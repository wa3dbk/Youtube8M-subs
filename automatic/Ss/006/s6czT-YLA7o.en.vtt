00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.040
 great guys with you i rik paw we 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.049
 keep looking interesting 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.050
 supplement for maykravt 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.730
 in this issue I will show you the shaders 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.150
 which I recommend these shaders immediately 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 I loved as soon as I installed it better 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.180
 perfect i haven't seen yet let's be 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.960
 look here actually it is and 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.189
 look 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.219
 sky she just can’t think better 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.030
 these clouds they are so realistic 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.820
 so everything is clearly done 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.750
 what is really amazing really 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.309
 beautiful shaders of course for this 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.100
 you need a solid computer yes even mine 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:53.329
 no hundred percent copes not on 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.570
 100 percent up all for real 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.399
 looks perfect for example water is better 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.109
 you can’t think up really better and not 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.589
 think up 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:07.200
 super really super water just well 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.390
 I don’t know much better 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
 shaders which are generally so much 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.439
 they stuck there 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.810
 that does not even know that there still dolep 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:19.460
 there is nothing superfluous there is all that 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.580
 need to thread bust to bust here everything 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.890
 smooth let's continue to look like 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.799
 so so so let's go over a little 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.549
 Let's see how this looks like this 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.549
 already 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.930
 very very ideal very very 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:43.500
 perfect so let's know turn on 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.780
 First morning, this is how it looks like. 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.460
 you can just watch and enjoy 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.610
 this beauty is beautiful so beautiful 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.680
 let's turn on for example the evening like this 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.530
 Okay here's the evening looks no better as the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.380
 I spoke and can not imagine 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.210
 so but you know it’s worth a look 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.850
 worth seeing until the end you only 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.230
 look even the sky but for example 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.650
 clouds they change too 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:23.350
 wait wait dark goes serious dark 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:32.290
 need to cook a torch so here is our moon 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:37.780
 the current rises so the moon is bright and bright 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:41.350
 with bright it is super such drops 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:47.250
 drops and now will be very well 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.459
 very dark just like some kind of horror 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.360
 kopanki 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:56.860
 they took the torches and drove them too 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.700
 function such light scattered can 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.480
 put well, very very beautiful light 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.239
 before 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:09.239
 yes he says say even you see what 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.239
 you are bright then you are just glowing 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.430
 super super super super 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.680
 so well it is of course not all here 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.920
 there is another plus sign 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:29.430
 namely, the rain looked like everyone 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:33.780
 begins such a fog fog darkens and 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.319
 this is happening as if I do not know the storm 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.819
 yes something like that something like that 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:45.250
 right here is not clear, as it were 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.819
 frosted glasses and bad through them 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.760
 see, too, such here but I 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.829
 like I do not know well, you guys only 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.590
 think how to do it all 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.129
 I can only imagine how it is 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.709
 many many work developer well 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.889
 really tried had to him 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:11.109
 not one month to sit it all 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:13.900
 fake how everything changes awesome 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:17.310
 awesome to be honest even the very plain and 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.310
 did not see how it all changes 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.150
 I wonder how they did this 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.410
 shaders and especially these clouds 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.590
 such variable clouds go away you what am I 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:36.820
 already so rose that big nowhere 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.210
 okay, get down to our ideal world 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.340
 the most beautiful after all is minecraft 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.450
 for minecraft, so much will come up 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.220
 that is simply amazing Well guys I 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.919
 I recommend you to try 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.010
 these shaders are all references 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.490
 of course in the description so guys up 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.490
 meeting
