00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello to all here we are so with the 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.179
 number 49 which will mainly treated 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.820
 assembly of the pre-assembly of the trains 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.809
 before so with different pieces that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.029
 are not provided that are well marked 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:23.369
 with the small spot for the side 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:27.090
 left so a succession of pieces I 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:34.230
 do not like good good parts 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.149
 with the traditional screw thing that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.920
 is going to be relatively interesting is to 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.850
 both a bit worrying for 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.070
 so we'll talk about it again. 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.280
 installation instructions do not ask first 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 instead of disassembling what had been mounted 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.620
 there is already some time to know the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.079
 wheel on the gimbal so we are that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.390
 poses of course none 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.600
 difficulty but that proves that when 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.970
 same as at the level of the mounting direction 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.790
 is still in things that have 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.970
 look at least approximate years and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.310
 we dismount we go up a room by six 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.630
 pieces by there good in the end we will arrive 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.340
 still something correct but 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.330
 the way to get there is a little 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.600
 particular so on mounting in 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.520
 himself two of his arms besides that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.590
 I think his arms are your 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.590
 relationships are well represented there too 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.740
 it actually picks up what's called on 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.090
 the on the ds and horned beasts are 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.799
 well, we have the system that will 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.200
 serve to raise the car that of agent 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.850
 remains quite dubious about it on 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.020
 editing in itself you see it at 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.700
 the screen is very simple which consists of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.070
 put 7 or lacemakers gap to 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.670
 flat therefore no risk of being wrong 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:14.350
 the small key that prevents the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.180
 profile and move that's getting it done 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.160
 done without any problems there a little 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.849
 precaution to take anyway in the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.590
 sense of a montage but the record as 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.269
 usually and she is well done so 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.760
 there is not you there is not too much to ask of 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.370
 questions well check the meaning of there 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.010
 as well 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:41.400
 speaking of wismes so I do not have 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:45.659
 had problem is always a moment 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.900
 of individuals has the faces of 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:53.720
 aldaya elements because the screws are 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:57.569
 always of a rather irregular quality 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.420
 in levis besides that the girls 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.159
 of age on the pieces on 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.450
 the occurrence as soon as there are coins 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.010
 metal you have to be very careful 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.030
 this is the case of his arms 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.849
 still be relatively careful 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.129
 so low for the train before that it's 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:23.810
 then precise there also on the arm 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:25.790
 inferior this little life that it takes 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.849
 to really go with infinitely 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.489
 precaution especially since I do not see 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.680
 not too useful service and meaning 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.439
 its accessibility afterwards but 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.459
 there again we will come back at least 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:43.010
 I will come back so we continue 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:47.989
 the assembly of the front axle with the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.920
 2nd 2nd horns if we can say another one 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.780
 times very very very faithful on that side 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.310
 they still cracked a 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.190
 system who who who takes enough 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.670
 faithfully the front train of one of a 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.780
 true goddess 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.620
 so that's still rather rather 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.379
 a positive point 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.819
 then mounting on the chassis then there 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.739
 on the other hand, the instructions ask us to 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.199
 insert it that way there I 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.680
 did not go it's almost impossible 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:20.419
 to do so here is again the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.360
 the only solution finally means in any case 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.300
 the one I advocate went from 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.870
 disassemble actually the paw that keeps 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.580
 the engine which actually allows for 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.130
 to clear the gear in fact it's 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.249
 especially the goal the goal is to 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.139
 power 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:46.659
 take out the gear and and so 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:49.659
 be well positioned the support of the 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:52.299
 gear wheel about this I got a little 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.189
 worry about my on my cat if I had 

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:57.789
 not pay attention when I have not 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.949
 but in fact these two these two 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.829
 ends where we screw the support 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.179
 was very bad and smudged and so 

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:05.829
 I had to come back and go 

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.409
 do not believe the most 

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:11.589
 accessible so with a little emery cloth 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:13.689
 hours on the handle of a good screwdriver 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:15.789
 I am I arrived and shot at 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.919
 to position the support well because 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:21.669
 otherwise it was not the barca that 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:24.669
 so screw from the bottom of the 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.409
 chassis and here too I have to start and 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.049
 I avoid it is completely the support 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.360
 before putting the gear and I 

00:05:29.049 --> 00:05:33.369
 you put it for information ben 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.489
 if we work here we live this support before 

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:39.879
 to put the gear wheel it does not pass 

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:42.699
 so in fact we have to take the 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:45.399
 support puts the gear wheel and fix it 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:48.219
 then because otherwise it's okay 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:50.679
 always therefore a hundred leagues from this 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:54.729
 that the assembly instructions recommend 

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:57.579
 do it again is nothing 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.979
 nasty but it's a little bit 

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:02.670
 amateur so once we took this 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.890
 precaution there and well two 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.740
 you nantais is well maintained this 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.230
 time and we replace the support of the 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.780
 engine and we will stop there because 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.840
 that in number 49 and by logic 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.400
 has actually done that editing 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.260
 stop there we are and where the train 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.560
 before but for the moment we do not ask 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.410
 it will be for next time 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.060
 so ben here is the most these basins 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.830
 before a train before representing well 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.690
 the less his sense of mounting the wreck 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.160
 book to review and too much play in the 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.960
 moving parts yes I will come back ashes 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.500
 in the miro 50 that similar to the number 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.320
 49 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.560
 there is a lot of play and it worries me to 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.560
 soon
