name of heroes of the storm now there

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.360 
name of heroes of the storm now there
was<00:03:15.840> no<00:03:16.019> clarification<00:03:16.349> as<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:16.889> what<00:03:17.190> this

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
was no clarification as to what this

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.430 
was no clarification as to what this
could<00:03:17.549> potentially<00:03:17.699> be<00:03:18.239> but<00:03:18.690> lots<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.379> people

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
could potentially be but lots of people

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.250 
could potentially be but lots of people
are<00:03:20.040> making<00:03:20.370> assumptions<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.359> guesses<00:03:21.810> one

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
are making assumptions and guesses one

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.569 
are making assumptions and guesses one
of<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.410> first<00:03:22.650> ones<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.099> maybe<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.489> an

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
of the first ones is maybe it's an

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.129 
of the first ones is maybe it's an
expansion<00:03:24.060> for<00:03:24.209> hearthstone<00:03:24.599> we've<00:03:24.930> got

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
expansion for hearthstone we've got

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.170 
expansion for hearthstone we've got
hearthstone<00:03:25.560> heroes<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.980> warcraft<00:03:26.430> maybe<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
hearthstone heroes of warcraft maybe the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.970 
hearthstone heroes of warcraft maybe the
next<00:03:27.299> one<00:03:27.540> will<00:03:27.720> be<00:03:27.750> hearthstone<00:03:28.319> heroes<00:03:28.349> of

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
next one will be hearthstone heroes of

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.520 
next one will be hearthstone heroes of
the<00:03:29.099> storm<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.480> feel<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.349> probably

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
the storm but I feel that it's probably

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.559 
the storm but I feel that it's probably
a<00:03:31.709> little<00:03:31.769> bit<00:03:31.949> too<00:03:32.099> early<00:03:32.129> for<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> hearthstone

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
a little bit too early for a hearthstone

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.420 
a little bit too early for a hearthstone
expansion<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.169> get<00:03:34.319> trademarked<00:03:34.859> so<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.400> next

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
expansion to get trademarked so the next

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.009 
expansion to get trademarked so the next
guess<00:03:35.819> is<00:03:35.849> maybe<00:03:36.269> it's<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.629> next<00:03:36.840> while

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
guess is maybe it's the next while

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.569 
guess is maybe it's the next while
expansion<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:37.919> could<00:03:38.069> very<00:03:38.099> well<00:03:38.340> be

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
expansion and that could very well be

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.220 
expansion and that could very well be
the<00:03:38.699> case<00:03:38.730> we've<00:03:39.209> got<00:03:39.389> blizzcon<00:03:39.810> coming<00:03:40.139> up

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
the case we've got blizzcon coming up

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.809 
the case we've got blizzcon coming up
this<00:03:40.349> fall<00:03:40.590> there's<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.280> good<00:03:41.400> chance<00:03:41.609> we

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
this fall there's a good chance we

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.300 
this fall there's a good chance we
should<00:03:42.000> expect<00:03:42.449> a<00:03:42.660> new<00:03:42.810> wow<00:03:42.989> expansion<00:03:43.310> coming

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
should expect a new wow expansion coming

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.369 
should expect a new wow expansion coming
up<00:03:44.519> within<00:03:44.669> the<00:03:44.879> next<00:03:45.030> year<00:03:45.180> or<00:03:45.389> so<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.079> maybe

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
up within the next year or so so maybe

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.960 
up within the next year or so so maybe
it<00:03:46.620> could<00:03:46.769> be<00:03:46.889> heroes<00:03:47.099> of<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.400> storm<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.879> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
it could be heroes of the storm and the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.879 
it could be heroes of the storm and the
last<00:03:48.510> one<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> one<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.319> I'm<00:03:49.530> sorry

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
last one and the one that I'm sorry

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.920 
last one and the one that I'm sorry
putting<00:03:50.190> my<00:03:50.280> money<00:03:50.459> on<00:03:50.639> is<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.480> heroes<00:03:51.810> of

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
putting my money on is that heroes of

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.379 
putting my money on is that heroes of
the<00:03:52.019> storm<00:03:52.079> is<00:03:52.590> potentially<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.280> new<00:03:53.879> name

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
the storm is potentially the new name

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.349 
the storm is potentially the new name
for<00:03:55.199> blizzard<00:03:55.650> all-stars<00:03:55.859> which<00:03:56.730> used<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.180> be

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
for blizzard all-stars which used to be

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.300 
for blizzard all-stars which used to be
blazer<00:03:57.810> dota<00:03:58.109> so<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.560> started<00:03:58.829> off<00:03:58.949> blizzard

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
blazer dota so it started off blizzard

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.729 
blazer dota so it started off blizzard
DOTA<00:03:59.489> there<00:04:00.090> was<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.329> dispute<00:04:00.810> with<00:04:01.049> valve<00:04:01.470> in

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
DOTA there was a dispute with valve in

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.110 
DOTA there was a dispute with valve in
which<00:04:01.889> they<00:04:02.099> changed<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.549> for<00:04:02.699> blizzard<00:04:03.000> DOTA

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
which they changed it for blizzard DOTA

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.000 
which they changed it for blizzard DOTA
to<00:04:03.359> blizzard<00:04:03.659> all-stars<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.440> maybe<00:04:04.799> they're

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
to blizzard all-stars and maybe they're

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.710 
to blizzard all-stars and maybe they're
just<00:04:05.099> not<00:04:05.280> happy<00:04:05.609> with<00:04:05.760> lizard<00:04:06.060> all-stars<00:04:06.480> and

just not happy with lizard all-stars and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.229 
just not happy with lizard all-stars and
they<00:04:06.840> want<00:04:07.049> to<00:04:07.109> call<00:04:07.349> it<00:04:07.379> heroes<00:04:07.889> of<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.159> storm

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239

its own standalone title that's

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.080 
its own standalone title that's
something<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.770> they're<00:04:28.370> hoping<00:04:28.760> is<00:04:28.910> going

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
something that they're hoping is going

to sort of take off in the mobile space

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.110 
to sort of take off in the mobile space
now<00:04:31.310> whether<00:04:31.520> or<00:04:31.610> not<00:04:31.700> that's<00:04:31.850> going<00:04:32.060> to

happen and again whether or not heroes
of<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.130> storm<00:04:34.190> is<00:04:34.580> actually<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.540> game<00:04:35.930> and

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
of the storm is actually that game and
