00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
to use them in the same way that we use

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.019 
to use them in the same way that we use
artifacts<00:01:51.049> or<00:01:51.289> mummies<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:52.700> piece<00:01:52.880> together

an idea of ancient Egypt or really any
other<00:01:57.560> lost<00:01:57.829> civilization<00:01:58.899> all<00:01:59.899> right<00:02:00.020> now

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
other lost civilization all right now

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.109 
other lost civilization all right now
this<00:02:01.249> scenario<00:02:02.179> is<00:02:02.450> me<00:02:02.659> even<00:02:03.109> more<00:02:03.289> likely<00:02:03.829> if

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
this scenario is me even more likely if

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.760 
this scenario is me even more likely if
something<00:02:05.119> catastrophic<00:02:05.479> were<00:02:06.139> to<00:02:06.380> happen<00:02:06.560> to

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
something catastrophic were to happen to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.600 
something catastrophic were to happen to
us<00:02:06.919> that<00:02:07.459> we<00:02:07.819> didn't<00:02:08.090> prepare<00:02:08.240> for<00:02:08.750> or<00:02:09.610> we

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
us that we didn't prepare for or we

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.430 
us that we didn't prepare for or we
didn't<00:02:10.970> see<00:02:11.630> coming<00:02:11.840> because

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
didn't see coming because

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.240 
didn't see coming because
we<00:02:12.530> were<00:02:12.620> too<00:02:12.830> distracted<00:02:14.020> okay<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
we were too distracted okay so the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.910 
we were too distracted okay so the
question<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.880> do<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:17.630> want<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.440> continue

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
question is do we want to continue

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.640 
question is do we want to continue
investing<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:19.850> things<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.450> really<00:02:21.320> won't

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
investing in things that really won't

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.480 
investing in things that really won't
help<00:02:21.950> us<00:02:22.160> out<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.760> long<00:02:22.970> run<00:02:23.000> and

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
help us out in the long run and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.790 
help us out in the long run and
basically<00:02:25.490> if<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.840> don't<00:02:27.050> learn<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.410> laugh<00:02:27.560> at

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
basically if we don't learn to laugh at

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.310 
basically if we don't learn to laugh at
