00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
to show you how to make a variation of

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.050 
to show you how to make a variation of
the<00:00:04.290> elite<00:00:04.529> bar<00:00:04.770> which<00:00:05.400> you'll<00:00:05.640> be<00:00:05.819> able<00:00:05.910> to

find a link to it in the description
down<00:00:07.560> below<00:00:07.620> I'm<00:00:08.460> not<00:00:08.610> sure<00:00:08.940> who<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.210> original

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
down below I'm not sure who the original

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.240 
down below I'm not sure who the original
creator<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.290> once<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.590> find<00:00:10.830> out<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.099> will

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
creator is so once I find out I will

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.299 
creator is so once I find out I will
give<00:00:12.000> them<00:00:12.179> credit<00:00:12.650> down<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.830> description

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
give them credit down in the description

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.090 
give them credit down in the description
so<00:00:15.269> again<00:00:15.870> like<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.080> said<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> variation

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
so again like I said this is a variation

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.920 
so again like I said this is a variation
of<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> first<00:00:18.240> two<00:00:18.449> steps<00:00:18.690> you're

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
of it so the first two steps you're

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750 
of it so the first two steps you're
going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.080> start<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> same<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:20.310> way<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.580> set

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
going to start the same the way we set

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.179 
going to start the same the way we set
the<00:00:20.880> chords<00:00:21.210> up<00:00:21.830> it<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.010> same<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:25.189> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the chords up it was the same and the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.460 
the chords up it was the same and the
next<00:00:26.430> step<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> same<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> what<00:00:28.380> we're

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
next step is the same so what we're

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
next step is the same so what we're
going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.859> take<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.820> bottom<00:00:30.029> right

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
going to do is take the bottom right

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.010 
going to do is take the bottom right
chord<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.199> bring<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.859> behind<00:00:32.309> first<00:00:33.020> then

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
chord and bring that behind first then

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.270 
chord and bring that behind first then
we're<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> take<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> bottom<00:00:34.980> left

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
we're going to take the bottom left

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.869 
we're going to take the bottom left
chord<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.880> bring<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.899> behind<00:00:37.260> second<00:00:37.879> just

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
chord and bring that behind second just

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.869 
chord and bring that behind second just
like<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.620> we'll<00:00:40.620> take<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> top<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.520> chord

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
like that we'll take the top right chord

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
like that we'll take the top right chord
and<00:00:42.090> we're<00:00:42.600> always<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> bring<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.500> under

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and we're always going to bring it under

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.869 
and we're always going to bring it under
and<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.879> over<00:00:45.590> between<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.309> guy<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.640> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and then over between this guy and that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.869 
and then over between this guy and that
guy<00:00:48.350> we<00:00:49.350> take<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> top<00:00:49.980> chord<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.640> we're

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
guy we take the top chord and we're

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.049 
guy we take the top chord and we're
going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> go<00:00:51.210> over<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.870> under<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.760> we're

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
going to go over it under and we're

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.270 
going to go over it under and we're
gonna<00:00:54.180> bring<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.480> across<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.949> right

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
gonna bring that across and go right

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.520 
gonna bring that across and go right
back<00:00:56.610> through<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:58.789> same<00:00:59.789> colored<00:01:00.180> loop<00:01:00.530> we

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
back through the same colored loop we

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.229 
back through the same colored loop we
want<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> make<00:01:01.890> sure<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.190> bring<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.489> above<00:01:02.789> this

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
want to make sure we bring it above this

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
want to make sure we bring it above this
bottom<00:01:03.690> chord<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.920> we'll<00:01:05.040> bring<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> right

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
bottom chord so we'll bring it right

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.830 
bottom chord so we'll bring it right
through<00:01:05.760> there<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.680> that's<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.070> step

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
through there and that's the first step

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.450 
through there and that's the first step
and<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> tight-knit<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.860> sure<00:01:11.159> there's<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and at a tight-knit I'm sure there's a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.750 
and at a tight-knit I'm sure there's a
few<00:01:11.610> different<00:01:12.030> ways<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
few different ways to do it I just do a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.719 
few different ways to do it I just do a
little<00:01:14.939> bit<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> time<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:17.070> tends<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> be

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
little bit at a time it tends to be

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
little bit at a time it tends to be
easier<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.240> place<00:01:18.479> your<00:01:18.720> finger<00:01:19.110> here<00:01:19.350> kind<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
easier to place your finger here kind of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
easier to place your finger here kind of
keep<00:01:20.040> everything<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.610> order<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.180> together

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
keep everything in order and together

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.149 
keep everything in order and together
and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> little<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:23.070> of

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and then just do a little bit of

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.600 
and then just do a little bit of
tightening<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:24.259> also<00:01:25.259> would<00:01:26.100> place<00:01:26.340> something

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
tightening I also would place something

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.160 
tightening I also would place something
in<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.420> still<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.869> bigger

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
in here when it's still a little bigger

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719 
in here when it's still a little bigger
because<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.070> starts<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> close

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
because you can see it starts to close

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.929 
because you can see it starts to close
up<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> tighten<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.750> gray<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> can

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
up as you tighten the gray so you can

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.219 
up as you tighten the gray so you can
always<00:01:33.090> place<00:01:33.360> something<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> keep<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
always place something there to keep it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.319 
always place something there to keep it
from<00:01:34.380> getting<00:01:34.530> too<00:01:34.680> tight<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
from getting too tight but that's the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.530 
from getting too tight but that's the
first<00:01:36.540> step<00:01:37.850> this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.060> where<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
first step this is where it's going to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.120 
first step this is where it's going to
vary<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> little<00:01:40.020> bit<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.610> next<00:01:42.329> pass<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
vary a little bit on this next pass and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.240 
vary a little bit on this next pass and
from<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.640> we're<00:01:45.119> gonna<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:46.250> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
from here on out we're gonna take the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.690 
from here on out we're gonna take the
top<00:01:47.520> courts<00:01:48.710> which<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.189> ones<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.549> you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
top courts which are the ones that you

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.550 
top courts which are the ones that you
know<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.600> cross<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.259> front

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560

and<00:01:52.770> these<00:01:53.280> chords<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.939> ones<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.299> are

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and these chords are the ones that are

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.440 
and these chords are the ones that are
going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> go<00:01:54.720> first<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:56.060> we're<00:01:57.060> also<00:01:57.210> going

to alternate which chord goes first so
the<00:01:59.939> last<00:02:00.119> time<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.780> brought<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:01.770> chord

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189

this guy bring it under and across

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.720 
this guy bring it under and across
between<00:02:25.700> these<00:02:26.180> two<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:27.620> over<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.430> under

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
between these two then over and under

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.260 
between these two then over and under
and<00:02:28.970> we're<00:02:29.900> gonna<00:02:29.990> push<00:02:30.350> him<00:02:30.590> across<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.820> go

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
and we're gonna push him across and go

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.820 
and we're gonna push him across and go
right<00:02:32.450> into<00:02:32.480> its<00:02:32.900> own<00:02:33.050> color<00:02:33.320> loop<00:02:33.590> like

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
right into its own color loop like

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.870 
right into its own color loop like
before<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:35.230> that<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:37.520> now<00:02:37.640> we<00:02:37.700> start

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
before and that is that so now we start

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.780 
before and that is that so now we start
to<00:02:38.840> tighten<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.920> again<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.310> just<00:02:40.460> do<00:02:40.760> a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
to tighten it and again I just do a

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.090 
to tighten it and again I just do a
little<00:02:41.060> bit<00:02:41.180> at<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.300> time<00:02:41.390> try<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> make<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.710> even

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
little bit at a time try to make it even

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.180 
little bit at a time try to make it even
so<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:43.780> let<00:02:44.780> me<00:02:44.840> keep<00:02:44.990> my<00:02:45.200> thumb<00:02:45.440> there<00:02:45.740> so<00:02:46.040> it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
so we let me keep my thumb there so it

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.060 
so we let me keep my thumb there so it
doesn't<00:02:46.550> start<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:46.970> curve<00:02:47.480> up<00:02:47.720> on<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.110> push<00:02:48.920> it

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
doesn't start to curve up on you push it

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.420 
doesn't start to curve up on you push it
up<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.310> little<00:02:49.490> and<00:02:50.170> there's<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.860> second<00:02:52.220> step

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
up a little and there's the second step

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.750 
up a little and there's the second step
and<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.950> third<00:02:55.160> one<00:02:55.400> we're<00:02:55.520> going<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.670> do

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
and the third one we're going to do

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.090 
and the third one we're going to do
exactly<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.330> same<00:02:56.600> take<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.230> top<00:02:57.440> chords<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
exactly the same take the top chords the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.820 
exactly the same take the top chords the
ones<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.430> just<00:02:58.580> crossed<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.330> front<00:03:00.080> and

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
ones that just crossed the front and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.470 
ones that just crossed the front and
we're<00:03:01.130> going<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.280> alternate<00:03:01.820> we're<00:03:02.270> going<00:03:02.390> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
we're going to alternate we're going to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.810 
we're going to alternate we're going to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.390 
across and go back into its own colored
loop<00:03:20.450> making<00:03:20.900> sure<00:03:21.080> we<00:03:21.230> go<00:03:21.380> above<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:22.160> core

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
loop making sure we go above the core

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.390 
loop making sure we go above the core
that's<00:03:22.580> hanging<00:03:22.790> out<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:24.350> we<00:03:24.890> tighten<00:03:25.250> that

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.570 
that's hanging out and we tighten that
and<00:03:25.930> that's<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.380> just<00:03:27.830> continue<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.310> until
