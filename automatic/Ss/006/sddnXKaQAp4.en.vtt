00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
cheat and lie yet but maybe if it's

later in the afternoon you had a chance
to<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.360> reality<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.230> are

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
to do so the reality is that we are

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.500 
to do so the reality is that we are
dishonest<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:37.040> much<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.070> our<00:00:38.370> days<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.329> do

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
dishonest for much of our days and we do

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.170 
dishonest for much of our days and we do
it<00:00:39.600> very<00:00:39.629> frequently<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:41.219> only<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
it very frequently not only that but the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.000 
it very frequently not only that but the
really<00:00:42.329> interesting<00:00:42.510> puzzle<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.770> while

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
really interesting puzzle is that while

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.330 
really interesting puzzle is that while
we<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.789> dishonest<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.809> dishonest<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> lot<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
we are dishonest and dishonest a lot we

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.220 
we are dishonest and dishonest a lot we
still<00:00:47.370> think<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.000> ourselves<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.570> very<00:00:48.780> honest

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
still think of ourselves as very honest

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.090 
still think of ourselves as very honest
people<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.250> that's<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.500> my<00:00:52.500> next<00:00:52.739> book<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
people and that's what my next book is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.639 
people and that's what my next book is
about<00:00:53.420> it's<00:00:54.420> called<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> honest<00:00:55.050> truth<00:00:55.230> about

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
about it's called the honest truth about

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.670 
about it's called the honest truth about
dishonesty<00:00:56.750> how<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> everyone

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
dishonesty how will I to everyone

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.430 
dishonesty how will I to everyone
especially<00:00:59.239> ourselves<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.260> I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
especially ourselves and in this I

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.709 
especially ourselves and in this I
basically<00:01:01.949> described<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.609> many<00:01:03.239> different

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
basically described the many different

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.630 
basically described the many different
things<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.409> many<00:01:04.710> different<00:01:05.040> aspect<00:01:05.549> that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
things that many different aspect that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.780 
things that many different aspect that
influence<00:01:06.270> our<00:01:06.420> honesty<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.170> our<00:01:07.790> dishonesty

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
influence our honesty and our dishonesty

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.179 
influence our honesty and our dishonesty
for<00:01:09.570> example<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.290> happened<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:10.860> take

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
for example what happened when we take

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.090 
for example what happened when we take
one<00:01:11.640> act<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.420> dishonest<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.770> happens

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
one act that is dishonest what happens

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.280 
one act that is dishonest what happens
to<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> perception<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.030> ourselves<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.840> what

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to a perception of ourselves and what

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710 
to a perception of ourselves and what
happens<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> tendency<00:01:17.400> later<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.509> be

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
happens to a tendency later on to be

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.830 
happens to a tendency later on to be
dishonest<00:01:19.580> what<00:01:20.580> happened<00:01:20.939> when<00:01:21.119> somebody's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
dishonest what happened when somebody's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.140 
dishonest what happened when somebody's
else<00:01:22.110> welfare<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.009> involved<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:23.850> happened

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
else welfare is involved what happened

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.749 
else welfare is involved what happened
if<00:01:24.450> we're<00:01:24.689> dishonest<00:01:25.229> somebody<00:01:25.920> else<00:01:26.130> could

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
if we're dishonest somebody else could

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.640 
if we're dishonest somebody else could
benefit<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.600> how<00:01:28.259> does<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> change

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
benefit from that how does that change

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.330 
benefit from that how does that change
our<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.540> calculus<00:01:30.540> about<00:01:31.140> how<00:01:31.380> dishonest<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
our a calculus about how dishonest and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.100 
our a calculus about how dishonest and
not<00:01:32.490> dishonest<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> how<00:01:33.900> does<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
not dishonest to be and how does it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.039 
not dishonest to be and how does it
change<00:01:34.439> our<00:01:34.710> ability<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> rationalize<00:01:35.640> our

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
change our ability to rationalize our

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.649 
change our ability to rationalize our
actions<00:01:37.250> anyway<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.509> fun

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
actions anyway and I think it's a fun

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.840 
actions anyway and I think it's a fun
book<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:41.130> very<00:01:41.340> different<00:01:41.520> from<00:01:41.700> my

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
book and it's very different from my

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.710 
book and it's very different from my
first<00:01:42.090> book<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:44.060> think<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.240> honesty<00:01:45.630> is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
first book and I think it's honesty is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.420 
first book and I think it's honesty is
actually<00:01:46.020> quite<00:01:46.140> important<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.310> it's

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
actually quite important I think it's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
actually quite important I think it's
important<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.030> us<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> realize<00:01:48.509> where<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.530> go

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
important for us to realize where we go

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.620 
important for us to realize where we go
wrong<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.399> kind<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.640> things<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.420> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
wrong the kind of things that we do and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
wrong the kind of things that we do and
I<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.350> important<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.860> realize<00:01:53.070> what

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
I think it's important to realize what

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.580 
I think it's important to realize what
are<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> cases<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> world<00:01:55.229> is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
are the cases in which the world is

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.280 
are the cases in which the world is
likely<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.430> something<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.869> honest<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
likely do something not so honest and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.170 
likely do something not so honest and
not<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.590> good<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:58.770> us<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> hope<00:02:00.000> you'll

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
not so good for us so I hope you'll

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.209 
not so good for us so I hope you'll
enjoy<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.840> hope<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.439> something<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:02.159> of
