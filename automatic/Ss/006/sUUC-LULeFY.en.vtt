00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
where you have to cut the wick and the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.320 
where you have to cut the wick and the
little<00:02:25.010> jam<00:02:25.340> thats<00:02:25.550> hanging<00:02:25.730> off<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.150> side

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
what about this one over here this is

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.590 
what about this one over here this is
this<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.370> little<00:03:28.640> bit<00:03:28.940> because<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.270> looks<00:03:29.450> like

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
this a little bit because it looks like

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.840 
this a little bit because it looks like
a<00:03:29.630> lipstick<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:30.470> like<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.950> spaceship<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:31.820> I

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
a lipstick is like a spaceship so I

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.070 
a lipstick is like a spaceship so I
think<00:03:32.270> this<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.540> probably<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.900> most

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
think this is probably the most

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.170 
think this is probably the most
high-tech<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:33.890> bunch<00:03:34.100> here<00:03:34.459> your<00:03:34.970> mom

but i think the the coolest part of this

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.880 
but i think the the coolest part of this
is<00:03:50.209> see<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.959> case<00:03:51.170> all<00:03:51.500> about<00:03:51.800> the
