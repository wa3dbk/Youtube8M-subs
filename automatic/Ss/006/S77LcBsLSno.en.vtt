have an electric actuator at the back
and<00:06:54.900> we<00:06:55.469> have<00:06:55.740> a<00:06:56.150> control<00:06:57.150> box<00:06:57.449> which<00:06:57.689> has<00:06:57.900> a

panel which keeps the battery charged
the<00:07:05.699> other<00:07:05.849> big<00:07:06.120> advantage<00:07:06.680> with<00:07:07.680> the<00:07:07.860> nesting

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:08.219 
the other big advantage with the nesting

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.550 
the other big advantage with the nesting
box<00:07:08.430> gates<00:07:08.580> is<00:07:09.149> if<00:07:09.629> you've<00:07:09.779> got<00:07:09.810> broody<00:07:10.229> birds

you don't have to come down and pull
them<00:07:12.270> out<00:07:12.479> out<00:07:13.020> at<00:07:13.259> night<00:07:13.469> the<00:07:14.250> nesting<00:07:14.669> box

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:14.849 
them out out at night the nesting box

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:18.559 
them out out at night the nesting box
gates<00:07:14.969> will<00:07:15.419> move<00:07:15.569> them<00:07:15.719> out<00:07:15.870> for<00:07:16.169> you<00:07:17.569> we've

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:18.569 
gates will move them out for you we've

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:20.329 
gates will move them out for you we've
got<00:07:18.689> timber<00:07:19.110> perches<00:07:19.649> it's<00:07:19.860> good<00:07:20.129> to<00:07:20.250> have

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:20.339 
got timber perches it's good to have

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.119 
got timber perches it's good to have
them<00:07:20.520> removable<00:07:21.149> so<00:07:21.389> we<00:07:21.539> can<00:07:21.770> take<00:07:22.770> them<00:07:22.949> out

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:23.129 
them removable so we can take them out

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:26.929 
them removable so we can take them out
for<00:07:23.399> cleaning<00:07:23.729> or<00:07:24.149> for<00:07:24.389> access<00:07:25.699> makes<00:07:26.699> it<00:07:26.879> a

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:26.939 
for cleaning or for access makes it a

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:28.429 
for cleaning or for access makes it a
bit<00:07:27.060> easier<00:07:27.089> to<00:07:27.449> move<00:07:27.689> around<00:07:27.810> the<00:07:28.080> chicken
