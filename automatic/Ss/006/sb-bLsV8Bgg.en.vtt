so I just got a small stick here so I'll

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:39.970 
so I just got a small stick here so I'll
set<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.630> down<00:03:23.840> take<00:03:24.840> another<00:03:25.080> stick

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.390 

goes<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.280> there<00:03:41.490> pretty<00:03:41.670> well<00:03:46.160> don't<00:03:47.160> want<00:03:47.340> to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
goes in there pretty well don't want to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.480 
goes in there pretty well don't want to
hit<00:03:47.520> concrete<00:03:47.760> oh<00:03:48.270> my<00:03:48.840> knife<00:03:49.020> but<00:03:49.920> got<00:03:50.340> half

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
hit concrete oh my knife but got half

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.520 
hit concrete oh my knife but got half
way<00:03:50.520> through<00:03:50.880> without<00:03:51.080> applying<00:03:52.080> very<00:03:52.350> much

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
way through without applying very much

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.990 
way through without applying very much
force<00:03:53.630> I'd<00:03:54.630> say<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.900> could<00:03:55.140> chop<00:03:55.350> through

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
force I'd say you could chop through

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.130 
force I'd say you could chop through
sticks<00:03:57.000> like<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.540> help<00:03:57.600> start<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> fire

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
sticks like this to help start a fire

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.950 
sticks like this to help start a fire
pretty<00:03:59.010> quickly<00:04:02.120> now<00:04:03.890> see<00:04:04.890> how<00:04:04.980> well<00:04:05.700> it

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
pretty quickly now see how well it

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:17.180 
pretty quickly now see how well it
whittles

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:57.770 

see<00:04:18.190> if<00:04:18.250> we<00:04:18.340> can<00:04:18.459> make<00:04:18.549> a<00:04:18.579> point<00:04:18.820> out<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.180> it

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.340 

that's<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.440> pretty<00:04:58.590> nice<00:04:58.740> point<00:05:00.170> works<00:05:01.170> really

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
that's a pretty nice point works really

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.450 
that's a pretty nice point works really
well<00:05:01.500> for<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:02.210> make<00:05:03.210> some<00:05:03.390> nice<00:05:03.510> Spears<00:05:05.780> and

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
well for that make some nice Spears and

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.010 
well for that make some nice Spears and
so<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.610> is<00:05:08.700> my<00:05:08.730> review<00:05:09.180> on<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:09.450> Ozark<00:05:09.870> Trail
