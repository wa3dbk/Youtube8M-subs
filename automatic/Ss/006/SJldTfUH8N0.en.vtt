00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
a handle on all those possibilities that

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.170 
a handle on all those possibilities that
lures<00:01:57.620> of<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:57.979> know<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.370> surface<00:01:58.610> all<00:01:59.060> the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
lures of it you know the surface all the

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.760 
lures of it you know the surface all the
way<00:01:59.299> down<00:01:59.570> but<00:01:59.720> this<00:01:59.810> being<00:02:00.049> a<00:02:00.170> surface<00:02:00.530> bait

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
way down but this being a surface bait

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.039 
way down but this being a surface bait
we<00:02:01.280> want<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.580> work<00:02:01.909> simply<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.780> well<00:02:03.020> I

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
we want it to work simply and well I

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.990 
we want it to work simply and well I
think<00:02:03.320> we're<00:02:03.440> very<00:02:03.680> very<00:02:03.770> close<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.490> having<00:02:04.670> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
think we're very very close to having a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.510 
think we're very very close to having a
bait<00:02:05.659> which<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.200> similar<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:07.159> what's<00:02:07.369> out

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
bait which is similar to what's out

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.119 
bait which is similar to what's out
there<00:02:07.820> but<00:02:08.479> works<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:09.019> bit<00:02:09.229> easier<00:02:09.560> exactly

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
there but works that bit easier exactly

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.910 
there but works that bit easier exactly
yeah<00:02:10.519> very<00:02:11.060> true<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.629> suppose<00:02:12.409> at<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.739> end<00:02:12.860> of

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
yeah very true I suppose at the end of

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.259 
yeah very true I suppose at the end of
the<00:02:13.040> day<00:02:13.159> what<00:02:13.340> you've<00:02:13.489> got<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.760> look<00:02:13.849> for<00:02:14.120> is

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
the day what you've got to look for is

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.759 
the day what you've got to look for is
you've<00:02:14.390> got<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.569> look<00:02:14.720> for<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.319> ease<00:02:15.560> of

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
you've got to look for that that ease of

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.850 
you've got to look for that that ease of
use<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.849> lot<00:02:17.269> of<00:02:17.299> these<00:02:17.510> styles<00:02:18.409> of<00:02:18.560> lures

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
use and a lot of these styles of lures

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.759 
use and a lot of these styles of lures
these<00:02:19.129> are<00:02:19.489> these<00:02:20.330> surface<00:02:20.840> walking<00:02:21.530> Bates

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
these are these surface walking Bates

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.470 
these are these surface walking Bates
they<00:02:22.159> have<00:02:22.310> an<00:02:22.400> attitude<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.030> water<00:02:23.269> which

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
they have an attitude in the water which

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.449 
they have an attitude in the water which
is<00:02:23.629> fairly<00:02:23.900> steep<00:02:24.319> something<00:02:24.709> about<00:02:25.130> that

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
is fairly steep something about that

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.540 
is fairly steep something about that
angle<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:27.470> works<00:02:27.770> really<00:02:27.920> good<00:02:28.310> at<00:02:28.520> it

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
angle and that works really good at it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.650 
angle and that works really good at it
allows<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.000> fish<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.270> ER<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.870> suck<00:02:30.080> them<00:02:30.290> off

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
allows the fish to ER to suck them off

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.260 
allows the fish to ER to suck them off
surface<00:02:31.020> very<00:02:31.410> easily<00:02:31.740> but<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.550> makes<00:02:33.060> them

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
surface very easily but it makes them

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.870 
surface very easily but it makes them
hard<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.870> work<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.740> what<00:02:35.010> we've<00:02:35.130> done<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.520> we've

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
hard to work so what we've done is we've

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.550 
hard to work so what we've done is we've
we've<00:02:36.360> lifted<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.080> little<00:02:37.230> bit<00:02:37.350> to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
we've lifted it up a little bit to

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.740 
we've lifted it up a little bit to
something<00:02:37.890> along<00:02:38.280> those<00:02:38.490> lines<00:02:38.700> that's<00:02:39.150> how

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
something along those lines that's how

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.330 
something along those lines that's how
it<00:02:39.810> should<00:02:39.960> sit<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> water<00:02:40.740> for<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it should sit in the water for you and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.580 
it should sit in the water for you and
what<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.880> allows<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.690> allows<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.170> lot

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
what that allows is it allows a lot

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.670 
what that allows is it allows a lot
greater<00:02:44.250> role<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.270> body<00:02:45.480> left<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.440> right

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
greater role of the body left and right

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.940 
greater role of the body left and right
and<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.220> allows<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.760> much<00:02:48.270> steeper<00:02:48.990> curve<00:02:49.620> in

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and it allows a much steeper curve in

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.680 
and it allows a much steeper curve in
for<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> left<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:50.670> right<00:02:50.700> sweep<00:02:51.210> of<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.540> lure

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
for the left and right sweep of the lure

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.560 
for the left and right sweep of the lure
and<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.740> you<00:02:52.860> can<00:02:53.010> do<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.670> as<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.390> said

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
and and you can do that just as you said

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.200 
and and you can do that just as you said
quite<00:02:55.020> simply<00:02:55.200> by<00:02:55.470> by<00:02:56.340> pulsing<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.880> rod<00:02:57.030> tip

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
quite simply by by pulsing the rod tip

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.330 
quite simply by by pulsing the rod tip
and<00:02:57.450> turning<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> handle<00:02:58.680> at<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.920> same<00:02:59.100> time

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
and turning the handle at the same time

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.700 
and turning the handle at the same time
you<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.880> have<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.120> slow<00:03:00.900> your<00:03:01.140> pulse<00:03:01.440> up

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
you do have to slow your pulse up

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.640 
you do have to slow your pulse up
sometimes<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.880> get<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.270> lure<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.020> walk<00:03:04.230> left

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
sometimes to get that lure to walk left

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.620 
sometimes to get that lure to walk left
and<00:03:04.920> right<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.490> left<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.850> right<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.240> once
