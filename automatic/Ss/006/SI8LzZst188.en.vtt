crane from the 2012 line of Technic of
course<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.340> two-in-one<00:00:12.150> build<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.960> it

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
course it is a two-in-one build and it

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.640 
course it is a two-in-one build and it
has<00:00:13.440> 218<00:00:14.370> pieces<00:00:14.969> then<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.049> back<00:00:16.260> here<00:00:16.560> it

shows<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> bulldozer<00:00:17.730> which<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
shows the bulldozer which is the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.230 
shows the bulldozer which is the
alternate<00:00:19.050> build<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.189> crane<00:00:20.609> probably

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
alternate build for the crane probably

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.490 
alternate build for the crane probably
will<00:00:21.330> not<00:00:21.510> build<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.960> I'll<00:00:22.140> probably<00:00:22.199> just

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
will not build this I'll probably just

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.519 
will not build this I'll probably just
review<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> crane<00:00:23.519> let<00:00:24.210> me<00:00:24.330> know<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.779> future

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
both of them I haven't built a Technic

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.350 
both of them I haven't built a Technic
set<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:32.009> while<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.820> let's<00:00:32.850> go<00:00:33.180> ahead<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
set in a while so let's go ahead and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.459 
set in a while so let's go ahead and
build<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.899> course<00:00:34.079> there's<00:00:34.320> no

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
build it of course there's no

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.490 
build it of course there's no
minifigures<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.899> but<00:00:36.899> we'll<00:00:37.170> take<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
minifigures in here but we'll take a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
minifigures in here but we'll take a
look<00:00:37.649> anyway

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.370 

okay<00:01:13.540> I<00:01:13.570> would<00:01:13.750> like<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.990> start<00:01:14.229> off<00:01:14.350> by

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
okay I would like to start off by

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.490 
okay I would like to start off by
showing<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.950> there<00:01:15.280> are<00:01:15.490> two<00:01:16.110> manuals<00:01:17.110> of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
showing that there are two manuals of

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.700 
showing that there are two manuals of
course<00:01:17.770> if<00:01:17.950> you<00:01:18.040> want<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.280> build<00:01:18.400> the<00:01:19.710> crane

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
course if you want to build the crane

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.560 
course if you want to build the crane
here<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.310> then<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.580> bulldozer<00:01:22.090> here<00:01:22.420> which

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
here and then the bulldozer here which

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.840 
here and then the bulldozer here which
is<00:01:22.720> nice<00:01:22.990> because<00:01:23.229> usually<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.890> have<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.070> find

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
is nice because usually you have to find

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.600 
is nice because usually you have to find
the<00:01:25.030> other<00:01:25.259> style<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.530> building<00:01:26.770> on<00:01:27.160> the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
the other style of building on the

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.580 
the other style of building on the
website<00:01:28.180> of<00:01:28.420> Lego<00:01:28.750> but<00:01:29.110> they<00:01:29.289> were<00:01:29.350> nice

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
website of Lego but they were nice

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.700 
website of Lego but they were nice
enough<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:30.070> include<00:01:30.399> the<00:01:31.390> instruction<00:01:32.289> manual

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
enough to include the instruction manual

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.950 
enough to include the instruction manual
in<00:01:32.800> here<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.700> course<00:01:33.940> I<00:01:34.180> have<00:01:34.450> not<00:01:34.600> built<00:01:34.840> a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
in here of course I have not built a

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.499 
in here of course I have not built a
Technic<00:01:35.380> set<00:01:35.649> in<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:36.100> while<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:37.090> maybe<00:01:37.300> they

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
Technic set in a while so maybe they

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.050 
Technic set in a while so maybe they
just<00:01:38.110> started<00:01:38.410> doing<00:01:38.710> this<00:01:38.830> all<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.100> time<00:01:39.399> let

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
just started doing this all the time let

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.150 
just started doing this all the time let
me<00:01:40.090> know<00:01:40.270> in<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.420> comments<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.950> all<00:01:42.009> you

Technic fans out there here's the model

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.570 
Technic fans out there here's the model
it's<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.130> really<00:01:45.580> nice<00:01:45.759> model<00:01:47.160> of<00:01:48.160> course<00:01:48.399> I'm

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
it's so really nice model of course I'm

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.150 
it's so really nice model of course I'm
not<00:01:48.789> that<00:01:49.149> big<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.539> fan<00:01:49.570> of<00:01:50.050> Technic<00:01:50.679> but<00:01:51.130> I

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
not that big of a fan of Technic but I

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.639 
not that big of a fan of Technic but I
do<00:01:51.310> like<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.090> amount<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.569> thought<00:01:52.929> that<00:01:53.440> has

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
do like the amount of thought that has

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.960 
do like the amount of thought that has
to<00:01:53.830> go<00:01:53.979> into<00:01:54.479> putting<00:01:55.479> these<00:01:55.599> sets<00:01:55.959> together

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
to go into putting these sets together

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.089 
to go into putting these sets together
you'd<00:01:57.970> have<00:01:58.149> to<00:01:58.300> be<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.450> genius<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.590> be<00:01:59.709> able<00:01:59.890> to

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:00.099 
you'd have to be a genius to be able to

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.559 
you'd have to be a genius to be able to
build<00:02:00.310> this<00:02:00.550> as<00:02:00.819> a<00:02:01.720> Lego<00:02:02.520> modeler<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:04.300> only

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
build this as a Lego modeler the only

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.990 
build this as a Lego modeler the only
problem<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:04.929> have<00:02:05.110> with<00:02:05.140> Technic<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:05.830> I<00:02:06.250> don't

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
problem I have with Technic is I don't

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.520 
problem I have with Technic is I don't
feel<00:02:07.149> like<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:07.630> much<00:02:07.869> of<00:02:08.110> an<00:02:08.200> accomplishment

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
feel like it's much of an accomplishment

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.580 
feel like it's much of an accomplishment
building<00:02:09.520> out<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.910> these<00:02:10.090> sets<00:02:10.780> because<00:02:11.020> it's

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
building out of these sets because it's

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.229 
building out of these sets because it's
real<00:02:11.770> easy<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.130> build<00:02:12.370> any<00:02:12.700> shape<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.030> you

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
real easy to build any shape that you

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.290 
real easy to build any shape that you
want<00:02:13.690> when<00:02:14.349> compared<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.739> Lego<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.730> features

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
want when compared to Lego the features

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.710 
want when compared to Lego the features
are<00:02:16.599> really<00:02:17.250> unique<00:02:18.330> compared<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.360> regular

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
are really unique compared to regular

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.809 
are really unique compared to regular
Legos<00:02:20.319> which<00:02:20.530> are<00:02:20.680> just<00:02:20.800> usually<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.400> bricks

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
Legos which are just usually the bricks

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.479 
Legos which are just usually the bricks
I<00:02:22.150> feel<00:02:22.720> like<00:02:23.020> there<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.620> much<00:02:23.830> more<00:02:24.099> of<00:02:24.340> a

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
I feel like there is much more of a

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.220 
I feel like there is much more of a
sense<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.970> accomplishment<00:02:25.300> when<00:02:25.930> building

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
sense of accomplishment when building

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.930 
sense of accomplishment when building
something<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.860> then<00:02:27.040> having<00:02:27.250> something<00:02:27.610> cool

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
something and then having something cool

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.540 
something and then having something cool
created<00:02:28.480> out<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.870> but<00:02:29.590> Technic<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.160> still

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
created out of that but Technic is still

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.570 
created out of that but Technic is still
pretty<00:02:30.819> cool<00:02:30.910> as<00:02:31.300> well<00:02:32.190> most<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.400> features

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
pretty cool as well most of the features

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.979 
pretty cool as well most of the features
are<00:02:33.970> all<00:02:34.209> gear<00:02:35.170> type<00:02:35.860> features<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.989> right

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
are all gear type features and right

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.260 
are all gear type features and right
here<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.379> see<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.770> first<00:02:39.010> feature<00:02:39.580> which<00:02:39.940> it

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
here you see the first feature which it

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.660 
here you see the first feature which it
is<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.840> crane<00:02:41.230> able<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.040> move<00:02:42.310> up<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.819> down

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
is the crane able to move up and down

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.270 
is the crane able to move up and down
and<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:46.660> course<00:02:46.959> this<00:02:47.170> piece<00:02:47.470> right<00:02:47.739> here<00:02:47.800> can

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
and of course this piece right here can

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.470 
and of course this piece right here can
also<00:02:48.629> extend<00:02:49.629> out<00:02:49.959> if<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.530> wish<00:02:50.890> for<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.670> longer

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
also extend out if you wish for a longer

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.130 
also extend out if you wish for a longer
crane<00:02:53.140> up<00:02:53.470> top<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.910> piece<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:55.660> extra

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
crane up top this piece is just extra

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.319 
crane up top this piece is just extra
piece<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.560> add<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:57.189> crane<00:02:57.489> feature<00:02:57.790> and

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
piece to add to the crane feature and

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.599 
piece to add to the crane feature and
then<00:02:58.629> another<00:02:58.989> knob<00:02:59.349> is<00:02:59.680> this<00:02:59.950> one<00:03:00.129> right<00:03:00.280> here

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
then another knob is this one right here

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:01.100 
then another knob is this one right here
which

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
which

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.610 
which
makes<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.470> swivel<00:03:02.690> completely<00:03:03.690> around<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
makes it swivel completely around so you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.110 
makes it swivel completely around so you
could<00:03:04.770> pretty<00:03:04.920> much<00:03:05.010> go<00:03:05.430> in<00:03:05.700> whatever

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
could pretty much go in whatever

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.780 
could pretty much go in whatever
direction<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:07.080> would<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.640> really<00:03:08.640> like

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
direction you would like really like

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.420 
direction you would like really like
these<00:03:08.940> tread<00:03:09.300> pieces<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.020> think<00:03:10.980> they<00:03:11.310> are

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
these tread pieces I think they are

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.280 
these tread pieces I think they are
really<00:03:11.940> nice<00:03:12.360> interesting<00:03:13.350> pieces<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:14.580> have

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
really nice interesting pieces to have

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.960 
really nice interesting pieces to have
of<00:03:16.290> course<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.710> rolls<00:03:17.010> pretty<00:03:17.340> decently

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
of course it rolls pretty decently

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.820 
of course it rolls pretty decently
probably<00:03:18.540> not<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.930> paper<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:19.380> maybe<00:03:19.590> on

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
probably not on the paper but maybe on

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.390 
probably not on the paper but maybe on
carpet<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.400> would<00:03:20.550> roll<00:03:20.790> very<00:03:21.450> excellent<00:03:22.400> have

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
carpet it would roll very excellent have

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.330 
carpet it would roll very excellent have
this<00:03:23.580> little<00:03:24.140> cabin<00:03:25.140> section<00:03:25.620> here<00:03:25.890> for<00:03:26.010> some

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
this little cabin section here for some

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.580 
this little cabin section here for some
detailing<00:03:26.900> nothing<00:03:27.900> can<00:03:28.020> really<00:03:28.290> fit<00:03:28.470> in

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
detailing nothing can really fit in

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.310 
detailing nothing can really fit in
there<00:03:28.770> it's<00:03:28.950> just<00:03:29.130> supposed<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.670> be<00:03:30.110> part<00:03:31.110> of

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
there it's just supposed to be part of

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.370 
there it's just supposed to be part of
the<00:03:31.530> model<00:03:31.920> itself<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:33.150> course<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.720> final

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
the model itself of course this final

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.440 
the model itself of course this final
gear<00:03:35.370> here<00:03:35.880> lowers<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.410> actual<00:03:38.100> string<00:03:38.700> to

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
gear here lowers the actual string to

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.340 
gear here lowers the actual string to
where<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.870> lower<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:42.110> lower<00:03:43.110> this

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
where you can lower it and lower this

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.340 
where you can lower it and lower this
hook<00:03:43.800> right<00:03:44.040> here<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.580> pick<00:03:45.060> up<00:03:45.270> whatever<00:03:46.050> you

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
hook right here and pick up whatever you

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.790 
hook right here and pick up whatever you
need<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.120> then<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.150> can<00:03:48.450> just<00:03:48.720> roll<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.620> back

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
need and then you can just roll it back

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.430 
need and then you can just roll it back
up<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:53.030> think<00:03:54.030> technic<00:03:54.480> sets<00:03:54.510> are<00:03:54.900> more<00:03:55.110> for<00:03:55.320> the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
up I think technic sets are more for the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.350 
up I think technic sets are more for the
model<00:03:55.800> builders<00:03:56.190> who<00:03:56.430> like<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.700> see<00:03:57.060> things

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
model builders who like to see things

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.660 
model builders who like to see things
come<00:03:57.720> together<00:03:57.900> out<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.530> really<00:03:59.280> interesting

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
come together out of really interesting

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.300 
come together out of really interesting
pieces<00:04:00.239> there's<00:04:01.170> not<00:04:01.410> too<00:04:01.590> much<00:04:01.739> playability

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
pieces there's not too much playability

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.860 
pieces there's not too much playability
with<00:04:02.670> this<00:04:02.880> as<00:04:03.590> far<00:04:04.590> as<00:04:04.620> when<00:04:05.600> conversing<00:04:06.600> with

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
with this as far as when conversing with

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.720 
with this as far as when conversing with
the<00:04:07.230> minifigure<00:04:07.590> world<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.250> can't<00:04:08.489> set<00:04:08.700> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
the minifigure world you can't set a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.930 
the minifigure world you can't set a
mini<00:04:08.940> figuring<00:04:09.420> in<00:04:09.600> here<00:04:10.200> anywhere<00:04:10.820> so<00:04:11.820> this

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
mini figuring in here anywhere so this

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.300 
mini figuring in here anywhere so this
is<00:04:12.150> more<00:04:12.420> for<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.750> older<00:04:13.110> crowd<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:14.040> course

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
is more for the older crowd of course

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.670 
is more for the older crowd of course
these<00:04:14.549> sets<00:04:14.850> are<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.299> little<00:04:15.750> bit<00:04:15.959> higher<00:04:16.320> in

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
these sets are a little bit higher in

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.670 
these sets are a little bit higher in
age<00:04:17.340> recommendation<00:04:18.150> it's<00:04:18.359> 8<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.750> 14<00:04:19.200> for<00:04:19.470> this

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
age recommendation it's 8 to 14 for this

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.640 
age recommendation it's 8 to 14 for this
simple<00:04:20.489> build<00:04:20.790> set<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.870> course<00:04:22.169> if<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.410> like

simple build set of course if you like
technic<00:04:23.190> sets<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.669> will<00:04:23.850> like<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.440> simple

Technic<00:04:29.520> sets<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:30.120> I'm<00:04:30.479> probably<00:04:30.900> going<00:04:31.229> to

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
Technic sets so I'm probably going to

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.190 
Technic sets so I'm probably going to
end<00:04:31.350> up<00:04:31.590> giving<00:04:31.830> this<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.370> build<00:04:32.760> it

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.320 

it<00:04:36.590> is<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.800> really<00:04:37.100> simple<00:04:37.250> build<00:04:37.640> but<00:04:37.760> it<00:04:38.150> is

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
it is a really simple build but it is

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.520 
it is a really simple build but it is
only<00:04:38.900> $20<00:04:39.830> for<00:04:40.040> this<00:04:40.130> set<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.760> has<00:04:41.530> 218

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
only $20 for this set and it has 218

only $20 for this set and it has 218
pieces<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.580> lot<00:04:43.850> of<00:04:43.940> which<00:04:44.090> are<00:04:44.210> probably<00:04:44.360> these

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
pieces a lot of which are probably these

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.440 
pieces a lot of which are probably these
smaller<00:04:45.080> peg<00:04:45.530> pieces<00:04:46.040> but<00:04:46.460> you<00:04:46.520> do<00:04:46.790> get<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.210> nice

below I don't really care for these
types<00:05:30.320> of<00:05:30.500> sets<00:05:31.000> they<00:05:32.000> are<00:05:32.210> very<00:05:32.450> challenging

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
types of sets they are very challenging

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.990 
types of sets they are very challenging
builds<00:05:34.270> in<00:05:35.270> comparison<00:05:36.080> to<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.610> regular<00:05:37.610> LEGO

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
builds in comparison to the regular LEGO

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.080 
builds in comparison to the regular LEGO
brick<00:05:39.070> so<00:05:40.070> if<00:05:40.190> you<00:05:40.280> think<00:05:40.430> I<00:05:40.580> should<00:05:40.610> review
