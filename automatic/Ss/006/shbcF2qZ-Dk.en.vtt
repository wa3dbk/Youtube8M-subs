00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
them used to coming out of the mountains

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.720 
them used to coming out of the mountains
which<00:00:31.109> they'll<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> regular<00:00:32.520> race

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
which they'll do on the regular race

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.540 
which they'll do on the regular race
course<00:00:33.120> he'll<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.079> mountains<00:00:34.530> six<00:00:35.430> to

course he'll be on the mountains six to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.119 
course he'll be on the mountains six to
eight<00:00:35.640> thousand<00:00:36.180> feet<00:00:36.390> high<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.890> then

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
eight thousand feet high and then

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.549 
eight thousand feet high and then
they'll<00:00:38.370> come<00:00:38.610> down<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.149> last<00:00:39.360> 60<00:00:39.840> miles<00:00:40.170> into

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
they'll come down the last 60 miles into

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.150 
they'll come down the last 60 miles into
the<00:00:40.829> valley<00:00:41.480> which<00:00:42.480> drops<00:00:42.870> down<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> about<00:00:43.559> 200

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the valley which drops down to about 200

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.049 
the valley which drops down to about 200
foot<00:00:44.370> once<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.210> home<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.430> think<00:00:47.730> it's

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
foot once they get home so I think it's

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.860 
foot once they get home so I think it's
kind<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.390> good<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.840> them<00:00:48.989> used<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
kind of good to get them used to the

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.189 
kind of good to get them used to the
elevation<00:00:51.870> change<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:53.129> them<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.460> here

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
elevation change so I take them up here

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.830 
elevation change so I take them up here
and<00:00:55.219> a<00:00:56.219> few<00:00:56.430> other<00:00:56.579> spots<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.629> higher

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and a few other spots up a little higher

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.810
