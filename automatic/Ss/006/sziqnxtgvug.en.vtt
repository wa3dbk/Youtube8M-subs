00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
they're just ah Kurt Vonnegut juniors we

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.630 
they're just ah Kurt Vonnegut juniors we
never<00:02:45.560> say<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:45.950> though<00:02:46.130> it's<00:02:46.310> just<00:02:46.459> Kurt

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
Vonnegut because we don't know to his

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.080

dad<00:02:48.230> breakfast<00:02:48.920> of<00:02:49.010> champions<00:02:49.070> which<00:02:49.880> is<00:02:50.060> a

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
dad breakfast of champions which is a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.330 
dad breakfast of champions which is a
novel<00:02:50.570> but<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:50.959> it's<00:02:51.500> it's<00:02:51.830> one<00:02:52.070> of<00:02:52.190> his

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
novel but it's it's it's one of his

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.600 
novel but it's it's it's one of his
probably<00:02:52.790> most<00:02:53.060> experimental<00:02:53.660> novels<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:55.070> it

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
probably most experimental novels so it

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.110 
probably most experimental novels so it
takes<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.810> look<00:02:57.410> at<00:02:57.590> his<00:02:57.770> past<00:02:58.040> characters<00:02:58.730> and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
takes a look at his past characters and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.320 
takes a look at his past characters and
gives<00:02:59.870> them<00:02:59.990> sort<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.680> endings<00:03:01.490> different

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
gives them sort of endings different

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.260 
gives them sort of endings different
endings<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.350> kind<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.400> mixes<00:03:04.760> them<00:03:04.850> up<00:03:04.970> all<00:03:05.150> in

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
endings and kind of mixes them up all in

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.720 
endings and kind of mixes them up all in
the<00:03:05.330> same<00:03:05.540> book<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.800> think<00:03:07.040> we're<00:03:07.160> loosely

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
calling it a novel that's what we'll do

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.670 
calling it a novel that's what we'll do
