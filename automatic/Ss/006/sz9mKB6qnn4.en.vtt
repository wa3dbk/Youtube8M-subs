00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:02.500
 this situation 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.500
 it requires a smooth ride 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 and care 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.470
 of that way of driving after ensuring that you arrive safely at the goal 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.650
 and so 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.570
 You can think about submitting your application for the next tests of 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.990
 trophy classification change 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.210
 after having followed this series of classes 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.840
 you are well equipped for it at least 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840
 in terms of gameplay as a pilot 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.590
 that area 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.360
 already 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.470
 yes it is true 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.079
 the tenth james trophy 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.940
 they are not celebrated in europe 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 The jungles of Brazil return to their place of origin 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.500
 but snow and ice are very suitable to try the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.000
 necessary characteristics 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 for man and conservation 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.720
 dwell 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.250
 resistance 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.060
 and ability to improvise 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.810
 A charge can also offer more benefits than other vehicles in 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.700
 iron and 10 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 but not even a range rover caves defeated 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.570
 the physical laws also apply in a vehicle with four-wheel drive 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.580
 wheels on ice and snow 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.010
 you can not bend faster than with a normal car 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.910
 the vehicle went out 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 and if it goes at full speed on my neighbor 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 the four wheels of rafÃ¡h 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.029
 when braking 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.029
 the blocked wheels will skid on the ice and cuate 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.199
 you see 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.329
 The attraction 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.779
 on all four wheels 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.779
 It does not help if you are going to expropriate 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.409
 on snow 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.409
 we must learn from the consultant farmer 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.279
 let it walk and it hit the hands and feet to get it 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:36.279
 fails wherever you want 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.839
 when going uphill for example 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:43.879
 despite the lowest possible speed in the longest possible gear 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:49.119
 and do not go too fast but at a speed that allows you to give the curves 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.499
 without skating 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:54.549
 Whatever you do, do not leave the curve accelerating too much 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.840
 it's easy to make the monkfish wheel and that's quite a problem 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.629
 when going downhill do not touch the brake 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.760
 but if you can not help it and start skating release the brake immediately 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.450
 and try to control the vehicle by driving the steering wheel carefully 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.450
 and pondering a brake 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.609
 in these conditions the safest way to go downhill with a 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.979
 four-wheel drive vehicle 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.799
 is to do it in the shortest possible gear that allows you to regulate 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.670
 speed 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.690
 with the accelerator without touching the brake 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.579
 downhill the faults are taken and which one costs you up 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.609
 all-terrain vehicles are especially prone to skate 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.609
 I saw how high its center of gravity 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:03.149
 let's imagine that one of the next cameron trophies takes place in the Alps 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.039
 the rocky mountains or the himalayas 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.139
 there will be many driving difficulties and harsh conditions 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.599
 environmental 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.099
 Intense cold in heat sc heat 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.519
 snowstorms instead of monsoon rains 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.579
 but despite these difficulties 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.939
 there will also be moments of great satisfaction and happiness 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.819
 wonderful landscapes 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.819
 and unforgettable encounters 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.030
 and maybe there's a special test that requires crossing a flat stretch of 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.030
 snow where a vehicle with four-wheel drive 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.330
 will have fewer problems than a normal car 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.860
 but where it is fundamental to calculate correctly 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.830
 the depth of the mine 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.840
 choose the correct route 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.840
 the leader at the right speed 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.330
 where only the best driver of the SUV 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.330
 he will be successful 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.900
 and no doubt there will also be situations comparable to those we already know 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.089
 originated by the water the swamps and the jungle 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.740
 situations that make the vehicle stuck 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.470
 the film crew applied the basic principle of the spirit underlying the 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.550
 camil trophy 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.650
 and solved the problem how to do it 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.650
 with a team work 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.569
 do not 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.380
 maybe this program built for wishes to participate in the trophy 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.159
 carranza 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.139
 if so 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.139
 because he does not submit this request 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.199
 log 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.009
 Never
