00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.639
 This is one of the most complete that will not agree to have more frequency and 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:09.360
 is that in one to have completed what is the central paddler ponce the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.449
 apply two 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.730
 per cent algorithms that explain to be able to three goalkeepers 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.890
 in countess a case in which you have well placed and oriented two of them and there 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.930
 two of them the other two that are not and are not well placed 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.820
 and what is this first here and being here I will have to come here then 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.589
 we apply the following algorithm 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.059
 we apply in small 2% 1 2 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.660
 up the top twice the right leg twice small twice 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.390
 the whole part 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.569
 blocks the two 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:48.370
 the part above twice 1 and 2 the right part 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.370
 twice the small 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.280
 the part 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.859
 from above the small 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.220
 twice for both 1 and 2 1 and 2 is worth 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.420
 to fund cube 90 degrees so well 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.340
 to do the right part official top part sense arias fatecha 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.360
 counterclockwise top part counterclockwise 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.030
 part right sense amount me front part clockwise 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.610
 right part about twice 2 noises 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.690
 upper part counterclockwise 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.690
 afp 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.580
 part of that meaning the newspaper 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.510
 top part counterclockwise right part clockwise 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.430
 top part clockwise 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.950
 part of this anti-clockwise and front side 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.890
 it's a long algorithm 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.150
 but in this way 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.160
 you already get to a situation where you stop two now you have three 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.190
 and with the one of the pp and do not bring out which rubies cube ruby â€‹â€‹of three by 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.619
 three 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.090
 to improve your times 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.210
 to be able to move this click here is here and is here 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.369
 the tamayazo dismissal pig that exceed the hiv again you do not know where 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.159
 look for it 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.860
 that movement we want to move is here is here and this is going to move and 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.349
 here 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.809
 how it is done 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:12.380
 that movement to move it 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.110
 you own 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.430
 part ted right twice 1 2 back part 1 gone part of that sense 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.229
 schedule front end clockwise 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:27.209
 part of those daily entity for back 1 gone 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.719
 part of that clockwise sense front part sense the day before yesterday 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.639
 and later 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.489
 you recover the sea and I, apart 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.840
 perfect we apply it once again this same villa algorithm we complete 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.830
 our rubik's cube all 1 2 maple rejected needed 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.650
 A) Yes 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.250
 1 2 right part so you need 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.330
 and we recover yellow 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.080
 I want to tell you to try ubic 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.020
 I think that this spice may seem like a lot but percent is the 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.980
 more common then there are some very well particular 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.259
 kelly going up I'll be hanging from a thousand web page 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.039
 and lina 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.839
 this is one of the functions that Terkes does as Laborism very long but if 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.910
 it does not bother me this could solve the cube 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.140
 rubik easily
