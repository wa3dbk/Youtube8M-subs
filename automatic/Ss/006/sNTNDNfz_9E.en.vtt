00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.380
 when you are driving a 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.240
 lamborghini immediately think of the times that 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.460
 can do and at the speed it can 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.710
 reach on the dry lap but that 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.050
 happens if you are strong on the track for six 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.180
 almost uninterrupted hours can 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.550
 you seem like nothing but you are hours but not 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.280
 i really believe me especially if i 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.860
 you run on a track like this with 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.910
 a car that is as sporty as it is 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.220
 ultra-sporty and in any case it was 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.309
 designed to run normally on 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.470
 road will be an unmissable opportunity for 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.860
 to know the laura right down to the smallest details 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.230
 cannes 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.120
 here if you except the engine that is 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.520
 an evolution of the previous 10 cylinders 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.980
 everything is new, starting with the frame 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.350
 made with a new structure in 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.540
 carbon and aluminum to the suspensions a 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.190
 electronic control and at the exchange that 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.270
 for the first time on a lamborghini 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.270
 it is double clutch 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 and then there are the aerodynamic brakes 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.960
 without forgetting internal ergonomics 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.429
 when traveling at high speed 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.329
 in fact everything must be in place 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.310
 quite right 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.170
 no time to look for commands either 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.569
 to interpret the data provided by 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.490
 instrumentation we will start at six o'clock 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.530
 afternoon in full light then there will be the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.689
 twilight and visibility will change 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.429
 radically until complete darkness 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.319
 because at a certain time even the moon there 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.360
 we will abandon then we will trust 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:44.369
 only for the new full led headlights e 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.590
 the driving experience is not 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.700
 we have no records to beat but alone 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.729
 a car to discover 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.220
 much later we will know you later 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.970
 say if this huracan we will have loved her 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.970
 or not 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.390
 before we start the test we have 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.750
 obviously all the checks were carried out 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.390
 appropriate from tires and brakes from 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.880
 liquids to lubricants and then we have it 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.560
 equipped with the v box the method 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.720
 used in all tests of 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.700
 quattroruote to monitor the times on the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.850
 car ride and course in each 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.850
 moment 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.890
 will be six among testers and 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.500
 journalists the pilots who will take turns 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.090
 by the hour at the wheel of the huracan 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.620
 at the time of change 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.660
 we will carry out supplies 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:43.720
 we will check the tires and 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:45.370
 eventually replace you and now it is 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.100
 The time has come to take a ride 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.610
 complete with the track 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.610
 prepared for this test 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.290
 from the pressure of more at the beginning is 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.489
 just the bike the cities the ability to 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.489
 discharge all horses to the ground 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.150
 four-wheel drive to its benefits 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.030
 effects we can I can 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.310
 re-verify here I'm in third gear 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:19.040
 I go out on the straight and all down 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.040
 but everyone turns a lot of aiming laps 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.240
 and it introduced me to the finish line brakes 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.040
 could quality and interest me in 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.600
 this cure which is really very fast 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.370
 and demanding because it closes must 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.080
 down gear and brake the third e 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.760
 also here I can give houses in I am 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.739
 compact car problems but e 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.810
 accelerates vigorously second to 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.470
 this hairpin is still down everything 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.470
 right away 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.969
 look again in the third for the city 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:04:00.650
 here you jump slightly on the curbs and 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:02.180
 to be fast corners here too 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.219
 rests on security from this 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.439
 car is really remarkable I can 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.719
 stretch also in fifth on this 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:12.709
 I keep the fifth for this 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:16.070
 proposes fourth for this and that is more 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.220
 narrow but the car follows me 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.220
 faithfully 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.810
 again slight acceleration and on 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.150
 braking in corners but our car 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.150
 breaks down and into the second street 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.840
 here I got a long thread but it is 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.610
 It was enough to brake a little more 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.740
 to make it trajectory la 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:47.150
 very sincere machine that forgives everything 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.150
 so overall easy to drive 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:57.270
 a car that gives a lot of security I have to 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:01.770
 say not a few turns to feel it 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.260
 very well the same maybe it is not 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.940
 as fast as other sports 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.380
 this caliber but it is really a lot 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.419
 progressive that sincere and transmits 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.370
 very well what is happening 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.599
 to the front wheels if you do well 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.599
 when passing the limit 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.150
 I must say that even the change that is one 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.400
 absolute novelty on this lamborghini a 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.230
 double clutch is really very much 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.360
 punctual very fast when you go up but 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.470
 also very careful to implement the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.470
 climb at the right time 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.930
 I must say that apart from the pleasure of 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.700
 drive to vairano at this evening time 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.140
 that really very exciting la 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.180
 machine impressed me 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.670
 favorably because essentially 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.590
 very easy to drive 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.970
 may seem paradoxical for a car 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.800
 so powerful but it's a compliment 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.140
 that makes the designers of this 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.050
 car is an easy car because it is 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.940
 very sincere immediately the idea of ​​how much 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.000
 grip ie on the wheels both in front and 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.740
 behind the rear end it moves a little 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.480
 when it releases when it moves 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.670
 load on the front end but it is a movement 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.350
 just what you need to give more 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.240
 cornering entries without ever being 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.870
 apprehensive and then the rest is one 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.150
 show 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.250
 still missing a few hours after the 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.249
 try but some data has already been a 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.319
 story 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:32.329
 after the first rounds of adjustment 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:34.219
 we have seen that the average of the times on the 

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:36.139
 around is around a minute e 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:41.349
 forty and that the maximum speed 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.349
 reached over 240 km now 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.110
 we are now in the last minutes of this 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.020
 very interesting heads and the now cannes 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.730
 you are comparing really well 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:07:00.330
 complete test you will find it on the next 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:07:02.550
 number of four the 12c lives in 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:07.080
 a new, more advanced and powerful form 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:10.350
 sports name changes and becomes 650 s yes 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.020
 called porsche 918 spyder la porsche 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.300
 road more powerful and faster but also 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:19.310
 undoubtedly the most complicated and ed 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.310
 evolved that has ever been built
