00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.619 

so<00:05:32.520> it's<00:05:33.560> not<00:05:34.560> a<00:05:34.590> style<00:05:35.009> well<00:05:35.879> that<00:05:36.270> it<00:05:36.389> really

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:36.629 
so it's not a style well that it really

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:42.689
