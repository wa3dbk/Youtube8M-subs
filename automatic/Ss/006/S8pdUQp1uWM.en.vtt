00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.410
 Hello everyone and today we have a new video 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.150
 and we will learn how to weave bead 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.410
 crocodile can just do it 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.109
 even a child and so let's get started 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.990
 for crocodile we need you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.779
 these are two colors of beads 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.279
 I take here such and also more 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.410
 will need two beads but for the peephole 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.630
 then we will need scissors and any 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.930
 weave on a fishing line so we will need 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.840
 fishing line then you will need to draw 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.690
 The scheme I have here is such a scheme I 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.219
 drew again, I leave this scheme 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.000
 for you in contact there is some 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.500
 need someone can draw himself 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.600
 Here is such a scheme of mine 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.390
 red is the eyes indicated so 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.670
 let's proceed 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.280
 put a scheme in front of you 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 it was clear I didnâ€™t cut off very much 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.430
 big piece of fishing line 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.909
 but where there probably can not half a meter 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.010
 maybe 60 centimeters so we start by 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.450
 the scheme we have is the first two green and their 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.619
 just put on everything and went down on 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.409
 our line next we go two yellow 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.650
 again we take one gold dress 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.700
 second and now we do our fishing line 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.570
 crosswise 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:35.600
 in these yellow beads we pass it and 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:39.659
 I tighten it turns out here and so 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:48.780
 Further further according to the scheme we get 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:52.380
 we take three beads green put on 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.560
 again the line we make a criss-cross these three 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.509
 beads second end spend 5 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.689
 tighten we get here and so 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.920
 in this way we weave up 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.920
 our paws 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.860
 I have already woven my own tail 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.380
 crocodile now i need to do 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.150
 paws for this we take only one 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:28.040
 part of our fishing line from one edge and 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:30.980
 put three beads on her after 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.010
 how to put 3 well , somehow we clamp 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.800
 finger howls them well, that is, we lower a little 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.800
 just down and put on three more beads 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.500
 now we need to hold the tip of the line 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.610
 here in these three beads that we 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.610
 put on first 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.390
 if you are not comfortable to weave just on 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.770
 fishing line principle you can take here 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:12.770
 besides fishing line still use needle and 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:16.790
 bring it to the end and so you see with us 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.750
 It turns out that such a foot or not 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.210
 I know where you can see here we get 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.230
 Here is such a foot there is the other side 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.880
 we should do the same if you 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.060
 you did everything right you should 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.150
 get here and so here are here are two 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.920
 paws further we after these paws here so 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.960
 look at our scheme and continue 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.170
 just bring it all the same way 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.030
 as we spun a tail to the next paws 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.430
 next foot do just like 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.660
 back and according to this scheme we just dock 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:55.120
 until the end I got this 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.340
 here crocodile were it well so 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.310
 I want to say for my scheme 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.340
 see here I forgot to note that 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.470
 need where 6 beads need 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.260
 weave three times and the body began 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.150
 short in general my diagram is just for you 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.850
 for example you can draw your 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.710
 lengthen the body for example or shorten 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.250
 head and whatever you do with it 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:23.180
 crocodile and so here we are 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.280
