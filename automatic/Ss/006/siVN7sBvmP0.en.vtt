 manufactured where it began to be distributed 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.230
 nintendo wii has suffered a small 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.849
 accident is that it has burned down by 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.649
 the rumors have lost a million 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.920

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.860
 asia as they get less wiiu this was a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.440
 rumor but recently it has been denied 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 They have been lost such number 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.370
 Nintendo consoles has said that they have not 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 lost a million consoles have been 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.800
 saved the fire I think it has been 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.780
 true but 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.309
 that number of consoles has not been lost 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.170
 I say it because many of you 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.750
 surely you have seen this news 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.700
 you have already said low that shit not that 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.119
 get wiiu do not worry guys 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.100
 Nintendo fulfills what it says and on the day 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.659
 of output we will have each one especially 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.670
 if you have it reserved for life and departure 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.090
 we will have our nintendo wii without 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.540
 no problem has already left the box 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.530
 official art box of the nintendo wii pack 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.790
 with zombie here you have it guys is 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.399
 pretty handsome, I liked it 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.800
 much the box already I thought that they were not going to 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.830
 give the box of the nintendo wii or 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.960
 deluxe with the game stuck with a floor 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.369
 with adhesive there in the box or did not give in 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.130
 the game apart and the script for 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.369
 controls apart but not there we have the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.100
 box there you can not can not see 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.810
 but surely the box is bigger 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.570
 a normal home because it brings down to 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.640
 controls bring zombies worth when 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.890
 have the box and a boxing goal I'm going to 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.170
 put it on top of a scale before 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.849
 open it to see how much the box weighs 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.020
 because it has to happen a bit and with 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.570
 so many things that it brings 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.789
 down in the image you can see the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.920
 accessories that it brings to control and 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.840
 others but it is not specified that it comes 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.569
 with nintendo network premium in this 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.560
 image that is from germany as you can 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.090
 see what is in German 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.340
 do not worry guys because it's 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.140
 console has been confirmed since it brings 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.450
 nintendo nar world premium would not have 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.060
 sense that a console console more 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.250
 face of existing packs do not bring 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.700
 internet network premium and the one that comes 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.319
 before 350 euros if you bring nintendo in 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.269
 the bot turned on without you do not worry 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.160
 that nintendo in premium waters comes with 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.739
 the pack of zombies here I leave the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.450
 image is really cool I have 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.630
 very much want to go to the store and I 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.160
 I'm doing my imagination you're 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.950
 flying from when I go to the store 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.989
 and look at that box in particular I have 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.519
 a lot of you want guys have already left 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.230
 that we are talking about zombies 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.769
 after not two trailers among them one 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.959
 of zombie nothing do not teach us much more 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.310
 of what has already been seen but it 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.800
 thanks that they are unique 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:10.720
 new trailer new small advances 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.840
 worth anything typical pointing to the wii 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.790
 with the gamepad and the peephole in the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.520
 gamepad and they have not shown much 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.560
 more than you already knew you already know that 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.600
 up here you can click to be able 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.570
 enter the trailer another have very 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.140
 funny guys he is the new test of 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.600
 tekken tag tournament 2 for nintendo 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.300
 very young as many of you already know what 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.600
 I have never commented but this game 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.600
 will bring a special mode it is worth the 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.420
 tekken ball is the game mode that makes 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.810
 so much that we see where giving a 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.190
 hit blows to a ball we can 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.070
 harm our adversary and others 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.920
 very cool but the coolest thing about this 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.590
 game is that we have special suits 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.150
 it's worth for nintendo wii u that are costumes 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.940
 like mario and luigi pizzi touch 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.630
 cell 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.380
 very many captain firefox 0 suite samus 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.570
 it's like a pore smash but real is 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.610
 very much guys watch TV because it is 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.489
 super fun I already know of several 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.250
 people who say they are going to sell their 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.940
 tekken tag tournament of playstation 3 or 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.460
 xbox and they are going to have it in wii 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.830
 because it 's very good and one last trailers 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.030
 that has left guys is the trailer for 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.100
 monster hunter 3 ultimate one pass 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.560
 behind the guys they already teach us how 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.770
 the data is passed between a 3ds and a 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.170
 wii or saved games and so on 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.730
 teaches us a little bit more videos of 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.040
 online mode as you see the players 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.290
 cooperating with each other and very cool 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.470
 very much and pp for this game I am 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.650
 hypeado to the maximum I have a lot of desire 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.030
 I remind you that this game does not 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.460
 will take advantage, so to speak 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.620
 the graphics to nintendo wii top 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.100
 because it 's like it's the version of 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.380
 3ds nintendo wii with hd with textures a 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.449
 little bit improved if you notice 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.999
 in when 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.430
 and the shadows are exactly the same 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:15.080
 it's worth the shadows you're walking with the 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.779
 character and the shadow is the same as the 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.009
 character is super cool to look at 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.169
 those little details because after 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.479
 worth especially when you go 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.819
 trailers guys one thing that I advise is 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.559
 that you put them in 1080p or in the largest 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.259
 layout that you can see the trailer 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:32.270
 to make you a little idea about everything 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.919
 in full screen to make a 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.379
 small idea of ​​how to play and aysén 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.180
 a television more or less the new 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.659
 nintendo wii campaign 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.849
 advertising will soon be in our 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.499
 televisions guys of the week that 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.990
 the next one comes in america and in 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.930
 england will start issuing new 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.389
 ads about nintendo wii so 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.310
 be in 2020 where you give it because it is 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.550
 possible that also in that period of 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.860
 time we start to see 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.000
 nintendo wii ads in our 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.340
 ambient television we are eating 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.050
 who knows if our little parts 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.330
 of games that have not yet been taught 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.460
 no in playboy no trailer or in 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.740
 something similar was attentive because if 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.370
 something like that comes out, it's worth something cool 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.110
 I would tell you around here, imagine that 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.180
 In a trailer, a function of 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.890
 look is not yet seen who 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.230
 he knows so the girls a greeting 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.920
 sit here and thank you very much for 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.360
 spend this this Sunday with me 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.730
 I hope you have a weekend already 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.730
