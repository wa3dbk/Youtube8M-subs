00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello and welcome here at rudi in 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:11.090
 we would like to give you this tutorial 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:15.089
 show how to super easy a video 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.000
 Your encoder can do that on one 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.580
 itunes can run and through this 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.480
 itunes of course on my ipad or 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.350
 iphone 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.150
 I have to pay attention to a few things 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.010
 because it is so I have doubt so 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.830
 a big video what was nine then 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.290
 gigabyte big but my ipad canal 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.540
 plus this size show it so 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.760
 nonsense data to provide 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.829
 to fill such a big picture if 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.930
 I have only such a small picture of the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.899
 Of course there is a difference in that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.390
 case in the file size of this format 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.030
 would be a gigabyte during this format 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.550
 on my ipad maybe only 300 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.960
 megabyte is big i must than it is 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.469
 really make sure that i have no 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.539
 format has what is unnecessarily big, especially 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.940
 then comes even more aggravating 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.290
 the format which is so big he must be yes 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.960
 count 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.360
 that is, the ipad must be unnecessarily much 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.400
 work around as a picture format too 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.740
 really reasonable to display 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 you can not buy anything for that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.700
 Good money is available to everyone 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.020
 That's the idea, too 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.810
 behind and to life 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.000
 but there are also free tools 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.939
 even really good tools and since one 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 few days you can get one from me right 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.869
 find good tool that if you miro 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 video converter and this converter 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.079
 Let's take a close look today and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.689
 show how it works we see 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.520
 here itunes in itunes i have 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.030
 different movies in my library 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.850
 and that's what I want to do now 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.460
 other films in a folder 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.159
 for my otto the movies that is now 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.380
 mco six folders you can see here 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.500
 can and these move files for 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.210
 I would like to have that on my 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.729
 to provide itunes 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.289
 For this I use the tool miro video 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.579
 converter that is this tool 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.349
 want us to times very briefly only once 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:15.040
 You do not really care much about watching 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:18.129
 look to convert trottweil 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.799
 that is, drag and drop as simply a 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.010
 video taking there reinziehen and it is 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:26.409
 because with him this pdf documents 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.680
 he has to create it in here 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.720
 now this is different 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.540
 video in what happens then 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.560
 I have another video quite simply so 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.829
 does not need the same 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.180
 I just click on a lot of other things 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.879
 video the theme is through 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.549
 or here the juso could be 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.500
 as well as select a file directly so 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.049
 We stay with our pdf document 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.970
 go down now what can we do with it 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.120
 we have and now she will 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.220
 really cool people but we have 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.909
 android devices that means next 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.689
 year the jersey of the magic droid this 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.799
 under different devices with the 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.840
 android running 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.260
 why different is below android 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.879
 no, it's about the display size 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.979
 that is how many pixels will be 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.609
 how many colors do you greet ? 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.859
 display 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.609
 I really want my video perfect 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.859
 to adjust 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.239
 I do not want unnecessary ballast with me 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.000
 I want to tow it by train 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.190
 drive in the hundred people inside 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.319
 although I have a plus 10 0 while 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.209
 this is exactly what needs to happen here 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.319
 I have my apple device is mine 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:38.859
 iphone ipod touch the nano the classic 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.260
 live by fiat or eveline rößler and 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.790
 then there are other formats you 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.030
 So you can do more in this case 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.389
 for example the portable playstation 4 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.409
 jura webcam the new format of google 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:58.900
 for multimedia files the solar 264 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:00.549
 replace or mp4 or mp3 audio only one 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.709
 can watch that is really good 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.290
 well thought out the whole story 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.180
 every important format is supported 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.459
 but we want in our case because 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.299
 we in eickel use on ipad click 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.450
 now there is something here to send 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.329
 he should do it the same if it does 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.150
 Finished tightly encoded directly in itunes 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.340
 It should be handed over as ultima in mine 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.270
 itunes list which is what I earlier also 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.729
 ever showed 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.460
 be available yes what should he do 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:35.320
 It will be complicated properly 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.620
 think convert that was that 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.550
 beautiful 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.469
 that means he is now converting this 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.710
 video in the right format 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:47.590
 correct image size and send it to me 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.130
 right now my own library i have 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.289
 here the status 7 percent whatever 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.180
 and if I want to know what 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.539
 is behind it how does that work 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.020
 Whats all the technology behind mpeg 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.150
 control output that is you know so 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.680
 already know ffm pack that 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.620
 So it works with the ff mpeg 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.409
 library over 120 video and 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.380
 encode and decode audio formats 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:16.120
 So it can be a really powerful tool 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.060
 and you have to chatter in there output 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.250
 How is the line around this code line 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.930
 the whole to include the individual 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.360
 which frames you right now 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.860
 the one after the other 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.130
 which version of the libraries you have 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.849
 you on it and and leave the whole 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:38.409
 ding just undergone far short 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.520
 at the end of 89 99 percent are done that 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.550
 whole has happened now 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.389
 you have seen in itunes prokop that 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.400
 was immediately in the itunes list in it 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.949
 this pdf documents i have so 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.550
 draw on my itunes so it can 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:57.520
 play here 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.510
 hello I welcome you here and have like 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.150
 you can see here 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:05.139
 just the right format I 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.330
 need the video on the ipad 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.599
 to play because I have for ipad times 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:14.229
 prepared that miro video converter 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:16.870
 is a free tool that link can 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.849
 you will find in our description there 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.990
 just download it on your mac os 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.589
 to install 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.210
 it is every one would even be paid for 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.940
 are worth saying so 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.830
