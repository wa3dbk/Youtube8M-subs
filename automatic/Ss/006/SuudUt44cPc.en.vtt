00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.580

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.200
 annotated game a game that already 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.570
 it's recorded that I'm not playing in 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.119
 direct so I can talk with a little 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.789
 more freedom and expression and nothing is 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.520
 opportunity I wanted to make it more than anything 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.689
 because I always see many people many 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.279
 subscribers that are always 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.830
 commenting on all the videos that are 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.599
 leaving their like although they do not leave me a 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.550

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.899
 constructive criticism that I say what 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.600
 be the truth that I always like to see 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.809
 the comments between the videos and a lot 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.219
 people always ask me the subject can you 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.860

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.829
 I would appreciate it a lot and I said that 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.110
 I would greet the people that I think 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.649
 moves more in the channel that shares 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.960
 the videos that talk the most with comments 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.989
 and what 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.270
 on twitter I retweet was many things or 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.240
 Facebook gives you some that I like 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.610

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.790
 yes that moves through the channel that I see it 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.340

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.590
 is leaving your comment and encouraging the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.899
 channel to which little by little it is growing 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.799
 more because every time we are more more 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.159
 channel followers does nothing we were 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.880

 we were a thousand ago nothing now we are 3200 the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.500
 I'm really enjoying how it is 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.200
 growing little by little the channel is not a 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.959
 channel that grows by leaps and bounds already 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.200

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.899

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.119
 people here youtube has a sponsor who 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.520
 it helps me grow up no one helps me and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.729
 I go alone and I go at my pace I do not want 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.500
 also not go so nobody tell me was 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.170
