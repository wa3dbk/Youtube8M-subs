00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.800 
acting on their Garrison's with fire
artist<00:01:22.119> so<00:01:22.750> there<00:01:22.929> are<00:01:22.960> archers<00:01:23.319> in<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.590> ship

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
artist so there are archers in the ship

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.969 
artist so there are archers in the ship
fire<00:01:26.810> arrows<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.470> right<00:01:27.620> now<00:01:27.770> they're

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
fire arrows and right now they're

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.399 
fire arrows and right now they're
engaging<00:01:28.340> these<00:01:29.000> archers<00:01:29.540> on<00:01:29.690> shore<00:01:30.050> that's

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
engaging these archers on shore that's

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.710 
engaging these archers on shore that's
an<00:01:30.530> example<00:01:30.830> of<00:01:31.040> how<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.850> ships<00:01:32.120> can<00:01:32.330> interact

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
an example of how the ships can interact

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.149 
an example of how the ships can interact
with<00:01:33.110> units<00:01:33.830> on<00:01:33.979> shore<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.610> can

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
with units on shore so you can

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.300 
with units on shore so you can
to<00:01:35.369> bombard<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.539> support<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.310> whatever

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to bombard and support of whatever

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.749 
to bombard and support of whatever
action<00:01:38.729> might<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:38.939> happening<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.569> land<00:01:40.759> we

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
action might be happening on land we

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.630 
action might be happening on land we
have<00:01:41.880> done<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> lot<00:01:42.569> of<00:01:42.979> upgrading<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.009> our

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
have done a lot of upgrading to our

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.969 
have done a lot of upgrading to our
engine<00:01:45.149> lot<00:01:45.539> of<00:01:45.689> new<00:01:45.810> technology<00:01:46.469> this<00:01:46.679> water

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
engine lot of new technology this water

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.429 
engine lot of new technology this water
system<00:01:47.429> is<00:01:47.549> an<00:01:47.939> example<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.539> that<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.319> can

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
system is an example of that so you can

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.870 
system is an example of that so you can
see<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.679> reflection<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.429> ships<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.819> the

water the shadows the Sun dancing off

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.230 
water the shadows the Sun dancing off
the<00:01:54.390> ripples<00:01:55.319> there<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:56.849> the<00:01:57.000> ocean

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the ripples there you can see the ocean

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.620 
the ripples there you can see the ocean
floor<00:01:57.599> underneath<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.740> depth<00:01:59.039> cues<00:01:59.630> it's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
floor underneath we get depth cues it's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.149 
floor underneath we get depth cues it's
very<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.619> pretty<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:04.079> we'll<00:02:04.200> take<00:02:04.349> our<00:02:04.500> ships

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
very very pretty so we'll take our ships

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.359 
very very pretty so we'll take our ships
on<00:02:05.340> around<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> point<00:02:05.969> here<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.220> what<00:02:08.220> we're

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
on around the point here and what we're

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.210

not<00:02:49.600> going<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:49.900> well<00:02:50.110> for<00:02:50.290> me<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.800> time<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:52.150> I

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
not going so well for me this time but I

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.820 
not going so well for me this time but I
do<00:02:52.270> have<00:02:52.450> some<00:02:52.630> reinforcements<00:02:53.290> coming<00:02:53.500> into

a second

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.479 
a second
