and<00:02:16.920> then<00:02:17.130> you're<00:02:17.610> going<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.820> release<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.360> that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and then you're going to release it that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.470 
and then you're going to release it that
simple<00:02:19.530> they<00:02:20.160> said<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.640> batter<00:02:20.820> was<00:02:21.060> not

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
simple they said the batter was not

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.080 
simple they said the batter was not
reachable<00:02:21.870> releasable<00:02:22.770> but<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.340> yes

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
reachable releasable but it is yes

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.330 
reachable releasable but it is yes
that's<00:02:24.420> something<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:24.990> guys<00:02:25.140> now<00:02:25.830> you're

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
that's something you guys now you're

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.030 
that's something you guys now you're
going<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.640> take<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.970> battery<00:02:27.390> off<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:28.040> then

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
going to take that battery off and then

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.270 
going to take that battery off and then
now<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:32.570> two<00:02:33.570> connectors<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.440> think<00:02:35.130> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
now this is two connectors I think it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.540 
now this is two connectors I think it
was<00:02:35.310> you're<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.330> take<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.780> school<00:02:37.550> the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
two screws here you're going to get them

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:50.840 
two screws here you're going to get them

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
going to take the plate off and then

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.740 
going to take the plate off and then
disconnect<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.910> connector<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.630> a

connector you are interested this is
another<00:03:08.370> connector<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.770> think<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.950> was<00:03:11.070> just

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
another connector I think it was just

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.660 
another connector I think it was just
left<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.820> tab<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.480> lifted<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:14.340> one

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
left the tab is lifted and this one

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.030 
left the tab is lifted and this one
should<00:03:14.880> be<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.030> bit<00:03:15.360> tricky<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.500> want<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.830> have

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
should be a bit tricky you want to have

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.850 
should be a bit tricky you want to have
to<00:03:17.340> pull<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.880> tab<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.240> there<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.320> piece

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
to pull a tab that there is like a piece

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.630 
to pull a tab that there is like a piece
of<00:03:20.090> metal<00:03:21.090> on<00:03:21.870> put<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> 90<00:03:22.830> degrees<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.370> then

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
of metal on put a 90 degrees and then

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.820 
of metal on put a 90 degrees and then
try<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:23.970> pry<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.510> apart<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:25.140> each<00:03:25.320> side<00:03:25.650> like

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
try to pry it apart in each side like

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.770 
try to pry it apart in each side like
this<00:03:25.860> connector<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:27.239> be<00:03:27.390> careful<00:03:27.420> because

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
this connector but be careful because

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.920 
this connector but be careful because
this<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.500> video<00:03:28.800> out<00:03:29.239> connector<00:03:30.239> now<00:03:30.870> the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
this is the video out connector now the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.380 
this is the video out connector now the
mega<00:03:31.320> safe<00:03:31.620> connector<00:03:32.220> is<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.700> little<00:03:33.269> bit

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
mega safe connector is a little bit

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.680 
mega safe connector is a little bit
trickier<00:03:34.190> some<00:03:35.190> sugar<00:03:35.610> just<00:03:35.880> try<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:36.480> to

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
trickier some sugar just try not to

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.180 
trickier some sugar just try not to
stick<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.910> metal<00:03:38.910> in<00:03:39.030> there<00:03:39.239> pointing<00:03:40.190> you

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
stick the metal in there pointing you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.150 
stick the metal in there pointing you
can<00:03:41.370> damage<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.180> now<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.440> when<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.650> remove

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
can damage it on now you when I remove

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.949 
can damage it on now you when I remove
this<00:03:44.850> two<00:03:45.630> screws<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.500> it's<00:03:47.160> off<00:03:47.370> now<00:03:47.959> after
