one<00:00:09.629> note<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.929> caution<00:00:10.139> when<00:00:10.499> it<00:00:10.589> comes<00:00:10.769> to

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:11.009 
one note of caution when it comes to

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.029 
one note of caution when it comes to
implied<00:00:11.549> odds<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:13.339> be<00:00:14.339> careful<00:00:14.759> not<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
implied odds is be careful not to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.909 
implied odds is be careful not to
fall<00:00:16.160> down<00:00:16.189> that<00:00:16.669> implied<00:00:17.650> spiral<00:00:18.650> if<00:00:18.800> you

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:18.919 
fall down that implied spiral if you

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.650 
fall down that implied spiral if you
will<00:00:19.099> when<00:00:19.250> it<00:00:19.369> comes<00:00:19.609> to<00:00:19.880> chasing<00:00:20.390> flush

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
will when it comes to chasing flush

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.630 
will when it comes to chasing flush
draws<00:00:20.929> because<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:21.800> flush<00:00:22.039> draw<00:00:22.279> is<00:00:22.489> the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
draws because the flush draw is the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.970 
draws because the flush draw is the
obvious<00:00:22.789> draw<00:00:24.309> and<00:00:25.689> also<00:00:26.689> scare<00:00:27.500> cards<00:00:27.739> that

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
obvious draw and also scare cards that

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.450 
obvious draw and also scare cards that
could<00:00:28.160> come<00:00:28.309> out<00:00:28.399> for<00:00:28.669> your<00:00:28.820> opponent<00:00:29.390> as<00:00:29.539> well

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
could come out for your opponent as well

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.899 
could come out for your opponent as well
in<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:32.419> sense<00:00:32.689> that<00:00:33.129> implied<00:00:34.129> odds<00:00:34.339> exist

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:34.909 
in the sense that implied odds exist

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.310 
in the sense that implied odds exist
typically<00:00:35.360> when<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.809> outs<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:36.170> you're

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
typically when the outs that you're

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.259 
typically when the outs that you're
hitting<00:00:36.589> or<00:00:36.710> more<00:00:36.890> hidden<00:00:37.159> because<00:00:37.820> it's<00:00:38.120> more

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
hitting or more hidden because it's more

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.079 
hitting or more hidden because it's more
likely<00:00:38.540> for<00:00:38.690> your<00:00:38.930> opponent<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.379> keep<00:00:39.620> betting

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
likely for your opponent to keep betting

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.780 
likely for your opponent to keep betting
implied<00:00:41.089> odds<00:00:41.239> are<00:00:41.420> basically<00:00:42.550> where<00:00:43.550> you're

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
implied odds are basically where you're

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.369 
implied odds are basically where you're
where<00:00:44.089> you're<00:00:44.210> coming<00:00:45.079> up<00:00:45.140> with<00:00:45.199> an

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
where you're coming up with an

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.709 
where you're coming up with an
implication<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:46.159> the<00:00:46.280> value<00:00:46.699> of<00:00:46.909> the<00:00:47.180> pot<00:00:47.420> as

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
implication of the value of the pot as

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.289 
implication of the value of the pot as
play<00:00:48.559> continues<00:00:49.159> so<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.699> pot<00:00:49.909> might<00:00:50.089> have<00:00:50.210> a

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
play continues so the pot might have a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:51.969 
play continues so the pot might have a
certain<00:00:50.600> value<00:00:50.960> right<00:00:51.170> now<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:51.680> as<00:00:51.769> play

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
certain value right now but as play

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.710 
certain value right now but as play
continues<00:00:52.549> and<00:00:52.759> there's<00:00:53.000> more<00:00:53.180> betting<00:00:53.479> that

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
continues and there's more betting that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.420 
continues and there's more betting that
you<00:00:53.780> can<00:00:54.019> predict<00:00:54.350> then<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.040> can<00:00:55.189> calculate

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
you can predict then you can calculate

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.210 
you can predict then you can calculate
what<00:00:55.759> that<00:00:56.030> implied<00:00:56.720> value<00:00:57.559> of<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:57.799> pot<00:00:58.009> will

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
what that implied value of the pot will

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.630 
what that implied value of the pot will
be<00:00:58.869> it's<00:00:59.869> difficult<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.650> imply<00:01:01.250> how<00:01:01.460> much

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
be it's difficult to imply how much

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.579 
be it's difficult to imply how much
betting<00:01:01.970> will<00:01:02.089> occur<00:01:02.390> when<00:01:02.629> a<00:01:02.659> scary<00:01:03.229> card

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
betting will occur when a scary card

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.079 
betting will occur when a scary card
hits<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.009> board<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.369> actually<00:01:04.729> usually

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
hits the board the actually usually

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.090 
hits the board the actually usually
shuts<00:01:05.360> down<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.409> if<00:01:06.470> you're<00:01:06.619> on<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.740> flush<00:01:07.070> draw

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
shuts down so if you're on a flush draw

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.640 
shuts down so if you're on a flush draw
on<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.610> flush<00:01:07.820> card<00:01:08.090> hits<00:01:08.409> unless<00:01:09.409> it's

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
on the flush card hits unless it's

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.740 
on the flush card hits unless it's
directly<00:01:10.040> heads-up<00:01:10.460> but<00:01:10.700> even<00:01:11.060> even<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.540> heads

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750

up<00:01:11.960> there's<00:01:12.770> no<00:01:12.890> guarantee<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:13.400> an

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
up there's no guarantee that an

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.130 
up there's no guarantee that an
opponent's<00:01:14.119> going<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.299> put<00:01:14.479> an<00:01:14.570> extra<00:01:14.750> chip<00:01:15.020> in

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
opponent's going to put an extra chip in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.920 
opponent's going to put an extra chip in
the<00:01:15.229> pot<00:01:15.579> but<00:01:16.579> this<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:16.880> why<00:01:17.000> we<00:01:17.180> play<00:01:17.360> hands

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
the pot but this is why we play hands

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.230 
the pot but this is why we play hands
like<00:01:18.079> small<00:01:18.619> pairs<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.159> try<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.369> flop<00:01:19.640> set<00:01:19.939> set

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
like small pairs and try to flop set set

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.500 
like small pairs and try to flop set set
set<00:01:20.450> mining<00:01:21.320> or<00:01:21.470> it's<00:01:22.040> why<00:01:22.190> we<00:01:22.370> try<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.640> or<00:01:23.270> why

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
set mining or it's why we try to or why

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.060 
set mining or it's why we try to or why
there's<00:01:23.690> greater<00:01:23.960> value<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.680> going<00:01:25.040> for

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
there's greater value to going for

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.940 
there's greater value to going for
straights<00:01:26.050> because<00:01:27.050> it's<00:01:27.260> typically<00:01:27.590> in<00:01:27.710> like

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
straights because it's typically in like

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.490 
straights because it's typically in like
double<00:01:28.310> gutshot<00:01:28.729> straight<00:01:28.790> because<00:01:29.750> it

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
double gutshot straight because it

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.899 
double gutshot straight because it
forces<00:01:30.890> your<00:01:31.040> opponent<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.490> put<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.729> on<00:01:31.790> a

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
forces your opponent to put you on a

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.640 
forces your opponent to put you on a
very<00:01:32.150> specific<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.870> to<00:01:33.140> think<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:33.409> they're

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
very specific and to think that they're

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.000 
very specific and to think that they're
beat<00:01:34.180> so<00:01:35.180> implied<00:01:35.930> value<00:01:36.320> typically<00:01:36.680> comes

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
beat so implied value typically comes

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.000 
beat so implied value typically comes
with<00:01:37.479> with<00:01:38.479> hitting<00:01:38.780> big<00:01:39.020> hands<00:01:39.229> like<00:01:39.440> sets<00:01:39.740> or

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
with with hitting big hands like sets or

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.550 
with with hitting big hands like sets or
hitting<00:01:40.370> or<00:01:40.729> hitting<00:01:41.299> straights<00:01:41.750> because

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
hitting or hitting straights because

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.230 
hitting or hitting straights because
there's<00:01:42.740> nothing<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:43.040> scare<00:01:43.430> your<00:01:43.549> opponent

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
there's nothing to scare your opponent

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.480 
there's nothing to scare your opponent
away<00:01:44.420> from<00:01:44.630> continuing<00:01:45.320> with<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.010> betting<00:01:46.310> so

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
away from continuing with the betting so

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.370 
away from continuing with the betting so
just<00:01:47.030> be<00:01:47.150> cautious<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:47.600> you're<00:01:47.840> not<00:01:47.960> waiving

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
just be cautious that you're not waiving

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.380 
just be cautious that you're not waiving
the<00:01:48.470> implied<00:01:48.830> value<00:01:49.780> flag<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.729> that's<00:01:53.210> what

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
the implied value flag and that's what

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.730 
the implied value flag and that's what
got<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.750> into<00:01:53.990> more<00:01:54.140> trouble<00:01:54.170> then<00:01:54.619> you

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
got you into more trouble then you

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.260 
got you into more trouble then you
needed<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.130> get<00:01:55.310> into<00:01:55.640> because<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.119> thought

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
needed to get into because you thought

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.840 
needed to get into because you thought
there<00:01:56.479> was<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:56.720> much<00:01:56.869> implied<00:01:57.680> value<00:01:58.190> it's<00:01:58.729> a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
there was so much implied value it's a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.550 
there was so much implied value it's a
little<00:01:59.030> bit<00:01:59.210> too<00:01:59.479> much<00:01:59.689> to<00:01:59.869> completely

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
little bit too much to completely

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.399 
little bit too much to completely
