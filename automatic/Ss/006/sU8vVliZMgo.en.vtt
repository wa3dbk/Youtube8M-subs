00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
screen shields on mine I had to take it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
screen shields on mine I had to take it
off<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.380> order<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> review<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.520> I've

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
off in order to do this review and I've

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.789 
off in order to do this review and I've
simply<00:01:24.330> personally<00:01:24.900> won't<00:01:25.049> choose<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.619> use<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
simply personally won't choose to use a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.920 
simply personally won't choose to use a
case<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.759> doesn't<00:01:27.150> let<00:01:27.240> me<00:01:27.270> use<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> screen

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
case that doesn't let me use a screen

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.359 
case that doesn't let me use a screen
shield<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.320> realize<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
shield I realize there are a lot of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.910 
shield I realize there are a lot of
people<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.689> don't<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
people out there that don't go with a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.380 
people out there that don't go with a
screen<00:01:32.250> shield<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.759> you'll<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.060> fine<00:01:33.210> with

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
screen shield so you'll be fine with

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.749 
screen shield so you'll be fine with
this<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.770> these<00:01:34.860> corners<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.520> so

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
this now because of these corners are so

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.640 
this now because of these corners are so
tight<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.450> very<00:01:36.720> hard<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> case<00:01:37.409> on

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
tight it's very hard to get the case on

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.770 
tight it's very hard to get the case on
you<00:01:37.860> got<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.250> push<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.640> pry<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
you got to really push and pry but that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.749 
you got to really push and pry but that
does<00:01:40.020> result<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:40.829> nice<00:01:41.100> tight<00:01:41.460> fit

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
does result in a really nice tight fit

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
does result in a really nice tight fit
as<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.450> I've<00:01:42.689> got<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.259> all<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.409> there

enough force required so that it's not

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.140 
enough force required so that it's not
going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.100> spin<00:02:41.310> around<00:02:41.430> when<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.790> don't<00:02:41.970> want

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
going to spin around when you don't want

it to and the strap fits perfectly you

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.370 
it to and the strap fits perfectly you
don't<00:02:45.090> really<00:02:45.210> have<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.510> adjust<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.110> at<00:02:46.230> all

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
don't really have to adjust it at all

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.560 
don't really have to adjust it at all
because<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:46.860> elastic<00:02:47.160> your<00:02:47.820> hand<00:02:48.030> slides<00:02:48.300> in

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
because it's elastic your hand slides in

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.650 
because it's elastic your hand slides in
and<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.810> sizes<00:02:49.530> perfectly<00:02:49.980> all<00:02:50.160> by<00:02:50.370> itself<00:02:50.790> so

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
and it sizes perfectly all by itself so

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.410 
and it sizes perfectly all by itself so
the<00:02:52.340> 360<00:02:53.340> again<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:53.790> available<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.270> couple

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.670 
and white at 5995 I'm not a fan of it
only<00:03:00.180> because<00:03:00.570> number<00:03:00.840> one<00:03:01.020> can't<00:03:01.530> use<00:03:01.650> a
