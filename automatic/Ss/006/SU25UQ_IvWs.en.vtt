00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
adjusted very very easily what I'd

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.969 
adjusted very very easily what I'd
recommend<00:01:36.909> is<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:38.200> adjusting<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.799> when<00:01:38.920> you

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
recommend is just adjusting it when you

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.700 
recommend is just adjusting it when you
put<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.250> muzzle<00:01:39.399> on<00:01:39.700> with<00:01:40.540> someone<00:01:40.720> tell<00:01:40.990> as
