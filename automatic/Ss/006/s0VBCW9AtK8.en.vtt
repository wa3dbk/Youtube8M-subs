so I got two of these and I had just
enough<00:01:48.049> dye<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.439> I'd<00:01:49.590> probably<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:50.009> three

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
enough dye like I'd probably get three

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.330 
enough dye like I'd probably get three
three<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.350> these<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.860> you're<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> do

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
three of these if you're going to do

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.219 
three of these if you're going to do
your<00:01:53.460> extensions<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.030> your<00:01:54.210> hair<00:01:54.570> because<00:01:54.990> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
your extensions and your hair because I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:55.550 
your extensions and your hair because I
was

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
was

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280 
was
kind<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.920> close<00:01:56.189> also<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.060> did<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.420> by<00:01:58.140> myself

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
kind of close also I did it by myself

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.080 
kind of close also I did it by myself
when<00:01:58.680> no<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:58.920> home<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.939> like

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
when no one was home and I think I like

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.569 
when no one was home and I think I like
missed<00:02:00.570> patches<00:02:01.020> at<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> back<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.070> would

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
missed patches at the back so I would

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.889 
missed patches at the back so I would
not<00:02:02.700> recommend<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.630> yeah<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.720> just

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
not recommend that but yeah I just

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.810 
not recommend that but yeah I just
wanted<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.380> quickly<00:02:04.619> go<00:02:04.890> over<00:02:04.979> what<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.340> use<00:02:05.549> and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
wanted to quickly go over what I use and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.819 
wanted to quickly go over what I use and
stuff<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.479> why<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> done<00:02:07.229> my<00:02:07.350> hair<00:02:07.530> cuz<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.680> knew

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
stuff and why I done my hair cuz I knew

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.960 
stuff and why I done my hair cuz I knew
I<00:02:07.860> was<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.459> questions<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
I was going to get questions and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.620 
I was going to get questions and
comments<00:02:09.270> um<00:02:09.590> along<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.340> need<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
comments um along with this you need a

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.559 
comments um along with this you need a
ten<00:02:15.630> developer<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:17.730> was<00:02:17.880> really<00:02:18.330> cheap

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
ten developer and this was really cheap

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.509 
ten developer and this was really cheap
I<00:02:18.660> went<00:02:18.840> out<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.019> Sally's<00:02:19.349> my<00:02:19.560> total<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:20.010> 25

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
I went out to Sally's my total was 25

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.190 
I went out to Sally's my total was 25
but<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.849> also<00:02:21.030> caught<00:02:21.300> leaving<00:02:22.050> conditioner

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
but I also caught leaving conditioner

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.839 
but I also caught leaving conditioner
and<00:02:22.739> gloves

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
and gloves

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.880 
and gloves
so<00:02:24.540> I'm<00:02:24.930> guessing<00:02:25.110> these<00:02:25.349> are<00:02:25.470> about<00:02:25.709> like

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
so I'm guessing these are about like

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.650 
so I'm guessing these are about like
five<00:02:26.069> dollars<00:02:26.250> each<00:02:26.610> which<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.090> not<00:02:27.239> bad<00:02:27.510> at

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
five dollars each which is not bad at

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.860 
five dollars each which is not bad at
all<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.049> basically<00:02:28.170> drugstore<00:02:29.299> price<00:02:30.299> but

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
all it's basically drugstore price but

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.570 
all it's basically drugstore price but
salon<00:02:31.380> quality<00:02:31.799> so<00:02:32.100> if<00:02:32.250> you're<00:02:32.340> going<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.519> dye

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
salon quality so if you're going to dye

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.800 
salon quality so if you're going to dye
your<00:02:32.700> hair<00:02:32.850> definitely<00:02:33.030> recommend<00:02:33.569> going<00:02:33.660> to

your hair definitely recommend going to
