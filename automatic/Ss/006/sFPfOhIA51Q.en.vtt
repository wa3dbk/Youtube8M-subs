00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.679
 he greets everyone draws that we 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.490
 found today on my desk for 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.360
 a new video 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.710
 I'll show you how in some 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.270
 so do - gew to the game so I 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.520
 want to clarify that it does not work 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.149
 for all the games example minecraft that 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:34.160
 do not eat or assassin's creed 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:38.699
 where all the young people at the top 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.590
 so that's why so that for 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.310
 do the trick we need this software 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.750
 so cff explore I will put the link of 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.550
 download not description of 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.230
 this video 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.640
 so we'll start straight away 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.280
 to show how to use it 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.160
 so that's when we get that back 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 so there could open files you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.790
 open the game launcher with which 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.149
 you want to boost so for example me 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.939
 it's going to be terrible 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.469
 so I have to search 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.880
 I'm peeling misses because I've 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.359
 cracked but I'm going to which I do not 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.189
 not hide so I think I put 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:23.340
 in my games 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.679
 so here is hop and I start the game with 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.709
 this one so normally if you have it 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.880
 not cracked it will be with this one but 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:35.600
 me it's with that so I do not open 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.070
 you go here in filed under 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.180
 complicated 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.439
 can we are cards in 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.020
 tables in minnig here write so your 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.600
 clicks and the same but our classes to you 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.509
 displays game features so 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.399
 theoretically the game as it is you 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.920
 see this line there she is not 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.250
 lying down so that means that by default 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.460
 your computer do not allow it to play 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.019
 tabbou to access more than 2 gigabits of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.000
 drama so you have to check it so 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.110
 the game will be able to use more than 2 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.090
 megabits of ram which will reduce 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.350
 a lot of joke 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.680
 make me trust me sorry 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.580
 market 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.670
 no you're done ok then 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.569
 you do say so here they go to me 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.870
 ask to replace original you 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.680
 make 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.920
 yes alas will you pass your game is 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.540
 now booster so if ever that 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.080
 tells you that it's impossible to 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.200
 replace 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.350
 you put it for example on your 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.090
 office so we'll say that the application 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.350
 that it has created you you can not 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.400
 replace so here it is on the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:56.170
 office you open the folder so me 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.360
 it's in the documents 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.450
 games here this is so here you 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:07.690
 replace so you have copy replaces 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:09.489
 so here is voila if so if it is 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.840
 already know if it will allow you to 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.180
 constantly reduce lags 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.670
 I also have another tip so no 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.330
 to show you but I tell you 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.390
 does the other you start your game so 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.269
 he goes with with your your launch 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.269
 usual finally, short you do we see 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.080
 on it for windows 7 and windows xp 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.010
 vista 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.150
 I do not know what it is for match 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.040
 so you go into manager of 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.489
 tasks 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.750
 I do not walk I do not think 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.799
 but I will still try by 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.600
 example with skype so if ever his 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.989
 chopped off 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.989
 I would do 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.730
 ah well it does not appear so I hope so 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.910
 so normally you have you have this 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.060
 if you go into process so you 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.670
 remember the name of the software you 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.459
 want to improve so a process me 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.100
 it's skype so you're looking for skype it 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.730
 is here right click you have defined 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.570
 priority 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.970
 and there you increase it to high so you 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.590
 did modify here so in fact 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.220
 how are you going to tell your 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.460
 computer 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.990
 2 how to say to give more than 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.660
 application resources that you have 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.150
 says to others so logically it goes from 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.010
 ranelagh so for those who have a pc 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.310
 no more not too powerful for 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.650
 minecraft makes you that one with 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.810
 management halt h and then to support him 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.419
 Basically I do not know what was skyrim or other 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.390
 Well you do both and tricks 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.230
 then your player lagrave a lot less 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.160
 no it was a little trick 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.570
 like that I have you that I give you 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.280
 so here I hope it will help you 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.479
 and then I am I will be very happy so 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.220
