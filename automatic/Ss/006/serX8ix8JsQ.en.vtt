I<00:05:48.590> thought<00:05:49.070> for<00:05:49.340> myself<00:05:49.729> I<00:05:49.970> was<00:05:50.810> willing<00:05:50.990> to

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
I thought for myself I was willing to

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.880 
I thought for myself I was willing to
give<00:05:51.590> that<00:05:51.830> a<00:05:52.130> try<00:05:52.550> now<00:05:53.510> by<00:05:53.660> researching<00:05:54.080> HCG

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
give that a try now by researching HCG

and this is what I'm succeeded by we
might<00:05:56.690> find<00:05:56.990> new<00:05:57.290> ways<00:05:57.470> to<00:05:57.530> help<00:05:57.950> millions<00:05:58.430> of
