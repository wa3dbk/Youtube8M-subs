00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.790 
how's that look pretty good or what just
the<00:01:52.950> homebrew<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.310> made<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.390> video<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:55.200> there

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
the homebrew I made the video of there

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.490 
the homebrew I made the video of there
last<00:01:56.040> week<00:01:56.720> last<00:01:57.720> week<00:01:57.870> in<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> week<00:01:58.320> before

what do you think guys smells like

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.510 
what do you think guys smells like
normal<00:02:39.770> homebrew<00:02:40.099> all<00:02:40.700> right<00:02:42.430> looks<00:02:43.430> pretty

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
normal homebrew all right looks pretty

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:58.440 
normal homebrew all right looks pretty
good

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.000 

you<00:02:59.450> know<00:02:59.540> what<00:02:59.690> I<00:03:02.769> did<00:03:03.769> it<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.980> bottle

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
you know what I did it the bottle

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.649 
you know what I did it the bottle
suppose<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.250> plastic<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:07.909> don't<00:03:08.330> really<00:03:08.480> find

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
suppose the plastic I don't really find

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.860 
suppose the plastic I don't really find
much<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.049> difference<00:03:11.799> it's<00:03:12.799> about<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> same

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
much of a difference it's about the same

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.119 
much of a difference it's about the same
it's<00:03:14.870> got<00:03:14.989> a<00:03:15.019> bit<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.349> refreshing<00:03:15.920> taste

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
it's got a bit of a refreshing taste

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:26.319 
it's got a bit of a refreshing taste
it's<00:03:24.069> it's<00:03:25.069> carbonated<00:03:25.670> boat<00:03:25.909> to<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.120> right

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
it's it's carbonated boat to the right

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.180 
it's it's carbonated boat to the right
amount

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
amount

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.670

got about the same taste as I would get

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.240 
got about the same taste as I would get
out<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.180> one<00:03:41.269> of<00:03:41.299> these<00:03:41.540> coke<00:03:42.470> balls<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:45.250> that's

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
out of one of these coke balls so that's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.830 
out of one of these coke balls so that's
about<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.519> same<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.940> doesn't<00:03:47.329> really<00:03:47.480> improve

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
about the same it doesn't really improve

any in the ball of course it was sitting

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.309 
any in the ball of course it was sitting
for<00:03:52.609> a<00:03:52.790> full<00:03:52.940> seven<00:03:53.239> days<00:03:53.420> in<00:03:53.659> the<00:03:53.690> closet<00:03:54.170> and

for a full seven days in the closet and
in<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.799> room<00:03:55.190> temperature<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:56.019> then<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.140> was

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
in the room temperature and then it was

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.879 
in the room temperature and then it was
sitting<00:03:57.560> for<00:03:59.440> seven<00:04:00.440> full<00:04:00.919> days<00:04:00.950> in<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.519> no<00:04:02.889> it

and<00:04:05.959> fridge<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.380> think<00:04:06.590> something<00:04:07.310> like<00:04:07.370> that

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
and fridge I think something like that

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.729 
and fridge I think something like that
so<00:04:09.859> anyways<00:04:10.150> that's<00:04:11.150> that<00:04:11.480> that's<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:12.590> old

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
so anyways that's that that's the old

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.770 
so anyways that's that that's the old
