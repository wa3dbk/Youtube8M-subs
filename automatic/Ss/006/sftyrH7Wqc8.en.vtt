reinflates or airbags now the reason the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.890 
reinflates or airbags now the reason the
reason<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.760> see<00:03:16.000> when<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.240> drop<00:03:16.480> an<00:03:16.630> empty

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
reason I see when you drop an empty

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.280 
reason I see when you drop an empty
trailer<00:03:17.170> once<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.650> first<00:03:17.920> feel<00:03:18.160> friction<00:03:19.290> you

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
trailer once you first feel friction you

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.860 
trailer once you first feel friction you
stop<00:03:20.680> because<00:03:21.460> what<00:03:21.790> happens<00:03:22.270> is<00:03:22.390> if<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.690> keep

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
stop because what happens is if you keep

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.220 
stop because what happens is if you keep
cranking<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.700> raising<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.240> or<00:03:25.630> rape<00:03:26.020> or

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
cranking it and raising that or rape or

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.040 
cranking it and raising that or rape or
lowering<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.710> landing<00:03:27.160> gear<00:03:27.930> you're<00:03:28.930> gonna

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
lowering that landing gear you're gonna

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.830 
lowering that landing gear you're gonna
have<00:03:29.290> air<00:03:29.560> suspension<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.420> air<00:03:31.570> spoon

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
have air suspension so the air spoon

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.480 
have air suspension so the air spoon
will<00:03:31.930> start<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.290> leak<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.740> reason<00:03:33.100> why

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
will start to leak and the reason why

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.530 
will start to leak and the reason why
it's<00:03:33.700> doing<00:03:33.880> that<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.240> because<00:03:34.300> you're

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
it's doing that is because you're

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.000 
it's doing that is because you're
lifting<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.930> fifth<00:03:35.140> wheel<00:03:35.380> up<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:35.830> air

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
lifting the fifth wheel up in the air
