cerebellum<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.590> also<00:02:37.160> responsible<00:02:37.700> for

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
cerebellum is also responsible for

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.330 
cerebellum is also responsible for
muscle

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
muscle

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.940 
muscle
movement<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.849> control<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:40.230> also<00:02:40.470> helps

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
movement and control and it also helps

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.970 
movement and control and it also helps
us<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.250> learning<00:02:41.959> great<00:02:42.959> you're<00:02:43.560> right<00:02:43.830> about

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
us in learning great you're right about

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.580 
us in learning great you're right about
the<00:02:44.190> medulla<00:02:44.610> also<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.629> running<00:02:45.930> our<00:02:46.230> body

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
the medulla also it is running our body

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.820 
the medulla also it is running our body
from<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.099> inside<00:02:47.870> now<00:02:48.870> do<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.379> want<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.680> learn

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
from the inside now do you want to learn

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.339 
from the inside now do you want to learn
about<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.310> peripheral<00:02:50.849> nervous<00:02:51.060> system<00:02:51.349> the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
about the peripheral nervous system the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.500 
about the peripheral nervous system the
peripheral<00:02:52.980> nervous<00:02:53.220> system<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.879> made<00:02:53.940> up<00:02:54.390> of

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
peripheral nervous system is made up of

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.780 
peripheral nervous system is made up of
many<00:02:55.080> nerves<00:02:55.440> which<00:02:55.980> are<00:02:56.160> present<00:02:56.610> throughout

has two functions some nerves receive

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.640 
has two functions some nerves receive
information<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.900> when<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.349> taste

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
information like when you taste

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.100 
information like when you taste
something<00:03:04.879> these<00:03:05.879> messages<00:03:06.390> are<00:03:06.569> carried<00:03:07.080> to

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
something these messages are carried to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.289 
something these messages are carried to
the<00:03:07.230> brain<00:03:07.319> by<00:03:07.799> these<00:03:08.040> nerves<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:09.269> nerves

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
the brain by these nerves the nerves

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.630 
the brain by these nerves the nerves
which<00:03:09.810> take<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.140> message<00:03:10.620> from<00:03:10.829> senses<00:03:11.340> to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
which take the message from senses to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.910 
which take the message from senses to
the<00:03:11.730> brain<00:03:11.970> are<00:03:12.209> called<00:03:12.780> sensory<00:03:13.560> nerves

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
the brain are called sensory nerves

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.550 
the brain are called sensory nerves
other<00:03:14.220> nerves<00:03:15.030> carry<00:03:15.540> messages<00:03:16.140> from<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
other nerves carry messages from the

other nerves carry messages from the
brain<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.370> body<00:03:17.400> these<00:03:18.390> are<00:03:18.630> called<00:03:18.900> motor

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
brain to the body these are called motor

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.890 
brain to the body these are called motor
nerves<00:03:19.860> they<00:03:20.640> carry<00:03:20.970> instructions<00:03:21.630> from<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
nerves they carry instructions from the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.050 
nerves they carry instructions from the
brain<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.380> body<00:03:22.680> on<00:03:22.890> what<00:03:23.430> action<00:03:23.879> to<00:03:23.910> take

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
brain to the body on what action to take

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.900 
brain to the body on what action to take
like<00:03:25.019> for<00:03:25.410> example<00:03:25.500> if<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.430> were<00:03:26.549> eating

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
like for example if you were eating

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.000 
like for example if you were eating
chili<00:03:27.269> which<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.049> brain<00:03:28.290> told<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.799> was

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
chili which the brain told you was

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.309 
chili which the brain told you was
bitter<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.940> now<00:03:30.120> you're<00:03:30.480> doing<00:03:30.629> a<00:03:30.930> spitting

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
bitter so now you're doing a spitting

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.280 
bitter so now you're doing a spitting
action<00:03:31.799> all<00:03:31.950> nerves<00:03:32.579> are<00:03:32.879> made<00:03:33.329> up<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.629> neurons

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
action all nerves are made up of neurons

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.539 
action all nerves are made up of neurons
a<00:03:34.620> neuron<00:03:35.239> has<00:03:36.239> three<00:03:36.690> major<00:03:36.989> parts<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.590> nucleus

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
a neuron has three major parts a nucleus

axon dendrites taken the electric

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.530 
axon dendrites taken the electric
messages<00:03:45.989> two<00:03:46.260> cell<00:03:46.500> bodies<00:03:47.000> axons<00:03:48.000> take<00:03:48.420> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
messages two cell bodies axons take the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.259 
messages two cell bodies axons take the
message<00:03:48.870> away<00:03:49.049> from<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.920> cell<00:03:50.100> body<00:03:50.280> so

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
message away from the cell body so

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.629 
message away from the cell body so
dendrites<00:03:52.019> are<00:03:52.200> like<00:03:52.440> entry<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.220> parking

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
dendrites are like entry to a parking

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.740 
dendrites are like entry to a parking
lot<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:55.160> axons<00:03:56.160> are<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.790> exit<00:03:57.269> route<00:03:57.480> from

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
lot and axons are the exit route from
