out on you that's right we're just
saving<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.540> answer<00:01:52.780> for<00:01:52.899> this<00:01:52.990> week<00:01:53.170> sniff

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
saving the answer for this week sniff

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.740 
saving the answer for this week sniff
Dean<00:01:53.619> ridiculous<00:01:54.100> segment<00:01:54.490> oh<00:01:54.670> really

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
Dean ridiculous segment oh really

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:06.450 
Dean ridiculous segment oh really
yeah<00:01:56.140> it's<00:01:56.590> time<00:01:56.800> for<00:01:56.950> some<00:01:57.070> good<00:01:57.780> science<00:02:05.460> so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
yeah it's time for some good science so

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.100 
yeah it's time for some good science so
remember<00:02:06.760> how<00:02:06.850> heliolisk<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.720> generator

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
remember how heliolisk is the generator

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.479 
remember how heliolisk is the generator
pokemon<00:02:08.530> it's<00:02:08.830> because<00:02:09.070> he's<00:02:09.220> all<00:02:09.459> about

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
pokemon it's because he's all about

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.610 
pokemon it's because he's all about
solar<00:02:10.060> power<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.630> black<00:02:10.929> scales<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.440> top

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
solar power the black scales on the top

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.870 
solar power the black scales on the top
half<00:02:11.799> of<00:02:11.890> his<00:02:11.950> body<00:02:12.160> are<00:02:12.340> reminiscent<00:02:12.610> of

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
half of his body are reminiscent of

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.080 
half of his body are reminiscent of
solar<00:02:13.180> panels<00:02:13.600> it's<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.260> good<00:02:14.560> science<00:02:15.090> yeah

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
solar panels it's just good science yeah

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.539 
solar panels it's just good science yeah
heck<00:02:16.810> his<00:02:17.260> hidden<00:02:17.530> ability<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:17.950> solar<00:02:18.220> power

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
heck his hidden ability is solar power

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.850 
heck his hidden ability is solar power
in<00:02:19.000> terms<00:02:19.269> of<00:02:19.420> light<00:02:19.600> black<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.500> absence

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
in terms of light black is the absence

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.320 
in terms of light black is the absence
of<00:02:20.950> color<00:02:21.010> because<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.549> absorbs<00:02:21.670> all<00:02:22.060> light

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
of color because it absorbs all light

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.420 
of color because it absorbs all light
that's<00:02:22.780> why<00:02:22.989> solar<00:02:23.290> panels<00:02:23.769> as<00:02:23.920> well<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.280> our

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
that's why solar panels as well as our

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.360 
that's why solar panels as well as our
pal<00:02:24.640> heliolisk<00:02:25.150> are<00:02:25.360> black<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:26.350> just<00:02:26.980> good

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
pal heliolisk are black it's just good

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.120 
pal heliolisk are black it's just good
science<00:02:28.150> oh<00:02:28.390> yeah<00:02:28.989> plus<00:02:29.440> black<00:02:29.739> emits<00:02:30.040> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
science oh yeah plus black emits the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.560 
science oh yeah plus black emits the
most<00:02:30.280> heat<00:02:30.549> just<00:02:30.970> think<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.209> heat<00:02:31.360> waves

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
most heat just think of heat waves

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.789 
most heat just think of heat waves
coming<00:02:31.810> off<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.110> an<00:02:32.230> asphalt

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
coming off of an asphalt

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.890 
coming off of an asphalt
heliolisk<00:02:33.580> splat<00:02:34.000> frill<00:02:34.330> absorbs<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> most

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
heliolisk splat frill absorbs the most

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.690 
heliolisk splat frill absorbs the most
energy<00:02:35.110> keeping<00:02:35.590> him<00:02:35.769> cool<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.400> warm

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
energy keeping him cool in the warm

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.910 
energy keeping him cool in the warm
desert<00:02:37.000> environment<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.750> that's<00:02:38.410> just<00:02:38.680> good

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
desert environment and that's just good

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.340 
desert environment and that's just good
science<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:39.760> for<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.540> record<00:02:40.810> that's<00:02:40.989> why<00:02:41.200> we

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
science and for the record that's why we

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.569 
science and for the record that's why we
see<00:02:41.530> things<00:02:41.680> in<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.890> colors<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.190> they<00:02:42.400> are

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
see things in the colors that they are

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.039 
see things in the colors that they are
and<00:02:42.820> why<00:02:42.940> white<00:02:43.180> stuff<00:02:43.420> doesn't<00:02:43.660> do<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.019> well

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
and why white stuff doesn't do so well

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.539 
and why white stuff doesn't do so well
in<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.350> desert<00:02:44.680> just<00:02:44.829> imagine<00:02:45.370> what<00:02:45.489> would

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
in the desert just imagine what would

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.009 
in the desert just imagine what would
happen<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.850> poor<00:02:46.030> Bear<00:02:46.239> tick<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.870> bad

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
happen to poor Bear tick it's a bad

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.910 
happen to poor Bear tick it's a bad
situation<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:47.829> it's<00:02:47.980> just<00:02:48.190> good<00:02:48.459> science

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
situation but it's just good science

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.979 

wow<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.280> was<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:52.760> interesting<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.540> almost

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
wow that was so interesting and almost

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.180 
wow that was so interesting and almost
covered<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.260> stop<00:02:54.440> thinking<00:02:54.620> about<00:02:54.709> omega

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
covered to stop thinking about omega

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.650 
covered to stop thinking about omega
ruby<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.459> alpha<00:02:55.610> sapphire<00:02:55.790> for<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> few

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
seconds oh my god hey hey that's enough

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.160 
seconds oh my god hey hey that's enough
of<00:03:02.870> that

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
of that

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.630
