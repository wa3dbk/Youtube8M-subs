00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.910 
so okay let's hope this load before my
camera<00:04:10.580> memory<00:04:11.480> decides<00:04:11.990> to<00:04:12.140> die<00:04:12.290> out<00:04:12.320> again

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:24.460 

but<00:04:15.920> yet<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:16.880> pretty<00:04:17.209> neat

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:34.570 

okay<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:25.520> there's<00:04:26.390> my<00:04:26.570> racer

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.760 

lucky<00:04:35.580> but<00:04:36.000> you'll<00:04:36.240> get<00:04:36.360> useful

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.970 

it's<00:04:39.770> kind<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.129> same<00:04:40.370> thing

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.370 

I<00:04:44.980> would<00:04:45.490> recommend<00:04:45.850> using<00:04:46.240> me<00:04:46.540> like<00:04:46.570> lots<00:04:47.260> of

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
I would recommend using me like lots of

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.440 
I would recommend using me like lots of
controller<00:04:47.770> for<00:04:48.010> this<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.430> don't<00:04:49.120> have<00:04:49.390> a

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
controller for this I don't have a

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.080 
controller for this I don't have a
classic<00:04:49.960> controller<00:04:50.350> so<00:04:50.790> that's<00:04:51.790> why<00:04:52.030> it

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
classic controller so that's why it

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.410 
classic controller so that's why it
wasn't<00:04:52.330> working<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:54.370> thing<00:04:54.580> is<00:04:54.610> you<00:04:54.940> know<00:04:55.060> you
