a<00:00:13.679> PlayStation<00:00:14.570> guy<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.490> controller

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
a PlayStation guy with a controller

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.790 
a PlayStation guy with a controller
against<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.270> mouse<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.660> keyboard<00:00:18.810> was<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.529> it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
against a mouse and keyboard was that it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.260 
against a mouse and keyboard was that it
was<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> novelty<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.820> what<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.060> thought

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
was just a novelty to do what I thought

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.700 
was just a novelty to do what I thought
about<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.080> see<00:00:22.230> how<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.590> would

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
about I just like to see how that would

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.019 
about I just like to see how that would
actually<00:00:22.740> play<00:00:23.220> out<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.760> then<00:00:23.939> they

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
actually play out but then they

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759 
actually play out but then they
eventually<00:00:24.180> took<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.990> out<00:00:25.109> they<00:00:25.260> said<00:00:25.470> you

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
eventually took it out they said you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.380 
eventually took it out they said you
know<00:00:25.890> what<00:00:26.099> we<00:00:26.580> know<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.910> won't<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.300> work

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
know what we know that won't really work

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.169 
know what we know that won't really work
so<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.470> came<00:00:28.619> out<00:00:28.740> yesterday<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.070> decided<00:00:29.340> well

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
so it came out yesterday I decided well

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.849 
so it came out yesterday I decided well
I'm<00:00:30.660> gonna<00:00:30.779> make<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.170> own<00:00:31.199> version<00:00:31.590> of

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
I'm gonna make my own version of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
I'm gonna make my own version of
cross-platform<00:00:32.610> play<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.420> see<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:33.840> would

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
cross-platform play and see what would

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.840 
cross-platform play and see what would
have<00:00:34.140> happened<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.010> world<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.430> they<00:00:35.670> had

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
have happened in a world that they had

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.340 
have happened in a world that they had
not<00:00:36.120> taken<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> segment

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
not taken it out of this is the segment

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.340 
not taken it out of this is the segment
were<00:00:40.559> calling<00:00:40.590> cross<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.640> X's<00:00:42.059> platform<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
were calling cross with X's platform and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.390 
were calling cross with X's platform and
I<00:00:43.590> should

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.370 

here's<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.550> first<00:00:47.670> video<00:00:47.880> and<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.630> me

here's the first video and it's me

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.010 
here's the first video and it's me
playing<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.830> a<00:00:49.860> PC<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.580> an<00:00:50.760> Xbox<00:00:51.000> 360<00:00:51.600> gamepad

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
playing on a PC with an Xbox 360 gamepad

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.410 
playing on a PC with an Xbox 360 gamepad
tried<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.250> few<00:00:53.580> servers<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.180> wouldn't

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
tried to a few servers and I wouldn't

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.420 
tried to a few servers and I wouldn't
even<00:00:54.510> let<00:00:54.690> me<00:00:54.750> move<00:00:55.050> which<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.650> good<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.190> some

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
even let me move which is good now some

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.880 
even let me move which is good now some
servers<00:00:56.790> actually<00:00:57.300> disable<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.930> playing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
servers actually disable you playing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.080 
servers actually disable you playing
with<00:00:59.040> a<00:00:59.070> controller<00:00:59.190> yeah<00:00:59.580> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:00:59.880> I<00:00:59.940> only

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
with a controller yeah I think I only

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.520 
with a controller yeah I think I only
read<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.450> in<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:00.600> forum<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.080> something<00:01:01.350> it's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
read that in a forum or something it's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.260 
read that in a forum or something it's
not<00:01:01.860> I<00:01:02.040> think<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.430> true<00:01:02.670> there's<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> button

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
not I think it's true there's a button

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.780 
not I think it's true there's a button
that<00:01:04.050> allows<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.440> do<00:01:04.559> 180s<00:01:05.100> oh<00:01:05.250> okay<00:01:05.729> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that allows you to do 180s oh okay so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.760 
that allows you to do 180s oh okay so
that's<00:01:06.000> how<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.360> let<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.660> turn<00:01:06.840> quick<00:01:07.260> it's

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that's how they let you turn quick it's

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.930 
that's how they let you turn quick it's
still<00:01:08.010> kind<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> slow<00:01:08.520> though

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
still kind of slow though

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.120 
still kind of slow though
yeah<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:09.660> still<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.140> still<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.650> lot<00:01:10.860> slower

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
yeah I'm still a it's still a lot slower

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.340 
yeah I'm still a it's still a lot slower
than<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> high-sensitivity<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:13.260> then

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
than like a high-sensitivity and then

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
than like a high-sensitivity and then
you<00:01:13.410> just<00:01:13.619> spin<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> mouse<00:01:16.970> yeah<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> mean

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you just spin the mouse yeah I mean

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.820 
you just spin the mouse yeah I mean
right<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.630> you're<00:01:19.350> getting<00:01:19.440> shot<00:01:19.740> from

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
right there you're getting shot from

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.920 
right there you're getting shot from

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
normal you kind of have to retrain

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.940

man<00:03:42.040> he<00:03:42.310> just<00:03:42.490> like<00:03:42.640> dominates<00:03:43.330> these<00:03:43.750> these

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
man he just like dominates these these

man he just like dominates these these
matches<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.760> can<00:03:45.910> see<00:03:46.150> by<00:03:46.300> like

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
matches and that you can see by like

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.570 
matches and that you can see by like
just<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.080> way<00:03:47.110> he<00:03:47.380> moves<00:03:47.620> compared<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.250> sort

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
just the way he moves compared to sort

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.610 
just the way he moves compared to sort
of<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.760> previous<00:03:49.150> video<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.660> way<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:50.380> the

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
of the previous video the way that the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.800 
of the previous video the way that the
screen<00:03:50.890> moves<00:03:51.070> it's<00:03:51.250> yeah<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.360> can<00:03:52.510> see<00:03:52.690> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
screen moves it's yeah you can see the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.220 
screen moves it's yeah you can see the
decision<00:03:53.320> I<00:03:54.480> mean<00:03:55.480> should<00:03:55.750> this<00:03:55.870> be<00:03:56.050> like

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
decision I mean should this be like

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.140 
decision I mean should this be like
regulated<00:03:56.950> in<00:03:57.100> any<00:03:57.220> way<00:03:57.460> or<00:03:57.730> can<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.120> just

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
regulated in any way or can you just

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.000 
regulated in any way or can you just
well<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.810> guess<00:03:58.959> they<00:03:59.140> could<00:03:59.440> do<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.770> they

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
well I guess they could do that they

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.890 
well I guess they could do that they
could<00:04:00.310> do<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.459> thing<00:04:00.910> that<00:04:01.270> they<00:04:01.600> had<00:04:01.750> with

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
could do that thing that they had with

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.600 
could do that thing that they had with
the<00:04:01.989> PC<00:04:02.320> where<00:04:02.500> like<00:04:02.709> they<00:04:02.830> might<00:04:02.980> disable<00:04:03.550> the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
the PC where like they might disable the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.010 
the PC where like they might disable the
controller<00:04:03.940> but<00:04:04.209> like<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.480> opposite<00:04:04.870> way

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
controller but like the opposite way

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.660 
controller but like the opposite way
where<00:04:05.290> servers<00:04:05.709> disabled<00:04:06.250> master<00:04:06.489> people

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
where servers disabled master people

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.250 
where servers disabled master people
look<00:04:09.670> at<00:04:09.790> mean<00:04:10.090> these<00:04:10.300> shots<00:04:10.690> where<00:04:10.900> he's<00:04:11.020> just

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
look at mean these shots where he's just

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.800 
look at mean these shots where he's just
yeah<00:04:11.680> he's<00:04:12.160> just<00:04:12.220> standing<00:04:12.580> there<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.600> guys

turned a corner and he's dead I can't
react<00:04:25.510> fast<00:04:25.540> enough<00:04:26.169> I<00:04:26.410> think<00:04:27.010> these

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
react fast enough I think these

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.159 
react fast enough I think these
long-range<00:04:27.370> shots<00:04:27.820> he's<00:04:27.970> lining<00:04:28.150> up<00:04:28.330> yeah<00:04:28.810> so

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
long-range shots he's lining up yeah so

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.750 
long-range shots he's lining up yeah so
perfect<00:04:29.560> on<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.800> mouse<00:04:29.919> like<00:04:30.160> easy<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.580> do

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
perfect on the mouse like easy to do

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.760 
perfect on the mouse like easy to do
impossible<00:04:31.690> with<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.870> joypad<00:04:31.990> well<00:04:32.560> if<00:04:32.680> it

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
impossible with the joypad well if it

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.310 
impossible with the joypad well if it
was<00:04:33.550> like<00:04:34.120> like<00:04:34.450> no<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.690> would<00:04:34.870> have<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.080> line

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
was like like no you would have to line

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.320 
was like like no you would have to line
it<00:04:35.350> up<00:04:35.500> by<00:04:35.830> strafing<00:04:36.220> as<00:04:36.550> if<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:36.760> divergence

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
it up by strafing as if a divergence

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.700 
it up by strafing as if a divergence
there's<00:04:38.050> probably<00:04:38.260> people<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.500> are<00:04:38.620> pretty

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
there's probably people that are pretty

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.560 
there's probably people that are pretty
good<00:04:38.830> at<00:04:39.040> them<00:04:39.310> I'm<00:04:39.640> sure<00:04:39.730> there<00:04:40.090> are<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:40.390> I

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
good at them I'm sure there are but I

good at them I'm sure there are but I
would<00:04:41.230> challenge<00:04:41.590> like<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.490> best<00:04:43.350> controller

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
would challenge like the best controller

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.430 
would challenge like the best controller
player<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:45.100> play<00:04:45.310> on<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.850> PC<00:04:46.210> server<00:04:46.419> and<00:04:47.080> see

I hope to see more of these sort of like

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.480 
I hope to see more of these sort of like
scientific<00:05:03.350> comparisons<00:05:04.010> maybe<00:05:04.220> in<00:05:04.400> the

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
scientific comparisons maybe in the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.600
