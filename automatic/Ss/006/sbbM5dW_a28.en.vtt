00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello very good to all I am maximum and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.040
 we are here in a new video that you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.649
 do with line I'm with pound in fort 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.269
 eye on the military base attentive eye and 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.980
 attentive to the maneuver that I'm going to do 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.230
 I'm learning to manage the leader to 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.299
 look look look look change 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.850
 I put the reactors in helicopter mode and 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.680
 already take rich rich acrobatics that just 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.350
 of doing good you are seeing that this 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.570
 military base in the east hangar that there was 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.830
 before this was not open and I 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.390
 he realized now that it is open 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.920
 I guess the new update will be 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 to do something here later in the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.360
 way of the blows and such it is worth just 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.040
 to go down I have left flying less badly than 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.140
 a dead man I was looking at opening the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.969
 doors and see if I was with 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.100
 something and the truth that all the doors 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.530
 are closed above only the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.730
 roof and there is nothing normal 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.420
 can choose weapons there is absolutely no 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.649
 nothing 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690
 I was also watching a game of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 death if you are in free mode 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.280
 tell me that against good digital 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.170
 I hope not to find the typical 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.890
 found jetpack because not here is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.890
 the current iev 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.300
 I also had come here running for 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.180
 find the jetpack but the truth is 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.800
 I did not find anything anything normal 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.050
 as I say I was trying to open the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.940
 doors and trying to move around here 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.130
 but there is absolutely nothing the most 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.900
 normal what what I suppose will be 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.520
 this is because it is open and such will be 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.470
 some emission later or 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.210
 simply by further expanding the map and 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.800
 have more content as I say if 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.600
 find something here in free mode or 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.580
 something less able to explore comments or 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.380
 leave us by twitter small often 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.750
 hit me I just give fine ridge and 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.770
 free I just got to meet some like 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.420
 serious side 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.640
 good here with stretching hitting shots and 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.770
 with kicks he opened the doors and 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.880
 such and nothing there is absolutely nothing not 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.530
 I will know nothing and I stayed a little I do not know with 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.540
 More taste in my mouth I do not know why this 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.910
 is open something for some reason has 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.260
 to be open not just because 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.119
 if I already tell you that it has to be some 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.530
 mission or some nonsense to the best 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.119
 when we come in free mode 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.950
 this is where the hydra is and we can 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.170
 catch like we can catch the fighter and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.910
 I do not know that you can enter the mode 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.160
 free and take a look then now 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.340
 I would really appreciate it if you give me a picture 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.500
 twitter 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.240
 a mention and sometimes process what there is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.789
 around here maybe I'm the one 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.189
 jetpack and if you send me a picture with him 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.469
 I also found other things 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.930
 pretty curious here I did not find 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:18.189
 absolutely more nothing I suppose here 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.890
 something will have to be done with some mission 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.540
 then I went to the control tower of 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.329
 force zancudo also from this base 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.790
 military exactly here flipas like 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.959
 landed the Danish leader and I am given 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.209
 pretty good, we have the door 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.530
 open and before this door then 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.420
 it was closed you have to click 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.489
 to get up to enter here had to 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.720
 do a lot of weird things now 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.280
 the doors are normal and current 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.329
 open do not have to do any tricks 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.720
 neither gray nor nothing is all totally 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.879
 open 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.919
 access is open for all 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.659
 world here is an elevator that although 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:53.310
 back inside is pretty funny because 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:55.450
 If you walk in and the doors close as 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.760
 it does not take you anywhere because the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.290
 elevators still do not work in 7 to 5 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.299
 so you have to use the stairs 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.069
 when you get to the top of the 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.980
 control tower as we are 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.109
 with a room with four chairs four or 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.840
 five chairs I do not know how many there are but the 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.370
 thing is that everything can be moved everything is 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.050
 can break fire 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.510
 now shot 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.890
 the computer screen and it will break 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.960
 all the chairs and everything moves 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.210
 completely then there are other stairs 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.010
 more that can go up and let's say that this 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.490
 is the surveillance area of ​​the tower 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.960
 control 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.540
 this is where you have to ask for permission 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.250
 when you are going to land something with something not 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.330
 are you going to use an airplane or something here 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.620
 is where you have to ask for permission if there 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.700
 some open track and such good 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.920
 from here is where 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.080
 it was from here where you have to 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.300
 allow access allowed access 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.160
 just denied and there is nothing good 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.959
 guys this has been all the hidden area 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.730
 new that they have opened of the hangar and with 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.430
 this pretty cinematic that I appear 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.739
 with the leader so in plan that happens to 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.630
 I'm going to kill you, mate, I say goodbye 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.430
