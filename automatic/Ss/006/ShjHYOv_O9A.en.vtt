00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 about 6% of workers in Brazil 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.649
 sell credit cards 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.540
 food and meal but for the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.849
 legislation in force 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.580
 considered a crime subject to dismissal 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.279

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.810
 sell or buy 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.880
 The law requires that cards be 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.880
 used by the employee for the purpose of 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.250
 food or meal only 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.529
 I have to use because I have family. 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.750
 So the food is not home. 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.480
 shop and meal and to show 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.620
 but not always what happens in several 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.660
 parts of the country 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.790
 the credits made available the cards 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.739
 are exchanged for money in the region 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.360
 our team was 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.879
 to this restaurant that according to 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 the clients make the purchase of credits 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.809
 this administrative assistant who 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.760
 Prefer not to identify yourself explains how 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.879
 is made the sale is not the first time that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.449
 I sell my food order to 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.850
 facilitated because they usually have some 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.879
 some establishments that do not 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.760
 receive the card so I sell because 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.760
 I keep money in hand for some 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.650
 accounts of daily expenses are not 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.869
 restaurant employee who buys the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.939
 benefits did not want to record interview and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.350
 denied that the sale of the vouchers is made here 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.689
 meal and food 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 but according to customers this is a 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.020
 common practice 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.119
 this receptionist who also did not want 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.830
 if you identify account that every month 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.110
 will the store sell the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.189
 benefits uses the money to pay the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.369
 month accounts 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.939
 For three months I've been selling a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.100
 ticket to use the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.350
 money in other things right? 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.570
 the numbers draw attention according to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.759
 with this labor lawyer throughout the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 country about 6% of workers 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.710
 adopt the same practice and can be 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.360
 dismissed for just cause becomes difficult 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.960
 supervision of this type of 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.540
 act 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.930
 the law prohibits this type of transfer 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.180
 benefits because the benefit of the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.740
 meal is for the worker who 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.530
 receives benefit only he can 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.560
 use the company that provides the benefit 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.989
 if she is aware that you have the job 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.930
 is misrepresenting the use of this 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.560
 selling to get value in 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.080
 money 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.790
 this may constitute serious misconduct may 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.610
 have at home in the invention for just cause 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.380
 the streets do not all know that the sale 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.590
 and the purchase of the credits is a crime 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.530
 I did not know the size but I never thought 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.410
 To do this I do not even use to feed 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.610
 At lunch, all you know is that way. 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.269
 It was a secret to nobody that this 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.080
 happens 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.239
 the mother program is the mother who uses you 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.030

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.799

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.380
 buy in the market can this lawyer 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.819
 criminalist explains that in this case the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.069

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.170
 estelionato and a merchant for crime 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.330
 although it is a practice 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.030
 everyday is criminal 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.360
 It is good to say that the sale of 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.950
 Valley meal credits is crime is who 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.680
