00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hello everyone, Iâ€™m an angel killer and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.690
 us next release of the brothers program 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.780
 arms recently played in a platoon consisting 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.480
 from object 140 bochata and you are 62 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.300
 we hit the south coast map on this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.699
 map a lot of trips the first thing 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.020
 we could do it about rashi kerrick but 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.060
 this is now a bad option 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.820
 and was an opponent a lot etc. on which 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.650
 there we could meet and crush could 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.590
 fly into the center and there impose 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.290
 shootout but under four artam there 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.059
 you should n't go too 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.610
 germinate the zero line but again 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.170
 don't know who you will meet there so we 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.300
 decided to use more carefully 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.329
 option and first shoot from base 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.000
 namely, from the square c 6 for those who will be 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.980
 go to the center of anar batchat immediately 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 went to e0 to shoot at 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.019
 central tank assembly 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.300
 then a little damage in the center highlighted 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.519
 waited for the stone and decided 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.010
 spread to zero and stand here 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.100
 it was already stupid because it did not glow 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.229
 same foch 155 which is from square a6 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.940
 could easily shoot us also mouth 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.000
 the enemy was too likely 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.420
 already reduced to us therefore we are offended 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.580
 and gone walnut tastes pivotal we noticed 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.510
 that in our opinion, the e100 from below goes very 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.150
 a lot of his pressure soon had to 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.170
 and but we decided to help him first with 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.880
 position at 9 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.380
 but realizing that the shooting is not just 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.900
 turned around and went straight 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.340
 opponents 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.520
 burst rang let it out Isa 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.520
 the third 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.060
 so they just finished them off focusing on 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.060
 e100 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.520
 not understood 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.490
 he caught fire someone went to the hangar before 44 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.290
 did not live long 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.149
 and at that moment they just killed our 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.369
 batchat and which remained there to 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.790
 cover us up but two rushed in 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.819
 dozens and finished him off 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.980
 I climbed a little up the hill and I finished 5 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.440
 Now the question was what to do and we 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.319
 decided to go kill arta for a start but 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.359
 here we had a surprise in the form of the XXI century 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.389
 hevik stood in the open field and his 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:30.370
 murder was not against but here we are 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.950
 created made a little cipher she 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.709
 put on the patti of the century and counted the whole 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.450
 drum I successfully put the x century on 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.739
 caterpillar and kept until our 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.540
 weave did not drive up and did not give him damage in 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.719
 principle of the x century probably better punches 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.879
 I think under the tower in the cheeks and in the NLD 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.879
 you have a higher chance to blow up his ammunition 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.550
 the sirens began howling I decided to go 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.660
 to save the base Orense decided to kill the arta 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.080
 so that she does not shoot at the defenders 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.080
 situation 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.600
 using our art is very easy 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.600
 one per city invaders 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.950
 I already had five frags victory was 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.360
 in my pocket i just went for t 69 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.360
 hopes to take the warriors 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:54.820
 lucky that the allies did not become here 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:57.990
 clean up and I took some more or far let's 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.420
 let's go to the results of this fight 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.210
 as you see here they gave me the first 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.670
 degree warrior with defender core 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.100
 caliber and several smaller awards 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.670
 if we go to the team tab 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.280
 result 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.470
 then we will see that our platoon thanks 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.310
 competent actions and positions inflicted 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.890
 a lot of damage namely 11500 units 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.510
 on this i have all subscribe to our 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.910
