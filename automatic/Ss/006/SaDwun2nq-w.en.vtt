00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
from the plane but plot twist you don't

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.840 
from the plane but plot twist you don't
want<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.710> make<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.100> into<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> building<00:01:56.820> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the building and this is a very crucial

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.870 
the building and this is a very crucial
part<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.130> need<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> make<00:02:02.460> sure<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> you

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
part you need to make sure that you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.030 
part you need to make sure that you
smack<00:02:03.270> into<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.719> exact<00:02:04.200> same<00:02:04.439> pixels<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
smack into the exact same pixels that I

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.700 
smack into the exact same pixels that I
do<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.899> you<00:02:06.899> need<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.350> sure<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.619> you

do and you need to make sure that you

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
do and you need to make sure that you
die<00:02:08.009> before<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:09.030> hit<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.239> ground<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.869> is

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
die before you hit the ground that is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.890 
die before you hit the ground that is
very<00:02:10.349> important

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
very important

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.479 
very important
all<00:02:12.900> right<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.379> next<00:02:13.409> step<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.430> need

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
all right so the next step is you need

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.089 
all right so the next step is you need
to<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.970> city<00:02:15.360> bus<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:16.049> as<00:02:16.830> you're<00:02:17.010> going

kill all three of them sometimes this

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.470 
kill all three of them sometimes this
could<00:03:16.470> be<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> little<00:03:16.829> tricky<00:03:17.160> because<00:03:17.419> by<00:03:18.419> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
could be a little tricky because by the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.610 
could be a little tricky because by the
time<00:03:18.510> they<00:03:18.720> see<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.959> pull<00:03:19.139> out<00:03:19.169> your<00:03:19.380> grenade

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
launcher they start to run away and the

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.839 
launcher they start to run away and the
grenade<00:03:22.290> can<00:03:22.769> detonate<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.250> time<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.549> kill<00:03:23.730> all

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849

grenade can detonate in time to kill all
three<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.090> them<00:03:24.329> but<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.750> time<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:24.989> did<00:03:28.549> yes<00:03:29.549> so

and then after you do that you turn your
console<00:04:19.830> off<00:04:25.490> this<00:04:26.490> next<00:04:26.760> step<00:04:26.970> is<00:04:27.180> quick<00:04:27.510> but

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
console off this next step is quick but

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.670 
console off this next step is quick but
it<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.470> also<00:04:28.740> crucial<00:04:29.180> so<00:04:30.180> after<00:04:31.140> you<00:04:31.200> put<00:04:31.350> GTA

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
it is also crucial so after you put GTA

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.920 
it is also crucial so after you put GTA
5<00:04:31.920> back<00:04:32.160> in<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.970> need<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.150> get<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.360> friend<00:04:33.690> and

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
5 back in you need to get a friend and

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.110 
5 back in you need to get a friend and
he<00:04:34.050> needs<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.320> stand<00:04:34.590> there<00:04:34.920> and<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.910> need<00:04:36.000> to

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
he needs to stand there and you need to

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.510 
he needs to stand there and you need to
get<00:04:36.270> into<00:04:36.420> it<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.110> high<00:04:37.680> vantage<00:04:38.040> point

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
get into it like a high vantage point

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.750 
get into it like a high vantage point
and<00:04:38.880> you<00:04:39.330> need<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.600> no<00:04:39.900> scoped<00:04:40.260> in<00:04:40.640> with<00:04:41.640> the

be wearing the bulletproof helmet this

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.350 
be wearing the bulletproof helmet this
is<00:04:46.320> probably<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:46.980> of<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.160> most<00:04:47.430> it's

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
is probably one of the most it's

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.820 
is probably one of the most it's
probably<00:04:48.630> one<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.870> most<00:04:49.020> difficult<00:04:49.200> parts

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
probably one of the most difficult parts

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.700 
probably one of the most difficult parts
of<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.160> Easter<00:04:50.490> Egg<00:04:50.670> but<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:51.930> possible<00:04:52.170> as
