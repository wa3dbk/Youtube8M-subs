00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
want to show you the basic patterns

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.640 
want to show you the basic patterns
which<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> dot<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.380> heart

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
which is the dot and the heart

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.859 
which is the dot and the heart
everything<00:00:29.580> starts<00:00:30.150> from<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.420> dot<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
everything starts from the dot and the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.749 
everything starts from the dot and the
heart<00:00:31.109> from<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> even<00:00:31.980> progressed<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.579> make

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
heart from the even progressed to make

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.870 
heart from the even progressed to make
any<00:00:33.059> other<00:00:33.420> free<00:00:34.110> form<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.680> free<00:00:34.950> pour<00:00:35.250> style

any other free form or free pour style
of<00:00:35.969> latte<00:00:36.360> art<00:00:36.570> whether<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> Rosetta

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
of latte art whether it be a Rosetta

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.270 
of latte art whether it be a Rosetta
double<00:00:38.550> Rosetta<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.239> tulip<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:40.920> stem

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
double Rosetta a tulip they all stem

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.369 
double Rosetta a tulip they all stem
from<00:00:41.430> those<00:00:41.640> two<00:00:41.969> basic<00:00:42.239> patterns<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.290> I'm

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
from those two basic patterns so I'm

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
from those two basic patterns so I'm
going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.590> show<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.860> those<00:00:44.070> today<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.670> let's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
going to show you those today so let's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.639 
going to show you those today so let's
get<00:00:45.210> started<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.629> an<00:00:45.750> espresso<00:00:46.050> shot<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
get started with an espresso shot and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.360 
get started with an espresso shot and
we'll<00:00:46.800> work<00:00:47.010> from<00:00:47.160> there<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> now<00:00:50.010> we've<00:00:50.160> dosed

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
we'll work from there so now we've dosed

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.740 
we'll work from there so now we've dosed
our<00:00:50.550> Porta<00:00:50.879> filter<00:00:50.910> we're<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
our Porta filter we're just going to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.439 
our Porta filter we're just going to
extract<00:00:52.079> our<00:00:52.289> spresso<00:00:52.670> at<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> same<00:00:54.000> time<00:00:54.270> our

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
extract our spresso at the same time our

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
extract our spresso at the same time our
espresso<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> extracting<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.890> start

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
espresso is extracting we can start

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.939 
espresso is extracting we can start
texturing<00:00:56.489> our<00:00:56.760> milk<00:00:57.410> I've<00:00:58.410> got<00:00:58.620> our<00:00:58.739> milk

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
texturing our milk I've got our milk

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.799 
texturing our milk I've got our milk
temperature<00:00:59.430> set<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.820> 60<00:01:00.210> degrees

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
temperature set at 60 degrees

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.959 
temperature set at 60 degrees
that's<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.469> personal<00:01:01.920> preference<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.940> I

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that's just a personal preference but I

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.340 
that's just a personal preference but I
recommend<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.690> your<00:01:03.960> milk

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
recommend that you have your milk

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
recommend that you have your milk
temperature<00:01:04.500> set<00:01:04.949> somewhere<00:01:05.309> between<00:01:05.460> 60<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
temperature set somewhere between 60 and

temperature set somewhere between 60 and
65<00:01:06.810> degrees

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
65 degrees

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.679 
65 degrees
never<00:01:08.010> over<00:01:08.220> heat<00:01:08.580> your<00:01:08.729> milk<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.570> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
never over heat your milk because it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.690 
never over heat your milk because it
damages<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> delicate<00:01:10.799> proteins<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> milk

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
damages the delicate proteins and milk

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.380 
damages the delicate proteins and milk
solids<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.689> affects<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> tape<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
solids and that affects the tape so a

milks<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:15.869> 60<00:01:16.229> degrees<00:01:16.909> all<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.970> need<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.509> now

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
milks at 60 degrees all I need to do now

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.020 
milks at 60 degrees all I need to do now
is<00:01:18.840> why<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> steam<00:01:19.439> wand<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:21.270> tip

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.980 

just<00:01:25.030> going<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.240> tap<00:01:25.540> down<00:01:25.750> on<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.020> jug<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
just going to tap down on the jug and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.300 
just going to tap down on the jug and
then<00:01:29.140> I'm<00:01:29.259> going<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.409> swirl<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.860> integrate<00:01:30.280> our

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
then I'm going to swirl to integrate our

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.940 
then I'm going to swirl to integrate our
texture<00:01:32.909> grab<00:01:33.909> my<00:01:34.090> espresso<00:01:34.360> shot<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.170> then

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
texture grab my espresso shot and then

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.380 
texture grab my espresso shot and then
just<00:01:36.159> swirl<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.640> break<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.970> surface<00:01:37.180> tension

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
just swirl to break the surface tension

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.480 
just swirl to break the surface tension
of<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.810> espresso<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.590> then<00:01:39.220> I'm<00:01:39.310> going<00:01:39.460> to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
of the espresso and then I'm going to

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.870 
of the espresso and then I'm going to
pour<00:01:39.759> our<00:01:40.030> milk<00:01:40.630> directly<00:01:41.610> right<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
pour our milk directly right in the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.480 
pour our milk directly right in the
center<00:01:43.210> of<00:01:43.299> our<00:01:43.420> spresso<00:01:44.310> integrating<00:01:45.310> the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
center of our spresso integrating the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.359 
center of our spresso integrating the
crema<00:01:46.090> with<00:01:46.659> our<00:01:46.810> milk<00:01:47.049> pour<00:01:47.740> straight<00:01:48.159> into

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
crema with our milk pour straight into

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.399 
crema with our milk pour straight into
the<00:01:48.460> middle<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:48.880> there<00:01:49.479> we<00:01:49.570> have<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:49.990> really

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
the middle and there we have it a really

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.350 
the middle and there we have it a really
nice<00:01:50.560> dot<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.220> basic<00:01:51.640> pattern<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.119> all

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
nice dot the basic pattern of all
