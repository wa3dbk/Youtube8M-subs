00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 all right 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.090
 Welcome to online drawing today 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.250
 we will draw the face of the character 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.380
 number 18 in a three-quarter view 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.400
 before we saw the profile and the front 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.890
 step 1 and woman we have a circle the best 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.930
 that we can to this circle we will add 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.520
 a section about half the size 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.740
 of the radius of the circle as it looks 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.480
 then we draw a curved line from 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.520
 the center of the circle to a point 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.250
 slightly next to the center line 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.960
 that we draw this point will be the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 chin 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.610
 so we attach some lines to the chin 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.900
 curves that start from the circle and so on 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.680
 we finished the general shape of the head 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.750
 step 2 proportions we will draw 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.330
 slightly above the chin a 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.580
 line and above this three sections 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.650
 of the same size until the part of 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.680
 above the head in the first 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.930
 section we will draw the face more or 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.449
 less to the center of the face we draw the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.100
 tip of the nose following the line 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.840
 central of the face that we draw to the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.080
 beginning 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.910
 step 3 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.370
 now we will detail in black 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.400
 following the shape of the nose we trace 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.340
 eyebrows and below this we draw a 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.320
 eye slightly tilted when we saw 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.390
 face in front we explain the eye 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.980
 more details 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.690
 now we draw the edge of the face 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.300
 following the direction of the small 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.240
 arrows observe that the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.460
 original shape of the face we draw the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.280
 second eye which passes over the line 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.180
 center of the circle that can serve you 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.880
 as a reference to draw this eye 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.160
 the mouth is a very small line below 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 from the nose we also trace the ear 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.090
 pretty big more or less from the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.850
 height of the mouth to the height of the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.460
 eyebrows the neck part of the center of the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.500
 tip of the chin and is quite thin 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.500
 using the principle of the third 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.030
 section we draw the hair lines 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.400
 watch as a central line helps us 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.979
 to correctly locate the nose the eyes 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.080
 and now the hair line we draw 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.170
 the pupils and a line that will divide the 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.150
 two hair sections from 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.040
 this division we draw a curved line 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.020
 up to the side of the sideburns and another 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.239
 big curved line that will be the other 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.069
 section of the hair that rises and 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.660
 we trace the outer part of the hair 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.300
 that greatly increases the volume of your 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.739
 head to finish the general form 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.590
 of the face we add various details 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.959
 like the hair lines 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.599
 it remains for us to clean and detail our 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.780
 drawing we draw more lashes we draw 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.959
 a smile the hair one by one in this 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.910
 step we look for the best possible pulse 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.190
 we add color and we give our drawing 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.959
 by finished remember that the draw 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.930
 you must practice your characters in 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.280
 the greatest number of possible angles 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.440
 until next time and if you liked this 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.830
 video do not forget to share until the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.830
 next
