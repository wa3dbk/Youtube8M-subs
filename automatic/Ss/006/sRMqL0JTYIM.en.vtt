 hi kids in the yard 2015 and this 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.500

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.509
 one old game 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.490

 nb hits like spin and a mortal kombat 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.279
 then suddenly decided to create some 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.340
 hybrid 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.529
 a mixture of sport and fighting without rules 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.300
 American Riesling was perfect 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.939
 to implement such a plan 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.869
 having a hefty experience and what 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.630
 not unimportant 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.000
 excitement engaging specialists from both 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.010
 teams that had previously worked on 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.010
 dnb jam mk2 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.140

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 caught and forced to run jump and 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 swing fists against blue 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.539
 screen 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.789
 as with the mortal kombat, no 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.500
 drawn characters only real 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.840
 people are just hardcore 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.610
 only animation has been modified 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.540
 special attacks to impart yet 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.729

 high-quality recording of all the actors fighters 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.180
 allowed to create branded 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.140
 pleasing to the eye realistic graphics 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.479

 already the brainchild of the globally recognized mortal 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.650
 kombat arcade wrestling is not unique 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.170
 only their ring where players can 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.270
 move along the three axes of coordinates in 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.159
 unlike mortal kombat but 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 incredible drive compared to 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.619
 other games dedicated to peace and sling 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.830
 also unlike m to famous 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.960
 its cruelty times breaking 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.960
 remembered for its specific humor 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.920
 special attention deserve 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.890
 characters of the game just arcade was 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.650

 adam bombs was supposed to be secret and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.770
 hidden character in the game but by 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.660
 unknown reasons would never have been 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.150
 Deal at the time of the official release 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.910
 arcade and its digital version was 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.160
 mercilessly drunk possible machine 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.830
 just did not have enough free memory 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.810
 however, when reviewing a gameâ€™s build, you can 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.650
 notice a large number of empty 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.900
 slots for additional modules eprom 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.510
 few of the played mobbing learns 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.269
 that first row tickets got creator 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.510
 games and their friends and acquaintances 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.739
 rumored viewers 2 rows of relatives and 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.739
 developer friends 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.340
 in different versions of the game the audience is pretty 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.829
 The audience and the audience were relocated to 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.959
 place only march army chief 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.620
 the programmer has consistently remained in the center 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.620
 first row 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.620
 not all are used in the arcade 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.380
 soundtracks although they are already laid in 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.930
 memory fighters mostly use sounds 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.180
 novel or charter during the battle also have 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.460
 every fighter should have sounded 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.920
 special phrase in case of victory or 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.500
 for example getting into the ass is also not all 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.600
 know that the original arcade exists 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.020
 special finishing for the undertaker 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.040
 like fatalities in mortal kombat 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.590
 the undertaker is able to bury 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.690
 defeated opponent this finishing off is not 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.570
 available on all doctors version of the game 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.880
 obviously again the fault of all 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.710
 from memory initially developers 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.420
 planned to do the same 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.460
 finishing for each fighter 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.350
 but the federation hardly learned about it 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.859
 rosling developers had 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.320
 recommended not to do the original 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.180
 the game is pretty messed up sometimes 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.850
 totally hellish things 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.180
 if fish hang or even fly away 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.740
 forever from the ring blocks are punched 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.560
 unlockable combos are blocked and so 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.880
 etc. However, if some bugs and are able to 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.160
 cause irritation 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.740
 fruits vzlom not only can cheer 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.640
 but also used slyly no fights in 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.220
 insidious purposes 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.510
 like for example combination with plexes throw 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.800
 salts performed thickly set outside 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.870
 any doubt 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.879
 Russians have long been outdated by 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.159
 technical and graphic standards and 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.409
 quite able to upset band fans 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.990
 rally and lovers of 5 channel sound 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.330
 while the game firmly occupies one of 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.430
 high places ageless classics of the genre 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.430
 arcade and still not forgotten 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.720

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.770

 arcade gained fame in the middle 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.840
