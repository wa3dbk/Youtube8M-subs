America<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> States<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.440> costs

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
America in the States I think this costs

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069 
America in the States I think this costs
about<00:00:34.800> 30<00:00:35.280> bucks<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.760> Canada<00:00:36.600> right<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:36.870> it

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
about 30 bucks in Canada right now it

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.500 
about 30 bucks in Canada right now it
was<00:00:37.170> $35<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.370> definitely<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.149> full

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
was $35 so it's definitely not a full

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.869 
was $35 so it's definitely not a full
version<00:00:40.379> price<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> game<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.790> you're

websites<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.489> IGN<00:03:42.000> gave<00:03:42.030> nes<00:03:42.690> remix<00:03:42.900> 1<00:03:43.530> and

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
websites like IGN gave nes remix 1 and

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:44.810

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.210 
and they gave nes remix to something
like<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.790> 7.7<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.299> overall<00:03:48.570> this<00:03:48.930> pack<00:03:49.230> as<00:03:49.530> a
