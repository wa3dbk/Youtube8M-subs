box<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.569> finishing<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.260> really<00:02:25.530> effective<00:02:26.010> and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
box is finishing is really effective and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.130 
box is finishing is really effective and
when<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.849> comes<00:02:26.910> across<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:27.840> said<00:02:28.020> it's

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
crossing on each foot is absolutely

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.830 
crossing on each foot is absolutely
brilliant<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.120> only<00:02:30.239> feel<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.450> lets<00:02:30.569> him<00:02:30.690> down

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
brilliant the only feel it lets him down
