00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 good morning good sergio change 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.680
 number the 16 is accompanied during 24 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.309
 first seasons here but in this 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.230
 you change to 10 because it makes the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.510
 really good when I arrived here in the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.240
 city 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.230
 well no one had it weak but 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 obviously 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.910
 out of respect because he was here 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.760
 obviously he had to choose another number 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.270
 but because good I always liked the 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:36.680
 number 10 because in my club where I started 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.850
 always since I was a kid I put the 10 and good 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.640
 until I played first 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.940
 and then in the athletic one also on the 10th and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.620
 only here I change the number but 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.170
 good and now what 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.960
 He has gone to Rome 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.519
 was free and well I asked if I could 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.539
 grab the micro obviously the 16 with 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.670
 Omen behind his back has become 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.210
 almost already in an icon of the city ​​there will be 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.210
 to get used 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.090
 obviously 16 the truth that 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.290
 It was very very cute very nice number 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.900
 because I won 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.840
 2 premier and one that was crazy 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.620
 and the truth is that he is very happy with the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.020
 number because I think very well even 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.690
 your signature contained the number 16 you have already 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.480
 rehearsed the new one with day 2 and always 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.850
 equality my signature down I put the 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.820
 shit but 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.659
 but in the athletic one he put the 10 and the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.900
 20 also but the 16th in the selection the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.570
 11 and good and now and now again the 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:56.549
 day so if now it seems to me that the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.170
 that remains until I withdraw the prize 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.500
 is going to start this Monday for the site and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.090
 with him with the visit to west brom we are going to 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.530
 see the first goal with the 10 to the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.580
 t - shirt of the hour or in that party 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.370
 I hope God wants yes obviously what 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.040
 important that my goal or the goal of 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.470
 whoever is used to win not always 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.260
 I said that the goals are nice 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.140
 enjoy but also enjoy when 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.840
 when you win not and well hopefully 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.350
 let's win no matter who and what good 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.320
 obviously 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.570
 make much better last season 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.370
 dial this 26 with the 16 to the back that 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.890
 He has brought you great numbers during 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.120
 these four years here do you think that even 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.370
 with the day that is a special number 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.580
 for you that number could be increased 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.680
 may be able to govern another 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.680
 enthusiasm not but but there will not be 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.290
 I do not propose goal numbers but 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.810
 Well, I hope you can mark many 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.209
 if not people want me to come back another 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.040
 with the design what is impressive is 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.900
 looking at the numbers of the template 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.599
 think about how you can associate the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.969
 seven sterling on 21 silva and this new 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.129
 10 omen up because it is a promise 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:10.909
 of show yes good the truth that 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.500
 with the city sterling surely in what 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.950
 which is in the attack will improve 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.739
 very much is a great player and I think 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.799
 that will serve us a lot so hopefully 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.620
 not that this same Monday against the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.810
 west brom and let's do things well and what 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.340
 good that he can debut with a great 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.620
 acting and talking about numbers 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.150
 select a scale from 0 to 10 how 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.299
 you are seeing the team in these first 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.459
 weeks before everything starts good 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.730
 it's difficult not because the preseason does not 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.430
 it is easy not to take evaluation or the 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.370
 technical tries to test players 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.909
 try to test the scheme then 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.580
 there's not that much score to see if we're 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.129
 well we are human sometimes can be 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.140
 very bad and then weigh the league and start 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.580
 otherwise start very well and put 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.880
 you're well preseason and you start 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.030
 losing or is it either 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.860
 it's a number that needs to be put I think 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.690
 let's go well 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.750
 obviously the first league 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.330
 it's hard hard but but I think that 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.890
 We have experience so I do not think 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.360
 will go well in addition to the own 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.970
 fight will also be a season 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.590
 more in the champions last season 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.330
 We saw your good friend Leo Messi with a 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.750
 10 to the back also lift the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.330
 trophy you think we're going to see this 10 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.790
 any red - always I said 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.640
 that my idea always try to win the 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.850
 champions but the champions is difficult 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.650
 they are not the best teams in each country 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.810
 and there are great teams that have 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.200
 history we are new 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.520
 starting and good as I always said 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.400
 there are four years of contract 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.130
 I hope that in these four years in some 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.410
 of these four years can win the 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.710
 champions four years and it 's nothing 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.320
 weird because I wanted to change that is not that 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.810
 I do not like it says my nothing but good 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.480
 always from kids and surely the 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.320
 people get to check my history what 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.320
 I always used 10
