00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.070
 my people and welcome to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.080
 new video this is my old cell phone and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.610
 you see her down the journalist and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.440
 you just can not serve it anymore 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.260
 then I downloaded his 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.840
 with which one withdrawn again and again in Rome 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.140
 menu can go or like for example 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.140
 Here you go back so fringe but 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.240
 that's pretty annoying and that's why 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.450
 I ordered a new device that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.610
 old always pack away the new comes in 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.610
 picture that she arrived today 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.739
 I will box with you now and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.450
 I 'll unpack that, I 'll tell you 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.649
 ever before it will happen again 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.020
 that's the way you last 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.000
 made here at the cx 9 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.420
 it is unfortunately after two weeks 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.910
 use yes unhappy wonders 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 and that's why I have a new one 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.359
 is ordering now after somehow six 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.340
 months wait or so it will be now 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.220
 so that we run here today only times 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.720
 just do the unboxing because we now 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.840
 do 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.890
 and next week if we go then 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.299
 already had a bit in use 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.950
 then i will do a detailed test 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.950
 to do with you and explain everything to you 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 let it be so and if it is worth it 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.860
 it was already a 16 gb 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.940
 memory card and blood we open this 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.250
 whole package finally go on 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.070
 that is always the most exciting thing 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.350
 Looks like I think that sees it 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.020
 very good 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.030
 black view is an anonymous brand again 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.100
 I have to honestly say I have it 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.130
 also in black not in white water white 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.780
 okay that's the smartphone 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.280
 the most interesting one comes away too 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.410
 for me i see it yes gave the first one 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.920
 it's always difficult that's easy 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:10.179
 so to pack away but good man like 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.850
 is it here on such a 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.510
 Protective film supplied by the factory already 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.050
 times very practical because we have left 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.060
 in it 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.880
 a protective cover that was completely me 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.510
 important that I have a nice school 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.100
 that comes right around the whole thing 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.500
 smartphone boom is a bit now 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.640
 I must say clumsy though that sees 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:38.440
 actually quite nice and what is 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.230
 still included power supply quite normal 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.580
 here is also black you drop that had 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.830
 I just did not finish that 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.459
 thought this is such a in the china 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:52.050
 Brand cheap but of the quality 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:59.440
 I hope I hope I have a lot here 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:01.480
 included headphones york i think 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.670
 Soundwise, I can not do that right now 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.290
 expect a lot from 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.840
 but that will be alright quick start 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.510
 guide in a possible languages 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.510
 English and English 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.620
 be through again then yes here we have 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.639
 still the usb cable for the mobile phone 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.999
 I do not really have to anymore now 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:33.459
 show and a battery comes with 2200 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:35.769
 Milliampere therefore that 's it 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:42.269
 pretty neat in the old cell phone had 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:45.219
 i 1800 this is the smartphone 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.700
 smartphone is very good in the 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:50.349
 hand is not big what me now here 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.669
 is disturbing are these Chinese 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:58.090
 sign but good you have to 149 that is 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.769
 the price is 249 euro shipping 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.480
 Germany was here for two three days 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.129
 You also have to cut a few 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.590
 do and I think that is perfect 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.980
 OK 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:13.150
 october you can see eight cores with 17 each 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.189
 gigahertz clocked wifi 3g gps dual sim 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.669
 So I can install two SIM cards 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:22.090
 the front camera should have 5 megapixels 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.229
 the rear camera 13 and android 4.4 point 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:30.669
 2 and I can already see that it 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:31.870
 really well built is indeed looking 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.229
 Everything is fine 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:41.190
 I will insert the acura 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:43.960
 you open this here probably on the side yes 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.889
 well expected something more here before 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.320
 broken crusher 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:54.780
 but here you can read smaller opening 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.340
 slit then it goes off quite well 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.139
 Here comes the memory card purely here 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.680
 the first sim card the second sim card 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.360
 there is everything on it again and then 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.780
 I will the battery he to pretend 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.250
 pack my sim cards right away and yes 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.900
 then i would say im in the 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.310
 next video again when I get the phone 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.960

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.909

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.610
 turn on again as I said that 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.490

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.900

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:26.780

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.080
 cover exactly and the memory card is 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.240
