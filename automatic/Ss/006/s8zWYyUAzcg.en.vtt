00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.809
 and it's easy because we stick with the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.219
 arms and when we have arms to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.219
 we keep our legs 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.510
 we have underwater speakers below 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.110
 the pool that we listen to music 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.369
 just as we listen to it from the outside 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.410
 we have a secret a little secret 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.150
 that are the tweezers that with them do not 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.610
 water enters through the nose every time we 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.080
 we put upside down is not not a 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.880
 special makeup the truth is that 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.980
 we use any type of makeup 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.260
 not all pools are the same there 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.570
 some that are longer narrower 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.000
 higher less depth the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.110
 Depth depends on each pool we 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.110
 we have to adapt to them 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.110
 normally it takes a little while to comb 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.150
 we have to be good hair 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.270
 stretched out we miss gelatin which is 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.000
 fish tail that is for us to stay 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.630
 super party and I do not know what is with a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.580
 hair and the whole year is perfect 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.500
 it's a complicated question because it exists 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.240
 the modality is only but also duo and 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.720
 team where we all have to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.510
 empathize and you need the company of 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.600
 rest of your classmates 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.870
 I believe that technique is the main thing 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.540
 the first thing after, the swimsuit comes 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.390
 the cap the make-up putting on 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.010
 scene everything counts a bit but but 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.530
 it is clear that if you do not swim well and if not 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.220
 do things with technique do not you're not going to 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.220
 have score 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.580
 Well, the truth is that I keep all 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.560
 the medals in a box because I do not 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.650
 like to be bragging or having the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.170
 I do not have them, they are mine, they are 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.520
 medals not but what I'm left of each 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.520
 championship are the experiences 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.300
 Well, if not, the truth is that most 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.360
 decide we are not always young because 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.170
 you start very young you have to educate them in 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.099
 the water and train them from little ones 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.959
 the body endures a few years later and 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.959
 you have other concerns and probably 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.030
 My last challenge is Rio 2016
