00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.960
 and where is this a video for the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.230
 channel 23 is one 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.279
 in this video people nickname there of several 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.140
 enrolled 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.530
 I'll teach you how to do silas. 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.100
 coppio is a device that here to 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.110
 you use a pc ie whether you will use 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.080
 you are going to make an interface that 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.030
 I'll teach you how to do it 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.080
 it will measure waves that neither 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.450
 right here is to use both the 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:59.199
 desktop as in notebook 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.829
 ok it can be one channel or two 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.170
 channels 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.110
 I'll teach you how to do two channels is 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.390
 anyone who wants to opt for one also makes use of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.850
 a good warning here in this video he 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.009
 stay long or cut it will be fine 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.039
 from a youtube video 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.039
 Good people, you go. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:29.700
 the show is my camera that does not work today 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:31.770
 to see you're going to need us 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.829
 needed a piece of circuit board 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.829
 printed 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.479
 a cellulite printed circuit board 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.149
 This is for the people who work, you already know. 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.530
 work with the hob or even can 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.840
 cut it from here with a stylus or with 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.060
 meat the way you want it 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.350
 plate is very simple you will need 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:06.299
 a p2 pinhole mystery is thorn that is the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.729
 pin entering the microphone at the input 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:16.380
 the microphone or on that 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:20.870
 input the computer inside the p2 in 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:25.200
 of this piece that he is like this here 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:30.720
 is a big one here just to demonstrate the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.890
 single being earth or the channel one 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.660
 channel 2 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:41.430
 but so much does one in 2001 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:47.959
 within this plan will need people 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:51.030
 more or less than two meters of wire 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:59.239
 microphone is faithful that has wire mesh 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:59.239
 Toasted calls has no means 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:09.209
 electronic will have a wire to wire 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:13.579
 he has a microphone that means you 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:19.079
 loses microphone wire with mesh 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:20.660
 stereo or is it going to have two wires and 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:28.799
 will have one that will only be a failure 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:36.389
 so the film is a mesh that you have 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:37.950
 two plugs who knows electronics otto 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.450
 summarizing here why this here for whom 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.230
 already playing with electronics you'll know 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.690
 do 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.020
 who is a novice there will have to search 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.270
 a little on the net 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:54.810
 Oh, and you're going to need more or less 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:58.670
 one meter of wire from the microphone or 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.470
 be abstract to stay three meters of century 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.940
 Then I'll explain why I'm going 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.880
 stay long I have seen that it will get big 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:13.040
 but I'll publish the video a piece of 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.570
 can be there 3 centimeters and 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.790
 two by 31 the plaque anyone who 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.360
 I have the most important thing. 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.360
 show now 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:33.320
 there the circuit is well 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.170
 simple'll leave here on the screen to O 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:42.040
 you give a piti created on the computer of 6 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:45.470
 I'm going to say it here, it 's the metal metal 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:50.390
 Of course I'm going to throw the components to 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:53.990
 You 're better off making a 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.780
 the way it is the size of the 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:01.210
 board itself is not very important to 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.210
 People can be this metal 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.210
 metal 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.790
 good of a pix crime there gave to have a 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.320
 idea of ​​the little plaque 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.320
 now I'll put the components 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:23.560
 note the component numbers only goes 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.710
 use resistor here nothing more then go 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.850
 explain the principle of operation only 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.210
 resistor resistor may be common will 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:37.690
 pick up the camera is an eighth of iwate 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.800
 You can lie around half a watt 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.530
 Do you want a room or an email? 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.970
 is hot coal here the result of 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:51.990
 Coal metal film is not right puts an 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.990
 movie resistor 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:59.440
 let's send the numbers the resistors 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:02.610
 100k I'm saying there was on the camera 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.610
 in the foot 10k
