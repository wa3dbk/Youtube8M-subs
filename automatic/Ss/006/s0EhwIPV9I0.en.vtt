that's<00:02:48.310> what's<00:02:48.519> helping<00:02:48.820> us<00:02:48.940> glide<00:02:49.750> through

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
that's what's helping us glide through

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.110 
that's what's helping us glide through
the<00:02:50.140> hair<00:02:50.290> here<00:02:50.739> it's<00:02:51.310> critical<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:52.090> able

the hair here it's critical to be able

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.750 
the hair here it's critical to be able
to<00:02:52.269> do<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.900> salon<00:02:53.170> with<00:02:53.380> one<00:02:53.650> pass<00:02:54.010> so

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
to do this in the salon with one pass so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.340 
to do this in the salon with one pass so
titanium<00:02:55.330> makes<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.630> big<00:02:55.780> difference<00:02:56.200> but

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
titanium makes a big difference but

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.770 
titanium makes a big difference but
another<00:02:56.620> key<00:02:57.040> thing<00:02:57.370> here<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.390> smart

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
another key thing here is the smart

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.350 
another key thing here is the smart
sense<00:02:59.280> microchip<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.880> provides

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
sense microchip this provides

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.720 
sense microchip this provides
lightning-fast<00:03:02.049> heat<00:03:02.410> recovery<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.580> can

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
lightning-fast heat recovery so you can

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.330 
lightning-fast heat recovery so you can
style<00:03:04.030> hair<00:03:04.450> quicker<00:03:04.930> with<00:03:05.530> greater<00:03:05.830> control

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
style hair quicker with greater control

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.420 
style hair quicker with greater control
that's<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.570> advantage<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:08.260> neural<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.280> this

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that's the advantage of neural so this

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.039 
that's the advantage of neural so this
is<00:03:09.549> the<00:03:09.640> neuro<00:03:09.850> smoothen<00:03:10.390> action<00:03:10.780> this<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.019> a

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
is the neuro smoothen action this is a

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.100 
is the neuro smoothen action this is a
transformation<00:03:11.799> of<00:03:12.220> hair<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:13.600> neuro<00:03:13.780> smooth

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
transformation of hair the neuro smooth

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.150 
transformation of hair the neuro smooth
heats<00:03:14.709> up<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.400> 450<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.269> just<00:03:16.480> 30<00:03:17.170> seconds

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
heats up to 450 in just 30 seconds

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.370 
heats up to 450 in just 30 seconds
that<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.090> unbelievable<00:03:19.810> that's<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.080> lot<00:03:20.350> of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
that is unbelievable that's a lot of

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.430 
that is unbelievable that's a lot of
what's<00:03:20.650> really<00:03:20.830> making<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.340> difference

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
what's really making the difference

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.190 
what's really making the difference
then<00:03:22.710> the<00:03:23.040> constant<00:03:24.110> recalculation<00:03:25.110> of

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
then the constant recalculation of

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.770 
then the constant recalculation of
temperature<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:26.040> delivering<00:03:26.940> more<00:03:27.210> even

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780

temperature is delivering more even
temperature<00:03:27.990> every<00:03:28.500> single<00:03:28.890> time<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.430> you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
temperature every single time so you

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.760
