the<00:02:16.900> screens<00:02:17.200> nine<00:02:17.470> point<00:02:17.799> seven<00:02:18.010> inches<00:02:20.250> but

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the screens nine point seven inches but

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.699 
the screens nine point seven inches but
it's<00:02:21.430> smaller<00:02:21.760> than<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:22.030> magazine<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.569> says

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
it's smaller than a magazine it says

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.460 
it's smaller than a magazine it says
it's<00:02:23.709> just<00:02:24.540> 1.5<00:02:25.540> pounds<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.519> 10.5<00:02:27.519> inches<00:02:28.470> then

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
it's just 1.5 pounds I 10.5 inches then

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.000 
it's just 1.5 pounds I 10.5 inches then
so<00:02:30.010> it's<00:02:30.130> actually<00:02:30.250> half<00:02:30.640> an<00:02:30.760> inch<00:02:30.910> then<00:02:32.010> you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
so it's actually half an inch then you

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.620 
so it's actually half an inch then you
can<00:02:33.099> get<00:02:33.160> up<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.400> 10<00:02:33.610> hours<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:34.000> battery<00:02:34.239> life

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630

games it looks like they have also got
for<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.139> which<00:03:35.440> makes<00:03:35.829> a<00:03:36.069> little<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.549> little<00:03:37.090> bit

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
for it which makes a little a little bit

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.059 
for it which makes a little a little bit
better<00:03:37.950> than<00:03:38.950> use<00:03:39.370> an<00:03:39.489> iPhone<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:41.069> business

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
better than use an iPhone in a business

better than use an iPhone in a business
use<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.970> does<00:03:43.150> have<00:03:43.329> keynote<00:03:43.900> Pages<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.709> number

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
use it does have keynote Pages a number

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.349 
use it does have keynote Pages a number
so<00:03:45.579> you<00:03:45.940> can<00:03:45.970> actually<00:03:46.269> use<00:03:46.630> an<00:03:46.900> office<00:03:47.349> suite

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359
