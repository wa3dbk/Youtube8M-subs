buzz cut you're gonna go through at
least<00:01:36.730> my<00:01:37.090> experience<00:01:37.470> two<00:01:38.470> different<00:01:38.980> stages

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
least my experience two different stages

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.400 
least my experience two different stages
the<00:01:39.820> first<00:01:39.850> stage<00:01:40.150> is<00:01:40.540> like<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.840> first<00:01:41.170> month

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
the first stage is like the first month

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.020 
the first stage is like the first month
that<00:01:42.280> first<00:01:42.550> month<00:01:42.850> was<00:01:43.120> like<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.820> was

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
that first month was like it was

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.480 
that first month was like it was
difficult<00:01:46.540> as<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.870> matter<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.320> fact<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:48.460> first

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
difficult as a matter of fact the first

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.060 
difficult as a matter of fact the first
month<00:01:49.150> I<00:01:49.360> was<00:01:49.390> more<00:01:49.930> likely<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.470> cut<00:01:50.680> my<00:01:50.860> hair

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
month I was more likely to cut my hair

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.900 
month I was more likely to cut my hair
than<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.340> am<00:01:51.490> now<00:01:51.730> at<00:01:51.940> six<00:01:52.240> months<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.790> know

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
than I am now at six months so you know

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.760

first<00:02:14.620> month<00:02:14.800> was<00:02:15.010> one<00:02:15.160> stage<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.790> now<00:02:16.060> at<00:02:16.239> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
first month was one stage and now at the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.259 
first month was one stage and now at the
six<00:02:16.629> months<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.349> gotta<00:02:18.040> tell<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.519> I<00:02:19.030> feel

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
this probably started back around the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.729 
this probably started back around the
fifth<00:02:23.709> month<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:24.220> hair<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.849> really<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:26.560> looks

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
Sugiyama coming but by the end of the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.229 
Sugiyama coming but by the end of the
day<00:02:31.569> if<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.620> really<00:02:32.890> will<00:02:33.370> start<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:34.060> bounce

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
day if it really will start to bounce

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.089 
day if it really will start to bounce
out<00:02:34.510> because<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.410> type<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.650> hair<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.010> I

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
out because of the type of hair that I

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.210 
out because of the type of hair that I
have<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:37.629> can<00:02:37.810> see<00:02:37.989> right<00:02:38.200> here<00:02:38.379> this<00:02:38.650> this

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
have you can see right here this this

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.830 
have you can see right here this this
curve<00:02:39.489> right<00:02:39.700> here<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.150> thing<00:02:40.330> hangs<00:02:40.569> there

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
curve right here that thing hangs there

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.300 
curve right here that thing hangs there
all<00:02:41.049> day<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.819> what<00:02:43.000> happens<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:44.010> well<00:02:45.010> the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
all day and what happens is well the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.009 
all day and what happens is well the
hair<00:02:45.459> just<00:02:45.640> gets<00:02:45.760> real<00:02:46.060> bouncing<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.810> guess

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
hair just gets real bouncing I guess

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.460 
hair just gets real bouncing I guess
that's<00:02:47.230> what

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.730

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.910 

this<00:03:23.580> past<00:03:23.910> month<00:03:24.270> I've<00:03:25.110> learned<00:03:25.500> something

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
this past month I've learned something

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.740 
this past month I've learned something
that<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:27.320> hold<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.520> is<00:03:29.760> I'm<00:03:30.150> not<00:03:30.210> going<00:03:30.630> to

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
that I hold and that is I'm not going to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.330 
that I hold and that is I'm not going to
put<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.020> time<00:03:31.470> limit<00:03:31.800> on<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:33.000> length<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:34.340> know

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
put a time limit on the length you know

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.130 
put a time limit on the length you know
like<00:03:36.050> I'm<00:03:37.050> not<00:03:37.110> gonna<00:03:37.410> say<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:39.690> what<00:03:39.959> year

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
like I'm not gonna say that in what year

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.840 
like I'm not gonna say that in what year
I<00:03:40.200> expect<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:40.890> be<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.160> long<00:03:41.400> because<00:03:41.580> that

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
I expect it to be this long because that

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.970 
I expect it to be this long because that
put<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.300> time<00:03:42.510> limit<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.320> that's<00:03:43.740> just

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
put in a time limit and that's just

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.590 
put in a time limit and that's just
putting<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.310> little<00:03:44.340> bit<00:03:44.580> more<00:03:44.790> pressure<00:03:45.090> on

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
putting a little bit more pressure on

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.340 
putting a little bit more pressure on
yourself<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:49.520> so<00:03:50.810> that's<00:03:51.810> something<00:03:52.080> I've

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
yourself to so that's something I've

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.199 
yourself to so that's something I've
learned<00:03:52.590> at<00:03:52.709> this<00:03:52.950> point<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.550> know<00:03:53.670> I'm<00:03:54.060> not

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
learned at this point you know I'm not

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.100 
learned at this point you know I'm not
going<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:55.760> really<00:03:56.760> put<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.150> time<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.570> I'm<00:03:57.959> just

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110
