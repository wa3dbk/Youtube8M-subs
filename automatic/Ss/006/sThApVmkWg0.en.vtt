00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 School and wants to see what you little toad itneunge not my case, also now themselves 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.590
 Finding written material or something like this 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.089
 I know there is a practice to do it because it will be a lot of help 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.260
 It's the same, so from deep to deep, from one to ten , we are not passed on . 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.220
 I will 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.220
 How to get this water that is the most basic to maintain life 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.500
 To sell a machine to know for hunting come in handy 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.529
 Leading me out 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.300
 Urban life Which is not easy for many students 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:40.410
 Let's focus as much as possible and try to challenge this group 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.020
 I have to go. 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.210
 Just as I would like to try a village 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.210
 More efforts are needed will like 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.930
 So, it seems that compared to the city where it was not a job to solve it together 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.980
 The meal here is indeed a struggle . 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.190
 The students who eaten tearful rice became uninhabited and felt a lot. 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.190
 I will 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.500
 For the two cases so loved the first one sins honestly Light Camp 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.350
 Do not get four guys 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.110
 It's hard to get out, and you have to do a lot of acting. 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:23.369
 Oh inde really that obvious why the three ralkka away from the United States 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.729
 Well yesterday complained'm not 11 hours g2 Taiwan took precautions as having boiled water 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.729
 Because it takes 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.869
 It's not easy to do here. 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.820
 The students who visited here, as well as the uninhabited 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.820
 after class 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.430
 It's small. 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:52.740
 Now, what did you say? 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:57.480
 Is not part geolkkayo If you are also a type IV 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.570
 If you look, you do not have a colt port. Look at the bottom of it. 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.810
 Kwangwoo-shi This time, I am finished in the typhoon 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.800
 One standing there are also together all the situations that may not be the one to four trillion 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.130
 I can make a watch now. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:16.970
 A few rafts. Yes. 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.970
 This man who makes a raft to replace this broken boat 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:25.300
 Lake material is just this abandoned PET bottle. 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:29.770
 I have become a precious treasure for you . 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:35.319
 This little guy is also a future plan to feel gratitude to 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:39.220
 I've heard of it. At first, I 've avoided more like a translator in the city. 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:43.510
 Those who are nearing the station 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:48.000
 My current alternative is to tell you this, and as hard as I live now 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.000
 I am going to live so hard that I live. 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.700
 I would like to keep the uninhabited island and tell people how to survive. 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:01.450
 We applaud the strong support of the dream. 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.140
 Said that it lives in Uninhabited minutes I thought that October day indeed 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.050
 I think you're in a hurry. It's not easy to eat with Daiba . 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.950
 If you eat it, the fire will be tired. I need water again. 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.459
 We have to wait. 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.010
 If you want to eat fish, you have to go out to catch fish by the sea. 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.540
 I do not even have ten of them. 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.769
 I think I'll have to live with a little gratitude. 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.769
 I think I will be someone who will appreciate everything when I go 4 days .
