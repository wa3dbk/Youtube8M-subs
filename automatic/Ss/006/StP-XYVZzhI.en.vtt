00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.740
 hello now welcome to this video 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.150
 where will explain what are the doubts that 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.430
 they present themselves when one 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.770
 begins to play from that universe by 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.700
 example in which the powers vary for 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.500
 what are they? 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.020
 once one when there is already a certain 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.520
 time understand if things like they are 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.590
 many times he thinks he believes he is more 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.399
 his character with powers like 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.399
 mentors acquired 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.550
 then what are we going to create character 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.260
 at 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.260
 served the player person player 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.310
 for 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.310
 and be able to explain 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.310
 so 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.260
 and here in the case of mentors 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.900
 I do not have it very clear 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.990
 yes yes they vary in which one chooses a mentor 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.330
 that will give you weapons or extra prizes 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.500
 Numbering depending on the mentor 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.960
 wanted to 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.350
 I do not know if for example in one man that is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.880
 one chooses batman d 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.340
 of mentor they will give you things 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.280
 specialized to people who choose from 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.700
 technology powers 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.880
 I do not have that very clear 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.140
 so this step maybe we 're going 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.140
 we are going to have to measure them 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.490
 you see this yes I already have something less clear 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.490
 how would it be 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.100
 what is only the two only 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.050
 that can be varied in your 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.740
 that is really the only thing that can be 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.260
 tank and dps that is of bs is done what 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.880
 which are the characters as core or 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.140
 that they have to destroy the enemy in 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.420
 a lesser amount of time 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.110
 that followed fire that can be varied 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.480
 between tank and fish 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.030
 full 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.569
 for me it is the best tank that could 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.180
 to be would be to choose the power of ice 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.519
 because he has a skill 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.680
 a script that lowers the 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.170
 body temperature that using it makes 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.150
 colder and if some do the version to 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.799
 5 times they become a character 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.400
 it falls on him with an ice armor 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.590
 and that 's how it reduces the damage 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.829
 so I find that it would be the best 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.829
 path 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.480
 technology that make the 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.629
 technology is based on worrying about 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.930
 third parties to dine all damage but its 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.550
 main function is to surround 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.990
 and study the enemy themes 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.250
 because nuclear and tankers are already 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.250
 scare them from fire and those from ice 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.990
 the mental dowry 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.610
 it's almost the same as technology with the 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.090
 difference if I do not tell me where 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.590
 mental can hellyar also 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.590
 they already have that ability 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:46.069
 what nature is lowered are based on eta 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:50.379
 In general, there is also no longer 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.379
 but its main function is to turn
