week's video today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:04.740> about<00:00:04.950> gas<00:00:05.430> puddles<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.150> how<00:00:06.240> they

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
talking about gas puddles and how they

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.080 
talking about gas puddles and how they
work<00:00:06.690> now<00:00:07.470> one<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.919> things<00:00:08.160> I'd<00:00:08.519> like<00:00:08.730> for

all my viewers to be able to do is just

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.709 
all my viewers to be able to do is just
pop<00:00:11.219> them<00:00:11.400> out<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.639> their<00:00:11.759> trunk<00:00:12.030> lift<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.540> up

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
pop them out of their trunk lift it up

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.110 
pop them out of their trunk lift it up
look<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.710> their<00:00:13.920> engine<00:00:14.280> bay<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:14.910> able<00:00:15.000> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
look in their engine bay and be able to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.359 
look in their engine bay and be able to
identify<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.960> explain<00:00:16.379> how<00:00:16.650> everything<00:00:16.890> that

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
identify and explain how everything that

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.760 
identify and explain how everything that
they<00:00:17.520> see<00:00:17.580> works<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.260> order<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.529> do

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
they see works and so in order to do

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.929 
they see works and so in order to do
this<00:00:19.949> I'm<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.580> go<00:00:20.670> through<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
this I'm going to have to go through a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.390 
this I'm going to have to go through a
lot<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.150> different<00:00:21.330> systems<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.289> I'm<00:00:23.250> going

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
lot of different systems and I'm going

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880 
lot of different systems and I'm going
to<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.550> starting<00:00:24.000> with<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.600> gas<00:00:24.900> pedal<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.650> one

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
to be starting with the gas pedal so one

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.529 
to be starting with the gas pedal so one
of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> most<00:00:26.189> important<00:00:26.730> parts<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.119> your<00:00:27.330> car

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
of the most important parts of your car

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.240 
of the most important parts of your car
yes<00:00:27.869> without<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.170> gas<00:00:28.380> pedal<00:00:28.619> you're<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.010> going

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
yes without a gas pedal you're not going

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.070 
yes without a gas pedal you're not going
anywhere<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.510> you're<00:00:30.660> certainly<00:00:30.990> not

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
anywhere and you're certainly not

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
anywhere and you're certainly not
controlling<00:00:31.740> how<00:00:31.890> fast<00:00:32.219> you're<00:00:32.430> getting

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
controlling how fast you're getting

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.900 
controlling how fast you're getting
there<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.469> the<00:00:34.469> gas<00:00:34.649> pedal<00:00:35.010> system<00:00:35.340> itself<00:00:35.700> is

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
there so the gas pedal system itself is

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.000 
there so the gas pedal system itself is
rather<00:00:36.149> simple<00:00:36.540> there's<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.590> complex

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
rather simple there's a lot of complex

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.740 
rather simple there's a lot of complex
systems<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.730> involved<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.540> though

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
systems that get involved with it though

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.350 
systems that get involved with it though
which<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.350> will<00:00:40.500> get<00:00:40.590> into<00:00:40.649> later<00:00:41.239> for<00:00:42.239> now

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
which I will get into later for now

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.720 
which I will get into later for now
though<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> gas<00:00:42.960> pedal<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.550> what

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
though the gas pedal so this is what

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.830 
though the gas pedal so this is what
you're<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> push<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.450> foot<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.809> here

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
you're going to push your foot on here

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.650 
you're going to push your foot on here
here's<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.530> gas<00:00:46.710> pedal<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.360> push

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
here's the gas pedal and as you push

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.139 
here's the gas pedal and as you push
that<00:00:48.899> you've<00:00:49.170> got<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> pivot<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.940> you're

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that you've got a pivot and so you're

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
that you've got a pivot and so you're
going<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.360> push<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.110> pivot<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.559> going

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
going to push in and that pivot is going

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
going to push in and that pivot is going
to<00:00:52.770> pull<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> wire<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.879> throttle<00:00:54.390> wire<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
to pull on a wire the throttle wire and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.229 
to pull on a wire the throttle wire and
that<00:00:55.620> throttle<00:00:56.039> wire<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> connected<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that throttle wire is connected to the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.540 
that throttle wire is connected to the
throttle<00:00:57.510> linkage<00:00:57.859> which<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.100> turn<00:00:59.460> uh

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
throttle linkage which in turn uh

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.100 
throttle linkage which in turn uh
manipulates<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.789> butterfly<00:01:03.449> valve<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:04.019> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
manipulates a butterfly valve that is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.890 
manipulates a butterfly valve that is
located<00:01:04.470> inside<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.369> throttle<00:01:05.729> body<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
located inside of the throttle body so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.289 
located inside of the throttle body so
what<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> butterfly<00:01:07.830> belt<00:01:08.280> does<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.820> here's

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
what this butterfly belt does is here's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.210 
what this butterfly belt does is here's
your<00:01:09.630> air<00:01:09.780> intake<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.590> air<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.010> into

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
your air intake your air is going into

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
your air intake your air is going into
your<00:01:11.340> engine<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.479> you've<00:01:12.960> got<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
your engine here and you've got this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950 
your engine here and you've got this
butterfly<00:01:13.860> valve<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:15.150> butterfly<00:01:15.479> flap

a<00:01:44.700> system<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.270> sensors<00:01:45.810> are<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.409> able

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
a system of sensors are going to be able

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.440 
a system of sensors are going to be able
to<00:01:46.619> identify<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.549> more<00:01:47.759> air<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> coming<00:01:48.180> into

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to identify that more air is coming into

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
to identify that more air is coming into
the<00:01:48.600> engine<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.140> when<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:49.979> sense<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the engine and when they sense that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.010 
the engine and when they sense that
there's<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.850> air<00:01:51.000> coming<00:01:51.210> into<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.570> engine

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
there's more air coming into the engine

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.929 
there's more air coming into the engine
they're<00:01:52.619> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> inject<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.399> fuel<00:01:53.700> into

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
they're going to inject more fuel into

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.940 
they're going to inject more fuel into
the<00:01:53.970> engine<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.990> want<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> keep<00:01:55.409> an<00:01:55.590> even

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the engine so you want to keep an even

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
the engine so you want to keep an even
ratio<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.670> air<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.000> fuel<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.329> gasoline

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
ratio of air and fuel for gasoline

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.020 
ratio of air and fuel for gasoline
engines<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.710> about<00:01:58.920> fourteen<00:01:59.490> point<00:01:59.820> seven

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
engines is about fourteen point seven

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.130 
engines is about fourteen point seven
parts<00:02:00.840> air<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.680> part<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.280> fuel<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.750> there's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
parts air to one part of fuel so there's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840 
parts air to one part of fuel so there's
various<00:02:04.469> sensors<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.040> are<00:02:05.100> involved<00:02:05.700> in

making ensuring that the amount of air

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.510 
making ensuring that the amount of air
is<00:02:09.500> correct<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.770> amount<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.009> fuel<00:02:11.310> is

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
is correct and the amount of fuel is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.309 
is correct and the amount of fuel is
correct<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.970> goes<00:02:12.150> into<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.540> end<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
correct it goes into this end to the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.010 
correct it goes into this end to the
cylinders<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.550> you've<00:02:14.670> got<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.209> MAF<00:02:15.989> sensor

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020

later videos but for now I just wanted

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.350 
later videos but for now I just wanted
to<00:02:29.160> get<00:02:29.250> through<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.610> gas<00:02:29.849> pedal<00:02:30.269> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
to get through this gas pedal and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.080 
to get through this gas pedal and
explain<00:02:30.750> how<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.170> works<00:02:31.670> I'm<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.910> show

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
explain how it works I'm going to show

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.740 
explain how it works I'm going to show
you<00:02:33.150> what<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.510> looks<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:34.140> my<00:02:34.500> car<00:02:34.860> and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
you what this looks like on my car and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.940 
you what this looks like on my car and
one<00:02:36.750> thing<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.290> should<00:02:37.500> know<00:02:37.709> is<00:02:37.920> that

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
one thing that you should know is that

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.250 
one thing that you should know is that
not<00:02:38.819> all<00:02:39.000> cars<00:02:39.239> use<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.660> system<00:02:40.019> anymore

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
not all cars use the system anymore

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.920 
not all cars use the system anymore
because<00:02:40.650> now<00:02:41.069> there's<00:02:41.970> better<00:02:42.300> greater

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
because now there's better greater

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.589 
because now there's better greater
technology<00:02:43.349> available<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.700> new<00:02:45.030> cars<00:02:45.330> will

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
technology available so new cars will

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.600 
technology available so new cars will
have<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.840> drive<00:02:46.260> by<00:02:46.500> wire<00:02:46.769> which<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.280> what<00:02:47.519> they

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
have a drive by wire which is what they

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.460 
have a drive by wire which is what they
call<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:47.910> just<00:02:48.090> because<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:48.569> electronic<00:02:49.230> so

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
call it just because it's electronic so

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.369 
call it just because it's electronic so
wires<00:02:49.769> are<00:02:50.250> doing<00:02:50.489> all<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.700> work<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:52.170> will

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
wires are doing all the work and I will

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.110 
wires are doing all the work and I will
explain<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.220> future<00:02:53.430> video<00:02:53.640> as<00:02:53.910> well

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
explain that in a future video as well

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.350 
explain that in a future video as well
so<00:02:54.840> let's<00:02:55.110> take<00:02:55.349> a<00:02:55.379> look<00:02:55.500> at<00:02:55.650> my<00:02:55.769> car<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:57.209> here

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
so let's take a look at my car so here

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.390 
so let's take a look at my car so here
we<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.659> our<00:02:57.840> throttle<00:02:58.050> linkage<00:02:58.590> for<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.220> gas

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
we have our throttle linkage for the gas

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.809 
we have our throttle linkage for the gas
pedal<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.900> see<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.260> throttle<00:03:01.620> cable

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.250 
pedal and you can see the throttle cable
running<00:03:02.819> along<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.920> then<00:03:04.920> disappearing<00:03:05.640> into

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
running along and then disappearing into

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.280 
running along and then disappearing into
the<00:03:07.260> driver<00:03:08.099> compartment<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.750> I'll<00:03:10.019> show

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
the driver compartment so I'll show

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.020
