 hello in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.830
 update our samsung galaxy tab 2 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.540
 from 10.1 inches to the Android version 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.030
 4.1.1 official samsung well that 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.259
 we need to do this process 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.389
 we need to have this folder that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.340
 you are watching on the screen downloaded in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.109
 your computer the folder you can 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.060
 download from the link you have here 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.199
 below in the description and consists in the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.359
 following files 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.830
 the first thing of interest version 1.85 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.699
 which is the program with which we are going to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.649
 flashing in addition without a file that is not 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.800
 need to touch the rom in dot format 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.110
 such and point ' md5 and this file that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.790
 neither is it necessary to use but that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 yes it is important for everything to come out 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.899
 well we need more besides it 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.110
 we have to have the tablet at least 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.760
 charged to 50% the battery so that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.920
 so that we can not have any 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.739
 problem of being interrupted the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.710
 process and we may have a problem 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.300
 greater and we also have to have 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.370
 downloaded and installed drivers for 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 our tablet on our computer with 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.300
 windows and how do we get this 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.640
 is that to install the program for it 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.800
 samsung kies once installed the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.080
 samsung kies on our computer is us 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.400
 will install all the traders so 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.650
 that when we connect the tablet 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.090
 they will simply be installed and we can 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520
 perform this process but it is very 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.979
 important to have all the drivers 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.950
 installed well then let's go to odin 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.240
 we are going to open it and as you can see this is the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.729
 The program's interface is quite 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.440
 simple to use we have to be 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.920
 sure that these two options are 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.479
 marked auto rebut and frs there is a 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.690
 once done this we go here where it says 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.560
 fight we selected the file that was 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.740
 the rom in total form m of 5 and we give it 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.920
 to open and now simply with our 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 tablet what we have to do is 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.009
 turn it off 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.260
 for this we keep pressing the button 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.790
 off we go to where it says turn off 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.790
 there you see that it is turning off 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.009
 and once off what we should 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.530
 do is turn it on in download mode and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.739
 for this we have to turn on we have 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.170
 that keep pressing more volume and button 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.930
 power both at the same time the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.720
 we keep pressed and as you can see we jump 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.349
 this screen that says if we go to 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.380
 install a good operating system you 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.450
 we give volume down to continue and 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.670
 we enter login mode once 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.319
 done this we are going to connect with our 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.150
 USB Cable 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.180
 previously connected to the computer the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.489
 tablet 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.290
 well once connected we will leave 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.629
 on the side here came a very 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.069
 important essential to continue 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.200
 As you can see, he has already recognized me 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.930
 here says the port to which I have it 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.879
 connected and here down here then already 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.790
 everything is ready to continue with the 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.960
 process we simply give start and 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.980
 we wait 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.580
 to which the process is carried out 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.910
 here you will see on screen 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.410
 in the command console all the 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.410
 instructions that are being made 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.870
 and at the same time a 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:20.069
 bar on the same device 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.069
 you are going to see around here 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.030
 that is completing is a bar 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.290
 I want to comment to you while you 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.090
 does this process that in this in this 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.390
 operation does not erase any kind of 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.070
 data of the tablet that is to say you have seen 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.440
 that we have not done any kind of wight 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.840
 or anything like that then all 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.060
 data that we had stored as 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.650
 wifi passwords and apps and everything 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.520
 the typical that is in the internal memory 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.590
 they will not be erased, much less in the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.290
 data that we have in the external memory 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.480
 I in my case do not have any kind of 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.100
 sd card so there is no 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.500
 problem because tn is formed and nothing 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.420
 simply the tablet will be like 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.020
 I was before with the same applications 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.360
 the only thing that has updated and if I want 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.980
 tell you meanwhile that with this 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.840
 process we get the tablet 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.970
 have a better performance since android 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.640
 4.1.1 is much more optimized and it 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.160
 gets a greater sensitivity at the time 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.690
 to move around the screens and in 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.569
 definitive the tablet improves its 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.210
 operating performance and fairly 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.729
 well here as you see it simply says 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.620
 by the top part pass and you have already 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.040
 finished the process 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.950
 now let's go to the tablet well as you see 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.220
 It is done 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.170
 completing the last steps in the 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.350
 device and on the computer we have already 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.350
 finished 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.169
 and you are already starting our device 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.259
 with the new version of android 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.129
 we can disconnect what is not there 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.129
 no problem 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.120
 there you see update it 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.590
 the android operating system is 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.590
 optimizing all our applications 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.900
 and now we have our tablet 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.669
 updated 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.700
 to ask us for the configurations 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:40.340
 initials 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.340
 here you see the date the time the day 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:45.899
 google locations 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.770
 there you see that the keyboard has also 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.770
 changed 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.880
 and ready what I was saying the subject of 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.220
 the 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.990
 Wi-Fi has been saved because it has not been 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.180
 deleted any data 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.910
 the only thing that some other configuration 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.490
 had to add good first 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.170
 impressions I can assure you that 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.630
 note much more fluid as with a greater 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:18.820
 sensitivity on the screen 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:21.160
 and that's partly due to project vader 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.190
 which is a type of 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.780
 this project that google did to 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.750
 improve a little what was fluency 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.360
 of the system and also here you see also 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.340
 a new the new management of 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.890
 applications the new administrator of 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:40.110
 tasks that have changed the colors and 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.110
 well here you can see in the settings 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:46.590
 down here all the way about the 

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:48.800
 device we have android 4.1.1 and the 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.800
 gym 

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.710
 The truth is that there is not much more than 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:56.210
 show I hope you liked this 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.790
