all right the sweet child of mind in

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.270 
all right the sweet child of mind in
trouble<00:00:10.170> has<00:00:10.349> harmonics<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.040> also<00:00:11.280> opened

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.190 

seeing<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.969> open<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.510> gonna<00:00:15.750> really<00:00:15.990> make

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
seeing it open is gonna really make

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.070 
seeing it open is gonna really make
sense<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.680> how<00:00:16.860> it<00:00:17.160> works<00:00:17.369> way<00:00:17.640> up<00:00:17.760> here<00:00:18.080> and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
sense on how it works way up here and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.630 
sense on how it works way up here and
the<00:00:19.410> harmonics<00:00:19.860> is<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.189> kind<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.460> neat

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the harmonics is just kind of a neat

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.790 
the harmonics is just kind of a neat
thing<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.510> both<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.900> our<00:00:24.410> harmonics<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
thing to do both with our harmonics and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.519 
thing to do both with our harmonics and
just<00:00:26.040> kind<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.220> needing<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.520> do<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.849> intro<00:00:27.529> so

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
just kind of needing to do the intro so

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.380 
just kind of needing to do the intro so
here's<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> sweet<00:00:29.009> child<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.250> mine<00:00:29.310> open<00:00:29.820> what

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
here's a sweet child of mine open what

here's a sweet child of mine open what
we<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.960> have<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.260> four<00:00:31.560> string<00:00:31.890> open

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
we have is we have my four string open

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.670 
we have is we have my four string open
it's<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.449> first<00:00:33.720> note<00:00:33.960> now<00:00:34.199> that<00:00:34.230> note<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
it's the first note now that note is

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.369 
it's the first note now that note is
gonna<00:00:34.830> change<00:00:35.070> two<00:00:35.370> other<00:00:35.519> times<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:37.290> we

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
gonna change two other times so what we

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.780 
gonna change two other times so what we
really<00:00:37.590> need<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:37.890> used<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.580> last

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790

really need to get used to is the last
little<00:00:38.940> bit<00:00:39.150> that<00:00:39.330> doesn't<00:00:39.629> change<00:00:39.809> which<00:00:40.470> is

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
little bit that doesn't change which is

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.890 
little bit that doesn't change which is
the<00:00:40.769> second<00:00:41.220> string<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:42.150> as<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> folder<00:00:42.809> of

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
the second string right as a folder of

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.399 
the second string right as a folder of
the<00:00:42.989> D<00:00:43.140> chord<00:00:44.420> third<00:00:45.420> string<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:46.199> as<00:00:46.290> it

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
the D chord third string right as it

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.009 
the D chord third string right as it
falls<00:00:46.589> over<00:00:46.769> the<00:00:47.040> D<00:00:47.159> chord<00:00:47.400> open<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.870> third

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
falls over the D chord open on the third

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.180 
falls over the D chord open on the third
string

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.210 

and<00:00:52.940> then<00:00:53.870> after<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:54.230> we<00:00:54.350> have<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.500> de<00:00:54.710> sus<00:00:54.950> 4

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
and then after that we have a de sus 4

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.630 
and then after that we have a de sus 4
on<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.579> first<00:00:55.850> string<00:00:56.530> third<00:00:57.530> string<00:00:57.650> right

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
on the first string third string right

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.490 
on the first string third string right
word<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:58.940> back<00:00:59.270> to<00:00:59.690> where<00:00:59.809> it<00:00:59.930> was<00:01:00.079> on<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.260> D

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
word is back to where it was on the D

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.100 
word is back to where it was on the D
chord<00:01:01.690> then<00:01:02.690> open<00:01:03.200> or<00:01:03.550> second<00:01:04.550> fret<00:01:05.089> just<00:01:05.690> like

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
chord then open or second fret just like

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.649 
chord then open or second fret just like
a<00:01:06.140> normal<00:01:06.320> D<00:01:06.620> so<00:01:07.580> here's<00:01:08.240> what<00:01:08.360> we<00:01:08.420> have

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.880 

do<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.380> twice

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.980 

now<00:01:21.520> what<00:01:21.640> we<00:01:21.730> have<00:01:21.760> is<00:01:22.090> we<00:01:22.210> have<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.510> second

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
now what we have is we have the second

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.500 
now what we have is we have the second
hour<00:01:23.260> beginning<00:01:23.830> note<00:01:24.070> he's<00:01:24.820> gonna<00:01:24.940> change<00:01:25.270> to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
hour beginning note he's gonna change to

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.830 
hour beginning note he's gonna change to
an<00:01:25.630> e<00:01:25.960> no<00:01:26.440> on<00:01:26.740> this<00:01:27.010> fourth<00:01:27.940> string<00:01:28.210> second

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
an e no on this fourth string second

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.870 
an e no on this fourth string second
fret<00:01:29.020> plus<00:01:29.980> out<00:01:30.100> of<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.310> everything<00:01:30.730> else

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
fret plus out of that everything else

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.280 
fret plus out of that everything else
stays<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.120> same<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:34.390> do<00:01:34.540> that<00:01:34.750> twice

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
stays the same we do that twice

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.410 
stays the same we do that twice
I'm<00:01:35.740> barring<00:01:36.130> my<00:01:36.250> first<00:01:36.490> finger<00:01:36.730> on<00:01:36.970> both<00:01:37.150> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
I'm barring my first finger on both the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.890 
I'm barring my first finger on both the
fourth<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.320> third<00:01:38.350> string

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.120 

that's<00:01:43.900> what<00:01:44.050> you<00:01:44.110> have<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.410> third<00:01:44.800> string

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
that's what you have is the third string

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.980 
that's what you have is the third string
open

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.010 

everything<00:01:49.990> else<00:01:50.140> stays<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.439> same

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.720 

the<00:01:56.130> open<00:01:57.130> D

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.250 

so<00:02:02.730> when<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.940> do<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> intro<00:02:03.510> way<00:02:03.660> up<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:04.110> is

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
so when you do the intro way up here is

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.230 
so when you do the intro way up here is
the<00:02:04.560> same<00:02:04.740> thing<00:02:05.040> only<00:02:05.160> instead<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.490> open<00:02:05.910> our

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the same thing only instead of open our

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.460 
the same thing only instead of open our
first<00:02:06.450> finger<00:02:06.720> takes<00:02:07.050> care<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.320> that

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
first finger takes care of that

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.719 
first finger takes care of that
hopefully<00:02:08.040> that<00:02:08.160> should<00:02:08.250> make<00:02:08.430> a<00:02:08.460> little<00:02:08.550> bit

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
hopefully that should make a little bit

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.120 
hopefully that should make a little bit
more<00:02:08.880> sense<00:02:09.259> now<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.380> we<00:02:10.470> got<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.680> open<00:02:10.800> let's

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
more sense now that we got it open let's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.090 
more sense now that we got it open let's
do<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.310> out<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.460> our<00:02:11.520> harmonics<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.890> just

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
do it out with our harmonics so just

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.380 
do it out with our harmonics so just
like<00:02:14.220> with<00:02:14.370> open<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> first<00:02:15.060> note<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.360> going

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
like with open the first note is going

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.200 
like with open the first note is going
to<00:02:15.570> change<00:02:15.750> three<00:02:16.170> times<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:17.520> case<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
to change three times this case the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.670 
to change three times this case the
first<00:02:18.450> note<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.780> going<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.990> be<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.200> twelfth

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
first note is going to be the twelfth

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.850 
first note is going to be the twelfth
fret<00:02:20.070> on<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> fourth<00:02:20.820> string<00:02:21.650> next<00:02:22.650> we're

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
fret on the fourth string next we're

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.260 
fret on the fourth string next we're
going<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> go<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.280> seventh<00:02:23.700> fret<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
going to go to the seventh fret on the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.780 
going to go to the seventh fret on the
third<00:02:24.990> string<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:28.310> then<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.550> fourth

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
third string and then on the fourth
