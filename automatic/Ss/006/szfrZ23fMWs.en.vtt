gigabytes of ddr3 memory on here and
actually<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.060> 1600<00:01:09.060> Megane<00:01:09.270> ativ<00:01:09.659> which

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
actually do up to 1600 Megane ativ which

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
actually do up to 1600 Megane ativ which
is<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.470> high<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:11.220> also<00:01:11.369> features

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
is actually really high it also features

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.149 
is actually really high it also features
the<00:01:11.700> memo<00:01:11.939> K<00:01:12.210> feature<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.170> memory<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the memo K feature so if your memory is

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.649 
the memo K feature so if your memory is
not<00:01:14.460> booting<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:14.850> -<00:01:15.030> well<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.299> push<00:01:15.570> this

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
not booting up - well you just push this

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.789 
not booting up - well you just push this
little<00:01:15.750> button<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.710> gonna

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
little button right here it's gonna

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.090 
little button right here it's gonna
automatically<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.600> reset<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
automatically kind of reset it to you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.200 
automatically kind of reset it to you
know<00:01:20.189> conservative<00:01:20.700> settings<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.060> will

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
know conservative settings that will

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.580 
know conservative settings that will
work<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.509> that'll<00:01:21.689> let<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.869> boot<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.229> into

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
work and that'll let you boot up into

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.990 
work and that'll let you boot up into
Windows<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.970> can

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
Windows and then from there you can

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.399 
Windows and then from there you can
overclock<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:24.780> BIOS<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.170> make<00:01:25.290> sure

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
overclock it in your BIOS and make sure

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.039 
overclock it in your BIOS and make sure
it<00:01:25.500> works<00:01:25.590> properly<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> 2200

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
it works properly you can do up to 2200

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.170 
it works properly you can do up to 2200
megahertz<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.220> overclock<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:30.030> let's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
megahertz if you overclock now let's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.569 
megahertz if you overclock now let's
talk<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> little<00:01:30.450> bit<00:01:30.659> about<00:01:30.840> SATA<00:01:31.290> ports<00:01:31.680> your

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
talk a little bit about SATA ports your

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.300 
talk a little bit about SATA ports your

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
right direction as I like to say because

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.330 
right direction as I like to say because

so<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.960> incredibly<00:01:51.960> fast<00:01:52.200> these<00:01:52.350> are

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so these are incredibly fast these are

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.980 
so these are incredibly fast these are
twice<00:01:52.680> as<00:01:52.710> fast<00:01:53.070> as<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.970> SATA<00:01:54.180> 2<00:01:54.420> basically

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
twice as fast as the SATA 2 basically

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.630 
twice as fast as the SATA 2 basically
this<00:01:55.229> goes<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> J<00:01:55.950> micron<00:01:56.280> controller

might ask why is there a difference in

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.180 
might ask why is there a difference in
the<00:02:35.760> colors<00:02:36.060> why<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.750> gray<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.980> this

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the colors why is this one gray and this

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.530 
the colors why is this one gray and this
one<00:02:38.400> blue<00:02:38.610> if<00:02:38.760> they're<00:02:38.880> both<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> same<00:02:39.210> well

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
one blue if they're both the same well

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.600 
one blue if they're both the same well
there<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> reason<00:02:40.190> basically<00:02:41.190> what<00:02:41.520> you're

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
there is a reason basically what you're

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.010 
there is a reason basically what you're
looking<00:02:41.640> at<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> blue<00:02:42.300> ones<00:02:42.480> up<00:02:42.630> here<00:02:42.660> are

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
looking at is the blue ones up here are

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.840 
looking at is the blue ones up here are
5<00:02:43.260> give<00:02:43.470> your<00:02:43.590> transfers<00:02:43.920> per<00:02:44.070> second<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.700> one

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
5 give your transfers per second the one

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.370 
5 give your transfers per second the one
down<00:02:44.970> here<00:02:45.000> at<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.210> bottom<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.510> 2.5<00:02:45.990> gigatons

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
down here at the bottom is 2.5 gigatons

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.660 
down here at the bottom is 2.5 gigatons
per<00:02:46.650> second<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.130> for<00:02:47.280> something<00:02:47.520> that

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
per second so for something that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.130 
per second so for something that
bandwidth<00:02:48.240> is<00:02:48.330> important<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.780> want<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.960> throw

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
bandwidth is important you want to throw

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.360 
bandwidth is important you want to throw
it<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> blue<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.800> something<00:02:50.280> that

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
it on the blue one is something that

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.950 
it on the blue one is something that
bandwidth<00:02:50.610> isn't<00:02:50.910> important<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.600> can<00:02:51.750> throw

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
bandwidth isn't important you can throw

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.320

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
talk about what you get in the box and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.370 
talk about what you get in the box and
some<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.690> Asus<00:03:48.690> features<00:03:49.050> now<00:03:49.200> I'm<00:03:49.290> not

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
some of the Asus features now I'm not

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.690 
some of the Asus features now I'm not
gonna<00:03:49.500> go<00:03:49.620> too<00:03:49.770> crazy<00:03:49.890> with<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.190> ACS<00:03:50.400> features

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
gonna go too crazy with the ACS features

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.240 
gonna go too crazy with the ACS features
because<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:52.470> know<00:03:52.530> there's<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.800> billion

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
because you know there's like a billion

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.460 
because you know there's like a billion
of<00:03:53.340> them<00:03:53.459> there's<00:03:53.670> smart<00:03:54.120> fan<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.840> fan<00:03:55.020> expert

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
and I mean there's so many it's hard but

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.690 
and I mean there's so many it's hard but
I<00:03:57.570> will<00:03:57.900> go<00:03:58.050> over<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.680> few<00:03:58.890> that<00:03:59.310> get<00:03:59.400> in<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.520> box
