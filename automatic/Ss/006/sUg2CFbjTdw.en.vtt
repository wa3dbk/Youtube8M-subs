moment is a bunch of bits for an iphone
far<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.890> as<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.610> can<00:00:08.730> see<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.090> screen<00:00:09.420> here

far and as you can see this screen here

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.740 
far and as you can see this screen here
is<00:00:09.809> white<00:00:10.429> it's<00:00:11.429> not<00:00:11.519> genuine<00:00:11.910> white<00:00:12.210> there

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
is white it's not genuine white there

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.499 
is white it's not genuine white there
has<00:00:13.139> been<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.920> color<00:00:14.370> conversion<00:00:14.790> Dino<00:00:15.269> from

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
has been a color conversion Dino from

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.310 
has been a color conversion Dino from
black<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:15.990> white<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:18.480> problems<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.109> got

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
black to white the problems it's got

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.590 
black to white the problems it's got
though<00:00:19.590> I've<00:00:19.830> come<00:00:20.100> from<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.730> think<00:00:21.090> water

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
though I've come from I think water

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.550 
though I've come from I think water
damage<00:00:22.080> from<00:00:22.650> what<00:00:22.830> themselves<00:00:24.350> now<00:00:25.460> the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
damage from what themselves now the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.859 
damage from what themselves now the
iphone<00:00:28.560> was<00:00:28.859> bought<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.369> water<00:00:29.609> damaged<00:00:30.119> with

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
iphone was bought as water damaged with

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.500 
iphone was bought as water damaged with
the<00:00:30.929> screen<00:00:31.199> not<00:00:31.349> working<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.769> think<00:00:31.800> I'm<00:00:32.130> told

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
the screen not working I think I'm told

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.690 
the screen not working I think I'm told
so<00:00:33.860> it<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:35.010> thought<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> coal<00:00:35.460> conversion

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
so it was thought a coal conversion

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.610 
so it was thought a coal conversion
could<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.270> done<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
could be done as you can see with the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.030 
could be done as you can see with the
white<00:00:37.770> components<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:40.920> work

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
white components and then it would work

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.799 
white components and then it would work
ok<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.780> wasn't<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> case<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.879> we

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
ok now that wasn't the case because we

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.340 
ok now that wasn't the case because we
look<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.200> these<00:00:46.469> connectors<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.170> can<00:00:49.170> get

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
look at these connectors here I can get

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.069 
look at these connectors here I can get
the<00:00:49.440> camera<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> focus<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:54.390> calm<00:00:54.690> this

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the camera to focus it is this calm this

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.299 
the camera to focus it is this calm this
connect<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.620> we're<00:00:55.770> looking<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
connect here we're looking out on the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.930 
connect here we're looking out on the
bigger<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.920> can<00:00:58.920> hopefully<00:00:59.129> get<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
bigger one there I can hopefully get the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.990 
bigger one there I can hopefully get the
camera<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> focus<00:01:00.870> through<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.129> ok<00:01:02.699> there<00:01:02.910> we

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
camera to focus through here ok there we

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.929 
camera to focus through here ok there we
go<00:01:03.030> number<00:01:03.180> two<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.339> ok<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> center<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
go number two but ok about the center of

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.380 
go number two but ok about the center of
screen<00:01:07.220> you've<00:01:08.220> got<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> connector<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:09.000> with

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
screen you've got a connector there with

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.890 
screen you've got a connector there with
some<00:01:10.320> contacts<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.240> them<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.750> can

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
some contacts on some of them if I can

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.340 
some contacts on some of them if I can
angle<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.760> light<00:01:14.760> correctly<00:01:15.509> look<00:01:16.140> quite

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
angle this light correctly look quite

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
angle this light correctly look quite
dull<00:01:16.820> like<00:01:17.820> they've<00:01:18.180> been<00:01:18.509> burnt<00:01:18.930> out<00:01:19.939> of<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
dull like they've been burnt out of a

dull like they've been burnt out of a
look

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600

look
like<00:01:23.600> on<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:23.840> bigger<00:01:24.080> connector<00:01:24.910> and<00:01:25.910> a<00:01:25.970> lot

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
like on this bigger connector and a lot

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.170 
like on this bigger connector and a lot
easier<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.810> say<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:28.430> in<00:01:28.520> about<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.820> center<00:01:29.150> of

damage I think I've seen this kind of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.780 
damage I think I've seen this kind of
thing<00:02:17.720> before<00:02:17.990> on<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:20.720> camera<00:02:21.020> connector

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
thing before on the camera connector

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.020 
thing before on the camera connector
which<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.660> one<00:02:23.870> here<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.650> water<00:02:25.580> damage

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
which is this one here on a water damage

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.290 
which is this one here on a water damage
that<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.330> far<00:02:26.540> far<00:02:26.810> far<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.400> what<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:28.970> think<00:02:29.209> is

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
that I far far far so what I think is

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.360 
that I far far far so what I think is
just<00:02:29.330> happened<00:02:29.900> whatever<00:02:30.260> sort<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.010> current

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
just happened whatever sort of current

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.850 
just happened whatever sort of current
up<00:02:31.489> our<00:02:31.700> travels<00:02:32.209> through<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.660> as<00:02:32.900> sort<00:02:33.739> of

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
up our travels through that as sort of

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.220 
up our travels through that as sort of
blown<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.940> contact<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.600> hopefully<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.140> can

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
blown the contact and hopefully I can

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.380 
blown the contact and hopefully I can
just<00:02:36.350> sold<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.800> back<00:02:37.010> on<00:02:37.250> what<00:02:37.970> happens<00:02:38.269> in

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
just sold it back on what happens in

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.060 
just sold it back on what happens in
real<00:02:38.660> life<00:02:38.930> when<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.320> phone<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.530> switched<00:02:39.709> and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
real life when the phone is switched and

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.920 
real life when the phone is switched and
I've<00:02:40.190> been<00:02:40.340> told<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:41.330> just<00:02:41.510> gives<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.750> wide

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
I've been told it just gives a wide

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.390 
I've been told it just gives a wide
screen<00:02:42.670> now<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.590> screen<00:02:45.590> yourself<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.220> was

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
screen now the screen yourself that was

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.820 
screen now the screen yourself that was
52<00:02:46.880> at<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.150> one<00:02:47.390> here<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:48.050> is<00:02:48.290> fine<00:02:48.530> I'm

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
52 at this one here that is fine I'm

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.570 
52 at this one here that is fine I'm
told<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.550> that's<00:02:50.000> all<00:02:50.150> ok<00:02:50.800> we'll<00:02:51.800> get<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.250> see

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
told so that's all ok we'll get to see

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.280 
told so that's all ok we'll get to see
that<00:02:52.850> once<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:54.290> hopefully<00:02:55.750> soldered<00:02:56.750> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
that once I have hopefully soldered the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.000 
that once I have hopefully soldered the
contacts<00:02:58.280> back<00:02:58.550> on<00:02:58.790> if<00:02:59.090> I'm<00:02:59.300> able<00:02:59.480> to<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
contacts back on if I'm able to the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.979 
contacts back on if I'm able to the
reason<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.310> say<00:03:01.489> hopefully<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:02.360> because

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
reason I say hopefully is because

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.170 
reason I say hopefully is because
underneath

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
underneath

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.970 
underneath
contact<00:03:04.629> is<00:03:04.780> what's<00:03:04.989> got<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.200> pad<00:03:05.469> a<00:03:05.500> shoulder

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
contact is what's got a pad a shoulder

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.589 
contact is what's got a pad a shoulder
pad<00:03:06.159> that<00:03:06.969> the<00:03:07.239> contact<00:03:07.870> goes<00:03:08.140> on<00:03:08.349> to<00:03:08.769> if<00:03:09.579> it<00:03:10.239> is

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
pad that the contact goes on to if it is

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.250 
pad that the contact goes on to if it is
still<00:03:10.959> there<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:12.459> can<00:03:12.670> get<00:03:12.879> solder<00:03:13.689> to<00:03:13.900> run

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
still there and I can get solder to run

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.130 
still there and I can get solder to run
between<00:03:14.469> the<00:03:14.650> contacts<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:16.480> solder<00:03:16.989> pad

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
between the contacts and the solder pad

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.339 
between the contacts and the solder pad
the<00:03:17.260> nuts<00:03:17.469> I'll<00:03:17.680> fine<00:03:17.980> if<00:03:18.310> not<00:03:18.819> then<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:20.019> don't

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
the nuts I'll fine if not then I don't

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.259 
the nuts I'll fine if not then I don't
think<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.620> solder<00:03:20.920> pad<00:03:21.129> will<00:03:22.000> be<00:03:22.090> there

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
think the solder pad will be there

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.229 
think the solder pad will be there
anymore<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.870> what<00:03:23.109> could<00:03:23.290> have<00:03:23.409> happened<00:03:23.799> was

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
anymore so what could have happened was

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.240 
anymore so what could have happened was
the<00:03:25.239> pad<00:03:25.750> could<00:03:26.349> have<00:03:26.439> been<00:03:26.650> sort<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:26.980> burnt

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
the pad could have been sort of burnt

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.520 
the pad could have been sort of burnt
away<00:03:28.469> somehow<00:03:30.239> because<00:03:31.239> of<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:32.019> damage<00:03:32.379> that

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
away somehow because of the damage that

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.679 
away somehow because of the damage that
are<00:03:32.920> there<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.730> water<00:03:34.150> damage<00:03:34.359> that

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
are there and the water damage that

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.399 
are there and the water damage that
caused<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.230> but<00:03:36.299> like<00:03:37.299> say<00:03:37.540> I'm<00:03:38.049> going<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.260> try

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
caused it but like say I'm going to try

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.300 
caused it but like say I'm going to try
my<00:03:38.439> best<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.950> get<00:03:39.549> those<00:03:39.819> tied<00:03:40.659> it<00:03:40.870> up<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.310> sort

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
my best to get those tied it up and sort

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.640 
my best to get those tied it up and sort
of<00:03:42.480> making<00:03:43.480> contact<00:03:43.989> again<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.349> working

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
of making contact again and working

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.929 
of making contact again and working
properly<00:03:44.889> and<00:03:45.189> that's<00:03:45.639> what<00:03:45.760> you'll<00:03:45.909> be

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
properly and that's what you'll be

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.389 
properly and that's what you'll be
seeing<00:03:46.120> next
