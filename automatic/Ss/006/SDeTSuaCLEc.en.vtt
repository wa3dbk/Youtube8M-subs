00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
way it's not just recalled it's more

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.030 
way it's not just recalled it's more
possible<00:01:17.580> immediately<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:19.470> want<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
possible immediately you want to be the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.410 
possible immediately you want to be the
girl

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.940 

is<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:22.930> like<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.049> reaction<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.680> what<00:01:23.799> you've

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
is it like a reaction to what you've

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.130 
is it like a reaction to what you've
done<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.340> sort<00:01:24.640> of<00:01:24.670> evolution<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:25.750> think<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:26.049> an

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
done a sort of evolution I think it's an

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.780 
done a sort of evolution I think it's an
evolution<00:01:26.770> because<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.189> really<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.580> a<00:01:27.610> very

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
evolution because it really is a very

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.910 
evolution because it really is a very
ultra<00:01:28.210> Zara<00:01:28.570> cut<00:01:28.900> it's<00:01:29.110> like<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:29.439> you<00:01:29.799> know<00:01:29.890> a

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
ultra Zara cut it's like that you know a

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.370 
ultra Zara cut it's like that you know a
lot<00:01:30.040> of<00:01:30.100> tailoring<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.850> small<00:01:31.149> shoulder<00:01:31.689> but<00:01:32.290> I

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
lot of tailoring a small shoulder but I

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.590 
lot of tailoring a small shoulder but I
think<00:01:32.619> in<00:01:32.740> terms<00:01:32.770> of<00:01:33.250> how<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.820> worked<00:01:34.210> on<00:01:34.479> the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
think in terms of how I worked on the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.719 
think in terms of how I worked on the
collection<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.320> was<00:01:35.439> definitely<00:01:35.729> reactionary

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
collection it was definitely reactionary

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.149 
collection it was definitely reactionary
because<00:01:37.390> I<00:01:37.509> think<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.840> felt<00:01:38.049> really<00:01:38.259> boring<00:01:38.830> to

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
because I think it felt really boring to

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.060 
because I think it felt really boring to
just<00:01:39.190> work<00:01:40.030> on<00:01:40.180> one<00:01:40.240> idea<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:41.830> became

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
just work on one idea and it just became

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.490 
just work on one idea and it just became
so<00:01:42.280> much<00:01:42.430> more<00:01:42.640> interesting<00:01:42.909> to<00:01:43.299> have<00:01:43.539> like<00:01:44.289> a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
so much more interesting to have like a

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.060 
so much more interesting to have like a
million<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:46.200> uncompromising<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.439> think<00:01:47.740> but

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
million so uncompromising I think but

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.920 
million so uncompromising I think but
when<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.460> have<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.670> talented<00:01:49.210> person<00:01:49.420> it's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
when you have a talented person it's

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.090 
when you have a talented person it's
just<00:01:50.020> that's<00:01:50.259> what<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.590> is

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
just that's what it is

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.160 
just that's what it is
it<00:01:51.369> was<00:01:51.670> very<00:01:51.939> definite<00:01:52.509> but<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.720> also<00:01:52.869> thought

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
it was very definite but I also thought

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.230 
it was very definite but I also thought

the execution was well done
I<00:01:55.270> think<00:01:56.050> wearability<00:01:56.649> might<00:01:57.159> be<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.550> tiny

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909

I think wearability might be a tiny
