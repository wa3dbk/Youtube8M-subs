00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.999 
pretty much insta kill me at this point
if<00:04:51.909> I<00:04:51.969> don't<00:04:52.150> heal<00:04:52.559> let's<00:04:53.559> take<00:04:53.740> care<00:04:53.860> of<00:04:53.919> that

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
if I don't heal let's take care of that

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:05.040 
if I don't heal let's take care of that
first

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.970 

you

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
you

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.710 
you
I<00:05:07.130> was<00:05:07.640> something<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:07.910> range<00:05:08.240> would<00:05:08.420> go<00:05:08.570> out

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
I was something that range would go out

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.670 
I was something that range would go out
just<00:05:09.160> fine

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.340 

we<00:05:16.340> have<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.520> be<00:05:16.639> really<00:05:17.300> aware<00:05:17.449> of<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.930> music

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
we have to be really aware of the music

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.779 
we have to be really aware of the music
because<00:05:18.620> it's<00:05:18.800> not<00:05:18.949> going<00:05:19.009> to<00:05:19.190> be<00:05:19.250> immediately

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
because it's not going to be immediately

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.700 
because it's not going to be immediately
apparent<00:05:19.940> if<00:05:20.389> he's<00:05:20.539> sleeping<00:05:21.080> if<00:05:21.199> I<00:05:21.289> sleep<00:05:21.560> in

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
apparent if he's sleeping if I sleep in

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:32.670 
apparent if he's sleeping if I sleep in
like<00:05:21.830> this

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.890 

yeah<00:05:33.680> no<00:05:34.300> it's<00:05:35.300> going<00:05:35.450> to<00:05:35.510> knock<00:05:35.600> us<00:05:35.750> out<00:05:35.840> of

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
yeah no it's going to knock us out of

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.950 
yeah no it's going to knock us out of
the<00:05:36.050> area<00:05:36.260> may<00:05:36.560> as<00:05:36.620> well<00:05:36.770> sharpen<00:05:40.600> its<00:05:41.600> ko'd

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
the area may as well sharpen its ko'd

00:05:41.960 --> 00:06:02.950 
the area may as well sharpen its ko'd
both<00:05:42.140> of<00:05:42.230> my<00:05:42.320> cats<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.810> jerk<00:05:44.810> oh<00:05:49.690> hello

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960

got<00:06:03.590> to<00:06:03.710> be<00:06:03.770> careful<00:06:03.949> he's<00:06:04.250> going<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:04.460> deflate

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
got to be careful he's going to deflate

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.189 
got to be careful he's going to deflate
soon<00:06:05.030> I'm<00:06:05.210> sure<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:08.330> quick<00:06:08.600> color<00:06:08.780> change<00:06:09.080> I

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
soon I'm sure the quick color change I

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:25.510 
soon I'm sure the quick color change I
think<00:06:09.259> before<00:06:09.530> he<00:06:09.710> does<00:06:09.949> yeah<00:06:10.250> there<00:06:10.400> we<00:06:10.490> go

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:34.189 

sleep<00:06:26.520> thing<00:06:26.729> good<00:06:27.889> good<00:06:28.889> good<00:06:29.039> video<00:06:33.199> let's

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 
sleep thing good good good video let's

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:45.079 
sleep thing good good good video let's
get<00:06:34.379> one<00:06:34.529> over<00:06:34.559> here<00:06:34.979> too<00:06:42.169> okay<00:06:43.729> it's<00:06:44.729> actually

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
get one over here too okay it's actually

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.049 
get one over here too okay it's actually
probably<00:06:45.269> ready<00:06:45.599> for<00:06:45.779> capture<00:06:46.169> at<00:06:46.259> this<00:06:46.409> point

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:47.059 
probably ready for capture at this point

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:53.970 
probably ready for capture at this point
after<00:06:48.059> that

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.880 

yes<00:06:54.990> when<00:06:55.990> the<00:06:56.080> cats<00:06:56.230> are<00:06:56.410> going<00:06:56.620> in<00:06:56.710> for<00:06:56.800> the

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.890 
yes when the cats are going in for the

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:02.820 
yes when the cats are going in for the
rocket<00:06:59.310> they<00:07:00.310> collided<00:07:00.610> I<00:07:00.970> think<00:07:01.900> maybe<00:07:02.620> with

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
rocket they collided I think maybe with

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.700 
rocket they collided I think maybe with
the<00:07:02.920> ground<00:07:03.810> but<00:07:04.810> neither<00:07:05.110> case<00:07:05.410> we<00:07:05.590> can

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
the ground but neither case we can

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.430 
the ground but neither case we can
actually<00:07:05.860> go<00:07:06.100> for<00:07:06.400> a<00:07:06.430> cap<00:07:06.790> and<00:07:07.090> we<00:07:08.080> will<00:07:08.260> right

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 
actually go for a cap and we will right

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:16.249 
actually go for a cap and we will right
away

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:23.629 

that<00:07:17.259> was<00:07:17.380> bull<00:07:17.889> advised

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:29.140 

yeah<00:07:24.270> got<00:07:24.629> lucky

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.150 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.600 

all<00:07:30.150> caps<00:07:30.480> so<00:07:31.020> far<00:07:31.260> I<00:07:31.590> haven't<00:07:32.160> seen<00:07:32.340> the<00:07:32.460> death

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610 
all caps so far I haven't seen the death

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:38.060 
all caps so far I haven't seen the death
yet<00:07:35.120> such<00:07:36.120> as<00:07:36.240> the<00:07:36.360> power<00:07:36.540> of<00:07:36.930> sleep<00:07:37.620> bombing

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.070 
yet such as the power of sleep bombing

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.120 
yet such as the power of sleep bombing
and<00:07:38.160> low<00:07:38.310> rank<00:07:39.380> people<00:07:40.380> can<00:07:40.500> hate<00:07:40.680> on<00:07:40.740> at<00:07:41.010> all

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.130 
and low rank people can hate on at all

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.280 
and low rank people can hate on at all
they<00:07:41.280> want<00:07:41.550> but<00:07:41.700> it<00:07:41.910> is<00:07:42.290> extraordinarily

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.290 
they want but it is extraordinarily

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:53.030 
they want but it is extraordinarily
effective<00:07:51.170> that<00:07:52.170> at<00:07:52.320> least<00:07:52.470> get<00:07:52.650> my<00:07:52.770> times

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:53.040 
effective that at least get my times

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.770 
effective that at least get my times
down<00:07:53.310> enough<00:07:53.580> to<00:07:53.610> where<00:07:53.730> I'll<00:07:53.910> be<00:07:53.940> satisfied

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 
down enough to where I'll be satisfied

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.230 
down enough to where I'll be satisfied
