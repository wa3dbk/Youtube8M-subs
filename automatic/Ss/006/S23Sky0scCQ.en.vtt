but I think Judy is a mix between
mercenary<00:01:52.509> hitman<00:01:52.959> any<00:01:53.200> questionable<00:01:54.069> shady

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
and there especially the part where he

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.890 
and there especially the part where he
was<00:03:38.430> talking<00:03:38.579> about<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.060> sticky<00:03:39.420> bombs<00:03:39.629> when

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
was talking about the sticky bombs when

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.960 
was talking about the sticky bombs when
he<00:03:40.019> said<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.680> sticky<00:03:41.129> bomb<00:03:41.340> his<00:03:41.579> sticks

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
he said this is a sticky bomb his sticks

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.000 
he said this is a sticky bomb his sticks
and<00:03:42.209> they<00:03:42.569> wanna<00:03:42.750> Steve<00:03:42.989> actually<00:03:43.530> did<00:03:43.709> get<00:03:43.859> me

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
and they wanna Steve actually did get me

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.220 
and they wanna Steve actually did get me
laughing<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.489> bit<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:45.150> he<00:03:45.269> definitely<00:03:45.450> likes<00:03:46.079> to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
laughing a bit so he definitely likes to

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.870 
laughing a bit so he definitely likes to
have<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.410> laugh<00:03:46.739> fair<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.190> bare<00:03:47.400> but<00:03:47.609> then<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.819> do

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
have a laugh fair and bare but then I do

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.789 
have a laugh fair and bare but then I do
think<00:03:48.269> he<00:03:48.389> does<00:03:48.569> have<00:03:48.599> a<00:03:48.750> serious<00:03:49.290> side<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.650> him

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
think he does have a serious side to him

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.949 
think he does have a serious side to him
and<00:03:49.919> he's<00:03:50.519> probably<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.239> sort<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.510> guy<00:03:51.750> but

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
and he's probably the sort of guy but

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.690 
and he's probably the sort of guy but
you<00:03:52.079> don't<00:03:52.349> want<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.620> get<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.950> bad<00:03:53.130> side<00:03:53.160> on

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
you don't want to get on the bad side on

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.849 
you don't want to get on the bad side on
pictures<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.239> could<00:03:54.419> end<00:03:54.690> up<00:03:54.900> pretty<00:03:55.260> nasty

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
pictures it could end up pretty nasty

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.069 
pictures it could end up pretty nasty
but<00:03:56.129> seeing<00:03:56.819> a<00:03:56.940> funny<00:03:57.180> side<00:03:57.389> of<00:03:57.540> Judy<00:03:57.900> was

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
but seeing a funny side of Judy was

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.539 
but seeing a funny side of Judy was
actually<00:03:58.440> quite<00:03:58.680> surprising<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.370> see

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
actually quite surprising to see

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.339 
actually quite surprising to see
especially<00:04:00.269> if<00:04:00.359> you<00:04:00.450> think<00:04:00.480> about<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.079> Jodi

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
especially if you think about the Jodi

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.129 
especially if you think about the Jodi
we<00:04:01.560> met<00:04:01.799> during<00:04:02.010> e3<00:04:02.280> 2012<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.389> course<00:04:03.720> where

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
we met during e3 2012 of course where

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.180 
we met during e3 2012 of course where
her<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.410> big<00:04:04.620> difference<00:04:04.859> between

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
her is a big difference between

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.369 
her is a big difference between
virtually<00:04:05.819> backbend<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.780> Judy<00:04:07.169> right

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
virtually backbend and the Judy right

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.949 
virtually backbend and the Judy right
now<00:04:07.590> because<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.489> my<00:04:08.699> opinion<00:04:08.849> fish<00:04:09.419> judy<00:04:09.840> is

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
now because in my opinion fish judy is

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.839 
now because in my opinion fish judy is
like<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.169> thousand<00:04:10.709> times<00:04:10.919> more<00:04:11.129> bad<00:04:11.370> event<00:04:11.730> per

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
like a thousand times more bad event per

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.879 
like a thousand times more bad event per
one<00:04:12.060> backbend<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:12.870> how<00:04:13.290> do<00:04:13.349> you<00:04:13.500> think<00:04:13.709> that

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
one backbend and how do you think that

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.289 
one backbend and how do you think that
he<00:04:14.010> could<00:04:14.129> possibly<00:04:14.370> be<00:04:14.699> one<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.180> those

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
he could possibly be one of those

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.569 
he could possibly be one of those
game-changing<00:04:16.109> characters<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.859> watchdogs<00:04:17.310> I

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
game-changing characters and watchdogs I

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.189 
game-changing characters and watchdogs I
don't<00:04:17.910> know<00:04:18.000> if<00:04:18.060> that's<00:04:18.239> just<00:04:18.419> my<00:04:18.539> opinion<00:04:19.019> but

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
don't know if that's just my opinion but

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.319 
don't know if that's just my opinion but
I<00:04:19.260> am<00:04:19.440> really<00:04:19.739> pumped<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.370> see<00:04:20.579> what<00:04:20.849> he<00:04:21.000> has<00:04:21.150> to

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
I am really pumped to see what he has to

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.180 
I am really pumped to see what he has to
offer<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.870> game<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.320> what<00:04:22.889> he's<00:04:23.010> actually

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
offer to the game and what he's actually

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.640 
offer to the game and what he's actually
capable<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.880> doing<00:04:24.060> but<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.050> would<00:04:25.260> love<00:04:25.470> to
