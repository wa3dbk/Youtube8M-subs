00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.789
 of miles let's go prepare 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.889
 sweet toast typical of the 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.259
 Spanish gastronomy are elaborate in 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.310
 Holy week with this recipe you are left 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:24.310
 very fluffy and super rich and you'll see 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.310
 we started 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.199
 we will need half a liter of milk 2 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.809
 eggs bread of the previous day 50 grams of 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.270
 sugar the crust of half a lemon 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.739
 Cinnamon stick a little anise and oil 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.430
 to fry them the first thing we will do 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.010
 will be put in a milk catch 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.350
 with the lemon rind the cinnamon in 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.690
 branch and some anise 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.140
 when it starts to boil as you see 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.710
 we take it away from the fire 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.129
 we will add sugar 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.899
 we move it to dissolve and now 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.760
 we will cover it and let it be 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.890
 infusion for at least 15 minutes 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.790
 You can leave it all the time 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.370
 you want but at least 15 minutes 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.780
 while we will cut the bread into slices 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.780
 about two centimeters 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.530
 after 15 minutes we will try the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.420
 milk in a colander to a bowl 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.420
 big where the torrijas fit 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.100
 then we will put the slices of bread 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.000
 and let it soak in good for the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.280
 two sides 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.920
 we must take care that we are not 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.969
 spend time soaking because you do not 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.969
 we want it to be broken 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.040
 and finally we will fry them 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.040
 first for the beaten egg 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.720
 and with the help of two wooden cutlery 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.380
 so we do not burn them, we'll fry them 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.380
 in the oil 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.010
 oil 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.489
 and cinnamon alcohol 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.550
 the we would be accompanied by a ball 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.550
 dance and ready to eat
