00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
is my only guess off the top of my head

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.219 
is my only guess off the top of my head
is<00:01:19.860> faction<00:01:20.460> wars<00:01:20.700> since<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:21.990> something

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
is faction wars since that was something

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.039 
is faction wars since that was something
we<00:01:22.530> saw<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> very<00:01:23.430> first<00:01:23.759> vitac<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
we saw in the very first vitac and it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
we saw in the very first vitac and it
also<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.409> swords<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> emblems<00:01:26.580> which

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
also has swords in the emblems which

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.910 
also has swords in the emblems which
that<00:01:27.000> did<00:01:27.299> if<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.509> remember<00:01:27.869> correctly<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that did if I remember correctly but I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560 
that did if I remember correctly but I
definitely<00:01:29.250> could<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.790> horribly<00:01:30.299> wrong

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
definitely could be horribly wrong

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.719 
definitely could be horribly wrong
that's<00:01:30.840> pure<00:01:31.140> speculation<00:01:31.490> either<00:01:32.490> way

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that's pure speculation either way

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.569 
that's pure speculation either way
though<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.060> can't<00:01:33.420> wait<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.930> what<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
though I can't wait to see what it is

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.219 
though I can't wait to see what it is
