Sasuke<00:01:56.880> like<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.570> mean<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.259> always<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.740> now

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
Sasuke like I mean it's always that now

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.380 
Sasuke like I mean it's always that now
tests<00:01:59.100> come<00:01:59.250> out<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> victor<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.329> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
tests come out the victor in here so I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
tests come out the victor in here so I
see<00:02:00.570> cannot<00:02:00.810> cannot<00:02:01.140> come<00:02:01.259> out<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> victor<00:02:01.770> he

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
see cannot cannot come out the victor he

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.620 
see cannot cannot come out the victor he
can't<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.119> cover<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.329> Victor

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
can't because if you cover that Victor

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.999 
can't because if you cover that Victor
he'll<00:02:03.869> basically<00:02:04.170> kill<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.770> he<00:02:04.860> probably

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
he'll basically kill now so he probably

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.789 
he'll basically kill now so he probably
has<00:02:05.189> no<00:02:06.020> qualms<00:02:07.020> about<00:02:07.110> killing<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.560> halter

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
has no qualms about killing the halter

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.309 
has no qualms about killing the halter
but<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:08.819> after<00:02:08.940> killing<00:02:09.270> Sasuke<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.840> don't<00:02:10.200> see

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
