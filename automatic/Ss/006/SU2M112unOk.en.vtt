00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.330
 employee means I got the store 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.330
 residents immediately permanent girl 2 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:35.640
 that's about it means again 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.350
 an explanation of what everyone comes across here 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.820
 just on the sofa shutter look 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 carefully you break 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 the shore sequence and start here 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 so that's just who forgets to start 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.460
 I like to make it interesting 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.460
 slowly i made movement in one 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.710
 on not even drove work in the right means 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.939
 that all such questions are dismantling 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.979
 assembly now disassembly assembly when kris 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.979
 Chuck on difficult understandable means 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:27.909
 I took off which I immediately put here and 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.520
 try to put the shutter wrong and here on 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.970
 I understand this part 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.670
 spring this cultural appeared on 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.659
 C grade gren ren side put this 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.640

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.229
 next now i'm already working and ropes 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.590
 so as not to wear naturally this 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.110
 part 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.190
 and I screwed it up where I took it off 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.860
 shutter it should this part that is how 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.530
 would this be to me why if you 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.119
 Now I will take this principle 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.780
 look see me more abruptly than r and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.780
