00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.770
 ie, always already going fast on 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.900
 Start and finish these links a lot 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.900
 Oblique position here in his skin 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.370
 use it to the heights 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.300
 dare 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.250
 hasan demir end start and goal there 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.520
 you get in nice and clean now 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.600
 let hang 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.290
 now here from left to right 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.220
 Prepare may go in beckum 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 take swing with you 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.239
 again here on the curbs all over 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.500
 braking for a short distance away to the outside 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.200
 pure toss and again full one 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.670
 a gear up again on the left 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.590
 Roller coaster brakes here at an angle 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.150
 back in the second gear a lot 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.489
 curve speed asked here 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.160
 You have to be able to decide on the medium 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.979
 again like to watch high between 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.400
 especially all this in a diagonal position 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.290
 slow down to the right here nicely 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.860
 get out of the body 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.980
 to let 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.920
 on board the short 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.890
 Schikane backup is not just about us 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.350
 akula win on aragon can be one 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.900
 a little bit far Bahrain slowly come to her 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.010
 and now prepare for the longest 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.730
 left here in aragon by thinks outside like 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:38.210
 a lot of skew four already 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.280
 americans and accelerate properly 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.070
 but everything fast 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.960
 150 meters blind at the border point I 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.270
 completely transversely drifted a bit late 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.180
 pity alex only has a round going on 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.180
 on the right is the camera 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.300
 accelerate the world from slowing down 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.909
 difficult piece and alex hofmann im 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.479
 I would say that's it 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.470
 something 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.739
 that's the way it goes, of course 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.050
 traction control is full on premiere 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.950
 and I have only one round 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.410
 and now I have to be slow too 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.720
 years so they were there 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.460
 too much risked too much 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.930
 the long straight down we are again 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.319
 on the route 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.319
 what you are there 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.310
 radeberger 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.860
 dine with many games and these 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.980
 last left the tires are too 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.819
 Dirty I have to be careful with that here 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.819
 a lot of skew 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.160
 everyone went to the gas sooner 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.880
 also start and finish came 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.880
 and again and again 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.360
 what a shame 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.660
 Paragon 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.660
 there 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.530
 yes what should I say 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.330
 what do nobody say perfect 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.520
 been far too quickly in this art 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.680
 Playing chicane happens 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.790
 celery hopefully guys will do the same 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.790
 better in the race
