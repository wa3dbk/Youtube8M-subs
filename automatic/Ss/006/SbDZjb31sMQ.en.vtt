 when we talk about fun games 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.770
 then the classic day of the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.810
 tentacle from 1993 are not missing 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.939
 Back then, that was the point click adventure 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.640
 even the first game in the lucas arts 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.590
 adventure series that was set to music and 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.320
 talking tentacles are easy 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.690
 more funny than silent i believe 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.539
 not that you should drink it 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:53.300

 and larvae around with the help of the time machine 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.860
 the world of power-hungry tentacles too 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.690
 rescue 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.880
 but that does not work the same way 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.130
 planned and therefore all three land in 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.409
 different periods of time the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.659

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:31.250
 let each mouth angle upwards 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:34.310
 wander absolutely crazy and 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.770
 hilarious is the game update in the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.960
 the title from 2010 gives you one 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.670
 Cuttlefish posing as a man's father 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.009
 spend and try the homo sapiens 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.720
 to survive undetected everyday life 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.789
 and that is not exactly easy 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.739
 the control with the in a suit 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.810
 pressed ten days is one 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:53.599
 challenge for yourself and take care of 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.090

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.530
 for in between and with the sequel the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.879
 deadliest catch even lets it up 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:26.319
 the current console generation 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:29.019
 play this way we can get that 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.000
 Squirrel conquer from the N64 times

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.670
 over the top humor because as capped 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.549
 we feed the squirrel to mice cheese 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.920
 until you candles help a bee king 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.920

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.150
 Parents do not cover the game 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.150
 mitgekriegt 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.810
 the up is also about playing the pool 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.090
 too though are the gameplay mechanics and 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.160
 the leveldesign not just the best 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.530
 but the humor can be seen anyway 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.720
 and listen to this game you play 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.430

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.110
