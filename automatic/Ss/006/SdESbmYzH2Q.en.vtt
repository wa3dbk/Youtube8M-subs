the four young men they brought nine

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
pigs that they started with back in

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.440 
pigs that they started with back in
September<00:02:40.730> they<00:02:41.730> were<00:02:41.790> having<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.150> pick<00:02:42.300> these

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
September they were having to pick these

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.510 
September they were having to pick these
pigs<00:02:42.750> out<00:02:42.930> when<00:02:43.110> they<00:02:43.230> weighed<00:02:43.410> 35<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.220> 40

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.820 
pigs out when they weighed 35 to 40
pounds<00:02:44.700> it's<00:02:45.090> very<00:02:45.300> difficult<00:02:45.810> at<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.140> size

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
pounds it's very difficult at that size

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.949 
pounds it's very difficult at that size
pigs<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.819> decide<00:02:48.209> what<00:02:48.599> they're<00:02:48.750> going<00:02:48.780> to

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
pigs to decide what they're going to

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.620 
pigs to decide what they're going to
look<00:02:49.110> like<00:02:49.290> when<00:02:49.500> they<00:02:49.620> weigh<00:02:49.770> 280<00:02:50.459> pounds<00:02:50.630> so

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
look like when they weigh 280 pounds so

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.470 
look like when they weigh 280 pounds so
they<00:02:51.810> learn<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.260> skill<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.590> livestock

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
they learn the skill of livestock

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.120 
they learn the skill of livestock

only<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.500> winning<00:03:13.739> aspect<00:03:14.489> of<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.850> but<00:03:15.000> it's

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
only the winning aspect of it but it's

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.390 
only the winning aspect of it but it's
the<00:03:15.239> fact<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:16.440> can<00:03:16.620> feed<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.980> animals

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
the fact that you can feed the animals

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.340 
the fact that you can feed the animals
and<00:03:17.700> it's<00:03:17.970> up<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.510> practically<00:03:19.110> show<00:03:19.290> you

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
and it's up to you practically show you

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.289 
and it's up to you practically show you
it<00:03:19.560> puts<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.890> responsibility<00:03:20.010> on<00:03:21.000> you

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
it puts the responsibility on you

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.930 
it puts the responsibility on you
instead<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:22.080> somebody<00:03:22.440> else<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.489> if<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.730> feed

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
instead of somebody else so if you feed

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.400 
instead of somebody else so if you feed
the<00:03:24.120> animals<00:03:24.480> how<00:03:24.660> they're<00:03:24.840> supposed<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.230> be

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
the animals how they're supposed to be

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
fed and water them and make sure that

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.240 
fed and water them and make sure that
you<00:03:27.510> take<00:03:27.690> care<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:27.989> them<00:03:28.290> once<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.950> get<00:03:29.130> in

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
you take care of them once you get in

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.280 
you take care of them once you get in
the<00:03:29.340> show<00:03:29.549> vein<00:03:29.819> that's<00:03:30.480> when<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.870> all<00:03:30.900> pays

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
the show vein that's when it all pays

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.990 
the show vein that's when it all pays
off<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.769> there's<00:03:31.920> nothing<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.340> winning<00:03:32.610> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
off and there's nothing like winning the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.850 
off and there's nothing like winning the
showmanship<00:03:33.780> which<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.140> actually<00:03:34.260> done<00:03:34.650> today

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
showmanship which I actually done today

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.759 
showmanship which I actually done today
and<00:03:35.370> also<00:03:35.970> winning<00:03:36.450> Grand<00:03:36.840> Champions<00:03:37.410> across

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
and also winning Grand Champions across

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.190 
and also winning Grand Champions across
the<00:03:38.040> state<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.549> it's<00:03:38.700> something<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.200> there's

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
the state so it's something that there's

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.050 
the state so it's something that there's
nothing<00:03:40.560> like<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.370> whenever<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.670> have<00:03:41.880> that

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
nothing like it whenever you have that

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.910 
nothing like it whenever you have that
feeling<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.540> achievement<00:03:42.750> knowing<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.739> you

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
feeling of achievement knowing that you

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.910 
feeling of achievement knowing that you
you<00:03:44.370> took<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.730> responsibility<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.140> steps

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
you took the responsibility in the steps

00:03:46.920 --> 00:04:00.670 
you took the responsibility in the steps
to<00:03:47.100> make<00:03:47.280> them<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.640> best<00:03:47.790> they<00:03:47.910> can<00:03:48.030> be

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.410 

it's<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.459> experience<00:04:01.970> I've<00:04:02.060> never<00:04:02.239> had

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
it's the experience I've never had

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.420 
it's the experience I've never had
