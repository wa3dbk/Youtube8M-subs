endless possibilities in this case we

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.589 
endless possibilities in this case we
have<00:00:13.679> done<00:00:14.190> some<00:00:14.370> dental<00:00:14.820> support<00:00:15.269> cutting

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
have done some dental support cutting

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.080 
have done some dental support cutting
and<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:17.070> coloring<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.640> see<00:00:17.910> was

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
and the coloring that you see was

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.080 
and the coloring that you see was
achieved<00:00:18.480> using<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.990> water-based<00:00:19.350> die<00:00:20.090> in

addition<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:22.170> had<00:00:22.350> some<00:00:22.650> unfortunate

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
addition we had some unfortunate

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.759 
addition we had some unfortunate
existing<00:00:24.510> cracks<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> concrete<00:00:25.350> and

existing cracks in the concrete and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.220 
existing cracks in the concrete and
rather<00:00:26.130> than<00:00:26.400> try<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.640> mask<00:00:27.090> them<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.570> hide

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
rather than try to mask them and hide

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.599 
rather than try to mask them and hide
them<00:00:28.470> or<00:00:28.590> make<00:00:28.769> them<00:00:28.949> go<00:00:29.099> away

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
them or make them go away

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.279 
them or make them go away
we<00:00:29.910> simply<00:00:30.330> filled<00:00:30.630> them<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.080> an

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
we simply filled them with an

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.850 
we simply filled them with an
interesting<00:00:31.920> metallic<00:00:32.520> copper<00:00:33.530> joint<00:00:34.530> filler

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
interesting metallic copper joint filler

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.440 
interesting metallic copper joint filler
just<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.340> give<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:35.760> added<00:00:36.090> character

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
just to give it some added character

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.240 
just to give it some added character
which<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.079> looks<00:00:37.410> nice<00:00:37.649> against<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
which really looks nice against the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
which really looks nice against the
guide<00:00:38.510> sections<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.020> exposed<00:00:40.440> aggregate

transitioning from finished floor on the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
transitioning from finished floor on the
left<00:00:55.110> onto<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.430> floor<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.820> we're<00:00:56.940> working

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
left onto the floor that we're working

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.619 
left onto the floor that we're working
on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.789> 3000<00:01:00.480> grit

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
on the right here you have 3000 grit

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.900 
on the right here you have 3000 grit
polished<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.710> side<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.670> always

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
polished on this side and you always

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.570 
polished on this side and you always
want<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.899> over<00:01:04.409> your<00:01:04.559> contraction<00:01:05.339> joint

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
want to go over your contraction joint

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.289 
want to go over your contraction joint
roughly<00:01:06.119> 24<00:01:06.689> inches<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.770> we've<00:01:07.979> done<00:01:08.189> here

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
roughly 24 inches like we've done here

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.440 
roughly 24 inches like we've done here
so<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.530> come<00:01:11.130> back<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.670> transition

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so now when we come back and transition

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.109 
so now when we come back and transition
on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> right<00:01:13.049> side<00:01:13.409> by<00:01:14.159> having<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.760> room

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
on the right side by having that room

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.899 
on the right side by having that room
we're<00:01:15.390> able<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.810> step<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
we're able to step in and

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.719 
we're able to step in and
to<00:01:17.060> eat<00:01:17.390> rich<00:01:17.899> so<00:01:18.229> we<00:01:18.380> started<00:01:18.740> with<00:01:18.799> a<00:01:18.890> 25<00:01:19.399> for

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
to eat rich so we started with a 25 for

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.330 
to eat rich so we started with a 25 for
it<00:01:19.759> go<00:01:20.299> into<00:01:20.569> a<00:01:20.600> 40<00:01:21.020> grip<00:01:21.289> we're<00:01:21.770> currently<00:01:22.009> on

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
it go into a 40 grip we're currently on

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.789 
it go into a 40 grip we're currently on
80<00:01:22.670> live<00:01:23.299> right<00:01:23.539> now<00:01:23.719> a<00:01:23.749> metal<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:24.679> that

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
80 live right now a metal and so that

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.800 
80 live right now a metal and so that
gives<00:01:25.039> us<00:01:25.219> some<00:01:25.280> room<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.090> transition<00:01:26.689> into

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
gives us some room to transition into

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.749 
gives us some room to transition into
the<00:01:26.990> scenes<00:01:27.250> finish<00:01:28.250> floor

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
the scenes finish floor

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.149 
the scenes finish floor
one<00:01:29.719> of<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.869> first<00:01:30.049> considerations<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:30.979> want

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
one of the first considerations you want

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.340 
one of the first considerations you want
to<00:01:31.250> do<00:01:31.369> is<00:01:31.549> fill<00:01:31.850> your<00:01:32.030> joints<00:01:32.539> in<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:33.049> case

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
to do is fill your joints in this case

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.249 
to do is fill your joints in this case
we<00:01:33.649> used<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.340> two-component<00:01:35.259> self-leveling

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
we used a two-component self-leveling

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.039 
we used a two-component self-leveling
colored<00:01:36.920> polyuria<00:01:37.700> material<00:01:38.329> that's<00:01:38.810> the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
colored polyuria material that's the

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.260 
colored polyuria material that's the
very<00:01:39.289> first<00:01:39.349> thing<00:01:39.679> that<00:01:39.950> we<00:01:40.069> do<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.849> then

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
very first thing that we do and then

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.179 
very first thing that we do and then
once<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.990> material<00:01:42.469> has<00:01:42.530> been<00:01:42.740> put<00:01:42.950> into<00:01:43.069> the

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
once the material has been put into the

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.249 
once the material has been put into the
joint<00:01:43.459> we<00:01:43.700> let<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.000> sit<00:01:44.450> for<00:01:44.479> roughly<00:01:44.959> 30

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
joint we let it sit for roughly 30

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.809 
joint we let it sit for roughly 30
minutes<00:01:45.500> we<00:01:46.130> shave<00:01:46.459> it<00:01:46.609> off<00:01:46.729> flush<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.500> then

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
minutes we shave it off flush and then

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.819 
minutes we shave it off flush and then
commenced<00:01:49.819> to<00:01:49.879> our<00:01:50.270> horse<00:01:51.049> grinding<00:01:51.649> and

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
commenced to our horse grinding and

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:52.959 
commenced to our horse grinding and
you're<00:01:51.979> left<00:01:52.129> with<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.340> really<00:01:52.849> attractive

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
you're left with a really attractive

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.940 
you're left with a really attractive
joint<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:53.929> aesthetically<00:01:54.409> it's<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.770> way<00:01:54.890> to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
joint so aesthetically it's the way to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.639 
joint so aesthetically it's the way to
do<00:01:55.159> it<00:01:55.280> also<00:01:55.819> it<00:01:56.539> will<00:01:56.869> help<00:01:57.020> preserve<00:01:57.289> the

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
do it also it will help preserve the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.979 
do it also it will help preserve the
joints<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:58.399> get<00:01:58.640> less<00:01:58.819> chipping<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.810> here
