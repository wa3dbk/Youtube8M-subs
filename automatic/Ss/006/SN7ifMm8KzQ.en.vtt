 mango production this is a 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.970
 project that my family started my dad 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.710
 specifically more than 12 years ago 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.510
 did I had the opportunity of a trip to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.440
 israel and I knew some plantations of 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.070
 mango 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.050
 when I get here through the inta that 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.830
 and see some varieties we started with 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.200
 this project with the mango I dedicate myself 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.850
 to intensive crops in general and 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.410
 particularly the kiwi 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.700
 today we have here 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.960
 about 20,000 plants already 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.200
 planted and other 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.470
 7000, both in production plants are used 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.310
 no seeds and 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.430
 is a multi-year crop are projects 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.650
 of medium and long term 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.040
 in our area in the vicinity of 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.609
 mar del plata thrive very well because 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.620
 this area repeats many of the 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.230
 conditions of the places where the kiwi 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.180
 it was originally developed that while 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.540
 The plant is originally from China 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.430
 commercial development of this fruit is 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.719
 He did in New Zealand very conditions 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.239
 similar to those we have in sea of 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.130
 silver the mango good the mango in the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.050
 fruit 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.920
 sweet has a very rich flavor 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.920
 It is native to India 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.040
 we met them here in the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.890
 There are many Creole mango trees there 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.849
 here in the city of Oran and in Salta 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.290
 especially here in the city of Oran 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.090
 all the houses and a mango plant 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.770
 Creole not of these varieties that are 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.780
 varieties that have gone 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.800
 I imagine in Israel and in other parts of the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.190
 world have been developing the fruit has 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.819
 a finite skin covered a presence 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.060
 some little hairs digits 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.950
 a brown color with different 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.440
 tonalities according to their exposure to light 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.069
 it can be darker lighter 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.640
 basically based on your exposure 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.200
 to the light and the pulp is very green 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.739
 striking a miralda bar very 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.020
 attractive with seeds many seeds

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:25.070
 [Music] 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.040
 in terms of size and it depends on the 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.630
 variety for example in banks like as 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.070
 the tommy atkins or that has an average 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.470
 from 300 to 600 grams in the fruit another 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.790
 variety of which is the average of the weight 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.890
 average and a fruit now there is 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.460
 varieties like the kit that is known 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.569
 that here in the area we have fruit that 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.550
 weighs up to 2 kilos 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.159
 but then I had other variables like 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.659
 the feeling and know they are a little more 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:55.020
 guys that are mangoes that hang around 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:57.929
 200 and 300 grams per fruit plus one 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.669
 fruit that you have is very meaty 

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:02.840
 inside you have a lot of guilt these 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.630
 varieties have no fiber 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.440
 and they have a car or a seed that is 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.440
 pretty big

 1 year ago 16 years ago when 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.349
 a company that installs then came by 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.610
 drip I arrive by the micro appearance 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:36.180
 which was coincidentally the fifth then 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.889
 he arrived here he invited one to be a number of 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.710
 producers here in the area be a trip 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.350
 to israel and took him to know different 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.780
 crops 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.390
 and a crop he met and there he met my 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.130
 dad the cultivation of mango then something 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.900
 some other company that here in the area 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.130
 that they did in a few plants the 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.320
 mango they had had not made a 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.810
 project of a certain scale were 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.660
 improving the variety and quality of 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.880
 fruit the size the taste of the sight that 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.280
 has the outside of the fruit the skin and 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.620
 they got better and one when 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.920
 that I saw here in the area in the houses what 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.720
 that there was that it was seen that the handle was 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.600
 the plant did not have did not have many 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.760
 problems and adapted to the climates of the 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.000
 zone then a bit at the beginning 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.470
 we start with a trial of 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.020
 3,000 plants and well we were seeing 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.740
 that was adapted 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.740
 fairly good 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.850
