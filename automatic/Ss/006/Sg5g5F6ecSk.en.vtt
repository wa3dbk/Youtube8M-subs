00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.010
 Today we left death and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.469
 a line orly for a the most point 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
 top of the line while clearing this 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.699
 who fell 10 cm that night so 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.369
 we chased the snow to make the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.380
 place for the next one that may be 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.699
 fell that night we do not know and at the same 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.900
 time check all facilities 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 ground security 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.910
 ice cubes if in the tunnels and then 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.859
 that ice on the ground does not break 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.489
 pedal 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.489
 passage level 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.410
 and then the snow the tanner little obliged 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.489
 to mobilize reinforcements do not toast 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.890
 so that means positioning agents 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.530
 in our strategic points 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.750
 it forces us to put gear 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.840
 supervisors snow removal 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.300
 additional to power on the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.969
 region burgundy franche county allow 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.559
 railway traffic 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.920
 to circulate safely 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.930
 the problem of ice is water 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.170
 infiltrates and with the cold waiting 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.320
 the current of a possible causes 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.360
 distinctive 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 so we do the tours every day 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.810
 we break everything that is at risk 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.450
 there is also the water flowing over 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.380
 the sides and the wise she on the ground 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.890
 So we go with punch pick 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 generator sets and then my 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.759
 simply trust the for 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.189
 remove here bead of ice the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.049
 consequences of bad weather slowed down 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.829
 trains to avoid projections 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.829
 ice ballast ice and then if 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.750
 we never realize that we have 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.079
 significant snow accumulation that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.880
 prevents the traffic from going to the beginning 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.460
 probe they formed themselves on 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.700
 intervenes outside the circulations the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.000
 most of the time at night to allow 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.409
 to the morning circulations to circulate in 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.360
 all security 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.060
 you will be that a cari value arrives 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.840
 because we worked all night it's 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.840
 it's one of the great satisfactions
