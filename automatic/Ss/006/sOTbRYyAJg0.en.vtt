better than this this I was looking at

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410 
better than this this I was looking at
the<00:01:46.860> range<00:01:47.070> actually<00:01:47.460> yesterday<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:48.000> sephora

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the range actually yesterday in sephora

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.280 
the range actually yesterday in sephora
and<00:01:51.500> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> little<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.810> cool<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.140> me

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
and this is a little bit cool for me

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
and this is a little bit cool for me
even<00:01:55.619> though<00:01:55.969> if<00:01:56.969> i'm<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.240> neutral<00:01:57.719> i'm<00:01:57.840> cool

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
even though if i'm not neutral i'm cool

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.050 
even though if i'm not neutral i'm cool
so<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.590> why<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:59.009> i<00:01:59.159> were<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> matte<00:01:59.640> color<00:01:59.880> at

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
