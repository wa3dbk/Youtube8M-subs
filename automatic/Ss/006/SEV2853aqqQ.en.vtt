00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.920
 now I do change like back now 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.920
 we have because Fantino sleeps in bodies 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.920
 of televisions 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.480
 and you do not have to know santiaguito told me 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.930
 once I will invite the journal of 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.840
 mariana fabbiani 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.940
 they brought up the subject of fort was alive 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.190
 for they talked about for rendered him a lot 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.870
 they were 50 minutes talking about him 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.860
 because I said look all right I'm going 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.860
 no, never 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.380
 if the man 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.840
 singular when a theme maybe miriam 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.540
 lanzoni does not know but fancy if when 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.770
 a subject gives you a lot of stretches that 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.770
 subject and unfortunately 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.840
 there is a topic more exposed in its logic 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.670
 getting angry by waiting is a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.580
 Damned like santi de tibro says 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.470
 air and is doubly crap when 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.840
 your husband works in the channel where 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.460
 you're invited even out of respect 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 you should not mount your husband 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.930
 such a mess because somehow you 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.150
 is going to pass on to him someone is going to 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.310
 to say you create an entity that is an internal 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.440
 unnecessary he is focused on the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 premiere of animals let it quiet no 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:45.590
 it was the day to ride it starts the no 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:50.109
 it was never spoken before 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.109
 I could have made it come to the top 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.420
 that is to say 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.229
 you are afraid of truth 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.910
 verily 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.830
 and by twitter until I understood that 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.300
 I have to fight more and directly 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.220
 the graphs that I was going to discuss 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.099
 publicly with the wife of a friend what 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.510
 I say it is serious I find the 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.400
 instead of having worked in a program 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.810
 where for example me being a member 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.470
 of the program passes me programs between 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.470
 others 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.060
 woman goes to the channel where you work and 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.840
 does this quilombo to the air when you arrive 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.840
 to her 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.680
 It is also being sold with the woman 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.680
 from a friend of the moment a while ago 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.270
 with that angle 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.610
 we have to offend racing people 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.610
 talking was she the only 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.629
 to listen to me 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:30.709
 and mentioned the benefits of the product that 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.629
 lasts 20 seconds 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.609
 luckily the companies that we 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:39.189
 they accompany us tell us that they find it 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.189
 profitable and that damn happiness 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.739
 worth a lot of money 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.390
 how much is 20 seconds 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:56.659
 67 minutes that if you multiply it to 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.500
 reverse 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.500
 Santiago 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.299
 one
