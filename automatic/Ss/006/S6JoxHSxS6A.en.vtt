Hockney<00:00:49.629> was<00:00:49.660> saying<00:00:50.019> that<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:51.010> took<00:00:51.370> him<00:00:51.550> two

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
weeks to paint and yet it was

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.799 
weeks to paint and yet it was
representing<00:00:54.370> two<00:00:54.580> seconds<00:00:55.210> almost<00:00:55.540> whether

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809

being<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:38.899> hot<00:01:39.140> there<00:01:40.600> because<00:01:41.600> we<00:01:41.810> were

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
being so hot there because we were

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.840 
being so hot there because we were

resort<00:01:44.060> as<00:01:44.299> well<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:45.049> seemed<00:01:45.350> perfect<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:46.190> use

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
resort as well it seemed perfect to use

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.630 
resort as well it seemed perfect to use
that<00:01:46.850> as<00:01:47.060> an<00:01:47.240> inspiration<00:01:51.429> splash<00:01:52.429> is

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
that as an inspiration splash is

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.570 
that as an inspiration splash is
actually<00:01:53.179> lots<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:54.080> fine<00:01:54.709> lines<00:01:55.039> so<00:01:55.369> that's

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
actually lots of fine lines so that's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.669 
actually lots of fine lines so that's
where<00:01:55.759> we<00:01:55.850> took<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.209> and<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.720> yellow<00:01:57.020> diving

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
where we took that and the yellow diving

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:58.240 
where we took that and the yellow diving
board

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
board

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.460 
board
we<00:01:58.610> thought<00:01:58.819> we<00:01:59.060> souped<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.780> up<00:01:59.869> a<00:02:00.049> bit<00:02:00.080> but

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
we thought we souped it up a bit but

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.330 
we thought we souped it up a bit but
made<00:02:00.679> it<00:02:00.830> more<00:02:00.979> neon<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:03.229> just<00:02:03.649> by<00:02:03.799> printing

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
made it more neon and just by printing

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.120 
made it more neon and just by printing
it<00:02:04.490> across<00:02:05.060> part<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.840> feels<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.259> bit<00:02:06.289> to<00:02:06.950> us<00:02:07.099> a

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
it across part of it feels a bit to us a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.620 
it across part of it feels a bit to us a
little<00:02:07.310> bit<00:02:07.549> like<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.819> original<00:02:08.209> painting

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
little bit like the original painting

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.960 
little bit like the original painting
where<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.929> can<00:02:09.110> see<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.500> border<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.369> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
where you can see the border and the the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.630 
where you can see the border and the the
ground<00:02:11.560> fabric<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.709> he<00:02:12.859> painted<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.459> piece

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
ground fabric that he painted the piece

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.420 
ground fabric that he painted the piece
of<00:02:14.109> the<00:02:15.109> interesting<00:02:15.620> thing<00:02:15.799> about<00:02:15.859> Hockney

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
of the interesting thing about Hockney

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.020 
of the interesting thing about Hockney
he<00:02:16.700> moved<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.150> LA<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.200> was<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:19.010> suppose<00:02:19.700> so

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
he moved to LA and that was I suppose so

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.509 
he moved to LA and that was I suppose so
far<00:02:20.329> removed<00:02:20.720> from<00:02:21.079> Yorkshire<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.310> guess

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
far removed from Yorkshire and I guess

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.090 
far removed from Yorkshire and I guess
when<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.209> are<00:02:23.420> British<00:02:23.829> especially<00:02:24.829> I<00:02:25.040> don't

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
when you are British especially I don't

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.920 
when you are British especially I don't
