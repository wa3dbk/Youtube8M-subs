00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
use another one straight in the center

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.869 
use another one straight in the center

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
of the base another race well that

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.729

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
only have 42 percent so we must be able

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
only have 42 percent so we must be able
to<00:01:39.630> clean<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.259> base<00:01:40.409> within<00:01:40.650> 8%<00:01:41.220> maybe<00:01:41.400> my

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
to clean up this base within 8% maybe my

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.149 
to clean up this base within 8% maybe my
queen<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> all<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> work<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.770> she's

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
was in range of that Queen then she

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.930

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
this is a pretty interesting one this is

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.860 
this is a pretty interesting one this is
a<00:03:06.720> southern<00:03:07.110> teaser<00:03:07.910> not<00:03:08.910> exactly<00:03:09.480> sudden

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
a southern teaser not exactly sudden

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.910 
a southern teaser not exactly sudden
teaser<00:03:10.050> obviously<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.590> on<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.740> right<00:03:10.890> side

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
teaser obviously it's on the right side

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.030 
teaser obviously it's on the right side
but<00:03:11.610> we're<00:03:12.150> gonna<00:03:12.300> just<00:03:12.510> drop<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.020> one<00:03:13.440> dragon

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.470 
but we're gonna just drop it one dragon
on<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.160> right-hand<00:03:14.580> side<00:03:14.670> there<00:03:15.120> just

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
on the right-hand side there just

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.330 
on the right-hand side there just
because<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.930> expose<00:03:16.320> down<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.800> there's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
because that expose down and there's

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.640 
because that expose down and there's
just<00:03:17.490> like<00:03:17.640> no<00:03:17.850> air<00:03:18.030> defenses<00:03:18.540> or<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.500> arch

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
just like no air defenses or just arch

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.900 
just like no air defenses or just arch
towers<00:03:19.950> over<00:03:20.040> there<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.610> very<00:03:20.850> easy

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
towers over there so it's a very easy

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.940 
towers over there so it's a very easy
picking<00:03:21.570> they're<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.170> few<00:03:22.350> air<00:03:22.500> bombs<00:03:22.800> so

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
picking they're just a few air bombs so

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.320 
picking they're just a few air bombs so
that's<00:03:23.160> gonna<00:03:23.250> take<00:03:23.490> out<00:03:23.640> my<00:03:23.760> dragon<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.240> I'm

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
well on the base now what I'm thinking

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.670

is that I'm gonna drop some dragons at

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.830 
is that I'm gonna drop some dragons at
the<00:03:34.800> bottom<00:03:35.190> of<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.430> base<00:03:35.610> since<00:03:36.120> there's

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the bottom of the base since there's

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.570 
the bottom of the base since there's
only<00:03:36.900> basically<00:03:37.500> one<00:03:37.800> air<00:03:37.950> defense<00:03:37.980> there<00:03:38.460> I'm

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
only basically one air defense there I'm

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.130 
only basically one air defense there I'm
