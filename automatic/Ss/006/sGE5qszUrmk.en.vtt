00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
crackle or almost lightning like pattern

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.499

all<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.049> silver<00:01:46.380> areas<00:01:46.740> are<00:01:46.890> also<00:01:47.100> 3m<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.329> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
all the silver areas are also 3m so it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.990 
all the silver areas are also 3m so it
is<00:01:48.659> an<00:01:48.810> incredibly<00:01:49.470> bright<00:01:49.799> shoe<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:50.880> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
if that is the case then this would have

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.150 
if that is the case then this would have

see that it definitely has that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.300 
see that it definitely has that
old-school<00:02:21.569> vibe<00:02:21.900> about<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.800> material<00:02:23.250> of

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:46.820 
shorts go they definitely look good in
my<00:04:46.169> opinion

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
my opinion

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.680 
my opinion
you<00:04:47.070> got<00:04:47.190> those<00:04:47.310> cutouts<00:04:47.610> in<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.000> ankle<00:04:48.419> and

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
you got those cutouts in the ankle and

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.560 
you got those cutouts in the ankle and
it<00:04:49.020> is<00:04:49.169> a<00:04:49.199> training<00:04:49.650> shoe<00:04:50.070> so<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.610> obviously<00:04:51.419> is

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
it is a training shoe so it obviously is

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.600 
it is a training shoe so it obviously is
more<00:04:51.840> athletic<00:04:52.020> inspired<00:04:52.560> but<00:04:53.130> of<00:04:53.220> course<00:04:53.460> it

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
more athletic inspired but of course it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.600 
more athletic inspired but of course it
is<00:04:53.729> from<00:04:54.229> 1981<00:04:55.229> so<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.800> has<00:04:55.919> that<00:04:56.070> old-school

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
is from 1981 so it has that old-school

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.640 
is from 1981 so it has that old-school
vibe<00:04:56.850> about<00:04:57.090> it<00:04:57.270> as<00:04:57.479> well<00:04:57.720> which<00:04:58.260> personally

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
vibe about it as well which personally

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.590 
vibe about it as well which personally
I'm<00:04:58.889> a<00:04:58.919> big<00:04:59.190> fan<00:04:59.490> owner<00:04:59.729> as<00:05:00.120> far<00:05:00.300> as<00:05:00.389> comfort

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
I'm a big fan owner as far as comfort

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.090 
I'm a big fan owner as far as comfort
and<00:05:00.870> sizing<00:05:01.229> goes<00:05:01.380> they're<00:05:01.590> very<00:05:01.860> very

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
and sizing goes they're very very

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.800 
and sizing goes they're very very
comfortable<00:05:02.340> shoes<00:05:02.789> they<00:05:03.300> have<00:05:03.389> a<00:05:03.419> somewhat

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
comfortable shoes they have a somewhat

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.659 
comfortable shoes they have a somewhat
unusual<00:05:04.020> arch<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:04.770> it<00:05:04.830> feels<00:05:05.130> like<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.400> heel

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
unusual arch and it feels like the heel

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.969 
unusual arch and it feels like the heel
is<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.910> lot<00:05:06.210> higher<00:05:06.539> than<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.930> forefoot<00:05:07.380> not

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
is a lot higher than the forefoot not

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.430 
is a lot higher than the forefoot not
sure<00:05:08.220> why<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.699> but<00:05:09.690> overall<00:05:10.020> they<00:05:10.229> feel

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
sure why that is but overall they feel

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.080 
sure why that is but overall they feel
pretty<00:05:10.710> comfortable<00:05:10.860> especially<00:05:11.220> for<00:05:11.669> casual

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
pretty comfortable especially for casual

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.850 
pretty comfortable especially for casual
wear<00:05:12.240> not<00:05:12.780> sure<00:05:13.050> I<00:05:13.080> would<00:05:13.260> wear<00:05:13.440> these<00:05:13.590> as

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
wear not sure I would wear these as

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.040 
wear not sure I would wear these as
performance<00:05:14.520> shoes<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:15.180> in<00:05:15.330> terms<00:05:15.510> of<00:05:15.690> sizing

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
performance shoes and in terms of sizing

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.510 
performance shoes and in terms of sizing
I'm<00:05:16.199> wearing<00:05:16.410> my<00:05:16.500> usual<00:05:16.860> size<00:05:17.039> nine<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.490> a

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
I'm wearing my usual size nine and a

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.310 
I'm wearing my usual size nine and a
half<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.850> they<00:05:18.270> do<00:05:18.330> fit<00:05:18.630> a<00:05:18.660> little<00:05:18.960> bit<00:05:19.110> bigger

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
half and they do fit a little bit bigger

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.469 
half and they do fit a little bit bigger
than<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.710> average<00:05:19.830> nine<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.430> half<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:20.880> for

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
than the average nine and a half so for

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.820 
than the average nine and a half so for
the<00:05:21.570> most<00:05:21.720> part<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:21.990> would<00:05:22.169> recommend<00:05:22.590> staying

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
the most part I would recommend staying

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.379 
the most part I would recommend staying
true<00:05:23.010> to<00:05:23.070> size<00:05:23.340> but<00:05:23.580> if<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.760> wanted<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.090> tighter

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
true to size but if you wanted a tighter

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.330 
true to size but if you wanted a tighter
fit<00:05:24.660> you<00:05:25.110> can<00:05:25.260> definitely<00:05:25.410> go<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.800> half-size

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
fit you can definitely go a half-size

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.159 
fit you can definitely go a half-size
down<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:27.240> that's<00:05:27.300> pretty<00:05:27.510> much<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.780> as<00:05:27.900> far<00:05:28.080> as

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
down so that's pretty much it as far as

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.240 
down so that's pretty much it as far as
what<00:05:28.289> they<00:05:28.380> look<00:05:28.560> like<00:05:28.590> with<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.010> panel
