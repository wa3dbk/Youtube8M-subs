00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
rain clears away towards the east and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.880 
rain clears away towards the east and
then<00:01:28.979> we're<00:01:29.220> left<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.850> clearing<00:01:30.780> skies

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
then we're left with clearing skies

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.890 
then we're left with clearing skies
temperatures<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.520> drop<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.390> little<00:01:33.750> bit

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
temperatures will drop off a little bit

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.390 
temperatures will drop off a little bit
they<00:01:34.170> won't<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.470> desperately<00:01:35.040> low<00:01:35.189> but<00:01:35.369> still

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
they won't be desperately low but still

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
they won't be desperately low but still
quite<00:01:36.030> chilly<00:01:36.150> around<00:01:36.509> five<00:01:36.840> degrees<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.259> your

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
quite chilly around five degrees in your

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.069 
quite chilly around five degrees in your
Castle<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.920> example<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:39.030> talking<00:01:39.810> about<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
Castle for example but talking about the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.149 
Castle for example but talking about the
temperatures<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:40.740> something<00:01:41.009> that's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
temperatures that's something that's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.560 
temperatures that's something that's
certainly<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> rise<00:01:42.119> this

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
certainly going to be on the rise this

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.660 
certainly going to be on the rise this
week<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.079> gradually<00:01:43.740> turning<00:01:44.130> warmer

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
week so gradually turning warmer

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.340 
week so gradually turning warmer
especially<00:01:44.850> towards<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> end<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> week

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
especially towards the end of the week

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.319 
especially towards the end of the week
and<00:01:46.500> also<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.740> lot<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.070> humid<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.210> is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and also a lot more humid now this is

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
cool relative temperatures and see them

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.469

course of the week those blues get
washed<00:01:57.180> away<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.719> get<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> heat<00:01:58.259> coming

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
washed away and we get the heat coming

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
washed away and we get the heat coming
up<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> south<00:01:59.700> course<00:01:59.939> not<00:02:00.090> everybody

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
up from the south course not everybody

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.580 
up from the south course not everybody
likes<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> heat<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.259> certainly

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
likes the heat but it you certainly

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.350 
likes the heat but it you certainly
won't<00:02:01.680> needs<00:02:01.890> your<00:02:02.040> central<00:02:02.880> heating<00:02:03.000> on

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
won't needs your central heating on

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760 
won't needs your central heating on
during<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> night<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.110> that's<00:02:04.229> some<00:02:04.560> good

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
during the night so that's some good

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800 
during the night so that's some good
news<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.909> start<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> week<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
news but we start the week on a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.320 
news but we start the week on a
relatively<00:02:07.350> cool<00:02:07.860> note<00:02:08.160> once<00:02:08.489> again<00:02:08.879> with

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
relatively cool note once again with

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.790 
relatively cool note once again with
some<00:02:09.599> showers<00:02:09.810> around<00:02:10.289> as<00:02:10.440> well<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.770> think

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
some showers around as well but I think

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.350 
some showers around as well but I think
it'll<00:02:11.190> feel<00:02:11.400> marginally<00:02:11.819> warmer<00:02:12.150> tomorrow

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
it'll feel marginally warmer tomorrow

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.250 
it'll feel marginally warmer tomorrow
because

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
because

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.869 
because
there<00:02:13.439> will<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:13.620> more<00:02:13.950> sunshine<00:02:14.159> for<00:02:14.580> example

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
there will be more sunshine for example

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.030 
there will be more sunshine for example
18<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.330> London<00:02:15.689> around<00:02:16.110> about<00:02:16.319> 16<00:02:16.739> degrees

the high pressure which is going to

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.729 
the high pressure which is going to
bring<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.540> warmer<00:02:21.840> weather<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.349> sort<00:02:22.620> of

approaching the mid-20s with the humid
air<00:03:18.449> as<00:03:18.629> well<00:03:18.810> there<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.440> chance<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:20.069> we

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
air as well there is a chance that we

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.309 
air as well there is a chance that we
could<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.730> some<00:03:21.150> thunderstorms<00:03:21.230> brewing<00:03:22.230> as

well so two things will be watching the
warmth<00:03:24.629> and<00:03:24.750> also<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.260> Icelandic<00:03:25.769> volcano
