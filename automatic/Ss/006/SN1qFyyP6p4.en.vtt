00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.900

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.460
 that's what having the joystick has 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.470

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.030
 entourage tag that was what is called 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.160
 fly to the beach 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.600

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.520
 fly to the one you want to stop pulling 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.320
 green car falling green lettuce because

 nothing because they call me the one of shenzhen 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.659
 closer let's go let's go let's stop 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.339
 unearth things and we go to mica windows 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.140
 for your father as a four-month subway 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.280
 boy I give you life, okay, guys 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.270
 quiet, quiet, not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.440
 be aggressive I really am a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.400
 peaceful what happens when I get the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.470
 moral a little bit I put a little 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.700
 aggressive there's an uncle just see the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.430
 point that all kid 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.140
 let's go if we would escape indicative if we 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.700
 we totally escape stain there is a 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.700
 you have escapes us totally has 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.030
 put yesterday in the fifth march has 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.030
 state 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.009
 if I start to look back while 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.149
 I'm driving on a beach 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.630
 more normal is that there is some moment in 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.630
 which the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.130
 I love I love that I exploded 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.200
 proximity payroll the truth that the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.670
 sir he came for the army I fall very 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.970
 well the truth I honestly fall super 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.220
 It's worth comrades and comrades 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.780
 that I put station2 here you can 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.890
 partner here I do not know he had more 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.890
 followed me because he trusts me but 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.030
 Wait, I can do more pine 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.310
 Calm quiet kids this 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.119
 race a little unruly but but I 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.119
 I think we can win 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.000
 worth 13 points out of 30 and just finished 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.190
 the first one seems to me quite correct 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.570
 the truth that seems seems very good 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.220
 that I put him a show an uncle in 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.110
 the mouth and the one that disappears knows in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.270
 plan using the ability of goku 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.470
 is of instantaneous transmission is 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.510
 there's a lot of a transmission agreement 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.980
 snapshot was called the the power that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.760
 to occupy marine teleportation 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.590
 What memory do I fear? 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.400
 I want to be second at least the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.290
 first who first gives his place if 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.110
 you do not want me to target you 11 4 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.640
 It's worth it seems that the guy resists 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.730
 the mind that is in front if we throw it 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.599
 of 4 and there's nothing you beat me 4 15 4 a 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.370
 it comes before half this 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.870
 unfortunate this does not end that it is 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.819
 I want the rematch in this same race 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.579
 because I want to win in the village 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.079
 towards the beach because if it even seems 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.940
 that I will continue and return as you are 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.230
 watching and has appeared in plan in format 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.760
 cockroach knows employee have given the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.470
 back because I do not know but I do 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.329
 like to look like this I tell you manners and 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.400
 see how we are now given at the moment 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.400
 what we have to try is to be more 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.319
 and I think we're going to pass it on and 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.579
 Milan has egg white I am the 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.010
 typical white eggs that same 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.560
 white than summer white not the 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.909
 white egg is like a white more 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.819
 rustic you know that the white fridge already 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.599
 you understand, it's worth an eye 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.040
 ok we have dropped a plan as a 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.000
 Toast knows turning around I'm not going to 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.560
 burst I will not burst because 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.060
 we are very far from the post as it was 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.470
 part of another sense from the first 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.269
 point and see a little bit of penilla know 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.739
 what rules he had is with things 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.569
 of old sensors has gone busted 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.650
 why not but nobody is mosquitoes the 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.150
 same follows before it is titled 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.379
 coincidence you know but now I'm not going to 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.590
 have the same mistakes as before 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.359
 Crush against that curb or jump by 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.099
 where I should not 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:04:00.620
 Oh, my God, it's worth, I do not remember the 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:04.519
 travel that used tests before in the 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.170
 same place you have to catch I think that 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.299
 does not have this custom I think not 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.650
 has custom car so 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.790
 we can catch him he believed 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.950
 go boy there is nothing lost yet 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.780
 in opens another and also the uncle as a 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.609
 first he knows that the way goes first 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.859
 only I know what the one who has just 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.569
 hit perfect here here is very slow 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.939
 because if we turn over there it's perfect 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:28.759
 20 points are missing 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.990
 the curves kid and we also have a 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.550
 car customizes so we run a thousand 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.569
 trillions of times more than having 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.819
 missions you do not know but a little more if 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.110
 you wait 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:42.460
 let's go call me the king of this town 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.770
 yes I know it like the palm of my hand 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.330
 come on let's go to all that forward theme 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.370
 nothing if I have it to five seconds 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.580
 uncle five seconds I'm five 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.090
 seconds of the boys 123 and caixabank to 25 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.819
 seconds 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.560
 how I put proximity mine threw him 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.610
 a tortillas to the face nothing gave the mind 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.500
 so in front of the goal if in front 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.200
 surely the goal is macho 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.670
 is there in front male does not beat you 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.000
 I will never be able to win this race 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.680
 Really guys it's amazing 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.100
 impossible uncle always good you see yourself escapes 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.100
 amazing
