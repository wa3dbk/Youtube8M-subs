00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.820
 with assassin's creed rock comes on the 13th 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.199
 november the last part of the action 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.699
 adventures for the old consoles 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.529
 Generation on the market 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.320
 pressure is supposed to be the connection between 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.359
 Assassin's creed 3 and black flag 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.150
 produce and at the same time the 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.980
 complete hamburger and all that 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.020
 during a destructive war 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.430
 pretty much to do for a game like that 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.769
 almost in the shadow of the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.559
 At the same time, Assassin's creed appears 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.930
 unity is as the name suggests 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.510
 we are in this part of the rascal because 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.820
 patrick cormack starts as 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.500
 Assassin returns to the order 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.510
 a serious fate that 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.550
 move towards and find themselves in the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.219
 Templar again chase order is clear 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.260
 to the Assassins north of North America 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.850
 smashed and thus his 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.850
 to destroy former brothers 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.030
 he does that as in the black flag 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.220
 High lake 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.290
 This time, however, not in the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.690
 picturesque caribbean but in the rough 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.760
 Atlantic in the battles on the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.240
 open sea is geballert what the stuff 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.980
 keeps 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.260
 but not only the French fleet 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.300
 believe in it too bases on 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.040
 The country is attacking here too 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.080
 we sail around the fortifications and 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.950
 straighten our fire strategically 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.690
 important points 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.880
 after we have their four 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.280
 defense towers have been destroyed 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.280
 Our enemies are defenseless 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.000
 that is not so easy 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.400
 in the bombing we have both the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.440
 distance as well as the movement of ours 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.610
 note ship 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.410
 besides, we can do the french ones 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.450
 laws also weaken that we 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.520
 for example, break into their warehouses 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.010
 and their warehouses are learning as usual 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.750
 Here we have several options 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.610
 Either we agree with the post before 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.710
 violence and just beat each one 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.960
 poor from the alarm bell wants to ring 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.700
 or we benefit from ours 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.380
 Assassins training and stroking 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.510
 Secretly quietly in the camp 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.490
 lure the warehouse manager into a trap 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.490
 and take his keys off 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.939
 then we swing back into the 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.069
 Baumwipfel and so get to the other 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.170
 end of the camp the guards in front of the 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.269
 Warehouse we can with anesthetic arrow 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.510
 from our all purpose shotgun harmless 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.510
 do 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.599
 while the three gentlemen are peaceful 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.290
 sleep, we want peace in all the 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.290
 camp out 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.720
 and should someone do something 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.820
 you can catch that up then 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.080
 the good old assassin art with the 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.080
 to get rid of double crime 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.500
 next to the sleeping cartridges we have 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.630
 yet not quite so over another 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.090
 Gentle distraction means the berserker 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.740
 Grenades give off a poison that people 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.480
 to get obsessed by the 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.060
 to run and everything in her 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.320
 encircle directly into one 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.030
 in troops have shot the guard 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:33.610
 confused dominions once with 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:35.170
 self-employed the poison gas can 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.210
 but also used against civilians 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.590
 For example, if we are not from 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.450
 snipers want to be discovered 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.490
 We attract some of the first watch 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.920
 once by marauding citizens of 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.600
 away from her sight 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.190
 Colleagues we can then get in 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.190
 all peace individually button 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.459
 city outpost bombed the camp 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.349
 emptied and the guards have defeated us 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.959
 our mission is fulfilled by the base 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.940
 again belongs to us assassin's creed pressure 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.040
 likes with all the vortex around the adventure 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.900
 colleague unity sink a little bit 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.299
 you should underestimate the last one 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.160
 But that's not the reason why 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.320
 popular sea battles from black flag 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.240
 combined with the new weapons and the 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.669
 Change of perspective from Assassin to 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.979
 templar baroque to a successful 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.979
 last title for the old consoles
