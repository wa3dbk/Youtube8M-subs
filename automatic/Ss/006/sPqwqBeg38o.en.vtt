00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
we've got my notes in front of me let's

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.370 
we've got my notes in front of me let's
jump<00:00:34.860> straight<00:00:35.190> into<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> action<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> first

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
jump straight into the action so first

jump straight into the action so first
up<00:00:37.820> improved<00:00:38.820> community<00:00:39.390> creations<00:00:40.020> server

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
up improved community creations server

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.620 
up improved community creations server
performance<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.760> server<00:00:42.030> performance<00:00:42.240> in

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
performance so the server performance in

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.450 
performance so the server performance in
community<00:00:43.110> questions<00:00:43.470> in<00:00:43.650> general<00:00:43.950> has<00:00:44.310> been

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
community questions in general has been

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.490 
community questions in general has been
improved<00:00:44.880> basically<00:00:45.630> this<00:00:45.750> must<00:00:46.050> mean<00:00:46.260> now

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
improved basically this must mean now

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.620 
improved basically this must mean now
downloading<00:00:47.400> and<00:00:47.520> uploading<00:00:47.580> to<00:00:48.090> community

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
downloading and uploading to community

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.090 
downloading and uploading to community
creations<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> lot<00:00:49.470> smoother<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
creations will be a lot smoother and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.790 
creations will be a lot smoother and
easier<00:00:50.220> and<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.700> won't<00:00:51.450> get<00:00:51.600> kicked<00:00:52.080> as<00:00:52.260> much

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
easier and you won't get kicked as much

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.710 
easier and you won't get kicked as much
I<00:00:53.160> find<00:00:54.150> that<00:00:54.540> in<00:00:54.900> double<00:00:55.230> w12<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.040> managed<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
I find that in double w12 I managed to

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.850 
I find that in double w12 I managed to
access<00:00:57.720> community<00:00:58.170> questions<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> lot<00:00:58.710> better

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
access community questions a lot better

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.310 
access community questions a lot better
with<00:00:59.070> wider<00:00:59.340> connection<00:00:59.790> so<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.330> suggest<00:01:01.200> if

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
with wider connection so I suggest if

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.219 
with wider connection so I suggest if
you're<00:01:01.410> using<00:01:01.560> wireless<00:01:02.480> try<00:01:03.480> wide<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:04.019> you

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you're using wireless try wide if you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.739 
you're using wireless try wide if you
can<00:01:04.499> but<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> hundred<00:01:06.689> percent

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:06.749 
can but if you have a hundred percent

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:08.660 
can but if you have a hundred percent
signal<00:01:07.289> strength<00:01:07.560> than<00:01:07.770> wireless<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.310> alright

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
signal strength than wireless is alright

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.510 
signal strength than wireless is alright
but<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.179> heard<00:01:09.509> about<00:01:09.539> 87<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.859> it<00:01:11.159> wasn't

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
but I heard about 87 so it wasn't

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.270 
but I heard about 87 so it wasn't
working<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.850> well<00:01:11.969> as<00:01:12.439> obviously<00:01:13.439> hundred

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
working as well as obviously hundred

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
working as well as obviously hundred
percent<00:01:14.520> why<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.789> was<00:01:15.149> so<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.479> highly<00:01:16.020> recommend

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
percent why it was so I highly recommend

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.200 
percent why it was so I highly recommend
wide<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:17.039> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.219> use<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.700> makes

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
wide if you're going to use it it makes

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.469 
wide if you're going to use it it makes
a<00:01:18.420> big<00:01:18.749> difference<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.469> did<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.799> me<00:01:19.829> anyway

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
a big difference it did for me anyway

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
a big difference it did for me anyway
next<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.499> online<00:01:22.649> improvement

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
next up this is online improvement

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.940 
next up this is online improvement
number<00:01:23.369> two<00:01:23.539> latency<00:01:24.539> improvements<00:01:25.259> for

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
number two latency improvements for

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.889 
number two latency improvements for
better<00:01:26.189> gameplay<00:01:26.520> performance<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.390> basically

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
better gameplay performance so basically

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.690 
better gameplay performance so basically
this<00:01:28.020> means<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.469> we<00:01:28.649> less<00:01:28.829> latency<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.579> you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
this means that we less latency when you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.149 
this means that we less latency when you
are<00:01:29.850> participating<00:01:29.999> in<00:01:30.539> an<00:01:30.659> online<00:01:30.810> match<00:01:31.289> so

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
are participating in an online match so

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.120 
are participating in an online match so
you<00:01:32.219> will<00:01:32.819> not<00:01:33.049> obviously<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.289> too<00:01:34.710> much<00:01:34.829> lag

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you will not obviously see too much lag

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.910 
you will not obviously see too much lag
I<00:01:35.569> don't<00:01:36.569> know<00:01:36.630> they<00:01:36.749> say<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.499> this<00:01:37.799> too

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
I don't know they say this but this too

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.559 
I don't know they say this but this too
probably<00:01:38.069> will<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.429> a<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:38.700> bit<00:01:38.909> depending

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
probably will be a little bit depending

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.779 
probably will be a little bit depending
on<00:01:39.719> region<00:01:39.929> so<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.679> you're<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.340> Australia

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
on region so if you're here in Australia

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.520 
on region so if you're here in Australia
like<00:01:41.969> myself<00:01:42.179> try<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:42.929> get<00:01:43.020> an<00:01:43.109> Australian

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
like myself try and get an Australian

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.969 
like myself try and get an Australian
match<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.219> pretty<00:01:44.850> tough<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.450> but

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
match which is pretty tough to do but

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.139 
match which is pretty tough to do but
otherwise<00:01:46.979> Americans<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.609> it<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.819> lot<00:01:47.969> easier

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
otherwise Americans have it a lot easier

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.989 
otherwise Americans have it a lot easier
than<00:01:48.479> us<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.679> latency<00:01:50.249> has<00:01:50.459> apparently<00:01:50.729> been

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
than us so latency has apparently been

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.440 
than us so latency has apparently been

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
but probably the second biggest

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.680
