that's<00:03:14.280> kind<00:03:14.520> of<00:03:14.580> strange<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:16.970> that's<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
that's kind of strange but that's the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.170 
that's kind of strange but that's the
concept<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.830> execution<00:03:20.610> maybe<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:21.030> doing

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
concept of the execution maybe I'm doing

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.610 
concept of the execution maybe I'm doing
it<00:03:21.330> wrong<00:03:21.510> let's<00:03:22.500> go<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:22.890> way<00:03:23.160> with<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.580> oh

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
it wrong let's go this way with it oh

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.740 
it wrong let's go this way with it oh
okay<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:26.610> cat<00:03:26.849> is<00:03:26.880> supposed<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.270> be<00:03:27.330> upset<00:03:27.569> now

okay the cat is supposed to be upset now
maybe<00:03:28.190> I'm<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.430> think<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.910> was<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.150> other<00:03:30.270> way

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
maybe I'm not think it was the other way

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.930 
maybe I'm not think it was the other way
anyway<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.260> figure<00:03:32.069> it<00:03:32.160> out<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.459> was<00:03:32.580> nice<00:03:32.760> as

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
anyway I figure it out it was nice as

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.420 
anyway I figure it out it was nice as
they<00:03:33.060> included<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:34.110> know<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:35.069> on<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
packaging so I think that's a cute

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.550 
packaging so I think that's a cute
strange<00:03:37.410> crazy-looking<00:03:38.310> cat<00:03:38.519> but<00:03:39.180> um<00:03:39.560> can't
