00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello from los angeles if you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.339
 going to live abroad then you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.839
 you need actually the very place 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.839
 where do you collect them and 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.900
 apartments are different but unites them 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.630
 almost always the one they are not 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.210
 furnished you have nothing to sleep with you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.359
 no cabinets no bedside cabinets 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.400
 there is nothing the price of a two-room apartment 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.990
 apartments can range from a thousand 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.160
 dollars but if it's very lucky yes 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.620
 it probably can be attributed to the minuses 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.260
 Now about the pros of every building there 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.760
 a place that saves you from want 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.360
 buy a washing machine it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.399
 laundry 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.170
 you take a few coins 25 cents 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.289
 insert it here and cover 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.910
 underwear and everything just underwear can be left 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.800
 come for him at least in the evening nobody 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.180
 can also take unconditional pluses 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.180
 carry here n 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.520
 although honestly here it is not at all 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.270
 rarity in any more or less normal 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.230
 building 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.410
 be sure to have a pool door at all 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.090
 cardboard just a foot you can hit it 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.640
 the whole joke will open wide 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.410
 that they do not steal here and the whole emphasis on it 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.240
 And still American in homes allowed 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.830
 hold a weapon if you enter 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.880
 private territory of some person he 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.550
 you can shoot 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.350
 subsequently saying justifies that he 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.310
 I climbed into my private territory and 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.580
 I also wanted to rob the following scheme 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.820
 equally absolutely for all building 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.340
 basement takes parks when there is a poet 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.440
 traffic jams left cars 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.610
 one side of the road in the parking lot 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.630
 there are garbage cans 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:47.460
 and there are tenants in our building who donâ€™t 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:53.110
 pay for housing on Pushkin's tales 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.030
 oddly else but return to 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.800
 topical furniture can of course 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.970
 walk the streets and probably through 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.670
 some time you find some 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.130
 an old sofa that you put but with 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.270
 the other side can go along with it 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.979
 bring bedbugs 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.349
 so it was decided to go to 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.270
 furniture store and shop there but about 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.270
 this i will tell next time bye
