00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.780
 why did you choose the training to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.040
 distance 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.050
 so I chose the training to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.300
 distance because I live alternately 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.710
 darron so it was a lot more 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.450
 convenient for me it saved me from doing 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.810
 the round trip every day to come 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.110
 do the preparation in face-to-face and also 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.239
 for the benefit of my son because 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.680
 I had just been fired and 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.180
 blow that allowed me to do and the preparation 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.500
 and enjoy my son his 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.930
 school activities of power 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.289
 support output in school here that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.090
 allowed me to communicate to orange 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.629
 not necessarily chosen the training to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.969
 distance 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.730
 at the beginning I wanted to do went back in 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.769
 presential 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.469
 but there was more class with the 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.489
 blow I came to see a trainer who 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.230
 will hesitate to laprade locally and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.089
 final I am delighted because I was able to 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.120
 while being at home 1 million 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.870
 eur 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.390
 I could work hours 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.770
 staggered so here I chose the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.510
 training 10 years because a training 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.490
 that allowed morale to come back to me 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.170
 in the bath very easily done 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.360
 quietly I did not want to 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.729
 do a face-to-face training and 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.590
 parvis to find me with people 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.650
 maybe a bit too schooly and that's it 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.030
 allowed me to work at my own pace 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.680
 and if the grape shot this morning aurel 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.800
 maintains the evening we're working on it there 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.030
 is the evening and so do national everything to 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.720
 part of it could end up 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.160
 precisely there the pace of work 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.750
 I chose distance learning 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.820
 because in fact I work I am 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.979
 employee in a company and I do not 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.580
 could not do my training again 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.550
 presential 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.860
 so I inquired when I 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.990
 called ten sentences and here we will talk about 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.509
 the aef will have adea at 10 years so it has me 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.190
 following interested as I do not want me 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.509
 release here I was working full 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.030
 time so here I managed to do not 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.360
 my employer make me finance the the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.360
 prepa 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.490
 do you think it is possible 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.200
 to do group work at 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.369
 distance 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.069
 so I think quite possible 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.150
 that we have made it entirely possible to 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.310
 carry out group work 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.069
 you have to be a little bit hastier 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.430
 must be requested to organize a donation and 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.780
 the purpose of precisely this of this 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.150
 organized training 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.959
 so that's quite possible but it 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.020
 may need a little more guidance 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.550
 so yes we did it especially on 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.810
 themes 5 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.160
 social me is my break to pose 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.790
 particular problem 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.360
 it is true that it enables account 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.360
 I call can help to make a 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.450
 record together we know that sometimes that 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.720
 can be shifted by hand but a 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.770
 part the other a little bit later me by 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.080
 example I had taken a little bit of 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.760
 late on some themes and I was able to 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.000
 catch up easily and even contribute 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.860
 a little later how do you 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.540
 found educational activities in 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:17.690
 very diverse line vary the saying that 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.940
 I also liked to see 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.940
 videos of professionals 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.790
 profession the constraints of the 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.590
 profession 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.970
 so I found rewarding I 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.230
 does a training to discover this 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.510
 job to say what this job 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.100
 of caregiver and I found all the 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.770
 words and activities like to give 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.690
 to do good a lot learned and have 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.370
 allowed to discover realize that 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.510
 it was really the job for which 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.300
 I was done then I found that 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.660
 all activities been rewarding 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.120
 and constructive 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.980
 after my level of 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.440
 themes it's true that we've talked about 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.080
 main themes with regard to the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.080
 close to professions in the professional field 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.860
 it was it was pretty rare these 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.780
 musical themes done with everything and not 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.780
 necessarily all the time 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.780
 it was good in the heart what was there 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.550
 in the form of a questionnaire 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.930
 self-assessment it was not me I 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.270
 think it was that level 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.370
 there was little bit that's all 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.789
 types of homework to be done is duty 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:40.930
 are indeed well detailed 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:40.930
 two torrid lots to him to suck me that 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.710
 matched what I was looking for 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.030
 what did you think of the technical module 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.580
 in the classroom and seeing that we 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.530
 did not know it dares hardly better 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.710
 but already know and make a 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.009
 exchange and support each other and 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.389
 to give in what was very very 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:08.330
 enriching extra extra because of 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:12.080
 blow it puts faces on me 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.779
 photos we can really know each other 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.539
 there is the culmination of 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:20.689
 thing and at the same time the courses with 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.090
 the teachers down is due a lot of 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.930
 simulations we can put ourselves in the place 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.620
 of the jury to put in the place the demand 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.550
 of the candidate and 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.860
 a good gang versys big discount 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.260
 question 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:42.419
 grosjean or the agent in the head in 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:46.330
 burgundy and in the end it's a lot 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.669
 do you have anything else to add to me 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.550
 something to add I would say that the 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.870
 foad and it still allowed me 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.729
 to already learn to work in a team 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.070
 so what can be important 6 by 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.120
 relation to our friendship to learn to 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.770
 to be rigorous and to organize but me 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.690
 I would say to everyone 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.960
 do not hesitate to do this training 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.970
 this is not necessary we must start 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.669
 we have returned from the trainers 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.020
 are there to guide us and we 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.600
 help even it's not dramatic 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.419
 especially for me here they answer to 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.440
 your questions 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.060
 but yes I can I say that's 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.580
 that me is a training that goes 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.840
 common completely and totally that 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.449
 I found a lot of people listen 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.530
 only when I had a technical problem 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.039
 I called here and that there was 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.690
 problems that I also learned to 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.070
 to the people because in 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.900
 the group one can also discover a 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.130
 group changer we can discover the 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.440
 people with whom we could wait 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.700
 confused and that after finding all these 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.160
 people once one is like himself 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.740
 made an idea during the training at 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.960
 distance to find him face-to-face 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.400
 I'm doing a lot of good so that's okay 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.669
 learned a lot I really liked this 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.669
 foundation
