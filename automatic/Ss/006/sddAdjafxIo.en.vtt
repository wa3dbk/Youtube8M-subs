 good words to talk to them 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.469

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.820

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:21.750

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.580

 guardian of soil and rocks and and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.480
 all life that flows from it and springs from it 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.750
 no ace has seen it for centuries 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.579
 but she is supposed to live there 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.440
 she is very powerful connected to the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.570

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.059
 unicorns and she will listen to you 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.270
 believe no but she may listen to you 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270
 you 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.320
 were you going dangerous it was 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.879

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.550
 can reduce an entire mountain into one 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.690
 pile of gravel with one hoof 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.739
 I pulled it back into the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 dangerous category 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.270
 it's one of 5 listen there is some 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.270
 thing there 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.479
 chao felt something too 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.150
 she is the unicorn of the earth 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.380
 as usual it is always useful to 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.030
 to have him as a companion all is well 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.149
 we are here to ask you to 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.149
 ugly 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.520
 yes I understand all this and you can 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.530
 call me the puny elf so much you 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.179
 want but you have to listen to what 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.350
 I have to say because probably that 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.350
 emptying the horns depends
