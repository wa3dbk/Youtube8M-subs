00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.780
 well done good afternoon you have the 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.570
 equipment confirmed to play with rivero 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.350
 there are still some doubts 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.210
 no no no no no define 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.700
 and nothing is still not that some doubts 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.510
 if not 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.510
 just tomorrow 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.510
 I'm going to define the team that goes through your 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.400
 head these moments in the previous one where 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.230
 there is doubt in the middle especially 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.040
 bet on slim 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.040
 no no 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.690
 they are not doubts but to define what is 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.510
 whatever 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.160
 that what I eat what we're going to do 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.540
 and what 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.670
 which I think the best to raise in 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.940
 river court from that still 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.820
 we have 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.530
 until tomorrow at noon so there's 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.629
 we're just going to define the team 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.220
 also that will go based on the losses that 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.050
 has a river like 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.900
 by sanchez morÃ¡n 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.290
 let's keep thinking until tomorrow 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.290
 noon 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.320
 in what place of importance you put them 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.090
 this game that has touched him 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.980
 play in the tournament taking into account 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.660
 that 18 years ago you do not win in 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.660
 court to river and those issues 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.600
 it's an important match like how 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.600
 all of us who have been facing 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.240
 one week 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.840
 prepared purely and exclusively for 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.120
 river in the way that also what 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.850
 we have been doing so well as I say 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.750
 always today putting the head in this 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.200
 party knowing that he is a great rival in 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.470
 his court 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.790
 and good one also thinking about 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.470
 where can we talk 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.470
 to better exploit our virtues 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.500
 counteract all the good that can 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.090
 get to laugh 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.950
 you do not have the equipment but the list 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.330
 of concentrates I now have you defined 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.510
 pretty much what will happen with bar are 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.810
 two are the same 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.960
 the only change is this that will come out 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.760
 barrientos 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.040
 and we enter all of the list of 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.379
 concentrates 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.780
 chacho in regards to river de 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.400
 according to what we were informed is going to 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.980
 have a base very similar to the one 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.840
 played in the cup 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.209
 you would have preferred a team 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.640
 alternative or the wear that suffers 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.879
 a week may end up being a 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.560
 Advantage at the end due to the physical effort 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.580
 do not play with river in top court 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.580
 it does not bring you any advantage 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.550
 I think 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.350
 they are players who will be heights of 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.030
 fact 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.030
 then seen with racing 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.940
 if that was the alternative team of the 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.190
 it was a great team too so more 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.110
 beyond it I tell you what can get 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.060
 Being a river we continue with the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.239
 with the same mentality 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.590
 and with the same idea of thinking over 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.800
 all the things that we have 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.750
 to do things well and always 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.940
 thinking that we depend on what 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.440
 let's make us at stake see three 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.700
 points as always but taking into 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.190
 account the central goal to do 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.490
 protagonist and this is a direct rival 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.000
 in the fight has a plus this match 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.440
 if we as we said before we are going to 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.500
 keep the idea 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.980
 our idea forever 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.250
 and looking for the other point so 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.569
 beyond the way the systems or how 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.540
 headquarters 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:59.200
 in our head is is every game 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.800
 is winning then you can give it 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.840
 but I think I'm following 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.450
 what we are speaking from the 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.630
 start the tournament following the form 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.490
 idea the proposal 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.570
 It will be much easier not only 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.570
 three points any match
