00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
Evan Hart packed it's pretty much the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and stuff like that so it's a very good

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060 
and stuff like that so it's a very good
character<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.719> pretty<00:00:37.020> much<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
character to like pretty much out in the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.220 
character to like pretty much out in the
game<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:39.000> kind<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> fits<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.719> well<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
game it kind of fits in really well and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260 
game it kind of fits in really well and
of<00:00:40.860> course<00:00:40.980> I'm<00:00:41.340> very<00:00:41.370> limited<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
of course I'm very limited to the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.940 
of course I'm very limited to the
resources<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.780> have<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.649> say<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
resources I have and I know I say that

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.670 
resources I have and I know I say that
quite<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> lot<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.910> simply<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:45.930> there's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
quite a lot but simply because there's

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.900 
quite a lot but simply because there's
not<00:00:46.829> very<00:00:46.860> many<00:00:47.100> settings<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.789> play

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
not very many settings you can play

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.000 
not very many settings you can play
around<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.180> MMO<00:00:48.660> games<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.140> general<00:00:49.530> now<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
around with MMO games in general now I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.170 
around with MMO games in general now I
know<00:00:50.190> there's<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> few<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> games<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
know there's a few of the games that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.740 
know there's a few of the games that
quite<00:00:52.940> compact<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.300> comes<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> like

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
quite compact when it comes to like

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.389 
quite compact when it comes to like
seconds<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.350> playing<00:00:55.800> about<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.129> them<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
seconds and playing about with them and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.799 
seconds and playing about with them and
trying<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.910> make<00:00:57.059> new<00:00:57.270> characters<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
trying to like make new characters and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.660 
trying to like make new characters and
stuff<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.859> I'll<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.219> cause<00:00:59.489> I'd

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
stuff like that but I'll just cause I'd

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
stuff like that but I'll just cause I'd
kind<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.000> lacks<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.719> sense<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
kind of lacks in that sense because you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.319 
kind of lacks in that sense because you
can<00:01:01.649> only<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.010> use<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> triangle<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> go

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
can only like use a triangle for the go

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
can only like use a triangle for the go
soft<00:01:03.690> angular<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.470> things<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.189> that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
soft angular and things like that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.039 
soft angular and things like that
there's<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.640> very<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.090> many<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.540> presets

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
there's not very very many like presets

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
there's not very very many like presets
or<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.619> play<00:01:08.189> around<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.670> there's<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
or and I play around with there's a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.020 
or and I play around with there's a
couple<00:01:09.720> there<00:01:10.260> wasn't<00:01:10.530> really<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.950> many<00:01:11.250> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
couple there wasn't really that many so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.000 
couple there wasn't really that many so
I<00:01:12.060> decided<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> sort<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> best<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.799> could

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
I decided to sort of do the best I could

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.640 
I decided to sort of do the best I could
with<00:01:14.070> what<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:16.020> reckon<00:01:16.290> he<00:01:16.380> turned

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
with what I have and I reckon he turned

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.390 
with what I have and I reckon he turned
out<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:17.460> decent<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.270> fair<00:01:18.920> they<00:01:19.920> had

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
out pretty decent to be fair they had

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.980 
out pretty decent to be fair they had
being<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> hairs<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:21.780> too

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
being one of them like the hairs not too

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.899 
being one of them like the hairs not too
bad<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.590> course<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.280> completely

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
bad of course it's not like completely

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.539 
bad of course it's not like completely
spot-on<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:25.439> he<00:01:25.770> looks<00:01:26.040> pretty<00:01:26.369> decent

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
spot-on but he looks pretty decent

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.539 
spot-on but he looks pretty decent
nonetheless<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:28.070> yeah<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.250> said<00:01:29.460> he's

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
nonetheless and yeah like I said he's

nonetheless and yeah like I said he's
one<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> my<00:01:29.820> favorite<00:01:30.150> characters<00:01:30.360> anyway<00:01:30.689> I'm

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
one of my favorite characters anyway I'm

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.880 
one of my favorite characters anyway I'm
just<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.229> over<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.439> we'll<00:01:31.560> look<00:01:31.680> through

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
just going over that we'll look through

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.200 
just going over that we'll look through
the<00:01:32.040> hair<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.490> whether<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.970> find

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the hair see whether you can find

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.810 
the hair see whether you can find
anything<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.049> little<00:01:34.140> bit<00:01:34.290> decent<00:01:34.790> yeah<00:01:35.790> I

think I'll have to go back and that's
the<00:01:37.020> only<00:01:37.350> hairstyle<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.250> looks<00:01:38.430> decent<00:01:38.640> to
