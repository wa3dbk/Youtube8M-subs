00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:11.055
 Welcome to the World of Warcraft patch 6.0 survival guide. 

00:00:11.548 --> 00:00:15.123
 In this video you will see a brief summary of the most important changes 

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:18.844
 of Patch 6.0.2: The Iron Tide. 

00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:22.931
 To get all the information of what is happening 

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:25.838
 the complete notes of the patch 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.364
 They are available at worldofwarcraft.com. 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.530
 The first thing that you will see when you log in this new patch 

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:35.814
 is that many of the character models have been updated. 

00:00:36.462 --> 00:00:39.508
 Human models, orcs, dwarves, undead 

00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:43.968
 night elves, tauren, gnomes, trolls and draeneis 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.664
 they have received a massive visual update 

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.843
 with high-quality models, fluid animations 

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.159
 and more detailed options for facial personalization. 

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:55.975
 We have done our best to make your characters 

00:00:56.175 --> 00:00:58.313
 look as much as possible to the original 

00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:00.938
 but if they are not completely satisfied 

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:04.134
 can go to the nearest hairdresser to change the cut 

00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:07.838
 accessories or even check the new facial options. 

00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:12.504
 Since this patch is prior to the expansion Warlords of Draenor 

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:14.387
 you will find previous content 

00:01:14.587 --> 00:01:17.196
 with a first encounter with the Iron Horde. 

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:20.954
 The Iron Horde has begun its invasion in the Blasted Lands 

00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:24.740
 and the Alliance and the Horde are taking their first steps to stop it. 

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:29.765
 There are level 90 quests to reject them and get special rewards 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.075
 as the mascot Young iron star or the title "of the Iron Vanguard". 

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.685
 An updated special version of level 90 

00:01:36.885 --> 00:01:40.353
 of Upper Blackrock Summit will also be available. 

00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:44.028
 That version, in addition to the rewards of The Blasted Lands 

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:47.148
 is only available until the expansion is launched 

00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:49.393
 So be sure to check them! 

00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:53.523
 The next thing you will discover is what we call "Pruning skills". 

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:57.076
 With the passage of time, we have added more skills to each class 

00:01:57.276 --> 00:02:01.229
 to the point that we run out of space in the action bars. 

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:03.930
 With Warlords of Draenor and patch 6.0 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
 we wanted to concentrate the skills of each specialty to their style of play 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.378
 and that each spell was to be fun and interesting 

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.447
 not just another button to press. 

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.568
 Some are already only available for certain specialties 

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:18.802
 and others were completely eliminated. 

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:21.917
 We also deal with the skills of crowd control 

00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:25.267
 and we reduced them considerably, especially in PvP 

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:26.756
 where it can be frustrating 

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:30.050
 lose control of the character for long periods of time. 

00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:34.863
 The 6.0 patch also includes major changes to the equipment. 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.557
 The biggest of them is what we call "Change of statistics". 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.183
 Each expansion exponentially increases the figures 

00:02:42.383 --> 00:02:46.678
 both in the equipment and in the damage and healing that they receive and inflict. 

00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:49.475
 We wanted to reduce these numbers a little 

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:52.982
 so we have adjusted the equipment of previous expansions 

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:55.487
 so that they increase at a more reasonable rate. 

00:02:55.768 --> 00:02:59.271
 The end result is that they will see lower numbers in the equipment 

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:01.926
 and in the amount of damage or healing. 

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.128
 They will also have fewer health points 

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:06.781
 although they are still somewhat tall 

00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:08.852
 to make the least important explosion damage 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.849
 especially in PvP. 

00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:14.609
 Do not worry, we have also adjusted to all the creatures of the game 

00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:18.424
 so you are still as effective against them as before. 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.983
 Apart from the "Change of statistics", we have added and eliminated some. 

00:03:24.462 --> 00:03:27.257
 Blow, skill, dodge and stop 

00:03:27.497 --> 00:03:30.798
 they have been eliminated from the equipment to the detriment of new ones: 

00:03:31.152 --> 00:03:34.241
 Armor, Multigoll and Versatility Bonus. 

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:38.620
 Multigoll allows damaging spells or healing spells to be activated multiple times 

00:03:38.888 --> 00:03:41.958
 while Versatility will increase the damage and healing 

00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:44.479
 and the damage received is reduced. 

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:48.234
 If you do not know what statistics to pursue, look at your spellbook 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.466
 each specialization has a passive 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.538
 which gives a base benefit to a secondary statistic. 

00:03:54.738 --> 00:03:59.191
 Armor Bonus serves tanks to reduce the amount of damage received 

00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:03.656
 and it will only appear on rings, necklaces, layers and beads. 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.384
 We replace the spirit in a lot of equipment 

00:04:06.674 --> 00:04:11.768
 but we increase enough the regeneration of base mana and the obtained one of the spirit 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.477
 to compensate for less. 

00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:18.372
 Justice and value points have been eliminated 

00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:22.607
 so any point they had that has been turned into gold. 

00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:25.866
 Many things that could be bought with courage or justice 

00:04:26.106 --> 00:04:27.918
 now you can buy them with gold 

00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:29.576
 except for a few things. 

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:33.206
 Improving objects can be done with minor talismans of good fortune 

00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.393
 50 talismans for improvement. 

00:04:35.643 --> 00:04:38.221
 The relics are still achieved by Honor Points 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.579
 at the Black Moon Fair and the Argent Tournament at Corona de Hielo 

00:04:41.842 --> 00:04:44.326
 but the NPCs that sold them for Justice Points 

00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:46.022
 they have been temporarily removed 

00:04:46.182 --> 00:04:49.658
 while we work on a collection of relics for a next patch. 

00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:54.828
 One of the new features of the 6.0 patch is the Toy Box. 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.366
 In it you will find all the fun toys that you have collected 

00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:01.129
 as the fliptable table or the repugnant marmot 

00:05:01.408 --> 00:05:04.134
 instead of taking them everywhere in the inventory. 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.253
 They can open the box in the Collectables window 

00:05:07.487 --> 00:05:09.245
 and click on Toy box. 

00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:14.457
 Patch 6.0 also includes the new feature "Preset Groups". 

00:05:15.062 --> 00:05:18.744
 You can open it in the Group Finder by selecting Preset Groups. 

00:05:19.483 --> 00:05:22.618
 They can search or create a pre-set group for almost everything: 

00:05:22.992 --> 00:05:27.798
 missions, dungeons, gangs, arenas, battlefields or custom groups 

00:05:27.984 --> 00:05:30.421
 that does not belong to those categories. 

00:05:30.732 --> 00:05:32.997
 And so find new people to play 

00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:36.627
 or participate in content that does not work in random pairing. 

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:40.342
 If you like PvP, check also the new feature "Scrimmage" 

00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:44.932
 that will allow them to join unscreened arenas 2c2 or 3c3 

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:47.632
 Either you alone or with some friends! 

00:05:48.344 --> 00:05:52.594
 All that covers the most important updates and features of the patch 

00:05:52.922 --> 00:05:54.593
 but much more is happening 

00:05:54.818 --> 00:05:58.654
 Do not forget to check the full notes at worldofwarcraft.com. 

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.863
 It will serve as a complete list of everything that has changed 

00:06:02.063 --> 00:06:05.961
 with explanations and perspectives taken directly from the development team. 

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:10.070
 Thanks for your time and see you in Azeroth!
