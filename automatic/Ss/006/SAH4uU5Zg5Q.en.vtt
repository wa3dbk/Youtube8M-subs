record so what I'm doing here today is
doing<00:00:16.680> some<00:00:16.859> practice<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.400> next<00:00:17.490> quad

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760

doing some practice for the next quad
which<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.240> Indiana<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.840> May<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.380> I've<00:00:19.890> set

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
which is in Indiana in May and I've set

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.349 
which is in Indiana in May and I've set
up<00:00:20.130> some<00:00:20.220> cones<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:21.050> have<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:22.320> cone<00:00:23.359> 101.3

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
up some cones I have one cone 101.3

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
up some cones I have one cone 101.3
yards<00:00:24.660> roughly<00:00:25.050> which<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.320> where<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> set<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
yards roughly which is where I set the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.830 
yards roughly which is where I set the
record<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.730> I've<00:00:27.060> done<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.330> my<00:00:27.359> measurement

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
record and I've done all my measurement

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.679 
record and I've done all my measurement
using<00:00:28.019> laser<00:00:28.949> rangefinder<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.539> does

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
using laser rangefinder so it does

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.990 
using laser rangefinder so it does
meters<00:00:30.990> or<00:00:31.109> yards<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:32.130> easy<00:00:32.399> saves<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.880> lot

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
meters or yards really easy saves a lot

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.850 
meters or yards really easy saves a lot
of<00:00:33.059> time<00:00:33.180> pacing<00:00:33.600> off<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.140> make<00:00:34.590> sure<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
of time pacing off and make sure that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.880 
of time pacing off and make sure that
it's<00:00:35.010> accurate<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.809> also<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:37.079> you'll<00:00:37.680> see

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's accurate I also have you'll see

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.119 
it's accurate I also have you'll see
there's<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.370> double<00:00:38.790> cone<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.270> 105<00:00:39.989> yards<00:00:40.230> 100

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
there's a double cone at 105 yards 100

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.150 
there's a double cone at 105 yards 100
405<00:00:41.910> which<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.270> where<00:00:42.390> Peter<00:00:42.660> blur<00:00:43.129> through<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
405 which is where Peter blur through a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.810 
405 which is where Peter blur through a
competition<00:00:44.579> standard<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:46.190> in<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> 90s<00:00:47.610> some

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
competition standard in in the 90s some

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.270 
competition standard in in the 90s some
time<00:00:48.030> anyway<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.920> that<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> time

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
time anyway and that that at the time

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.139 
time anyway and that that at the time
was<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> world<00:00:50.730> record

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
was a world record

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.450 
was a world record
I<00:00:51.329> believe<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.500> at<00:00:52.710> least<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> weight

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
I believe in at least with that weight

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.810 
I believe in at least with that weight
so<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> hero<00:00:55.289> extra<00:00:55.620> 235<00:00:56.129> distance<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
so this is a hero extra 235 distance and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.689 
so this is a hero extra 235 distance and
it's<00:00:56.940> 108<00:00:57.840> grams<00:00:58.050> same<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> Cana<00:00:59.399> Center

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it's 108 grams same as the Cana Center

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
it's 108 grams same as the Cana Center
that<00:00:59.850> Peter<00:01:00.030> blurred<00:01:00.300> through<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> double

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that Peter blurred through so the double

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.219 
that Peter blurred through so the double
cones<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.129> at<00:01:02.250> 105<00:01:02.789> yards<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.390> then

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
cones are out at 105 yards and then

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
cones are out at 105 yards and then
there's<00:01:04.619> three<00:01:05.189> cones<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> line

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
there's three cones that are in a line

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
there's three cones that are in a line
and<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.540> are<00:01:06.630> 110<00:01:07.110> yards<00:01:07.290> which<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.590> 100

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and there are 110 yards which is 100

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.039 
and there are 110 yards which is 100
meters<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.430> my<00:01:09.060> goal<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.360> next<00:01:09.510> quad<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
meters so my goal for next quad is to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
meters so my goal for next quad is to
throw<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.580> I'm<00:01:11.580> from<00:01:11.790> Canada

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
throw that I'm from Canada

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
throw that I'm from Canada
I<00:01:12.390> love<00:01:12.600> meters<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.979> me<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.369> think

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
I love meters so for me I don't think

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
I love meters so for me I don't think
I've<00:01:14.850> hit<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> triple<00:01:15.270> digits<00:01:15.630> until<00:01:16.380> I've

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
I've hit the triple digits until I've

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.810 
I've hit the triple digits until I've
hit<00:01:16.619> meters<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.250> my<00:01:17.460> goal

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
hit meters so that's my goal

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
hit meters so that's my goal
and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.869> cone<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.350> way<00:01:19.590> far

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and then I have one cone that's way far

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.080 
and then I have one cone that's way far
out<00:01:20.009> there<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.780> 130<00:01:22.350> yards<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.090> 130

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
out there that is at 130 yards and 130

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.899 
out there that is at 130 yards and 130
131<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.409> mark<00:01:25.650> molnar<00:01:26.040> actually<00:01:26.490> through<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
131 so mark molnar actually through to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.429 
131 so mark molnar actually through to
Cheyenne<00:01:27.240> whippet<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.689> that's<00:01:27.810> kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
Cheyenne whippet and that's kind of a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.100 
Cheyenne whippet and that's kind of a
big<00:01:28.650> dog<00:01:29.460> diss<00:01:29.670> record<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.240> he<00:01:30.450> holds<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
big dog diss record that he holds and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.480 
big dog diss record that he holds and
that's<00:01:31.500> something<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.920> want<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.159> after<00:01:32.280> as

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that's something I want to go after as

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.460 
that's something I want to go after as
well<00:01:32.750> probably<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:33.840> gonna<00:01:33.960> happen<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.320> one

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
well probably not gonna happen with one

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.069 
well probably not gonna happen with one
of<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.650> these<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.100> light<00:01:36.079> probably

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
of these these are really light probably

of these these are really light probably

they're a little heavier they're about
25<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.180> 30<00:01:42.360> grams<00:01:42.570> heavier<00:01:42.810> than<00:01:43.110> made<00:01:43.229> for

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
25 to 30 grams heavier than made for

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.920 
25 to 30 grams heavier than made for
disc<00:01:43.649> golf<00:01:44.240> however<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.329> did<00:01:45.509> throw<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
disc golf however I did throw one of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.289 
disc golf however I did throw one of
these<00:01:46.020> today<00:01:46.200> 125<00:01:46.950> yards<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.850> we'll<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.210> if

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
these today 125 yards so we'll see if

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.670 
these today 125 yards so we'll see if
the<00:01:48.420> winds<00:01:48.570> right<00:01:48.840> maybe<00:01:49.110> I'll<00:01:49.259> break<00:01:49.470> that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
the winds right maybe I'll break that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.249 
the winds right maybe I'll break that
with<00:01:49.829> Davy<00:01:50.100> whippet<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.299> for<00:01:51.479> now<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.869> going

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
with Davy whippet but for now just going

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.990 
with Davy whippet but for now just going
off<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> quad<00:01:52.860> records<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.549> trying<00:01:53.880> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
off to the quad records and trying to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
off to the quad records and trying to
throw<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.170> said<00:01:55.350> 110<00:01:55.829> yards<00:01:55.950> which<00:01:56.219> would

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
throw like I said 110 yards which would

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.920 
throw like I said 110 yards which would
be<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> hundred<00:01:56.640> meters<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.600> way<00:01:57.689> I'm<00:01:57.780> gonna

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
be a hundred meters so the way I'm gonna

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
be a hundred meters so the way I'm gonna
do<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.140> today<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.469> filming<00:01:58.920> myself<00:01:59.100> throwing

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
do it today is filming myself throwing

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.520 
do it today is filming myself throwing
and<00:02:00.180> then<00:02:00.509> I'll<00:02:00.630> actually<00:02:00.810> walk<00:02:01.110> down<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.469> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and then I'll actually walk down with a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.810 
and then I'll actually walk down with a
video<00:02:01.740> camera<00:02:01.770> show<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.310> where<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.579> disc

video camera show you where all the disc
landed<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.899> wind's<00:02:04.170> pretty<00:02:04.469> good<00:02:04.680> hit<00:02:05.100> side

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
landed the wind's pretty good hit side

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.760 
landed the wind's pretty good hit side
my<00:02:05.579> back<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:06.149> little<00:02:07.079> over<00:02:07.350> my<00:02:07.409> left<00:02:07.649> shoulder

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
my back a little over my left shoulder

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.059 
my back a little over my left shoulder
which<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.190> perfect<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:10.140> about<00:02:10.440> 25

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
which is perfect and I have about 25

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:42.690 
which is perfect and I have about 25
hero<00:02:12.400> 235<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:15.040> throw

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:03:11.920 

I'm<00:02:43.700> straight

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.140 

straight<00:03:13.060> little<00:03:14.060> right

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
straight little right

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:47.100 
straight little right
it's<00:03:16.629> over<00:03:16.959> 110<00:03:45.510> all<00:03:46.510> right<00:03:46.629> so<00:03:46.780> this<00:03:46.900> is<00:03:46.959> the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
it's over 110 all right so this is the

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:56.789 
it's over 110 all right so this is the
shortest<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.890> it's<00:03:52.530> 75<00:03:53.530> yards<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:56.500> one

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
shortest one and it's 75 yards this one

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.580 
shortest one and it's 75 yards this one
is

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.570 

this<00:04:02.310> one's<00:04:02.520> 90<00:04:03.890> so<00:04:04.890> all<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.160> other<00:04:05.220> ones<00:04:05.459> are

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
this one's 90 so all the other ones are

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.530 
this one's 90 so all the other ones are
all<00:04:05.610> over<00:04:05.880> 90<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.900> good<00:04:08.120> so<00:04:09.120> this<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
all over 90 just good so this is the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.080 
all over 90 just good so this is the
world<00:04:09.690> record<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.290> set

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.099 

so<00:04:15.090> there's<00:04:17.000> what<00:04:18.000> half<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.389> disks<00:04:18.690> are<00:04:18.810> over

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
so there's what half the disks are over

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.890 
so there's what half the disks are over
the<00:04:19.230> over<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.769> world<00:04:19.950> record<00:04:20.250> mark<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:21.690> is

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
the over the world record mark this is

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.790 
the over the world record mark this is
Peter<00:04:22.109> blooms<00:04:22.500> record<00:04:23.389> which<00:04:24.389> is<00:04:24.540> 95<00:04:25.440> meters

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
Peter blooms record which is 95 meters

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.409 
Peter blooms record which is 95 meters
so<00:04:25.980> about<00:04:26.130> 105<00:04:26.669> yards

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.320 

there's<00:04:30.419> Oh<00:04:30.510> an<00:04:30.600> 8<00:04:30.780> over<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.169> mark<00:04:32.120> this<00:04:33.120> is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
there's Oh an 8 over that mark this is

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.060 
there's Oh an 8 over that mark this is
the<00:04:33.419> 110<00:04:33.930> yards<00:04:34.139> that<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.410> want<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.710> set<00:04:34.919> in

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
the 110 yards that I want to set in

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.710 
the 110 yards that I want to set in
Indiana<00:04:36.350> there's<00:04:37.350> once<00:04:37.830> you<00:04:38.240> just<00:04:39.240> four<00:04:39.510> over

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
Indiana there's once you just four over

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.710 
Indiana there's once you just four over
that<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:41.130> then<00:04:41.250> that's<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.729> one<00:04:42.210> way<00:04:42.389> I<00:04:42.419> did

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
that and then that's the one way I did

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.010 
that and then that's the one way I did
130<00:04:43.229> yards<00:04:43.410> that<00:04:44.130> mark<00:04:44.340> motorboats<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.120> this

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
130 yards that mark motorboats so this

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.540 
130 yards that mark motorboats so this
is<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.290> longest<00:04:46.500> one<00:04:46.800> today<00:04:48.710> exactly<00:04:49.710> pretty

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
is the longest one today exactly pretty

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.930 
is the longest one today exactly pretty
straight<00:04:51.620> cut<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.650> lot<00:04:52.800> of<00:04:52.919> float<00:04:53.190> on<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:53.700> Davy

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
straight cut a lot of float on so Davy

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:01.060 
straight cut a lot of float on so Davy
could<00:04:54.150> probably<00:04:54.300> catch<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:56.010> one<00:04:56.280> is

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.510 

okay<00:05:02.070> so<00:05:02.130> it's<00:05:02.340> not<00:05:02.400> as<00:05:02.580> long<00:05:02.729> at<00:05:02.940> 120<00:05:03.660> yards

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
okay so it's not as long at 120 yards

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:15.670 
okay so it's not as long at 120 yards
that<00:05:05.520> one's<00:05:05.760> about<00:05:06.919> 119<00:05:07.919> that<00:05:08.130> white<00:05:08.280> one

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.750 

anyway<00:05:16.680> you'll<00:05:16.830> see<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.130> spin<00:05:17.400> I'm<00:05:17.550> sure

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
anyway you'll see the spin I'm sure

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.260 
anyway you'll see the spin I'm sure
commode<00:05:18.030> in<00:05:18.180> Indiana<00:05:18.510> its<00:05:19.729> most<00:05:20.729> these<00:05:20.880> throws

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
commode in Indiana its most these throws

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.880 
commode in Indiana its most these throws
are<00:05:21.450> with<00:05:21.539> this<00:05:21.690> turnaround

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
are with this turnaround

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.040 
are with this turnaround
it's<00:05:23.850> a<00:05:23.910> wiping<00:05:24.090> throw<00:05:24.390> all<00:05:24.479> the<00:05:24.600> lost<00:05:24.810> ones

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
it's a wiping throw all the lost ones

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.940 
it's a wiping throw all the lost ones
they<00:05:25.140> threw<00:05:25.380> in<00:05:25.500> there<00:05:26.000> after<00:05:27.000> they<00:05:27.270> were

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
they threw in there after they were

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.930 
they threw in there after they were
three<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:29.039> the<00:05:29.100> four<00:05:29.340> longest<00:05:29.760> where<00:05:29.880> the

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
three of the four longest where the

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.890 
three of the four longest where the
white<00:05:30.060> ones<00:05:30.210> with<00:05:30.539> the<00:05:31.289> turnaround<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:32.250> it's

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
white ones with the turnaround so it's

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.760 
white ones with the turnaround so it's
definitely<00:05:33.900> out<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.110> distance<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.680> it

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
definitely out the distance to it

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.490 
definitely out the distance to it
they're<00:05:34.950> just<00:05:35.190> nice<00:05:35.340> and<00:05:36.169> if<00:05:37.169> you've<00:05:37.380> ever

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
they're just nice and if you've ever
