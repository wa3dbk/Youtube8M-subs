00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.750
 My advice to take tony 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.550
 such as about gondola heads 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.830
 name but it is a very beautiful head of 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.240
 halftime Gondola no 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.039
 better than you their taste of it for 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.449
 2012 the english they had sebastian 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.650
 the members of the cio speak to them 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.730
 sebastian coe it's a championship 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.930
 undecided it's a guy who has the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.740
 Olympic medals we are and 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.029
 bertrand delanoe 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.210
 as soon as he made three jogging on 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 case not say no but alas the brain 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.949
 sports no but you know you know if 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.239
 you are they sang the niÃ§ois it is 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.770
 particularly important because 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.000
 it is true that it is not neutral which 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.980
 is not neutral it's obviously tech3 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.379
 Olympic title there is also you have a 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.579
 image you like it maybe not but 2.2 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.010
 of perfect son-in-law you see two boys no 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.840
 opposite of boy you see police and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.579
 kiala who is able to be at any 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.890
 which table to discuss with anyone 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.020
 who has an absolute correction that is missing 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.969
 a little French say that you have this side 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.160
 maybe a little british who both 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.809
 and brawler and go get the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.699
 victories where it is necessary but who at the same 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.439
 time remains perfectly civilized 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.570
 respectful of each other and what makes a 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.340
 little bit lacking to us French 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.900
 we need to apply as the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.580
 hang on to the wing of another behind 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.470
 no but of course everything is huge and I 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.299
 mean is that as gilles says 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.030
 commerce must not be in it must 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.140
 to be our candidate really on this 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.909
 if we look a little at all 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.100
 nominations that were at the end there 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.740
 do not really have 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.210
 two common points sebastian coe 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.340
 actually it was a sportsman a 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.100
 corner rather the sports side but there is 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.690
 had nominations that was carried by 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.220
 by an Olympic committee chair has 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.440
 had candidatures carried by private 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.360
 end as and Olympic you understood 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.530
 it was to win from before we had 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.009
 no luck on this one there's nothing 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.299
 anyway 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.530
 yes yes no because I mean it's 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.460
 that there is no one either 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.869
 not because he's a French sportsman 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.159
 who will lead the candidacy that she will go to 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.479
 but it's not only the sporting side 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.920
 sebastian coates was lord coe so he 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.259
 there is one side too and then lord coe was 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.270
 very introduced politically as well 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.710
 that economically it's not that a 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.450
 former sportsman and what is reassuring 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.190
 is that Bernard is alive because we 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:09.619
 was looking rather distinguished was 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:11.480
 talked about a project that will row and then 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.049
 and then the clams will not let the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.980
 conclusion on it must be ordif y 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.980
 is here it is necessary to tell them
