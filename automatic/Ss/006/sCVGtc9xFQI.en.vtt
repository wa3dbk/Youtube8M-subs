this<00:00:00.390> might<00:00:00.599> be<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.750> bit<00:00:00.989> late<00:00:01.380> but<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:01.949> only<00:00:02.159> now

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
this might be a bit late but I only now

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.100 
this might be a bit late but I only now
started<00:00:02.820> noticing<00:00:02.939> just<00:00:03.389> how<00:00:03.480> much<00:00:03.929> the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
started noticing just how much the

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.930 
started noticing just how much the
Tokyo<00:00:04.440> ghoul<00:00:04.589> anime<00:00:05.009> ending<00:00:05.339> was<00:00:05.490> getting<00:00:05.790> on

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Tokyo ghoul anime ending was getting on

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.629 
Tokyo ghoul anime ending was getting on
the<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:06.810> hand<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.410> expected<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.189> cries<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.550> it

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
the one hand I expected the cries of it

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.629 
the one hand I expected the cries of it
being<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.030> cliffhanger<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.080> unfinished<00:00:11.010> but

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
being a cliffhanger and unfinished but

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.459 
being a cliffhanger and unfinished but
on<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> other<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.480> didn't<00:00:13.019> expect<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.410> year

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
on the other I didn't expect this year

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.020 
on the other I didn't expect this year
magnitude<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.639> all

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
magnitude of it all

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.939 
magnitude of it all
maybe<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.960> happen<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.379> be<00:00:16.500> seeing<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
maybe I just happen to not be seeing the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.070 
maybe I just happen to not be seeing the
more<00:00:17.070> positive<00:00:17.640> reception<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.869> seems

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
more positive reception but it seems

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.650 
more positive reception but it seems
almost<00:00:19.410> unanimous<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.910> now<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.539> take

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
almost unanimous so now I have to take

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.480 
almost unanimous so now I have to take
the<00:00:21.810> time<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.170> explain<00:00:22.470> why<00:00:22.680> everyone<00:00:23.340> is

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the time to explain why everyone is

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.570 
the time to explain why everyone is
wrong<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.180> I'm<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:25.279> was<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> joke

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
wrong and I'm right that was a joke

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.179 
wrong and I'm right that was a joke
obviously<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.170> genuinely<00:00:28.529> believe<00:00:29.070> it

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
obviously but I do genuinely believe it

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.040 
obviously but I do genuinely believe it
was<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.519> fine<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> wanted<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.869> take<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
was just fine so I wanted to take a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.479 
was just fine so I wanted to take a
little<00:00:31.199> bit<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> time<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.830> explain<00:00:32.130> why<00:00:32.460> I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
little bit of time to explain why I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.860 
little bit of time to explain why I
think<00:00:32.669> people<00:00:33.149> missed<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> point<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.780> what

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
think people missed the point of what

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.010 
think people missed the point of what
made<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> ending<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.820> ending<00:00:36.120> along

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
made the ending well and ending along

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.270 
made the ending well and ending along
with<00:00:37.170> some<00:00:37.320> pondering<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.770> what<00:00:37.890> an<00:00:37.980> ending<00:00:38.160> in

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
with some pondering on what an ending in

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.510 
with some pondering on what an ending in
general<00:00:38.700> really<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.620> needless<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> say<00:00:40.800> this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
general really is needless to say this

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.160 
general really is needless to say this
is<00:00:41.579> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.059> entirely<00:00:42.420> about<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> final

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
is going to be entirely about the final

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.350 
is going to be entirely about the final
episode<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> Tokyo<00:00:43.920> ghoul<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.910> probably

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
episode of Tokyo ghoul so you probably

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.119 
episode of Tokyo ghoul so you probably
want<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> stop<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.500> haven't<00:00:46.680> seen<00:00:46.860> or

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
want to stop here if you haven't seen or

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.069 
want to stop here if you haven't seen or
finished<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> show<00:00:47.730> which<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.870> should

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
finished the show which you should

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.209 
finished the show which you should
because<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:49.739> great

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
because it was great

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.270 
because it was great
I<00:00:50.719> think<00:00:51.719> what's<00:00:51.870> mainly<00:00:52.199> baffling<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.070> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I think what's mainly baffling is that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860 
I think what's mainly baffling is that
while<00:00:53.430> hate<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> ending<00:00:54.360> seems<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.750> be

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
while hate for the ending seems to be

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
while hate for the ending seems to be
unanimous<00:00:55.199> love<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> episode<00:00:56.579> itself

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
unanimous love for the episode itself

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.420 
unanimous love for the episode itself
also<00:00:57.719> seems<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.230> unanimous<00:00:58.469> it's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
also seems to be unanimous it's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.279 
also seems to be unanimous it's
confusing<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> understand<00:01:01.140> what

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
confusing because if you understand what

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.500 
confusing because if you understand what
made<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> episodes<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.129> great<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:03.090> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
made the episodes so great then so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.969 
made the episodes so great then so
should<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> reason<00:01:04.229> why<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.559> ended<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> way

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
should the reason why it ended the way

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.880 
should the reason why it ended the way
it<00:01:05.100> did<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.610> could<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.570> wrong<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.500> makes<00:01:07.740> me

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
it did I could be wrong but it makes me

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.320 
it did I could be wrong but it makes me
think<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> reason<00:01:08.490> most<00:01:08.729> people<00:01:08.880> liked

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
think that the reason most people liked

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
think that the reason most people liked
the<00:01:09.600> episode<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:10.170> simply<00:01:10.470> because<00:01:10.740> kaneki

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the episode was simply because kaneki

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
the episode was simply because kaneki
stopped<00:01:11.490> being<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.030> wimp<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.720> turned<00:01:13.110> into<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
stopped being a wimp and turned into a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980 
stopped being a wimp and turned into a
badass<00:01:13.970> kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> same<00:01:15.360> vein<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.840> when

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
badass kind of in the same vein is when

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
badass kind of in the same vein is when
people<00:01:16.110> complain<00:01:16.530> about<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:16.920> passive<00:01:17.430> or

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
people complain about more passive or

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.660 
people complain about more passive or
pathetic<00:01:17.850> main<00:01:18.150> characters<00:01:18.630> being<00:01:18.810> bad<00:01:19.670> it's

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
pathetic main characters being bad it's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
pathetic main characters being bad it's
a<00:01:20.820> pretty<00:01:21.060> bad<00:01:21.560> oversimplification<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
a pretty bad oversimplification of the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.340 
a pretty bad oversimplification of the
point<00:01:23.009> behind<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.759> episode<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:25.020> why<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
point behind the episode as the why is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.600 
point behind the episode as the why is
more<00:01:25.830> important

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
more important

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.580 
more important
just<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.570> any<00:01:27.600> fight<00:01:27.990> scene<00:01:28.290> the

just like with any fight scene the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.260 
just like with any fight scene the
choreography<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.820> mostly<00:01:30.119> eye

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
choreography of it is just mostly eye

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
choreography of it is just mostly eye
candy<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> actual<00:01:32.009> tension

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
excitement and stakes come from the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.490 
excitement and stakes come from the
reasons<00:01:34.829> behind<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.610> fight<00:01:36.079> so<00:01:37.079> then<00:01:37.259> what<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
reasons behind the fight so then what is

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
showed up to rescue him and most of them

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.469 
showed up to rescue him and most of them
seem<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.549> about<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.909> get<00:03:22.030> into<00:03:22.239> fights

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479 
seem to be about to get into fights

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.800 
seem to be about to get into fights
before<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.930> show<00:03:23.079> ended<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.459> thing<00:03:24.699> is<00:03:25.090> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
before the show ended the thing is the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.899 
before the show ended the thing is the
show<00:03:25.959> was<00:03:26.109> never<00:03:26.199> really<00:03:26.530> about<00:03:26.650> them<00:03:27.099> that's

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
show was never really about them that's

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.699 
show was never really about them that's
enough<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.209> say<00:03:28.329> they<00:03:28.449> aren't<00:03:28.659> important<00:03:29.379> but

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
enough to say they aren't important but

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.890 
enough to say they aren't important but
pretty<00:03:30.489> much<00:03:30.639> all<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.269> events<00:03:31.599> were<00:03:31.720> there

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
pretty much all of the events were there

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.039 
pretty much all of the events were there
to<00:03:32.019> add<00:03:32.169> to<00:03:32.379> Kentucky's<00:03:32.769> plight<00:03:33.069> in<00:03:33.220> some<00:03:33.459> way

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
to add to Kentucky's plight in some way

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.819 
to add to Kentucky's plight in some way
reinforcing<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.139> there<00:03:35.319> were<00:03:35.409> both<00:03:35.560> good

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
reinforcing that there were both good

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.710 
reinforcing that there were both good
and<00:03:36.010> bad<00:03:36.099> people<00:03:36.579> on<00:03:36.729> both<00:03:36.909> sides<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.479> feud

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
being the main one they all went to try

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.390 
being the main one they all went to try
and<00:03:40.180> rescue<00:03:40.389> him<00:03:40.720> but<00:03:41.409> now<00:03:41.650> he's<00:03:41.799> already<00:03:41.949> free

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
and rescue him but now he's already free

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.640 
and rescue him but now he's already free
until<00:03:43.329> they<00:03:43.419> obviously<00:03:43.569> don't<00:03:43.900> realize<00:03:44.439> it

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650

they're<00:03:47.650> done<00:03:47.939> if<00:03:48.939> I<00:03:49.090> wanted<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.449> get<00:03:49.599> really

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:50.259 
they're done if I wanted to get really

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:51.749 
they're done if I wanted to get really
technical<00:03:50.470> I<00:03:50.889> could<00:03:51.069> even<00:03:51.189> argue<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.639> it

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:51.759 
technical I could even argue that it

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.129 
technical I could even argue that it
didn't<00:03:52.000> really<00:03:52.180> end<00:03:52.419> in<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.840> middle<00:03:53.049> of

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
didn't really end in the middle of

didn't really end in the middle of
anything<00:03:53.590> since<00:03:54.099> those<00:03:54.280> fights<00:03:54.489> didn't

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
anything since those fights didn't

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.149 
anything since those fights didn't
actually<00:03:55.000> start<00:03:55.780> but<00:03:56.650> that<00:03:56.769> probably

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
actually start but that probably

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.849 
actually start but that probably
wouldn't<00:03:57.639> fly<00:03:57.819> for<00:03:58.060> most<00:03:58.209> people<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:59.530> point

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
wouldn't fly for most people the point

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.319 
wouldn't fly for most people the point
is<00:04:00.009> that<00:04:00.129> connect<00:04:00.400> II<00:04:00.519> is<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.669> center<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.239> the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
actions and at the end he's gone through

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
even shows this it starts with him

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.179

have white hair Kenickie the opening was
pretty<00:04:18.549> much<00:04:18.639> entirely<00:04:19.060> about<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.780> finale

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
pretty much entirely about the finale

pretty much entirely about the finale
even<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.009> song<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.370> about<00:04:21.459> him<00:04:21.669> accepting

general I'm not going to lie and say

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.760 
general I'm not going to lie and say
that<00:04:26.020> every<00:04:26.409> thread

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
that every thread

wrapped up because that's obviously not

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.809 
wrapped up because that's obviously not
true<00:04:28.590> but<00:04:29.590> it's<00:04:29.770> placing<00:04:30.129> a<00:04:30.220> bit<00:04:30.400> too<00:04:30.669> much

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
true but it's placing a bit too much

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.700 
true but it's placing a bit too much

importance on threads that don't really

the trees
anyways<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.949> point<00:04:42.190> is<00:04:42.340> that<00:04:42.490> it's<00:04:42.639> obsessing

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
anyways the point is that it's obsessing

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.760 
anyways the point is that it's obsessing
over<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.479> little<00:04:43.720> details<00:04:44.139> and<00:04:44.379> not<00:04:44.500> getting

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
over the little details and not getting

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.399 
over the little details and not getting
the<00:04:44.860> overall<00:04:45.250> picture<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:46.120> know<00:04:47.020> it<00:04:47.199> sounds

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
the overall picture I know it sounds

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.260 
the overall picture I know it sounds
like<00:04:47.500> I'm<00:04:47.650> saying<00:04:47.680> just<00:04:48.370> ignore<00:04:48.699> the<00:04:48.819> problems

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
like I'm saying just ignore the problems

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.969 
like I'm saying just ignore the problems
but<00:04:49.960> what<00:04:50.080> I'm<00:04:50.169> actually<00:04:50.289> saying<00:04:50.530> is<00:04:50.860> that

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
but what I'm actually saying is that

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.920 
but what I'm actually saying is that
they<00:04:51.099> aren't<00:04:51.370> actually<00:04:52.030> problems<00:04:52.509> to<00:04:52.659> begin

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
they aren't actually problems to begin

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.080 
they aren't actually problems to begin
with<00:04:53.280> again<00:04:54.280> it's<00:04:54.550> like<00:04:54.699> what<00:04:54.879> I<00:04:54.909> mentioned

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
with again it's like what I mentioned

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.420 
with again it's like what I mentioned
before<00:04:55.300> about<00:04:55.509> fight<00:04:55.900> scenes<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:56.889> fight<00:04:57.190> in

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
before about fight scenes the fight in

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.129 
before about fight scenes the fight in
and<00:04:57.639> of<00:04:57.699> itself<00:04:57.970> isn't<00:04:58.240> what's<00:04:58.539> important

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
and of itself isn't what's important

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.189 
and of itself isn't what's important
it's<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.740> reasons<00:05:00.190> behind<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:01.000> it's<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.050> same

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
it's the reasons behind it it's the same

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.589 
it's the reasons behind it it's the same
with<00:05:02.319> Tokyo<00:05:02.620> ghoul<00:05:02.830> as<00:05:03.009> a<00:05:03.039> whole<00:05:03.400> there<00:05:04.210> was

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
with Tokyo ghoul as a whole there was

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.200 
with Tokyo ghoul as a whole there was
finality<00:05:05.289> because<00:05:06.039> it<00:05:06.310> started<00:05:06.759> a<00:05:06.819> character

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
finality because it started a character

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.899 
finality because it started a character
arc<00:05:07.419> and<00:05:07.659> ended<00:05:08.259> it<00:05:08.409> as<00:05:08.590> any<00:05:09.250> good<00:05:09.520> show<00:05:09.729> should

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
arc and ended it as any good show should

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.020 
arc and ended it as any good show should
do<00:05:10.289> well<00:05:11.289> if<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.770> want<00:05:11.949> to<00:05:12.069> get<00:05:12.190> technical<00:05:12.490> I

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
do well if you want to get technical I

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.570 
do well if you want to get technical I
didn't<00:05:13.330> necessarily<00:05:13.990> end<00:05:14.229> so<00:05:14.919> much<00:05:15.069> as<00:05:15.220> morph

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
didn't necessarily end so much as morph

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.879 
didn't necessarily end so much as morph
into<00:05:15.729> something<00:05:15.819> new<00:05:16.389> but<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:17.380> point<00:05:17.620> is

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
into something new but the point is

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.100 
into something new but the point is
that's<00:05:18.280> something<00:05:18.490> for<00:05:18.669> another<00:05:18.880> season<00:05:19.300> just

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
that's something for another season just

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.879 
that's something for another season just
like<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.319> fights<00:05:20.530> with<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.770> other

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
like the fights with the other

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.670 
like the fights with the other
characters<00:05:21.400> that<00:05:21.430> start<00:05:21.759> setting<00:05:22.060> up<00:05:22.150> the

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
characters that start setting up the

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.839 
characters that start setting up the
only<00:05:23.680> reasonable<00:05:23.979> argument<00:05:24.550> against<00:05:24.789> the

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
only reasonable argument against the

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.249 
only reasonable argument against the
ending<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.240> could<00:05:25.419> think<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.810> is<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.110> it

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
ending I could think of is that it

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.420 
ending I could think of is that it
should<00:05:26.409> have<00:05:26.500> at<00:05:26.590> least<00:05:26.620> continued<00:05:27.219> to<00:05:27.310> the

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
should have at least continued to the

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.920 
should have at least continued to the
point<00:05:27.639> where<00:05:27.789> kaneki<00:05:28.210> and<00:05:28.360> everyone<00:05:28.629> else<00:05:28.750> got

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
point where kaneki and everyone else got

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.749 
point where kaneki and everyone else got
out<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.259> went<00:05:29.379> home<00:05:29.590> because<00:05:30.430> that<00:05:30.610> would

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
out and went home because that would

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:31.950 
out and went home because that would
still<00:05:30.940> cover<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.300> character<00:05:31.659> arc<00:05:31.840> without

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
still cover the character arc without

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.680 
still cover the character arc without
leaving<00:05:32.289> any<00:05:32.500> loose<00:05:32.710> ends<00:05:33.060> but<00:05:34.060> even<00:05:34.330> then<00:05:34.509> I'd

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
leaving any loose ends but even then I'd

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.450 
leaving any loose ends but even then I'd
argue<00:05:35.020> against<00:05:35.469> that<00:05:35.530> since<00:05:35.889> the<00:05:36.039> doubt<00:05:36.280> they

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
argue against that since the doubt they

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.680 
argue against that since the doubt they
could<00:05:36.550> finished<00:05:36.849> fights<00:05:37.060> with<00:05:37.210> any<00:05:37.389> of<00:05:37.569> these

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
could finished fights with any of these

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.939 
could finished fights with any of these
ghouls<00:05:37.900> they've<00:05:38.139> established<00:05:38.319> as<00:05:38.770> being

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
ghouls they've established as being

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.529 
ghouls they've established as being
exceptionally<00:05:39.280> strong<00:05:39.759> in<00:05:39.969> any<00:05:40.090> short<00:05:40.270> amount

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
exceptionally strong in any short amount

exceptionally strong in any short amount
of<00:05:40.569> time<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:41.139> more<00:05:41.830> importantly<00:05:42.340> because

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
of time and more importantly because

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.490 
of time and more importantly because
ending<00:05:43.389> the<00:05:43.509> show<00:05:43.659> with<00:05:43.779> kaneki<00:05:44.169> eating

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
ending the show with kaneki eating

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.110 
ending the show with kaneki eating
someone<00:05:44.800> is<00:05:44.889> far<00:05:45.130> too<00:05:45.340> important<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:45.880> have<00:05:46.000> it

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
someone is far too important to have it

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.159 
someone is far too important to have it
keep<00:05:46.300> going<00:05:46.479> considering<00:05:47.050> how<00:05:47.139> everything

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
keep going considering how everything

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.700 
keep going considering how everything
was<00:05:47.680> set<00:05:47.889> up<00:05:48.479> there's<00:05:49.479> not<00:05:49.779> much<00:05:50.080> else<00:05:50.259> to<00:05:50.409> say

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
was set up there's not much else to say

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.890 
was set up there's not much else to say
the<00:05:51.520> simplistic<00:05:51.909> summary<00:05:52.360> is<00:05:52.509> just<00:05:52.750> that<00:05:52.870> a

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
the simplistic summary is just that a

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.570 
the simplistic summary is just that a
final<00:05:53.289> episode<00:05:53.620> should<00:05:53.740> have<00:05:53.860> finality<00:05:54.190> and

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
final episode should have finality and

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.640 
final episode should have finality and
this<00:05:55.180> one<00:05:55.389> did<00:05:55.690> it<00:05:55.810> because<00:05:56.110> it<00:05:56.139> wrapped<00:05:56.440> up<00:05:56.560> a

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
this one did it because it wrapped up a

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.959 
this one did it because it wrapped up a
character<00:05:56.919> our<00:05:57.190> cadet<00:05:57.430> set<00:05:57.610> up<00:05:57.699> at<00:05:57.819> the<00:05:57.909> start

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
character our cadet set up at the start

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.339 
character our cadet set up at the start
and<00:05:58.330> developed<00:05:58.659> over<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:58.960> course<00:05:59.139> of<00:05:59.229> the

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
and developed over the course of the

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.559 
and developed over the course of the
show<00:05:59.500> it<00:06:00.370> was<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:00.669> core<00:06:00.849> of<00:06:00.880> everything<00:06:01.389> and

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
show it was the core of everything and

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.360 
show it was the core of everything and
it<00:06:02.139> was<00:06:02.259> developed<00:06:02.650> and<00:06:02.740> resolved<00:06:03.099> by<00:06:03.219> the<00:06:03.279> end

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
it was developed and resolved by the end

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.149 
it was developed and resolved by the end
and<00:06:03.880> as<00:06:04.599> I<00:06:04.750> said<00:06:04.810> that's<00:06:05.650> what<00:06:05.830> any<00:06:05.949> good

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
and as I said that's what any good

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.880 
and as I said that's what any good
finale<00:06:06.430> should<00:06:06.699> do
