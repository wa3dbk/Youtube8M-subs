00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.140
 let's say the ones I saw that where there is 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.290
 there were more to the coin why 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:46.310
 the neighboring woman from Liguria was not already there 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:50.200

 that there was already nothing zero 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.930
 so I swear to you they gave me 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:02.090
 really a good impression they work 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:05.870
 to die for and they are pigmented 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.040
 they are really good 289 but they are 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.360
 excellent 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.070

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.100
 far beyond the big band that I make you 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:23.210

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:40.520
 eyes and let me come one and this is 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.130
