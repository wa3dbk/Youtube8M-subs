done a pretty good job some of these
clubs<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.469> they<00:01:51.530> do<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.710> little<00:01:51.920> bit<00:01:52.100> more

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
clubs and they do a little bit more

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.419 
clubs and they do a little bit more
practicing<00:01:52.969> however<00:01:53.689> having<00:01:54.679> observed<00:01:55.100> some

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
practicing however having observed some

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.580 
practicing however having observed some
and<00:01:55.609> participated<00:01:56.299> in<00:01:56.420> some<00:01:56.659> we<00:01:57.229> don't<00:01:57.259> get

and participated in some we don't get

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.010 
and participated in some we don't get
full<00:01:57.799> participation<00:01:58.490> by<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:58.880> many<00:01:59.840> of<00:01:59.959> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
full participation by the many of the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.899 
full participation by the many of the
players<00:02:00.229> because<00:02:00.709> they<00:02:00.889> are<00:02:00.950> rightfully<00:02:01.490> off

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
players because they are rightfully off

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.699 
players because they are rightfully off
playing<00:02:02.329> other<00:02:02.509> sports<00:02:02.630> which<00:02:03.229> is<00:02:03.409> something

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
playing other sports which is something

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.620 
playing other sports which is something
we<00:02:03.829> would<00:02:03.920> like<00:02:04.130> them<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.369> do<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.299> they<00:02:05.450> don't

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
we would like them to do so they don't

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.790 
we would like them to do so they don't
come<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:06.560> these<00:02:06.939> these<00:02:07.939> practice<00:02:08.600> sessions

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
come to these these practice sessions

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.290 
come to these these practice sessions
but<00:02:09.800> they<00:02:09.979> sure<00:02:10.130> come<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:10.520> game<00:02:10.729> sessions

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
but they sure come to the game sessions

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.930 
but they sure come to the game sessions
so<00:02:11.770> I<00:02:12.770> think<00:02:13.520> coaches

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
so I think coaches

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.150 
so I think coaches
have<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.600> make<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> decision<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.560> whether

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
have to make a decision on whether

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.800 
have to make a decision on whether
they're<00:02:17.400> going<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.610> develop<00:02:17.880> hockey<00:02:18.360> players

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
they're going to develop hockey players

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.140 
they're going to develop hockey players
or<00:02:20.090> they<00:02:21.090> want<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> win<00:02:21.600> games<00:02:22.820> now<00:02:23.820> winning

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
or they want to win games now winning

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.120 
or they want to win games now winning
games<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.630> terrific<00:02:24.960> but<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.740> really<00:02:25.920> doesn't

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
games is terrific but it really doesn't

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.940

of that I think we have an obligation to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.940 
of that I think we have an obligation to
the<00:03:05.040> players<00:03:05.840> because<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.020> time<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
the players because of the time and the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.280 
the players because of the time and the
money<00:03:07.980> that's<00:03:08.460> being<00:03:08.610> spent<00:03:08.760> by<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.660> parents

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
money that's being spent by the parents

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.800 
money that's being spent by the parents
the<00:03:10.770> time<00:03:11.040> spent<00:03:11.430> by<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.640> players<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.600> give

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
the time spent by the players to give

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.200 
the time spent by the players to give
them<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.440> tools<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.190> need<00:03:14.370> to

them all the tools that they need to
become<00:03:15.360> as<00:03:15.780> good<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.380> hockey<00:03:16.650> player<00:03:17.100> that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820

they can all become most teams rely on
two<00:03:21.989> or<00:03:22.110> three<00:03:22.350> kids<00:03:22.620> their<00:03:23.370> top<00:03:23.670> two<00:03:23.910> or<00:03:23.940> three

success of that team if you're lucky you
got<00:03:28.320> five<00:03:28.620> kids<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.280> probably<00:03:29.670> win<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> lot

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
got five kids and you probably win a lot

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.140 
got five kids and you probably win a lot
of<00:03:30.360> games<00:03:30.570> but<00:03:30.870> what<00:03:31.020> about<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.380> rest<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.770> them

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
of games but what about the rest of them

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.850 
of games but what about the rest of them
do<00:03:33.150> we<00:03:33.239> always<00:03:33.450> do<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.140> do<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:34.350> always<00:03:34.530> allow

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
do we always do and do we always allow

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.520 
do we always do and do we always allow
them<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.459> play<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.880> special<00:03:36.300> situations<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:37.380> we

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
them to play in special situations do we

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.610 
them to play in special situations do we
coached<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.970> lesser<00:03:39.330> skilled<00:03:39.600> kids<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.170> I

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
coached the lesser skilled kids and I

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.110 
coached the lesser skilled kids and I
would<00:03:40.800> argue<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:41.280> we<00:03:41.400> should<00:03:41.430> coach<00:03:41.910> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
would argue that we should coach the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.790 
would argue that we should coach the
lesser<00:03:42.420> skilled<00:03:42.660> kids<00:03:43.020> just<00:03:43.260> as<00:03:43.410> much<00:03:43.590> as

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
lesser skilled kids just as much as

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.410 
lesser skilled kids just as much as
those<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.430> are<00:03:44.550> having<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> little<00:03:45.209> more

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
those that are having a little more

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.870 
those that are having a little more
natural<00:03:45.840> ability<00:03:46.260> but<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.220> go<00:03:47.340> back<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.610> this

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
natural ability but I go back to this

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.759 
natural ability but I go back to this
and<00:03:48.120> say<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.810> an<00:03:49.080> attitude<00:03:49.560> II<00:03:49.650> issue

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
and say this is an attitude II issue

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.970 
and say this is an attitude II issue
this<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.580> philosophy<00:03:51.269> issue<00:03:51.650> why<00:03:52.650> are<00:03:52.680> we

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
this is a philosophy issue why are we

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.910 
this is a philosophy issue why are we
here<00:03:53.370> we<00:03:54.090> should<00:03:54.330> be<00:03:54.480> here<00:03:54.690> for<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.959> kids<00:03:55.200> we

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
here we should be here for the kids we

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.580 
here we should be here for the kids we
should<00:03:56.160> be<00:03:56.340> helping<00:03:57.000> them<00:03:57.390> as<00:03:57.600> they<00:03:58.140> move

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
should be helping them as they move

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.949 
should be helping them as they move
through<00:03:58.620> youth<00:03:59.370> hockey<00:03:59.670> in<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.510> high<00:04:00.660> school

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
through youth hockey in the high school

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.390 
through youth hockey in the high school
hockey<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.620> they<00:04:02.310> move<00:04:02.519> on<00:04:02.760> from<00:04:03.000> each<00:04:03.269> level

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
hockey and they move on from each level

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.860 
hockey and they move on from each level
acquiring<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.519> skills<00:04:05.550> that<00:04:06.060> they<00:04:06.360> need<00:04:06.390> to

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
acquiring the skills that they need to

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.800 
acquiring the skills that they need to
be<00:04:06.989> successful<00:04:07.200> at<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.920> next<00:04:08.640> level<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.180> to

be successful at the next level and to

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.770 
be successful at the next level and to
me<00:04:09.959> that's<00:04:10.200> far<00:04:10.709> more<00:04:10.739> important<00:04:11.610> than<00:04:12.180> having

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
me that's far more important than having

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.840 
me that's far more important than having
to<00:04:13.019> win<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.500> next<00:04:13.680> invitational<00:04:14.640> tournament

a<00:04:21.510> long<00:04:21.870> period<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:22.590> time<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.250> that's<00:04:23.700> by

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
a long period of time and that's by

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.840 
a long period of time and that's by
giving<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.360> kids<00:04:24.660> as<00:04:24.870> much<00:04:24.900> skill<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.860> put<00:04:26.729> it

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
giving the kids as much skill and put it

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.129 
giving the kids as much skill and put it
putting<00:04:27.300> them<00:04:27.630> in<00:04:27.810> a

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
putting them in a

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.409 
putting them in a
positive<00:04:28.590> environment<00:04:29.310> all<00:04:29.580> through<00:04:30.210> their

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
positive environment all through their

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.989 
positive environment all through their
experience<00:04:31.110> so<00:04:31.949> that<00:04:31.979> they<00:04:32.249> can<00:04:32.430> maximize

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:32.999 
experience so that they can maximize

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.730 
experience so that they can maximize
their<00:04:33.150> potential<00:04:33.569> as<00:04:33.840> athletes<00:04:34.289> and<00:04:34.560> his

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
their potential as athletes and his

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.019 
their potential as athletes and his
people<00:04:35.099> so<00:04:35.930> coaches<00:04:36.930> you've<00:04:37.110> got<00:04:37.259> a<00:04:37.289> choice

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:38.029 
people so coaches you've got a choice

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.540 
people so coaches you've got a choice
prepare<00:04:39.029> for<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.330> games<00:04:39.569> or<00:04:40.189> teach<00:04:41.189> skills

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
prepare for the games or teach skills

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.749 
prepare for the games or teach skills
and<00:04:41.849> teach<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.719> game<00:04:42.930> of<00:04:43.139> hockey<00:04:43.319> and<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:44.550> would

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
and teach the game of hockey and I would

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.529 
and teach the game of hockey and I would
argue<00:04:44.789> that<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.389> second<00:04:45.810> choice<00:04:47.120> will<00:04:48.120> result

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
argue that the second choice will result

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.649 
argue that the second choice will result
in<00:04:48.719> more<00:04:48.900> wins<00:04:49.199> on<00:04:49.469> the<00:04:49.590> other<00:04:49.740> side<00:04:50.539> so<00:04:51.539> we'll

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
in more wins on the other side so we'll

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.409 
in more wins on the other side so we'll
see<00:04:51.810> around<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.199> rink
