00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 last night apple introduced osx 10 points 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.009
 at stake the new version she 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.450
 is called and the captain is a little 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.550
 special but actually not too much because 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 it comes in the continuity of 6 10 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.790
 points 10 it's really improved and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.009
 like that it's both names of 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.299
 mountain to emmys and capital so that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.260
 mark a little bit the link is what I you 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.340
 offers in this video it's from 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.900
 enjoy this brand new version 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.400
 before everyone that is here 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.570
 now right now it does not matter that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.939
 you have a developer account or not 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.689
 it's gone then in the name of starting there 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.099
 must know that this is the first 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.480
 beta so she's definitely very 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.130
 buggy most of your apps do not 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.029
 will not work on it so best 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.830
 it's not to install it on 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.719
 macintosh hd installed but rather on 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.340
 a partition of your mac or on a 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.480
 external disk what am I going to do or 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.870
 even on a partition of a disk 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.129
 external 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 if you want to know how to participate 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.219
 to cuts and a disc in half click 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.660
 on the little girl who is in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.730
 top right and so I'm going 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.960
 install it on my bone x and captain 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.550
 who comes from the subject the fame like that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.260
 that you are no longer simple who has to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.730
 to be completely empty at the site how it goes 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.809
 erase everything on it and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.300
 so here I am I'm ready then there is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.230
 20 gigabytes but that's more than enough 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 second thing of course we will have 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.449
 need it is the installer 2 6 10 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.680
 points 11 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.090
 so you can find it in the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 description of the video there is a link 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.829
 to download it if you have a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.390
 developer account 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.589
 there is a link to download it if 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.510
 you do not have a developer account 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.580
 have a third link for you 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.409
 sign up for the public beta that have 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.850
 that a less buggy version in any case 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.890
 we hope it will be available I think 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 late June early July and so you 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.040
 write this on the apple website 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.990
 and as soon as the public beta will be 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.850
 available so this is a version a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.080
 anticipation but that apple distributes to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 everyone since this version so 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.560
 normally available only for 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.970
 developers and well as soon as it will 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.229
 available you will receive an email for 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 have all the information for the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.659
 Download 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.100
 once you have downloaded your 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.180
 installer of course you double 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.590
 click on it when not too much 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.850
 problems if you have it download 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.619
 without a developer account 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.640
 he will first check the pitcher what 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.350
 will take a lot of time because that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.700
 weighs anyway if giga and then you 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.689
 you ask if you want to open it seen 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.740
 that it's like it's a 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.869
 application you downloaded 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.479
 internet is then very simple 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.770
 continue ok yes the little bug right here 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.380
 huh it promises for the future 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.460
 ok so here super important do not 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.110
 choose your and say that you 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.520
 display all the discs and you 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.170
 choose the disc on which you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 want to install it me it's the capital 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.420
 so frozen already installed end that's a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.950
 little magic of editing 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.780
 but here you choose that and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.040
 you have savalli installed very 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.270
 quickly at first but eventually 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.530
 will restart the computer it would take 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.450
 wait a little bit less when 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.950
 even a fair amount of time and here you are 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.690
 let the installation be done 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.060
 and that's the installation is over 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.739
 is found on osx 10 points 11 and the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.940
 capitane so it lasts a little bit of 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.319
 time to installation after you have to 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.360
 configure some stuff but so 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.470
 this is the first beta then for 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.420
 following versions you can do the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.530
 update via the mac app store and so 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.879
 all this is installed on a disk 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.459
 external and if we go in the preferences 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.290
 system including boot disk and well 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.050
 we can choose on which disk we want 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.970
 restart the mac is one of those two 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.620
 who have my basic disk and my 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.140
 disc two videos that are all 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.250
 two on bone x 10.6 and then the captain 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.780
 which is on my external drive 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.610
 but when I'm back on my 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.110
 video studio and well the capital punishment 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.360
 we can unplug it there's no 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.370
 problem and so if you want to come back 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.730
 do a little I play on osx 10 points 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.440
 11 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.959
 you plug in your disk you go 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.150
 on whose disc system preference of 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.799
 boot into your macintosh ad disk 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.440
 for example you choose such capital 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.760
 and you restart and go away so 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.440
 here I really hope this video 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.849
