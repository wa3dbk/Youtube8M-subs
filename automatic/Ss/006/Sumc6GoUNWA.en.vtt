00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:03.930
 overview program interfaces 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.090
 consider the program interface more 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.050
 in detail 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.930

 firstly this is the main menu located 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.509
 top of the program window and 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.309
 providing access to major 

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.560
 3ds max teams 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.779
 the whole command of this menu is closed exactly 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.390
 Patipa he that significantly 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.089
 makes it easy to find the functions you need

 located on the left to the right or at the bottom 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.460
 parts of the program window 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.550
 also this panel can be like 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.450
 independent element and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.930
 be in the toolbar 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.240
 with folds divided by 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.560
 categories 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.650
 on this toolbar you can 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.410
 find buttons for quick access to 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.030
 most sought after 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.670
 teams and operations 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.310
 main window space 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.080
 programs occupy cocoon projections 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.850
 in fact, itâ€™s like four cameras each 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.930
 of which by default look at 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.010
 object from its direction 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.490
 the entire projection may be several 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.950
 projection current from above 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.220
 power projection left 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.890
 and front view with redistribution 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 fourth projection most 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 claimed it and with them 3 chesky view so 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.020
 called perspective 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.750
 essentially any of the species in these four windows 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.760
 you can easily and simply switch to 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.930
 other either turn high schools 3 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.740

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.840
 to do this, simply advance 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.160
 the scene displayed are selected quarters 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.620
 to the left of the projection windows is located 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.680
 command panel containing 6 tabs and 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.040
 enabling operations 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.340
 on creation and modification of objects 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.370
 scenes 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.140
 each such tab consists of ingots 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.230
 containing data from a variety of 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.300
 properties already existing 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.610
 facilities or tools for creating new 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.140
 at the bottom of the window is also located 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.710
 interface line containing various 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.860
 button poles including a button group
