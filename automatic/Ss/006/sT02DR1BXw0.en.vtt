00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:03.810
 a new phenomenon in sports hall the harmony 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.440
 standard bearers impact coat of the grift insight and they see an attack of PKC 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.260
 with the meetings and leon simons two purified players from pkc 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.089
 and racing with leon simons that opened the score for the team from 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.400
 barendrecht 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.770
 but a little later the course of the trial was about forty for a head start 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.739
 of 3 0 2 of 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.989
 both parties are next to each other again 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.699
 bos wants to distance himself as quickly as possible from the opponent casper boom peter 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.440
 low road from distance 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.050
 that's what the association says 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.050
 dos 46 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.280
 it was of course to the satisfaction of the coach Jan the young robbers 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.220
 moments later another attack from the dos 46 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.330
 peter lageweg casper tree 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.130
 what is the difference 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.350
 two hits 3d photos 46 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.810
 growers a little later than a physically hard competition of 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.500
 and meanwhile it is indescribable here to make the ball one of the best players 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.760
 she is a fever and brings PKC a little closer 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.420
 but it's not just the suzanne bush 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.940
 mediq tim decorates 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 yes your street can be leon simons sham 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.610
 yes it remains a teasing spirit 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.470
 and thus dos 46 can say goodbye to pkc in a real way 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.330
 a number then again from dos 46 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.170
 the procession meijer 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.700
 it is now just searching for andré coopers 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.920
 yes he with a simple private move 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.470
 employers are sold 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.600
 and then we are already shortly before the break 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.110
 last attack from outpost 46 rebound and the score for casper boom 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.600
 he defined positions 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 10 10 in favor of pos 46 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.350
 Suzanne Bush Dam brings the various beginnings of the second half 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.800
 back to two hits 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 and so had to drop as 46 again 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.560
 andré coopers 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.500
 good combination here with sabrina bijank had lucas crystal meijer 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 and so the defense of pkc is completely lost 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.519
 we have to stop 14 11 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.919
 the new nato of dos 46 on which the greenhouse 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.539
 kristof meijer 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.379
 andré kuipers striking lucas 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.719
 one of his three goals 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.719
 and then the difference is on four hits 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.289
 because PKC is giving something back in that phase, I want so badly 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.189
 yes and they are stark contrast to suzanne bush 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.499
 she became top scorer at pkc with no less than seven goals 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.669
 but dost also leaves for the match 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:44.939
 peter lageweg 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.939
 from a distance sixteen against and twelve 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.139
 the difference is getting bigger 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.359
 certainly because the dos 46 is conditionally much stronger than pkc 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.709
 sabrina adj 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.329
 andré coopers 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.179
 17 12 that has been made suitable 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.179
 dos 46 from the competition winning that is clear 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:12.099
 we are now in the final phase of andre coopers 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.080
 the municipality scores the seven goals 22 15 differently 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:20.489
 the last hit is from sabrina egank liberator village 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.409
 23 15 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.889
 and as exciting as 46 for you 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.759
 today a difficult opponent to play 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.849
 it is tricky you know he am the lessons 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.479
 those on the physical do not owe debtors anything to get out of there 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.879
 but to win here 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.859
 and then you must be on top and if we are just good our game our level 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.340
 Therefore we must at least have a thousand of these problems and have it 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.869
 program sets what we have already set very high and that is allowed 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:51.639
 majdic if you are satisfied with 23 15 hours of beijing for a few months 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:52.019
 to be
