your radio-controlled car it's quite a

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.010 
your radio-controlled car it's quite a
simple<00:00:19.840> technique<00:00:20.289> all<00:00:20.710> you<00:00:20.919> need<00:00:21.039> is<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.189> few

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
simple technique all you need is a few

simple technique all you need is a few
readily<00:00:23.020> available<00:00:23.079> items<00:00:23.770> and<00:00:24.070> just<00:00:24.730> takes<00:00:24.910> a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
readily available items and just takes a

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.420 
readily available items and just takes a
few<00:00:25.029> minutes<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.570> do<00:00:25.739> little<00:00:26.739> bit<00:00:26.800> tricky<00:00:27.220> but

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
few minutes to do little bit tricky but

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.299 
few minutes to do little bit tricky but
you<00:00:27.820> know<00:00:28.410> shouldn't<00:00:29.410> take<00:00:29.559> you<00:00:29.649> too<00:00:29.710> long<00:00:29.829> and

you know shouldn't take you too long and
it<00:00:30.460> does<00:00:30.669> it<00:00:30.969> works<00:00:31.239> very<00:00:31.450> well<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:32.349> this<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:32.980> a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
it does it works very well so this is a

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.770 
it does it works very well so this is a
receiver<00:00:33.399> we're<00:00:33.640> going<00:00:33.850> to<00:00:33.940> waterproof<00:00:34.480> which

the<00:01:02.170> blue<00:01:02.440> once<00:01:03.039> you're<00:01:03.219> done<00:01:03.370> so<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.629> idea<00:01:04.989> is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
the blue once you're done so the idea is

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.460 
the blue once you're done so the idea is
once<00:01:06.159> you've<00:01:06.340> plugged<00:01:06.640> in<00:01:06.850> your<00:01:07.470> speed

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
once you've plugged in your speed

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.360 
once you've plugged in your speed
controller<00:01:08.800> your<00:01:09.520> steering<00:01:09.970> servo<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.600> the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
controller your steering servo and the

power supply cables to the receiver the

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.670 
power supply cables to the receiver the
idea<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.549> you<00:01:16.450> take<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.689> small<00:01:17.020> piece<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.259> the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
idea is you take a small piece of the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:28.499 
idea is you take a small piece of the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
tricky and it's worth trying to stretch

the balloon a bit before you try and get
it<00:02:13.610> over<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.970> receiver<00:02:14.330> because<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:15.019> can<00:02:15.290> be<00:02:15.590> a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
it over the receiver because it can be a

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.850 
it over the receiver because it can be a
little<00:02:15.800> bit<00:02:15.950> tricky<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:17.560> give<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.680> balloon

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.940 
little bit tricky to give the balloon
let<00:02:19.130> them<00:02:19.370> blow<00:02:20.000> up<00:02:20.030> first<00:02:20.420> okay<00:02:26.830> we're<00:02:27.830> trying

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
let them blow up first okay we're trying

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.880 
let them blow up first okay we're trying
to<00:02:28.160> stretch<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.580> balloon<00:02:29.290> over<00:02:30.290> our<00:02:30.620> fingers

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
to stretch the balloon over our fingers

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.979 
to stretch the balloon over our fingers
there's<00:02:33.890> possible<00:02:34.340> then<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:35.510> practice<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
there's possible then and practice a

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.680 
there's possible then and practice a
little<00:02:36.260> bit<00:02:36.470> fiddly<00:02:36.709> fiddly<00:02:37.310> but<00:02:37.819> if<00:02:38.120> it's

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
little bit fiddly fiddly but if it's

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.199 
little bit fiddly fiddly but if it's
certainly<00:02:39.049> doable<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:40.400> we<00:02:40.489> try<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.730> feed<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
certainly doable and we try and feed the

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.600 
certainly doable and we try and feed the
balloon<00:02:41.480> then<00:02:42.280> over<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.370> receiver<00:02:44.140> hopefully

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
down gradually over the receiver if you

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.860 
down gradually over the receiver if you
put<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.400> balloon<00:03:04.670> on<00:03:04.849> to<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.329> aerial<00:03:05.690> cable

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.259 
put the balloon on to the aerial cable

they can depending on what it's made up
natural<00:04:16.650> natural<00:04:17.070> rubber<00:04:17.400> or<00:04:17.580> latex<00:04:18.230> they<00:04:19.230> can

natural natural rubber or latex they can
rot<00:04:19.770> over<00:04:20.100> time<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.580> it's<00:04:20.700> worth<00:04:20.850> keeping<00:04:21.060> an
