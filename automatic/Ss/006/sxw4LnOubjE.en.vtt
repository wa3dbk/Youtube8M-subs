now<00:00:00.690> what<00:00:00.870> I<00:00:00.900> want<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.079> cover<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.460> output

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
now what I want to cover is output

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.360 
now what I want to cover is output
impedance<00:00:02.639> as<00:00:03.240> well<00:00:04.170> as<00:00:04.319> input<00:00:04.710> impedance<00:00:04.830> and

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
impedance as well as input impedance and

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.519 
impedance as well as input impedance and
an<00:00:06.060> example<00:00:06.480> where<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.080> look<00:00:07.259> at<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
an example where we look at the

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.540 
an example where we look at the
breadboard<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.189> we<00:00:08.940> take<00:00:09.090> advantage<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
breadboard and we take advantage of the

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.879 
breadboard and we take advantage of the
push-pull<00:00:11.550> driver<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.900> circuit<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.530> page

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
63 chapter 4 of our workbook so what I

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.590 
63 chapter 4 of our workbook so what I
have<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:20.070> darling<00:00:20.400> or<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.029> push<00:00:21.300> pole

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
have is this darling or this push pole

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.150 
have is this darling or this push pole
pair<00:00:21.930> set<00:00:22.289> up<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.970> I'm<00:00:23.970> driving<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.600> from<00:00:25.160> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
pair set up and I'm driving it from the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.970 
pair set up and I'm driving it from the
function<00:00:26.609> generator<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.380> right<00:00:28.380> now<00:00:28.619> what

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
function generator and right now what

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.859 
function generator and right now what
I'm<00:00:29.099> doing<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.519> I'm<00:00:29.580> bypassing<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.599> let's

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
I'm doing is I'm bypassing that let's

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.040 
I'm doing is I'm bypassing that let's
make<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.320> more<00:00:31.529> clear<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:32.270> will<00:00:33.270> go<00:00:33.420> ahead<00:00:33.540> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
make that more clear I will go ahead and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.250 
make that more clear I will go ahead and
plug<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.739> down<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> feed

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
plug it down here and this is the feed

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.260 
plug it down here and this is the feed
coming<00:00:37.710> from<00:00:38.629> function<00:00:39.629> generator<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> now

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
coming from function generator so now

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.560 
coming from function generator so now
I've<00:00:42.450> connected<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.789> my<00:00:44.789> speaker<00:00:45.180> input

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
I've connected that to my speaker input

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
I've connected that to my speaker input
and<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:45.899> I've<00:00:46.020> got<00:00:46.050> ground<00:00:46.500> connected<00:00:47.039> all

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and then I've got ground connected all

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.940 
and then I've got ground connected all
the<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.399> up<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.780> remainder<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> way<00:00:49.500> so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the way up the remainder of the way so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.130 
the way up the remainder of the way so
now<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> go<00:00:50.399> ahead<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.940> turn<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.449> my<00:00:51.660> breadboard

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
now I go ahead and turn on my breadboard

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.670 
now I go ahead and turn on my breadboard
and<00:00:53.000> maybe<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.510> hear<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and maybe you can hear it up with the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.270 
and maybe you can hear it up with the
camera<00:00:56.039> close<00:00:56.309> by<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.530> then<00:00:58.530> there's<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
camera close by and then there's the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810 
camera close by and then there's the
waveform<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.420> oscilloscope<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.609> i<00:01:02.609> can

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
waveform on the oscilloscope and i can

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.680 
waveform on the oscilloscope and i can
adjust<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.329> frequency

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.870 

and<00:01:10.690> so<00:01:10.870> we've<00:01:11.020> got<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.260> signal<00:01:11.650> in<00:01:11.770> there<00:01:11.980> let's

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
and so we've got a signal in there let's

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.700 
and so we've got a signal in there let's
go<00:01:13.030> ahead<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.330> hit<00:01:14.190> average<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:16.260> then<00:01:17.260> hit

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
go ahead and hit average and then hit

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.860 
go ahead and hit average and then hit
measure<00:01:18.370> to<00:01:18.700> get<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.120> measurement<00:01:19.690> of<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
measure to get the measurement of the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.410 
measure to get the measurement of the
signal<00:01:20.380> strength<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:21.100> right<00:01:22.000> now<00:01:22.150> I've<00:01:22.390> got

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
signal strength and right now I've got

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.340 
signal strength and right now I've got
to<00:01:23.170> two<00:01:23.830> hundred<00:01:23.980> and<00:01:24.220> eighty<00:01:24.550> millivolts<00:01:25.350> 272

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
to two hundred and eighty millivolts 272

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.010 
to two hundred and eighty millivolts 272
millivolts<00:01:26.920> peak<00:01:27.160> to<00:01:27.310> peak<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:28.600> signal

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
millivolts peak to peak of the signal

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.570 
millivolts peak to peak of the signal
coming<00:01:29.290> out<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.620> function<00:01:29.950> generator<00:01:30.130> and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
coming out of the function generator and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.420 
coming out of the function generator and
feeding<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.060> speaker<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.570> I'm<00:01:31.960> grabbing<00:01:32.680> the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
feeding the speaker and I'm grabbing the

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.020 
feeding the speaker and I'm grabbing the
signal<00:01:33.850> right<00:01:34.210> at<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.750> speaker<00:01:35.640> okay<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:36.700> now

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
signal right at the speaker okay so now

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.370 
signal right at the speaker okay so now
what<00:01:37.240> I'm<00:01:37.300> gonna<00:01:37.390> do<00:01:37.510> is<00:01:37.540> I'm<00:01:37.660> going<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:37.870> swap

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to swap

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.230 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to swap
the<00:01:38.680> input<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:40.170> speaker<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.200> this

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the input of the speaker to this

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.870 
the input of the speaker to this
push-pull<00:01:43.240> driver<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:48.520> I'm<00:01:48.670> going<00:01:48.820> to

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
push-pull driver and then I'm going to

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.110 
push-pull driver and then I'm going to
feed<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.479> signal<00:01:49.900> into<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.220> now<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.580> can

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
feed the signal into and so now you can

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.990 
feed the signal into and so now you can
see<00:01:55.420> how<00:01:55.690> much<00:01:56.110> stronger<00:01:56.530> is

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.020 

by<00:02:00.600> volts<00:02:01.320> peak<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.830> peak

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
by volts peak to peak

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.930 
by volts peak to peak
decrease<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.930> amplitude<00:02:04.250> here

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.090 

and<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:11.600> now<00:02:11.840> what<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.200> can<00:02:12.230> see<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.800> what<00:02:13.010> we

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
and so now what you can see is what we

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.380 
and so now what you can see is what we
call<00:02:13.370> crossover<00:02:14.120> distortion

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.980 

for<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.080> transistor<00:02:17.710> shut<00:02:18.100> off<00:02:21.750> when<00:02:22.750> they're

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
for the transistor shut off when they're

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.820 
for the transistor shut off when they're
going<00:02:23.410> across<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.340> diode<00:02:24.550> portion<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
going across the diode portion of the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.930 
going across the diode portion of the
transistors<00:02:27.660> emitter<00:02:28.890> pins<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.520> here<00:02:30.790> you

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
transistors emitter pins and so here you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.980 
transistors emitter pins and so here you
can<00:02:30.970> see<00:02:31.090> it's<00:02:31.420> off<00:02:31.660> turns<00:02:32.650> on/off<00:02:33.690> turns<00:02:34.690> on

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
can see it's off turns on/off turns on

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.590 
can see it's off turns on/off turns on
and<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.220> that's<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.820> crossover<00:02:37.450> distortion

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
and so that's the crossover distortion

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.900 
and so that's the crossover distortion
you<00:02:38.110> may<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.380> heard<00:02:38.590> about<00:02:38.680> when<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.700> comes

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
you may have heard about when it comes

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.620 
you may have heard about when it comes
to<00:02:40.380> push<00:02:41.380> pull<00:02:41.650> drivers<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.209> have

I'll<00:02:45.170> shut<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.620> off<00:02:45.800> now<00:02:46.690> we<00:02:47.690> now<00:02:47.900> have<00:02:48.170> our

I'll shut this off now we now have our

I'll shut this off now we now have our

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
push-pull driver if you remember is

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.660 
push-pull driver if you remember is
being<00:03:01.130> fed<00:03:01.940> into<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.510> base<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
being fed into the base of the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.090 
being fed into the base of the
transistors<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.990> input<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.590> got<00:03:06.890> some

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
transistors and that input is got some

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.630 
transistors and that input is got some
very<00:03:07.250> high<00:03:07.550> input<00:03:07.910> impedance<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:08.780> now<00:03:09.610> when<00:03:10.610> I

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
very high input impedance so now when I

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.290 
very high input impedance so now when I
look<00:03:10.910> at<00:03:11.090> my<00:03:12.370> speaker<00:03:13.370> my<00:03:13.640> speaker<00:03:13.940> has<00:03:14.090> eight

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
look at my speaker my speaker has eight

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.780 
look at my speaker my speaker has eight
ohms<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.780> resistance<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.530> ground<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:16.640> when<00:03:16.760> I

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
ohms of resistance to ground so when I

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.550 
ohms of resistance to ground so when I
take<00:03:17.150> my<00:03:17.180> signal<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.810> drive<00:03:18.020> it<00:03:18.140> directly

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
take my signal and drive it directly

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.400 
take my signal and drive it directly
into<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.130> speaker<00:03:19.720> then<00:03:20.720> I'm<00:03:20.840> looking<00:03:21.170> at<00:03:21.290> the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
into the speaker then I'm looking at the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.910 
into the speaker then I'm looking at the
500<00:03:21.680> ohm<00:03:22.130> output<00:03:22.790> impedance<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.600> my<00:03:24.500> function

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
500 ohm output impedance of my function

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.650 
500 ohm output impedance of my function
generator<00:03:25.780> feeding<00:03:26.780> an<00:03:26.900> 8<00:03:27.110> ohm<00:03:28.660> speaker

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
generator feeding an 8 ohm speaker

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.840 
generator feeding an 8 ohm speaker
resistor<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.010> that's<00:03:31.190> why<00:03:31.460> we<00:03:31.640> end<00:03:31.760> up

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
resistor and so that's why we end up

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.820 
resistor and so that's why we end up
with<00:03:32.000> very<00:03:32.030> small<00:03:32.390> signal<00:03:33.170> strength<00:03:33.470> at<00:03:33.650> the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
with very small signal strength at the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.560 
with very small signal strength at the
end<00:03:33.980> because<00:03:34.250> we<00:03:34.430> only<00:03:34.610> have<00:03:34.850> eight<00:03:35.060> more<00:03:35.330> ohms

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
end because we only have eight more ohms

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.410 
end because we only have eight more ohms
left<00:03:35.990> until<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.860> signal<00:03:37.220> gets<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.520> ground<00:03:37.760> but

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
left until a signal gets to ground but

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.390 
left until a signal gets to ground but
when<00:03:38.570> I<00:03:38.600> go<00:03:38.780> ahead<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:38.990> feet<00:03:39.290> feed<00:03:39.800> my<00:03:40.010> signal

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
when I go ahead and feet feed my signal

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.370 
when I go ahead and feet feed my signal
through<00:03:40.580> my<00:03:42.160> push-pull<00:03:43.160> transistor<00:03:43.970> driver

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
through my push-pull transistor driver

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.170 
through my push-pull transistor driver
that<00:03:45.380> has<00:03:45.590> very<00:03:45.860> high<00:03:45.920> input<00:03:46.400> impedance<00:03:46.610> so

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
that has very high input impedance so

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.960 
that has very high input impedance so
even<00:03:47.420> though<00:03:47.480> I've<00:03:47.600> got<00:03:47.780> 500<00:03:48.050> ohms<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.970> output

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
even though I've got 500 ohms of output

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.360 
even though I've got 500 ohms of output
impedance<00:03:50.360> on<00:03:50.510> my<00:03:50.720> breadboard<00:03:51.200> I'm<00:03:51.650> still

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
impedance on my breadboard I'm still

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.570 
impedance on my breadboard I'm still
feeding<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:53.060> whole<00:03:53.360> bunch<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.860> resistance<00:03:54.860> into

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
feeding a whole bunch of resistance into

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.580 
feeding a whole bunch of resistance into
this<00:03:56.000> circuit<00:03:56.480> before<00:03:56.630> it<00:03:56.930> finally<00:03:57.140> goes<00:03:57.380> to

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
this circuit before it finally goes to

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.470 
this circuit before it finally goes to
ground<00:03:57.770> so<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.640> signal<00:03:58.970> stays<00:03:59.150> nice<00:03:59.450> and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
ground so the signal stays nice and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.360 
ground so the signal stays nice and
strong<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.140> then<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.740> output<00:04:00.770> of<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:02.200> BJT

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
strong and then the output of the BJT

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.710 
strong and then the output of the BJT
ends<00:04:04.370> up<00:04:04.460> having<00:04:04.640> very<00:04:04.940> low<00:04:05.180> output<00:04:05.450> impedance

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
ends up having very low output impedance

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.020 
ends up having very low output impedance
not<00:04:06.440> like<00:04:06.740> 500<00:04:07.340> that<00:04:07.550> we<00:04:07.670> have<00:04:07.820> in<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
not like 500 that we have in the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.660 
not like 500 that we have in the
breadboard<00:04:08.390> but<00:04:08.690> something<00:04:09.140> on<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.340> order<00:04:10.490> of

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
breadboard but something on the order of

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.740 
breadboard but something on the order of
15<00:04:11.420> or<00:04:11.600> 20<00:04:11.990> ohms<00:04:12.470> maybe<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.220> now<00:04:14.030> feeding<00:04:14.480> that

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
15 or 20 ohms maybe and now feeding that

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.220 
15 or 20 ohms maybe and now feeding that
to<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.850> speaker<00:04:16.850> we<00:04:17.000> get<00:04:17.180> that<00:04:17.330> much<00:04:17.660> much

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
to the speaker we get that much much

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.940 
to the speaker we get that much much
louder<00:04:18.770> signal<00:04:19.430> coming<00:04:19.670> out
