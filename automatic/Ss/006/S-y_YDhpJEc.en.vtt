00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.980
 Hey, I'll show you how you guys today 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.010
 correct seat height on the motorcycle 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.199
 should be able to determine in principle 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.360
 feet always be on the ground if 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.680
 her on the motorcycle is not sitting that 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.300
 you somehow at the first traffic light 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.270
 then you can fall over and you can 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.830
 no longer hold 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.540
 Generally there are different 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.820
 Motorcycles so there are for example 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.500
 enduro that a little bit higher now 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.090
 a chopper there you sit a bit 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.200
 lower 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.920
 and of course you have to go first 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.940
 think what you want and 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 general on trial sit it comes to 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.309
 in principle, there are again 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.289
 times as a criterion as you on the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.339
 easy to measure where he already can 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.989
 times to make a preliminary decision 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.329
 which motorcycle fits you 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.059
 or which seat height and which level 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.850
 Not 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.569
 So this trick is the star you 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.489
 just have to step up your height 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:07.830
 accepted that side animal still before 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.210
 eyes and mouth and then you have to 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.610
 just the step height and important 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.590
 using where here's the ground that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.780
 have no shoes on here and then 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.030
 just stand up straight and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.890
 MÃ¤ster from here from the ground to the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.010
 Step and have a talk like I said 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:33.080
 the step height he gets accepted 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:36.120
 here 80 cm out then from her to here 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.820
 then you can do any problem without problems 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:43.650
 motorcycle up to 80 cm in any case drive 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.750
 and remember if that's 82 now 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.810
 So you have shoes on too 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.710
 certainly when riding a motorcycle and then 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.680
 do you have there also still a little bit 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.600
 play in it and if you really are now 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.010
 you love you in the motorcycle under 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.350
 many 12 cm 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.560
 then there is a possibility that you 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.230
 for sattler goes off and the saddle 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.790
 But cushions also think about that 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.050
 this seating comfort is a bit or 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.670
 this suspension just a bit 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.710
 So less will be all 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.950
 a bit harder but you can do that too 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.330
 a two centimeter win all the way 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.280
 conclusion what actually important 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.870
 is that you weight of the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.480
 motorcycle so do not looks at the now 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.900
 somehow weighs only 50 kilos and picks 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.670
 you as a moped with 250 kilos so that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.320
 is also a little bit stop watching 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.180
 simply because lifting 250 kilos with 50 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.150
 Kilo's own weight will definitely be 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.650
 difficult as you look again 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.420
 conclusion summarized here you can 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.050
 the correct seat height on the motorcycle 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.650
 easily determine by her just 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.840
 your step height fair and yes am 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.510
 circuit as always I hope that now so 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.440
 your real motorcycle finds and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.440
 wish you much fun
