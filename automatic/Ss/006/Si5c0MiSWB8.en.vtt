00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
regular camera sensors on mobile phones

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.830 
regular camera sensors on mobile phones
more<00:05:10.400> right<00:05:10.669> really<00:05:10.940> actually<00:05:11.240> is<00:05:11.659> the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
more right really actually is the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.409 
more right really actually is the
biggest<00:05:12.169> player<00:05:12.500> in<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:13.250> mobile<00:05:13.729> phone<00:05:14.000> carries

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
biggest player in a mobile phone carries

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.570 
biggest player in a mobile phone carries
the<00:05:14.539> sensors<00:05:14.900> are<00:05:15.080> so<00:05:15.289> small<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.400> more

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
the sensors are so small so the more

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.159 
the sensors are so small so the more
light<00:05:16.789> that's<00:05:16.940> coming<00:05:17.060> in<00:05:17.389> into<00:05:17.719> the<00:05:17.840> sensor

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
light that's coming in into the sensor

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.379 
light that's coming in into the sensor
means<00:05:18.440> to<00:05:18.680> clear<00:05:18.889> the<00:05:19.159> image<00:05:19.520> will<00:05:19.669> be<00:05:19.849> on<00:05:20.120> your

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
means to clear the image will be on your

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.870 
means to clear the image will be on your
device<00:05:20.659> so<00:05:21.169> maybe<00:05:21.319> a<00:05:21.469> 4<00:05:21.889> megapixel<00:05:22.069> camera

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
device so maybe a 4 megapixel camera

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.570 
device so maybe a 4 megapixel camera
isn't<00:05:23.539> so<00:05:23.779> bad<00:05:24.020> HTC<00:05:24.710> did<00:05:24.919> say<00:05:25.159> that<00:05:25.430> a

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
isn't so bad HTC did say that a

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.059 
isn't so bad HTC did say that a
4-megapixel<00:05:26.000> still<00:05:26.569> image<00:05:26.960> will<00:05:27.440> still<00:05:27.770> fill

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
4-megapixel still image will still fill

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.700 
4-megapixel still image will still fill
