00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
to go into working with them I'm gonna

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.810 
to go into working with them I'm gonna

some of the basic concepts involved

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.900 
some of the basic concepts involved
it's<00:00:22.320> made<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> null<00:00:22.920> object<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> number

it's made of a null object with a number
of<00:00:24.000> solids<00:00:24.390> parented<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.859> make<00:00:26.160> them

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
of solids parented to it I can make them

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.400 
of solids parented to it I can make them
transparent<00:00:26.580> add<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.390> few<00:00:27.689> lights<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
background which I'm gonna lock so it

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.030

section to help with this but you can
also<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> by<00:00:48.420> hand

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
also do it by hand

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
also do it by hand
I'll<00:00:50.280> set<00:00:50.610> motion<00:00:50.969> monkey<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> scale<00:00:51.930> up<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
I'll set motion monkey to a scale up and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.090 
I'll set motion monkey to a scale up and
a<00:00:52.590> spin<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:52.980> its<00:00:53.280> y-axis<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:55.530> first<00:00:55.770> approach

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
a spin on its y-axis the first approach

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.119 
a spin on its y-axis the first approach
is<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.579> pre-cut<00:00:56.969> them<00:00:57.180> individually<00:00:58.129> I'd

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
is to pre-cut them individually I'd

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.970 
is to pre-cut them individually I'd
recommend<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.760> for<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> most<00:01:00.239> control

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
recommend this for the most control

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.799 
recommend this for the most control
pre-comp<00:01:01.980> each<00:01:02.219> parented<00:01:02.820> object<00:01:03.329> before<00:01:03.660> the

motion<00:01:03.989> monkey<00:01:04.409> build<00:01:04.820> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.000> also<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
motion monkey build you can also do a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.539 
motion monkey build you can also do a
build<00:01:06.869> within<00:01:07.140> those<00:01:07.470> pre<00:01:07.770> comps<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> want

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
build within those pre comps if you want

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.789 
build within those pre comps if you want
then<00:01:09.510> bring<00:01:09.840> them<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.140> into<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> final

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
then bring them all into the final

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.880 
then bring them all into the final
composition<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.700> collapse<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.110> then

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
composition and collapse them and then

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:25.240 
composition and collapse them and then
build<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.520> new<00:01:14.549> motion<00:01:14.939> monkey<00:01:15.420> animation

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.950 

the<00:01:26.250> second<00:01:26.580> option<00:01:26.760> is<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> leave<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the second option is to leave it as is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 
the second option is to leave it as is
everything<00:01:28.950> unlocked<00:01:29.250> during<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.760> build

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
everything unlocked during the build

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.240 
everything unlocked during the build
motion<00:01:30.960> monkey<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.380> break<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> parenting

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
motion monkey will break the parenting

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.920 
motion monkey will break the parenting
resulting<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> null<00:01:33.270> self<00:01:33.600> being

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
resulting in the null self being

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.740 
resulting in the null self being
animated<00:01:34.320> by<00:01:34.680> motion<00:01:35.100> monkey<00:01:35.450> but<00:01:36.450> it'll<00:01:36.720> just

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
animated by motion monkey but it'll just

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.260 
animated by motion monkey but it'll just
basically<00:01:37.259> act<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.710> any<00:01:37.920> other<00:01:38.130> layer<00:01:38.430> this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
basically act as any other layer this

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.609 
basically act as any other layer this
might<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.840> best<00:01:39.990> way<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.500> about

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
might be the best way to go about

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.560 
might be the best way to go about
working<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.220> multiple<00:01:41.430> parented<00:01:42.119> objects

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
working with multiple parented objects

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
working with multiple parented objects
if<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.200> need<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.530> mess<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.009> after

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
if you don't need to mess with it after

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
if you don't need to mess with it after
the<00:01:44.430> build<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.390> end<00:01:45.540> result<00:01:45.930> will<00:01:46.050> be<00:01:46.110> all<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the build the end result will be all the

the animation using motion monkeys undo
will<00:02:35.940> lose<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.329> original<00:02:36.420> parenting<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.739> it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
will lose the original parenting so it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.340 
will lose the original parenting so it
might<00:02:38.100> be<00:02:38.310> best<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.670> use<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.239> ease<00:02:39.510> native<00:02:40.019> undo

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350
