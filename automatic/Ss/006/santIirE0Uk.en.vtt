hey guys Harry here so with mostly
dragon's<00:00:09.599> teeth<00:00:09.719> weapons<00:00:10.200> out<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.530> way<00:00:10.650> it's

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
dragon's teeth weapons out the way it's

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.060 
dragon's teeth weapons out the way it's
time<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.490> give<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.880> MPX<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.719> shot<00:00:12.929> now<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.710> PDW

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
time to give the MPX a shot now this PDW

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.460 
time to give the MPX a shot now this PDW
is<00:00:14.460> actually<00:00:14.940> really<00:00:15.269> good<00:00:15.540> fun<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.990> use<00:00:16.199> and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
is actually really good fun to use and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.890 
is actually really good fun to use and
statistically<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.430> rather<00:00:17.910> good<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.539> would

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
statistically it's rather good I would

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.290 
statistically it's rather good I would
say<00:00:19.109> dice<00:00:19.560> keep<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.100> stats<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.640> same<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.180> will

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
say dice keep the stats the same it will

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.710 
say dice keep the stats the same it will
definitely<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.529> your<00:00:22.800> go-to<00:00:23.269> pdws<00:00:24.269> so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
definitely be one of your go-to pdws so

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.509 
definitely be one of your go-to pdws so
firstly<00:00:25.109> let's<00:00:25.350> talk<00:00:25.560> about<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.039> stats<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
firstly let's talk about the stats the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.679 
firstly let's talk about the stats the
MPX<00:00:26.939> has<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> rate<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.750> fire<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.820> 850<00:00:29.820> rpm<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
MPX has a rate of fire of 850 rpm and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.950 
MPX has a rate of fire of 850 rpm and
has<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.019> damage<00:00:31.410> model<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.949> 27<00:00:32.669> maximum<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.420> 13

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
has a damage model of 27 maximum and 13

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.870 
has a damage model of 27 maximum and 13
minimum<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.649> obviously<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.280> not<00:00:35.370> really

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
minimum so obviously it's not really

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.330 
minimum so obviously it's not really
well<00:00:36.090> suited<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> long<00:00:37.050> range<00:00:37.320> gunfights<00:00:37.680> it

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
well suited to long range gunfights it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.940 
well suited to long range gunfights it
can<00:00:38.579> carry<00:00:38.760> 25<00:00:39.629> rounds<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
can carry 25 rounds and one and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
can carry 25 rounds and one and
chambered<00:00:41.370> its<00:00:41.640> tactical<00:00:42.180> reload<00:00:42.510> time<00:00:42.780> is

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
chambered its tactical reload time is

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.670 
chambered its tactical reload time is
2.1<00:00:43.770> seconds<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.840> 2.7<00:00:45.840> seconds<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.559> its

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
2.1 seconds and 2.7 seconds for its

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.950 
2.1 seconds and 2.7 seconds for its
empty<00:00:47.129> reload<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:48.000> course<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> beauty

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
empty reload and of course it's a beauty

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.799 
empty reload and of course it's a beauty
w<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.710> its<00:00:49.920> muzzle<00:00:50.190> velocity<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.059> rather<00:00:51.390> low

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
w so its muzzle velocity is rather low

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.729 
w so its muzzle velocity is rather low
at<00:00:52.250> 340<00:00:53.250> meters<00:00:53.610> per<00:00:53.640> second<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:55.199> even

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
at 340 meters per second and going even

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.670 
at 340 meters per second and going even
lower<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.399> 180<00:00:57.210> while<00:00:57.570> suppressed<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.440> does

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.830 
lower to 180 while suppressed it does
have<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> fairly<00:00:59.550> low<00:00:59.730> recall<00:01:00.270> though<00:01:00.510> it's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
have a fairly low recall though it's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080 
have a fairly low recall though it's
really<00:01:01.260> easy<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.710> control<00:01:02.340> its<00:01:02.609> upwards

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.429 
actually killing them luckily though
it's<00:02:02.369> high<00:02:02.640> rate<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.000> fire<00:02:03.329> kind<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> helps<00:02:04.259> out

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it's high rate of fire kind of helps out

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.200 
it's high rate of fire kind of helps out
with<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.829> time<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.310> kill<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:05.880> once<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
really cool as well

soldier kind of flicks the MPX up for
some<00:02:27.209> reason<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:27.720> don't<00:02:28.170> know<00:02:28.290> if<00:02:28.409> that's<00:02:28.620> a

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
some reason I don't know if that's a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.740 
some reason I don't know if that's a
technique<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.640> need<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.940> do<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.390> real<00:02:30.720> life

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
technique you need to do in real life

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.110 
technique you need to do in real life
but<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.409> kind<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.769> seems<00:02:32.040> like<00:02:32.190> dice<00:02:32.730> just

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
but it kind of seems like dice just

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.149 
but it kind of seems like dice just
added<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:34.200> make<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.500> reload<00:02:34.860> times

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
added that to make the reload times

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.819 
added that to make the reload times
longer<00:02:35.610> much<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.299> most<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> PDW<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.709> it

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
longer much like most of the PDW is it

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.039 
longer much like most of the PDW is it
excels<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.519> close<00:02:38.849> quarters<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> move

fights<00:02:40.409> you<00:02:40.980> don't<00:02:41.220> even<00:02:41.459> really<00:02:41.909> need<00:02:42.180> to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
fights you don't even really need to

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.179

worry<00:02:42.750> about<00:02:42.870> abs<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.799> can<00:02:43.950> get<00:02:44.069> away

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
worry about abs and you can get away

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.580 
worry about abs and you can get away
with<00:02:44.579> hip<00:02:44.909> firing<00:02:45.269> with<00:02:45.629> most<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.200> your<00:02:46.290> kills

especially if you add a laser sight I'm
pretty<00:02:49.379> happy<00:02:49.590> where<00:02:49.829> dice<00:02:50.129> I<00:02:50.400> go<00:02:50.670> with<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> lot

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it's causing some balancing concerns but
