00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.990 

back<00:01:27.800> next<00:01:28.800> thing<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.100> think<00:01:29.370> I'm<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> do

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
is go for some this looks like sandwich
sized<00:01:40.100> pepperoni<00:01:41.720> look<00:01:42.720> pretty<00:01:43.050> fragile<00:01:43.460> when

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
sized pepperoni look pretty fragile when

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.109 
sized pepperoni look pretty fragile when
I<00:01:44.610> saw<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:44.940> cutting<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.610> now<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:47.759> all<00:01:47.910> my

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
I saw it cutting it so now get all my

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.210 
I saw it cutting it so now get all my
meat<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> deli<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.830> help<00:01:50.009> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
meat out of the deli if I can help it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
meat out of the deli if I can help it
because<00:01:50.550> typically<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.440> fresher

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
because typically you know the fresher

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.700 
because typically you know the fresher
the<00:01:52.950> cut<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.400> better<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.509> also<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.259> seems

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the cut the better and also it it seems

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.029 
the cut the better and also it it seems
to<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:57.780> cost<00:01:58.080> effective<00:01:58.740> when<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
to to be more cost effective when you

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:06.639 
to to be more cost effective when you
get<00:01:59.160> it<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.490> deli<00:02:02.090> piece<00:02:03.090> here<00:02:03.830> okay<00:02:04.830> I

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
get it from the deli piece here okay I

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.609 
get it from the deli piece here okay I
think<00:02:07.649> that's<00:02:07.830> gonna<00:02:08.009> work<00:02:08.130> out<00:02:08.310> pretty<00:02:08.580> well

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
think that's gonna work out pretty well

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.229 
think that's gonna work out pretty well
but<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.800> anyway<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.100> saw<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.640> did<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.910> put

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
nice picture like in that but since they

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.630 
nice picture like in that but since they
were<00:02:46.260> kind<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.560> busy<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.920> really<00:02:47.220> didn't<00:02:47.459> want

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
were kind of busy I really didn't want

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.100

much

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
much

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.880 
much
and<00:02:50.100> here<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.549> probably<00:02:51.000> doesn't<00:02:51.269> go<00:02:51.480> at<00:02:51.660> all

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
and here this probably doesn't go at all

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.789 
and here this probably doesn't go at all
but<00:02:52.890> I've<00:02:53.040> got<00:02:53.250> some<00:02:53.519> black<00:02:54.000> forest<00:02:54.480> ham<00:02:54.799> right

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
but I've got some black forest ham right

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.009 
but I've got some black forest ham right
here<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:59.040> thought<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.519> know<00:02:59.640> why<00:02:59.880> not

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
here and I just thought you know why not

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.550 
here and I just thought you know why not
I'm<00:03:01.019> sure<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.410> could<00:03:01.590> use<00:03:02.810> was<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> prosciutto

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
I'm sure you could use was a prosciutto

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.830 
I'm sure you could use was a prosciutto
or<00:03:04.590> whatever<00:03:05.070> it's<00:03:05.970> probably<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.420> good<00:03:06.600> way<00:03:06.780> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
or whatever it's probably a good way to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.560 
or whatever it's probably a good way to
go<00:03:07.079> but<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.620> me<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:09.000> know<00:03:09.120> look<00:03:09.329> at<00:03:09.390> this

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
go but to me this you know look at this

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.970 
go but to me this you know look at this
thing<00:03:09.810> how<00:03:09.989> can<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.260> go<00:03:10.380> wrong<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:10.650> that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
thing how can you go wrong with that

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.720 
thing how can you go wrong with that

provolone<00:03:15.290> my<00:03:16.290> first<00:03:16.590> probably<00:03:17.160> should<00:03:17.459> have

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
provolone my first probably should have

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.360 
provolone my first probably should have
put<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.820> under<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.150> cheese<00:03:18.510> which<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:18.989> can

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
put this under the cheese which I can

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.180 
put this under the cheese which I can
still<00:03:20.370> put<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.299> on<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.570> cheese<00:03:21.810> there<00:03:22.190> you

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
still put that on the cheese there you

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.640 
still put that on the cheese there you
save<00:03:23.489> this<00:03:23.670> for<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:23.940> next<00:03:24.120> trip

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
save this for the next trip

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.619 
save this for the next trip
when<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.250> actually<00:03:26.489> look<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.030> up<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.330> make<00:03:27.480> it

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
when I actually look it up and make it

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.650 
when I actually look it up and make it
the<00:03:27.750> right<00:03:27.959> way<00:03:28.260> maybe<00:03:28.819> alright<00:03:29.819> from<00:03:30.450> there

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
the right way maybe alright from there

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.270 
the right way maybe alright from there
