you're going to make the eyes the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.880 
you're going to make the eyes the

facial<00:01:23.369> proportions<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:26.130> head<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.400> basically

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
facial proportions the head is basically

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.390 
facial proportions the head is basically
an<00:01:27.270> upside-down<00:01:27.689> egg<00:01:28.229> shape<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.130> want<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
an upside-down egg shape you want to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.520 
an upside-down egg shape you want to
begin<00:01:29.520> by<00:01:29.759> drawing<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.479> vertical<00:01:30.720> line<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
begin by drawing a vertical line to the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.910 
begin by drawing a vertical line to the
center<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:33.840> horizontal<00:01:34.439> line<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
center and a horizontal line to the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.210 
center and a horizontal line to the
center

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
center

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.420 
center
then<00:01:37.220> you'll<00:01:37.370> divide<00:01:37.670> both<00:01:38.000> halves<00:01:38.390> in<00:01:39.430> the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
then you'll divide both halves in the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.450 
then you'll divide both halves in the
middle<00:01:40.730> on<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:40.970> upper<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:41.930> lower<00:01:42.250> portions

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.010 

then<00:01:46.460> you'll<00:01:46.640> add<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:46.970> brow<00:01:47.180> line<00:01:47.510> which<00:01:47.990> goes

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
then you'll add the brow line which goes

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.120 
then you'll add the brow line which goes
on<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.500> upper<00:01:49.420> portion<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:51.650> chin<00:01:51.920> line

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
on the upper portion and the chin line

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.740 
on the upper portion and the chin line
which<00:01:52.340> goes<00:01:52.370> on<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.790> bottom<00:01:52.940> notice<00:01:53.630> I've

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
which goes on the bottom notice I've

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.450 
which goes on the bottom notice I've
already<00:01:53.930> added<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.440> mouth<00:01:54.710> line<00:01:55.070> which<00:01:55.430> goes

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
already added the mouth line which goes

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.010 
already added the mouth line which goes
in<00:01:55.820> between<00:01:55.970> both<00:01:56.810> lines<00:01:57.170> on<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.500> bottom<00:01:59.020> now

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
in between both lines on the bottom now

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.330 
in between both lines on the bottom now
you<00:02:00.080> have<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.410> positioning<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.040> your<00:02:01.100> eyes

like<00:04:24.690> an<00:04:25.070> angle<00:04:26.070> just<00:04:26.730> one<00:04:27.150> line<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.110> one

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
like an angle just one line and the one

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.100 
like an angle just one line and the one
on<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.500> bottom<00:04:28.650> looks<00:04:29.040> like<00:04:29.160> a<00:04:29.190> pig's<00:04:29.580> nose

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
on the bottom looks like a pig's nose

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.100 
on the bottom looks like a pig's nose
now<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:32.070> nose<00:04:32.310> is<00:04:32.340> complicated<00:04:33.330> but<00:04:33.540> you<00:04:33.960> do

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
now the nose is complicated but you do

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.590 
now the nose is complicated but you do
want<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.410> indicate<00:04:34.650> where<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.390> nostrils<00:04:36.390> are

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
want to indicate where the nostrils are

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.690 
want to indicate where the nostrils are
and<00:04:36.960> they<00:04:37.169> can<00:04:37.350> be<00:04:37.380> drawn<00:04:37.680> as<00:04:37.860> ellipses<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
and they can be drawn as ellipses and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.220 
and they can be drawn as ellipses and
you<00:04:38.880> want<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.120> barely<00:04:39.360> indicate<00:04:39.990> where<00:04:40.200> the

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
you want to barely indicate where the

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.140 
you want to barely indicate where the
outside<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.919> nose<00:04:41.130> is<00:04:43.730> now<00:04:44.730> with<00:04:45.000> the

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
outside of the nose is now with the

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.520 
outside of the nose is now with the
mouth<00:04:45.390> a<00:04:46.730> lot<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:48.000> lot<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.390> times<00:04:48.630> when<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
mouth a lot a lot of times when the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.590 
mouth a lot a lot of times when the
mouth<00:04:49.710> is<00:04:49.919> drawn<00:04:50.160> incorrectly<00:04:50.850> it's<00:04:51.150> just<00:04:51.390> a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
mouth is drawn incorrectly it's just a

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.810 
mouth is drawn incorrectly it's just a
line<00:04:52.230> with<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.740> few<00:04:53.280> loops<00:04:53.910> over<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.419> top<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:55.020> a

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
line with a few loops over the top and a

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.330 
line with a few loops over the top and a
half<00:04:56.820> circle<00:04:57.120> on<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.570> bottom<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.950> mouth<00:04:59.130> is

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
half circle on the bottom the mouth is

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.550 
half circle on the bottom the mouth is
much<00:04:59.550> more<00:04:59.729> complex<00:05:00.210> than<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:01.229> has

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
much more complex than that it has

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.900 
much more complex than that it has
gentle<00:05:02.370> sloping<00:05:02.940> lines<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.600> if<00:05:04.229> you<00:05:04.590> look

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
gentle sloping lines and if you look

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.650 
gentle sloping lines and if you look
you'll<00:05:05.910> notice<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:08.430> does<00:05:08.700> have<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:09.330> little

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
you'll notice that it does have a little

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.810 
you'll notice that it does have a little
bit<00:05:09.840> more<00:05:10.110> detail

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
bit more detail

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.950 
bit more detail
now<00:05:12.420> if<00:05:12.780> you<00:05:12.930> draw<00:05:13.110> these<00:05:13.290> generic<00:05:14.840> parts<00:05:15.840> of

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
now if you draw these generic parts of

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.480 
now if you draw these generic parts of
the<00:05:16.050> face<00:05:16.260> you'll<00:05:16.830> have<00:05:16.980> something<00:05:17.340> that

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490
