00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.170
 hi people this is gecko for a 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.430
 new video tips on buried then 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.100
 in this video I will show you 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.619
 how to get the seven assets of the 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.040
 mark at the sleeve so for 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.779
 to start 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.869
 already you need a nice sum in 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.390
 bank you have to have money 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.090
 you buy tray 4 at all no matter 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.390
 what the bottom of our 4 so I take 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.660
 the cuicui weill the pass pass that is 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.370
 finds in the dairy court the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.570
 mastodon that is between the cell and 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.019
 the first location of the box 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.579
 mystery and the elixir of vultures that 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.379
 find in the church once you 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.519
 have your four assets that you have 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.079
 bought four trumps it takes them you 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.120
 are still making money there is going to have to 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.010
 to make crates so already first 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.089
 trick block the crate for not 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.600
 it all bar five minutes 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.400
 and I will run after all over the map 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.650
 to block it you put george 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.350
 before wanted to give candy and he 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.729
 repeat once knew is that he has not 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.159
 does the crate is stuck she does not 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.079
 will move more 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.689
 so once that's done it takes 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.439
 that you find in the box the 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.439
 ballistic knives 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:42.380
 and then you have to find the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:44.000
 time bombs once you have 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.810
 these two objects you go into the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.619
 saloon everyone must have noticed 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.060
 that in his area there is a target 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.789
 in front of this target on the ground via a dash 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.600
 you stay well at this trait and with the 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.909
 ballistic knife 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.959
 you shoot a blade in the center of the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.539
 target at first shot miss that's 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:10.099
 good when it works how does it work 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:12.739
 the piano starts up once the 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:19.849
 piano gets started h starts to play you you 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:23.799
 head to the mansion on know he 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:26.299
 must have at least $ 10 / place 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.459
 also on to know is that each 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.030
 ghost if I touch you 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.500
 he takes away two points of mu dollars 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.480
 so I think now sprints 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.430
 ghosts you know them you 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.150
 can easily pass the mansion 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.150
 without making you touch 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.220
 you do not go through manor in 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.480
 made 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.140
 giscard and belgium to get out at 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.140
 the entrance to the labyrinth 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.500
 now here you go back in the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.500
 mansion on the other side 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.230
 alas the fact of having activated the piano 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.530
 in the saloon actually ben now a 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.170
 ghost plays the piano in the in the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.290
 mansion and when you approach her 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.130
 we approach the piano there is a 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.569
 sentence that fits who wants who says 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.489
 tip or make a donation 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.019
 here to tip 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.450
 we give him a tip of 10 dollars 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.379
 and you've seen age and a fifth to 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:42.730
 all who fell so now there 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.120
 you have 5 at all you go back on the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.370
 map 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.829
 so there from that moment so 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.269
 we were at 2 I asked a killer 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.239
 to keep a ghost not everything went 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:57.100
 you really are and I asked him to 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:59.380
 to keep a pardon there you take you the 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.099
 time bomb in the hands that their 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.319
 will kill the ghost is an asset that will 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.440
 appear as soon as everything has appeared to you 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.970
 activate your time bond 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.389
 so you'll be back shortly 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.739
 back 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.200
 your trump is still there you do not 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.530
 do not take the ghost back and there he 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.000
 second asset that appeared 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.039
 now you can take them and 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.110
 you now have 7 in turn and you 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.910
 are always the sleeve one 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.729
 so here I hope this video 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.260
 hints you will have pleased you will be useful and 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.310
