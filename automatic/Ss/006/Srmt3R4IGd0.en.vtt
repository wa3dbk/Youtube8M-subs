these little wings out to set the pot on
I<00:00:29.680> don't<00:00:30.219> know<00:00:30.369> what<00:00:30.640> size<00:00:30.910> I<00:00:30.939> really<00:00:31.509> want<00:00:31.779> of

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
I don't know what size I really want of

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.930 
I don't know what size I really want of
course<00:00:32.649> you<00:00:32.829> want<00:00:33.010> as<00:00:33.190> close<00:00:33.309> to<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.790> heat

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
course you want as close to the heat

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.299 
course you want as close to the heat
sources<00:00:34.270> you<00:00:34.510> can<00:00:34.540> get<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:34.960> probably<00:00:35.440> without

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
sources you can get it probably without

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.130 
sources you can get it probably without
smothering<00:00:36.670> it<00:00:36.969> so<00:00:37.239> first<00:00:37.600> i<00:00:37.750> started<00:00:38.050> with

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
smothering it so first i started with

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.020 
smothering it so first i started with
these<00:00:38.379> which<00:00:38.739> may<00:00:38.950> be<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.129> little<00:00:39.309> tall<00:00:39.640> and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
these which may be a little tall and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.760 
these which may be a little tall and
then<00:00:40.539> I<00:00:40.629> thought<00:00:40.809> well<00:00:40.960> maybe<00:00:41.020> I<00:00:41.320> might<00:00:41.590> need

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
then I thought well maybe I might need

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.660 
then I thought well maybe I might need
it<00:00:41.890> closer<00:00:42.160> so<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:43.030> got<00:00:43.780> these<00:00:43.930> little<00:00:44.140> guys<00:00:44.670> but

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
it closer so I got these little guys but

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.860 
it closer so I got these little guys but
I<00:00:45.880> was<00:00:46.030> thinking<00:00:46.060> I<00:00:46.630> need<00:00:46.900> to<00:00:47.020> use<00:00:48.660> kind<00:00:49.660> of<00:00:49.780> a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
I was thinking I need to use kind of a

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.250 
I was thinking I need to use kind of a
big<00:00:50.110> pan<00:00:50.590> because<00:00:51.720> they<00:00:52.720> only<00:00:52.840> have<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.050> single

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
big pan because they only have a single

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260 
big pan because they only have a single
burner<00:00:53.620> I'm<00:00:53.829> I<00:00:54.100> need<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.430> try<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:54.850> cook<00:00:55.090> all

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
burner I'm I need to try and cook all

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.060 
burner I'm I need to try and cook all
that<00:00:55.420> stuff<00:00:55.630> in<00:00:55.780> one<00:00:55.960> pan<00:00:56.230> so<00:00:56.530> perhaps<00:00:56.770> the

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
that stuff in one pan so perhaps the

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.310 
that stuff in one pan so perhaps the
taller<00:00:57.280> ones<00:00:57.550> might<00:00:57.760> work<00:00:58.000> better<00:00:58.239> but<00:00:59.170> I'm

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
taller ones might work better but I'm

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.100 
taller ones might work better but I'm
not<00:00:59.500> sure<00:00:59.530> so<00:01:00.329> I'll<00:01:01.329> come<00:01:01.540> back<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:01.840> you<00:01:01.899> in<00:01:02.020> a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
not sure so I'll come back to you in a

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.450 
not sure so I'll come back to you in a

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
few minutes and we'll see how things are

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.760 
few minutes and we'll see how things are
turning<00:01:03.640> out<00:01:03.930> about<00:01:04.930> this<00:01:05.110> year<00:01:05.320> here's<00:01:05.619> my

turning out about this year here's my
fuel<00:01:06.130> source<00:01:06.460> I'm<00:01:07.360> not<00:01:07.570> sure<00:01:07.780> if<00:01:07.869> that's<00:01:07.990> going

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
fuel source I'm not sure if that's going

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.620 
fuel source I'm not sure if that's going
to<00:01:08.290> be<00:01:08.439> enough<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.670> cook<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.060> entire<00:01:10.360> meal

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
guess it's because we cook the pork

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.759 
guess it's because we cook the pork
chops<00:03:07.269> first<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.900> all<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.080> fat<00:03:08.290> was<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:08.680> the

chops first and all the fat was in the
pan<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.340> then<00:03:09.430> we<00:03:09.550> cook<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:09.880> on<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.630> pork

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
pan and then we cook this on in the pork

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.380 
pan and then we cook this on in the pork
fat<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.410> parsley<00:03:12.310> delicious<00:03:12.850> surprisingly
