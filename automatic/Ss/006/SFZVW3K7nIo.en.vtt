00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.040 
bottom there it contains alcohol just so
you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:52.789> I've<00:00:53.789> never<00:00:54.030> had<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.449> before<00:00:54.510> I've

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you know I've never had this before I've

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.799 
you know I've never had this before I've
never<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:56.090> even<00:00:57.090> seen<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.480> before<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
never really even seen this before I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.000 
never really even seen this before I
know<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.079> might<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.379> seen<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.559> before<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
know I might have seen this before but I

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.049 
know I might have seen this before but I
really<00:00:59.219> pay<00:00:59.340> attention<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> because<00:00:59.879> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
really pay attention to it because I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.990 
really pay attention to it because I
always<00:01:00.239> got<00:01:00.390> juice<00:01:00.629> or<00:01:00.780> four<00:01:00.930> loko<00:01:01.430> but<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
always got juice or four loko but you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.429 
always got juice or four loko but you
can't<00:01:03.210> really<00:01:03.300> find<00:01:03.539> either<00:01:03.750> those<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
can't really find either those now so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.260 
can't really find either those now so
I'm<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.680> try<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.970> looks<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.060> there's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
I'm going to try this looks like there's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.020 
I'm going to try this looks like there's
no<00:01:06.479> caffeine<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.729> which<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> probably

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
no caffeine in this which is probably

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.770 
no caffeine in this which is probably
why<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.390> still<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> market<00:01:11.659> there's<00:01:12.659> no

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
why it's still on the market there's no

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.750 
why it's still on the market there's no
mention<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.200> caffeine<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.830> any<00:01:14.010> anything<00:01:14.490> else

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
mention of caffeine or any anything else

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
mention of caffeine or any anything else
on<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.560> I've<00:01:16.560> never<00:01:16.680> had<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:16.920> before

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
on this can I've never had this before

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.170 
on this can I've never had this before
but<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> looks<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:19.520> reminiscent<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.880> juice

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
but it looks very reminiscent of juice

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.660 
but it looks very reminiscent of juice
so<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.990> probably<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.320> tastes<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.830> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so it's probably it tastes like it so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.070 
so it's probably it tastes like it so
I'm<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> give<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.390> hundred<00:01:24.810> percent

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.850 
I'm going to give you my hundred percent
raw<00:01:25.290> reaction<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.009> my<00:01:26.130> first<00:01:26.430> sip<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.729> tilt<00:01:27.860> so

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
raw reaction to my first sip of tilt so

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:38.499 
raw reaction to my first sip of tilt so
here<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.100> go<00:01:30.049> crack<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> open<00:01:31.229> right<00:01:31.409> now

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.080
