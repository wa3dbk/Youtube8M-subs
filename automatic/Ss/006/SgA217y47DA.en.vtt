00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.280
 Hello everyone, I want to talk about today 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.550
 one that is on assignment in my opinion 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.269
 very useful in particular for 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.480
 to mean speeding up and developing the Arabs 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.840
 young bushes 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:26.789
 planted to leave with grapes well and not 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.300
 only young it is useful and for more 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.700
 older in this case it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.950
 this device was used for 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.020
 order to reanimate 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.190
 For several years now, art has been sitting 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.940
 reward which 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.260
 but really I did not drive out the forces here after here 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.640
 such an upgrade 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.570
 sheet he started as if we exercise 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.570
 the signs 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.820
 but active growth in general video is all 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.980
 you see it is such a bottle 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.950
 put natures and pebbles on 1 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.890
 in general, and pull the holes differently for 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.740
 what is it all done in the first place 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.460
 allows you to pre-steam 100 and water 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.100
 warm water is the first second 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.710
 prevent development 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.280
 and excess development of superficial 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.250
 the roots 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.240
 who still winter freeze more often 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.600
 there is no need for it all between two 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.180
 vines and you are ready to pit means 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.710
 Well, there are Korean 7 some there who 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.640
 performed them you can tidy up 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.330
 here we pour there burn out for the roller 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.659
 humus and compost 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.729
 all this we just put there and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.940
 now means already directly in 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.319
 roots enter the water is very warm and 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.179
 you need to warm up well and here we have 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.330
 get written place is 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.450
 it turned out and here in this case 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.850
 In general, a very good result gave a 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.130
 he immediately appeared on the bush 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.289
 fruits have come to mean 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.289
 super measure yet good luck
