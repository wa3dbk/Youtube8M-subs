idea<00:04:02.100> to<00:04:02.430> me<00:04:02.580> so<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.570> had<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.810> stay<00:04:04.170> with

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
idea to me so I just had to stay with

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.980 
idea to me so I just had to stay with
divine<00:04:04.560> insight<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:04.980> still<00:04:05.160> prox<00:04:05.460> a<00:04:05.640> lot<00:04:05.960> uh

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.320 

you<00:04:09.990> know<00:04:10.110> so<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.350> stayed<00:04:10.920> with<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.460> for

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
you know so I stayed with that and for

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.220 
you know so I stayed with that and for

the final tier with the changes to halo

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.440 
the final tier with the changes to halo
it<00:04:16.230> makes<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.130> even<00:04:17.250> less<00:04:17.549> usable<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:18.180> didn't

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
it makes it even less usable I didn't

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.570 
it makes it even less usable I didn't
use<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.600> previously<00:04:19.470> honestly<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.250> use<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.549> for

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.520 
use it previously honestly I use it for
a<00:04:20.700> little<00:04:20.820> bit<00:04:20.970> then<00:04:21.270> I'm<00:04:21.359> dropped<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.840> now

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
a little bit then I'm dropped it now

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.590 
a little bit then I'm dropped it now
that<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.800> does<00:04:22.950> not<00:04:23.280> bring<00:04:23.669> stealth<00:04:24.060> out<00:04:24.300> it's

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
that it does not bring stealth out it's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.680 
that it does not bring stealth out it's
even<00:04:24.990> less<00:04:25.260> useful<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.950> just<00:04:26.820> waste<00:04:27.030> your<00:04:27.180> mana

increases the heels by each renew tick

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.570 
increases the heels by each renew tick
by<00:05:44.700> thirty-three<00:05:45.150> percent<00:05:46.040> but<00:05:47.040> the<00:05:47.160> duration

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
by thirty-three percent but the duration

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.670 
by thirty-three percent but the duration
is<00:05:47.730> reduced<00:05:48.000> by<00:05:48.120> 33<00:05:48.720> seconds<00:05:48.990> I<00:05:49.080> mosters<00:05:49.500> bags

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
is reduced by 33 seconds I mosters bags

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.140 
is reduced by 33 seconds I mosters bags
permitting<00:05:50.190> so<00:05:50.280> that's<00:05:50.460> 60<00:05:50.700> per<00:05:50.910> cents<00:05:51.120> a

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
permitting so that's 60 per cents a

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.120 
permitting so that's 60 per cents a
little<00:05:51.300> bit<00:05:51.419> better<00:05:51.540> than<00:05:51.720> that<00:05:51.950> tested<00:05:52.950> I'm

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
little bit better than that tested I'm

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.770 
little bit better than that tested I'm
gonna<00:05:53.310> crunch<00:05:53.550> numbers<00:05:53.760> some<00:05:54.120> point<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.510> may

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
gonna crunch numbers some point I may
