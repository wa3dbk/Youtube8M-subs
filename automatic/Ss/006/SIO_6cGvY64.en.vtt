hear a little bit of the origins of this
beer<00:00:31.900> and<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.470> recipe<00:00:33.129> right<00:00:33.610> we<00:00:33.760> had<00:00:33.850> a

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
beer and the recipe right we had a

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.619 
beer and the recipe right we had a
wonderful<00:00:34.210> time<00:00:34.540> actually<00:00:35.320> in<00:00:35.830> the<00:00:36.280> room<00:00:36.489> with

this<00:00:47.170> nordic<00:00:47.620> grog<00:00:47.920> was<00:00:48.250> all<00:00:48.430> about<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:48.970> one

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
this nordic grog was all about and one

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
denmark around 1400 BC at the place

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.490 
denmark around 1400 BC at the place
called<00:01:00.159> egghead<00:01:00.970> so<00:01:01.809> if<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.049> go<00:01:02.229> to<00:01:02.260> the

huge oak coffin you'll remember that I

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.470 
huge oak coffin you'll remember that I
remember<00:01:16.630> them<00:01:16.780> saying<00:01:16.810> that<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:18.040> it<00:01:18.790> was<00:01:18.820> it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
remember them saying that the it was it

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.920 
remember them saying that the it was it
was<00:01:19.720> amazingly<00:01:20.820> rare<00:01:21.820> how<00:01:22.300> well-preserved

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
was amazingly rare how well-preserved

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.620 
was amazingly rare how well-preserved
her<00:01:23.440> remains<00:01:23.830> were<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:25.150> know<00:01:25.270> where<00:01:25.450> there

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
her remains were you know where there

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.260 
her remains were you know where there
was<00:01:25.720> still<00:01:25.870> brain<00:01:26.410> matter<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.980> hair<00:01:27.460> on<00:01:27.850> what

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
was still brain matter and hair on what

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.930 
was still brain matter and hair on what
we<00:01:28.390> sell<00:01:28.690> we<00:01:29.140> know<00:01:29.260> if<00:01:29.440> she's<00:01:29.620> blonde<00:01:29.950> right<00:01:30.520> I

we sell we know if she's blonde right I

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.550 
we sell we know if she's blonde right I
don't<00:01:31.690> know<00:01:31.780> if<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:31.930> know<00:01:32.050> that<00:01:32.380> she's

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
don't know if we know that she's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.890 
don't know if we know that she's
blue-eyed<00:01:33.010> but<00:01:33.790> yeah<00:01:34.600> there<00:01:34.720> was<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.840> little

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
blue-eyed but yeah there was a little

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.050 
blue-eyed but yeah there was a little
bit<00:01:35.050> of<00:01:35.140> brain<00:01:35.350> left<00:01:35.650> there<00:01:35.950> anyway<00:01:36.700> it<00:01:36.760> was

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
bit of brain left there anyway it was

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.670 
bit of brain left there anyway it was
amazing<00:01:37.690> thing<00:01:37.900> in<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.110> science<00:01:38.500> community

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
amazing thing in the science community

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.320 
amazing thing in the science community
to<00:01:38.980> find<00:01:39.130> something<00:01:39.550> that<00:01:39.580> will<00:01:39.880> preserve

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
to find something that will preserve

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.600 
to find something that will preserve
yeah<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.870> think<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.740> bogs<00:01:41.980> I<00:01:42.190> mean<00:01:42.310> with<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.460> high

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
yeah I think the bogs I mean with a high

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.320 
yeah I think the bogs I mean with a high
acidity<00:01:43.530> does<00:01:44.530> help<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:46.200> lower<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.790> oxygen

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
acidity does help to lower the oxygen

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.230 
acidity does help to lower the oxygen
level<00:01:49.659> as<00:01:49.840> well<00:01:50.080> yeah<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:50.860> this<00:01:51.580> one<00:01:51.760> was<00:01:51.940> in<00:01:52.150> a

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
level as well yeah so this one was in a

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.060 
level as well yeah so this one was in a
mound<00:01:52.540> I<00:01:52.930> mean<00:01:53.110> there<00:01:53.229> was<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.350> tumulus<00:01:53.650> you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
mound I mean there was a tumulus you

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.399 
mound I mean there was a tumulus you
know<00:01:54.190> built<00:01:54.430> over<00:01:54.850> her<00:01:55.000> tomb<00:01:55.270> but<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.020> water<00:01:56.260> I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
know built over her tomb but the water I

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.530 
know built over her tomb but the water I
guess<00:01:56.680> had<00:01:56.830> come<00:01:57.040> down<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.280> maybe<00:01:57.610> helped<00:01:58.300> to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
guess had come down and maybe helped to

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.680 
guess had come down and maybe helped to
preserve<00:01:58.750> her<00:01:59.260> a<00:01:59.530> little<00:02:00.010> bit<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.549> way<00:02:00.729> and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
preserve her a little bit that way and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.660 
preserve her a little bit that way and
the<00:02:01.750> reason<00:02:02.050> she<00:02:02.380> was<00:02:02.440> so<00:02:02.650> special<00:02:02.980> was

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
the reason she was so special was

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.460 
the reason she was so special was
because<00:02:04.330> of<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.510> stuff<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:04.960> was<00:02:05.080> found<00:02:05.110> a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
because of the stuff that was found a

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.960 
because of the stuff that was found a
little<00:02:05.620> closer<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.310> her<00:02:06.430> feet

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
little closer to her feet

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.850 
little closer to her feet
he's<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.780> birch<00:02:08.350> bark<00:02:08.520> bucket<00:02:09.690> that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
he's the birch bark bucket that

we<00:04:11.460> get<00:04:11.580> into<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:11.970> herbs<00:04:12.890> so<00:04:13.890> three<00:04:14.250> herbs

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
we get into the herbs so three herbs

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.400 
we get into the herbs so three herbs
that<00:04:14.580> we<00:04:14.790> have<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.090> front<00:04:15.270> of<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.630> how<00:04:16.170> do<00:04:16.230> you

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
that we have in front of you how do you

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.760 
that we have in front of you how do you
honor<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:18.239> work<00:04:18.420> that<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.840> do<00:04:19.080> on<00:04:19.380> a

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
honor the work that you do on a

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.070 
honor the work that you do on a
molecular<00:04:20.100> level<00:04:20.400> how<00:04:21.000> are<00:04:21.480> you<00:04:21.660> telling<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
molecular level how are you telling the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.150 
molecular level how are you telling the
difference<00:04:22.290> between<00:04:23.750> say<00:04:24.860> yarrow<00:04:26.300> and

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
difference between say yarrow and

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.270 
difference between say yarrow and
saffron<00:04:29.480> or<00:04:30.480> yarrow<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.590> maybe<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.920> good

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
saffron or yarrow and maybe a good

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.190 
saffron or yarrow and maybe a good
example<00:04:32.640> would<00:04:33.030> be<00:04:33.090> one<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.720> these<00:04:33.810> like

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
example would be one of these like

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.430 
example would be one of these like
miracle<00:04:35.010> right<00:04:35.480> well<00:04:36.480> mainly<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:37.080> mean<00:04:37.350> the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
miracle right well mainly I mean the

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.390 
miracle right well mainly I mean the
chemical<00:04:37.830> analyses<00:04:38.370> will<00:04:38.760> show<00:04:39.060> different

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
chemical analyses will show different

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.430 
chemical analyses will show different
compounds<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:42.000> know<00:04:42.090> try<00:04:42.390> terpenoids<00:04:43.020> are

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
compounds you know try terpenoids are

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.360 
compounds you know try terpenoids are
often<00:04:43.830> quite<00:04:44.520> distinctive<00:04:45.290> for<00:04:46.290> Euro<00:04:46.500> you

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
often quite distinctive for Euro you

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.790 
often quite distinctive for Euro you
know<00:04:47.460> thujone<00:04:48.210> is<00:04:48.660> a<00:04:49.170> very<00:04:49.380> important

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
know thujone is a very important

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.710 
know thujone is a very important
compound<00:04:50.160> it's<00:04:50.280> also<00:04:50.430> found<00:04:50.730> in<00:04:50.910> wormwood<00:04:51.420> and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
compound it's also found in wormwood and

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.409 
compound it's also found in wormwood and
we<00:04:52.710> had<00:04:52.890> sort<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.280> pleasure<00:04:53.490> trace<00:04:53.820> amounts

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
we had sort of a pleasure trace amounts

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.080 
we had sort of a pleasure trace amounts
in<00:04:54.570> trace<00:04:54.930> amounts<00:04:55.380> right<00:04:55.880> because<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:56.910> uh

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
in trace amounts right because that uh

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.710 
in trace amounts right because that uh
and<00:04:57.840> that's<00:04:58.110> what<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:59.040> FDA<00:04:59.340> or<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.850> ATF

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
and that's what the the FDA or the ATF

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.170 
and that's what the the FDA or the ATF
wants<00:05:01.200> is<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.410> I<00:05:01.860> think<00:05:02.310> it's<00:05:02.430> like<00:05:02.580> ten<00:05:02.880> parts

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
wants is a I think it's like ten parts

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.880 
wants is a I think it's like ten parts
per<00:05:03.270> million<00:05:03.570> whenever<00:05:04.200> we<00:05:04.350> vetted<00:05:04.590> that

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
per million whenever we vetted that

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.440 
per million whenever we vetted that
through<00:05:05.190> them

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
through them

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.680 
through them
less<00:05:07.450> than<00:05:07.780> we<00:05:08.380> even<00:05:08.590> need<00:05:08.889> to<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:10.060> mean<00:05:10.389> we<00:05:10.570> have

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
less than we even need to I mean we have

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.310 
less than we even need to I mean we have
year<00:05:10.870> outgrowing<00:05:11.260> as<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.860> came<00:05:12.040> down<00:05:12.310> from

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
year outgrowing as I came down from

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.480 
year outgrowing as I came down from
Philadelphia<00:05:14.320> today<00:05:14.470> growing<00:05:14.830> all<00:05:15.070> along<00:05:15.280> the

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
Philadelphia today growing all along the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.050 
Philadelphia today growing all along the
roadside<00:05:16.450> in<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.960> fall<00:05:17.260> yeah<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.860> I<00:05:18.550> think<00:05:18.970> it

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
roadside in the fall yeah and I think it

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.870 
roadside in the fall yeah and I think it
has<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.330> pretty<00:05:19.690> strong<00:05:20.050> intense<00:05:20.800> aroma<00:05:21.370> yeah

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
has a pretty strong intense aroma yeah

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.440 
has a pretty strong intense aroma yeah
which<00:05:22.360> is<00:05:22.590> I<00:05:23.760> think<00:05:24.760> we<00:05:24.850> decided<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.300> go<00:05:25.419> a

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
which is I think we decided to go a

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.420 
which is I think we decided to go a
little<00:05:25.630> bit<00:05:25.840> lighter<00:05:26.050> on<00:05:26.260> this<00:05:26.710> compared<00:05:27.340> to

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
little bit lighter on this compared to

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.120 
little bit lighter on this compared to
the<00:05:27.610> bog<00:05:28.000> myrtle<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:28.720> then<00:05:29.530> we<00:05:29.620> put<00:05:29.800> clover

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
the bog myrtle and then we put clover

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.670 
the bog myrtle and then we put clover
into<00:05:30.460> yep<00:05:30.850> yep<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:31.660> so<00:05:31.780> on<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:32.290> clover

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
into yep yep and so on to the clover

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.379 
into yep yep and so on to the clover
which<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:32.950> probably<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.400> mildest<00:05:33.970> of<00:05:34.240> the

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
which is probably the mildest of the

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.060 
which is probably the mildest of the
herbs<00:05:34.600> that<00:05:34.810> were<00:05:35.080> using<00:05:35.320> advice<00:05:35.800> here

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
herbs that were using advice here

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.820 
herbs that were using advice here
wouldn't<00:05:36.400> you<00:05:36.460> say<00:05:37.290> clover<00:05:38.290> yeah<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:38.620> think

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
wouldn't you say clover yeah I think

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.260 
wouldn't you say clover yeah I think
clovers<00:05:39.490> pretty<00:05:40.350> grassy<00:05:41.350> and<00:05:41.760> has<00:05:42.760> that<00:05:43.000> kind

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
clovers pretty grassy and has that kind

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.320 
clovers pretty grassy and has that kind
of<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.419> like<00:05:44.410> freshly<00:05:44.830> in<00:05:45.130> mowing<00:05:45.550> field<00:05:45.910> yeah

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
of a like freshly in mowing field yeah

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.810 
of a like freshly in mowing field yeah
mossy<00:05:46.930> mowed<00:05:47.230> lawn<00:05:47.530> type<00:05:48.010> of<00:05:48.190> snow<00:05:50.640> and<00:05:51.640> then

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
mossy mowed lawn type of snow and then

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.630 
mossy mowed lawn type of snow and then
last<00:05:52.150> but<00:05:52.330> not<00:05:52.600> least<00:05:53.020> is<00:05:53.590> my<00:05:53.680> favorite<00:05:54.430> is

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
last but not least is my favorite is

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.980 
last but not least is my favorite is
that<00:05:54.820> one<00:05:54.940> your<00:05:55.120> favorite<00:05:55.419> yeah<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.810> bock

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
that one your favorite yeah the bock

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.640 
that one your favorite yeah the bock
bock<00:05:56.380> myrtle<00:05:56.919> or<00:05:57.430> the<00:05:57.910> america<00:05:58.390> Gale<00:05:58.900> so

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
bock myrtle or the america Gale so

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.030 
bock myrtle or the america Gale so
that's<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.490> mixture<00:06:00.970> of<00:06:01.470> ingredients<00:06:02.470> that

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
that's the mixture of ingredients that

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.969 
that's the mixture of ingredients that
we<00:06:03.220> have<00:06:03.340> to<00:06:03.460> reverse<00:06:03.760> here<00:06:04.030> it's<00:06:04.979> we're

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
we have to reverse here it's we're

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.350 
we have to reverse here it's we're
tasting<00:06:06.190> it<00:06:06.430> out<00:06:06.550> of<00:06:06.639> the<00:06:06.700> fermenter<00:06:07.090> today

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
tasting it out of the fermenter today

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.900 
tasting it out of the fermenter today
our<00:06:07.870> goal<00:06:08.139> was<00:06:08.530> to<00:06:08.740> make<00:06:08.919> this<00:06:09.390> a<00:06:10.390> more<00:06:11.080> tart

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
our goal was to make this a more tart

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.010 
our goal was to make this a more tart
ancient<00:06:12.910> ale<00:06:13.030> than<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.450> ones<00:06:13.660> that<00:06:13.870> we've

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
ancient ale than the ones that we've

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.460 
ancient ale than the ones that we've
done<00:06:14.260> before<00:06:14.470> so<00:06:14.979> I<00:06:15.280> think<00:06:15.870> lovers<00:06:16.870> of<00:06:17.020> Belgium

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
done before so I think lovers of Belgium

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.250 
done before so I think lovers of Belgium
sours<00:06:18.040> and<00:06:18.070> lambics<00:06:18.850> will<00:06:19.510> find<00:06:19.840> something

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
sours and lambics will find something

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.080 
sours and lambics will find something
right<00:06:20.470> I<00:06:20.530> think<00:06:20.860> they'll<00:06:20.950> find<00:06:21.130> a<00:06:21.190> lot<00:06:21.370> to

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
right I think they'll find a lot to

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.520 
right I think they'll find a lot to
latch<00:06:22.419> on<00:06:22.720> to<00:06:22.750> yep

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
latch on to yep
