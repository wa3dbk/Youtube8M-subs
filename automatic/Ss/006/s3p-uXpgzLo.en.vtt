00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.880
 Not only that 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.599
 and if I believe that this is all that 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.230
 it could be a bus play the draculaura 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:37.280
 now I do not have much time so I 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.949
 you can work me the loot we hurried 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.160
 to begin the reason why not 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.110
 you can use beach sunblock with 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.610
 your usual makeup is because it's going 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.800
 to leave the skin very white and the 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.410
 reflections with everything and photography 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:57.560
 you could have in those pieces results 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.180
 aromatherapy is important even if 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.140
 late I know that he's going to help me do 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:07.520
 this fast the law of sant joan dalmau 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.920
 talcum powder but a lot of alcohol is for 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.750
 something more red or mouth corners 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.400
 Apply it with your fingers not with brooches 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.210
 correctors of course to the whole face 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.670
 we want to create a skin effect to be more 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.250
 exposed to the sun I do not know if they will be shown 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.400
 what happened I discovered that progress is more 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.590
 easy so allow an hour of this in 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.270
 one finger one droplet of these not in another 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.509
 of the progress according to the zones 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.259
 that correspond gentle touches ok 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.170
 then after all this roll and 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.860
 pequeñitos suárez but it is like that if not 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.690
 they listen to the deluge 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.690
 well because not with your hands 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.330
 what I did was to apply had 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.880
 compact first because this this 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.729
 What is this that I am and then 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.310
 this is a bit darker than that of 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 fonz in these areas to cut me 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.700
 all this face that is superfluous because 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.410
 what I want to do is a monster doll 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.300
 height 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:14.130
 now let's use blush I'm this for 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.880
 they like the same countries 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.570
 so then they are chic pons and the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.380
 purple to create depth on the face 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.380
 A) Yes 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:34.670
 there are no barriers and this is the thing 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.650
 some leaves 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.209
 I still have to demand a little more 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.090
 are the lips but I 'm going to delineate 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.800
 those with liquid eyeliner and to achieve 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:54.530
 this way you have to be soaking 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.900
 the lipstick in a pincelito and do so 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.830
 so you can get the form of 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.780
 teeth 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.300
 there are practically the lips 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.300
 right now what I 'm going to do is the eyes 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.540
 and this is what happens when you ask the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.459
 destination a little bit of help 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.040
 and I do not know if there's time to buy 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.590
 false eyelashes but I'm going to 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.310
 draw good I had to be those huge 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.769
 stripes to appear because tabs 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.260
 I have a natural pronunciation there 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.609
 I will never use dark shadows in that place 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.189
 never logical though this is what I 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.950
 I put the rose are the clearest men and 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.950
 you know because that is the shadow of 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.829
 I'm going to prolong the spotlights 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.159
 and then white eyeliner after 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.590
 line little by little little by little and remember 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.739
 that is like a leaf has to end 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.659
 in that way and a little upwards by 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.270
 that 's what empties here in the first one a 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.280
 little of the minor much 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.090
 from afar that will be appreciated as a 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:07.380
 eye and it is repaired that there may be some 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.680
 bigger under the eyebrows and I show you 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.680
 all 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.450
 ah 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500
 do not 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
 d
