00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
disappointing for Grimsby Town as a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.969 
disappointing for Grimsby Town as a
football<00:01:08.520> club<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:08.940> i<00:01:09.680> think<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.799> season

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
football club but i think this season

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.130 
football club but i think this season
could<00:01:11.370> be<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.850> hopefully<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.330> what

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
could be the one and hopefully is what

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.920 
could be the one and hopefully is what
did<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.380> make<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> game<00:01:13.920> ok<00:01:14.750> well<00:01:15.750> i'll

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
did you make of the game ok well i'll

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.170 
did you make of the game ok well i'll
make<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> game<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> strange<00:01:17.640> game<00:01:17.909> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
make the game it was a strange game I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840

them<00:01:45.030> gain<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.480> no<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.890> was<00:01:47.010> a<00:01:47.040> nervous<00:01:47.340> game<00:01:47.610> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
them gain so no it was a nervous game I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.550 
them gain so no it was a nervous game I
think<00:01:48.000> both<00:01:48.150> teams<00:01:48.180> were<00:01:48.690> obviously<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.530> much

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
think both teams were obviously so much

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.740 
think both teams were obviously so much
to<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.580> much<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.820> gain<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.300> much<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> lose

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
to so much to gain and so much to lose

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.620 
to so much to gain and so much to lose
it<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.230> lot<00:01:52.560> riding<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
it was a lot riding on it and it was a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.610 
it was a lot riding on it and it was a
scrappy<00:01:54.900> game<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:56.460> i<00:01:56.490> said<00:01:57.350> well<00:01:58.350> i

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
scrappy game but like i said well i

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.890
