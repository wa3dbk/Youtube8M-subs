00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.080
 ah 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.059
 one of the most representative bands and 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.400
 important of his generation in the 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.080
 indie pop scene comes to Lima in the 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.660
 best moment of his career 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.300
 foster the people the american group 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.300
 responsible for successes such as pump up key 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.760
 dong thap 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.570
 promises to shake his fans in the middle 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.120
 of a peculiarly original concert and 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.370
 As if that were not enough, they are accompanied by 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.250
 the Australian subway pop group 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.890
 Miami Hall is the second mini 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.290
 movistar players festival that will take 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.960
 out this Monday on the southern concourse 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.300
 of the monumental stadium good to lose is 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.150
 that we are bringing two bands to the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.430
 australian electro thing called miami 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.100
 horror that is spectacular live 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.900
 we have joserra people in the background 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.570
 a band that already has a trajectory 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.180
 incredible and that in itself is one of the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.150
 best live bands in the world in this 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.280
 we have prepared a kind of mini 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.220
 festival not because in this time we are 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.350
 like many festivals in South America and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.810
 apart from these great bands it 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.940
 will present a dj that through the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.830
 social networks will be willing to 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.650
 meet all our demands 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.440
 musicals 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.530
 it's a hashtag that we have the hashtag of 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.120
 and from jota and you are asking and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.390
 detecting that the dj 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.850
 and the day and put your songs if it is that 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.490
 as we always say technology is 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.040
 present in multiple aspects and how 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.590
 we see this concert will not be the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.990
 exception since the idea is that those who 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.150
 attend have all the resources to 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.740
 be connected along this 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.290
 new musical experience 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.060
 as the last thing in him and in you 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.549
 free internet can go up their 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.740
 photos we have some chargers where you 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.540
 high that you can recharge your battery for 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.939
 that you do not miss your friends so that 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.189
 is writing in the dj not for that 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.140
 register your photos or nobody is going to 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.179
 be without connection or even wifi or 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.700
 even without battery and speaks new 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.739
 technology for this event was innovated 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.230
 from the beginning with the sale of 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.720
 tickets since the mini festivals of 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 movistar priority have been the first 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.709
 in removing tickets completely 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.290
 physical 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.690
 The idea is to limit the issue of 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.700
 blowout saves you time you'll save 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.769
 the discomfort thank you that if you 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.120
 will sell a bad entry or that you 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.060
 resell at a price that suddenly 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.489
 new well then if finally you 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.410
 encouraged you do not worry because the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.020
 steps that you have to follow to buy 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.270
 your entries are super intuitive 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.020
 good if you do not have the application 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.570
 updated in the updated you have 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.470
 your data in a confirmation or the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.360
 security code 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.680
 you enter the security code and you are 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.660
 to serve all the provisions that 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.700
 you have in this case we will buy while 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.350
 Acosta we give you buy once 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.870
 confirm this request you will leave 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.340
 all the steps so you can fill the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.650
 card went to work credit 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.930
 debit card so you get it by 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.820
 last in an email with the continuation of 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.190
 your purchase that is a code that you have to 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.570
 take care too well because anyone 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.980
 of the signs of if you have it before a 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.720
 wawa anyone can steal it what 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.040
 then to enter I would simply have 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.480
 have to show this code qr and in exact 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.180
 this is just the beginning of a new 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.890
 concept of what normally 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.590
 we conceive as a concert since 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.070
 using technology 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.990
 give us much more than music in short 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.810
 we will see if it is innovating with 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.420
 similar experiences because this one at 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.480
 It seems that it is not only the future of 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.379
 concerts but the present 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.379
 at
