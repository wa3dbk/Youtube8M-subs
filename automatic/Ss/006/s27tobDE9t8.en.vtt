00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hey guys i just woke up really real 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.350
 net and I was walking down 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.730
 I woke up from the stomachache 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.500
 I have just a few painkillers 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.120
 I had already taken two 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.240
 but that didn't work very well I have 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.740
 one you have taken and I hope 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.359
 who will work because I have to say 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.730
 a spiral so I actually become 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.710
 never my period but when I agree 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.310
 the period is period and that is 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.140
 really once every four five months 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.910
 well then I have such a stomachache there 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 just a little sick of it 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.309
 and that I have now and then I become 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.480
 just woke up at night with the stomach ache and 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.989
 it just feels like it's on the inside 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.250
 completely open is really not nice 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.780
 and I really don't know what to do with it 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.040
 so I just wiggle 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.289
 and with a pillow between my legs 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.210
 just because it sleeps 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.700
 I just don't know what to do about it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 if someone has tips on that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.199
 please leave them behind because I will 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 completely crazy about the pain in my stomach and me 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.439
 had to work yesterday and I was me again 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.200
 let me think I had to go far 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.350
 and at 10 past 10 I was called 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.100
 arthur where are you you are walking again 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.360
 lucky guests no that your manager 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.430
 if not all that big 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.680
 problem but I can handle myself 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.229
 I just hit my head again 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.740
 I'm done again and it's just me 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.729
 I never manage to just manage it 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.900
 no i don't know what that is and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.759
 maybe that has to do with that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.829
 i could have a bit of a street problem 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.829
 I have a little HDD 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.579
 I sometimes have more people in all 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.259
 earlier it just hears anyway 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.020
 failed to arrive on time and so much fun 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.479
 so neither me and I think it is 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.189
 really really sincere just really very cunt 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.070
 because I can't do very much 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.270
 I feel so like others 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.520
 would say yes you do is just 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.250
 look carefully and just watch your alarm 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.840
 put it in my 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.759
 I feel how I look up well 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 my schedule and I really know that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.369
 I have to start so and so late and then 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.550
 yet I could be late again and just 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.230
 really really really annoying or I said 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.530
 i really would rather i just want that 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.120
 always came on time and just it comes 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.700
 also just because no fixed 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.410
 rhythm is 10 o'clock that one time 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.950
 11 am and then I now have the whole week 11 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.540
 hour god and then suddenly is teenager and then 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.010
 yes then club that just feel to me 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.989
 and not a year goes just 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.519
 wrong 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.050
 in the meantime I'm going to make fruit and 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.370
 maybe that 's why it's handy as i'm just 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:46.530
 would have a job where you just 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.530
 would start at the same time every day 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.890
 and kettle 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.890
 I am also going to have a nice cup of tea there 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.830
 because i was so tired of that boom pow pow 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.060
 pow guys and see a lot since 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.470
 Tuesday night I have n't had it since 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.959
 Tuesday morning I saw him have you 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.280
 also no internet and first all that 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.080
 internet but could not but very limited 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.390
 never again say the three or 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.220
 four heads a few more sentences and now 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.769
 he also no longer has internet 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.590
 and just not right I think 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.840
 really a weather and the and you believe 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.299
 find listening but i like the baby 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:34.319
 and now the more speak and yes I think 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.319
 it really annoying 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.739
 I want to be able to be with him every day 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.450
 and is questioning and well I know 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.760
 also not if you have already received an email from 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.769
 house or have it or not 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.630
 so I'm also very nervous about him 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.000
 because I want it so badly and I think every 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.010
 8 every day really doesn't do anything else 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.630
 to the cottage I hear I must go 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.670
 should such a beautiful spice you need kremont 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.660
 get a move 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.660
 it completely drives me crazy 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.910
 that is and my grandmother is now gone 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.700
 mother who are October or in a day trip 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.060
 gift I have to tell you that honestly 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.850
 say i find a little different one 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.549
 bit annoying as my family with 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.639
 my mother in law goes around 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.380
 yes i don't know that my mother had it 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.539
 never myself and now my oh my 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.440
 agree with his mother in law a twink 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.600
 a little weird to speak 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:34.190
 but i just have to accept and 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:38.900
 yes oh oh i do i like this boy 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.550
 pepernoten and when I go somewhere I am up 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.560
 though are then ginger nuts 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.440
 addicted to when I get there to 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.060
 I start the whole thing I think it is 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.620
 nice to give them a little so on to the 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.270
 suck and then already 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.010
 all that did not taste its sounding whole 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.480
 dirty and then it's soft and then click 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.160
 I really like it that way 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.310
 to eat 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:06.200
 the water is boiled anyway 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:08.270
 or almost almost almost almost almost 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.640
 then I'm going to make nice and creep and then 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.140
 I think I'll just watch a movie I know 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.760
 no fun movie yet 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.790
 because you really have few responses 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.100
 left on my previous one 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.850
 for a vlogje in which I asked if there is still one 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.500
 Movies were nicer but I still go 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.270
 look back and see vegetables or 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.520
 you have one feather in the comments one more 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.100
 The film was nice because I already had it 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.070
 looked but I think there was already me 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.370
 have seen everything but I have 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.840
 I really look already tanks is my twelfth 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.520
 really super many movies especially hungry and 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.380
 I then once had two 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.590
 moon thing went to school here 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.330
 because I was bullied a lot and that 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.310
 I only have two months 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.990
 so watching a movie day and night already 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.990
 those girls films and I have seen it that way 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.410
 just watch out because I'm now with cake 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:15.290
 and did know water to get into the kitchen 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:18.130
 do n't do enough water for well i have to 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.130
 move even more times 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.029
 and my sister has a photo on it 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:27.469
 instagram talk and has exactly 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:32.819
 I bought the same Holland seals 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:35.029
 well sisters do that see you as 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:35.029
 in front of 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.879
 I wanted to buy one for her but then 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:40.349
 others but yes sled snow and myself 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.279
 purchased 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.990
 Of course you also have to do it yourself 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.669
 know I just do not do with her so 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.249
 don't shoot but we used to 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.719
 I got a lot of fusion about that 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:52.349
 that would really not like them 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:53.729
 the same as i hear how is the 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.919
 by the way that number 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.740
 look, I put it in half water 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.059
 maybe not even paper and he blows 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.229
 completely absorbed 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:05.490
 van there becomes cool and then asks me 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.469
 also why 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.899
 you may not know that by the 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:11.580
 heat or so because 

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:13.349
 heat makes him whip and so I think 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.149
 might well result in my plate 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:19.159
 but I still find separate turns that 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:19.159
 doctor on makes me take things 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.719
 I'm just going to make a cup of tea and then 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:28.680
 I'm going to see something nice I remember a 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:31.229
 what and then I'll see you again this morning 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.999
 with new vlog tube how the floor got 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:36.949
 I think it has never been 8 again that long 

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:36.949
 half a minute bye
