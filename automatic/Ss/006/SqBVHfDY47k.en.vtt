change the cabin pollen filter on a 2007
Zafira<00:00:08.490> B<00:00:08.760> but<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:10.019> same<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.679> any

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
Zafira B but it's the same for any

Zafira B but it's the same for any
severe<00:00:11.519> from<00:00:11.759> 2005<00:00:12.509> onwards<00:00:13.790> if<00:00:14.790> you've<00:00:14.969> got

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
severe from 2005 onwards if you've got

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.140 
severe from 2005 onwards if you've got
problems<00:00:15.540> with<00:00:15.960> poor<00:00:16.379> ventilation<00:00:16.560> flow<00:00:17.550> or

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
problems with poor ventilation flow or

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.599 
problems with poor ventilation flow or
the<00:00:18.990> cabin<00:00:19.350> misting<00:00:19.650> up<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.920> winter<00:00:20.279> then<00:00:20.460> it's

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the cabin misting up in winter then it's

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.859 
the cabin misting up in winter then it's
probably<00:00:21.180> due<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.680> blocked<00:00:23.359> cabin<00:00:24.359> pollen

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
probably due to a blocked cabin pollen

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.460 
probably due to a blocked cabin pollen
filter<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> first<00:00:27.930> thing<00:00:28.140> we're<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
filter so the first thing we're going to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.700 
filter so the first thing we're going to
do<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:29.150> purchase<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> replacement<00:00:30.900> filter

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
do is purchase a replacement filter

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.500 
do is purchase a replacement filter
element<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.329> GM<00:00:33.840> part<00:00:34.530> number<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.510> I

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
element this is the GM part number and I

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.290 
element this is the GM part number and I
think<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.870> fits<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> theories<00:00:38.790> from<00:00:39.180> 2005

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
think it fits all the theories from 2005

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.330 
think it fits all the theories from 2005
the<00:00:42.300> pollen<00:00:42.840> filter<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.260> situated<00:00:43.980> behind<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the pollen filter is situated behind the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.900 
the pollen filter is situated behind the
glovebox<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.420> first<00:00:46.260> job<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.770> remove<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
glovebox so first job is to remove the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.410 
glovebox so first job is to remove the
glovebox

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.770 

so<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.750> open<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> bottles<00:00:53.539> you'll<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
so if we open the bottles you'll see a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.310 
so if we open the bottles you'll see a
couple<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.289> Torx<00:00:55.920> t20<00:00:56.640> screws<00:00:58.399> here<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.320> then

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
couple of Torx t20 screws here and then

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.070 
couple of Torx t20 screws here and then
another<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.579> over<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
another one on the right over here and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.120 
another one on the right over here and
first<00:01:07.080> job<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.530> slacken<00:01:07.950> those<00:01:08.220> off

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.550 

there<00:01:12.700> are<00:01:12.790> two<00:01:13.030> more<00:01:13.240> squeeze<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.290> got<00:01:14.439> to

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
there are two more squeeze that got to

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.289 
there are two more squeeze that got to
remove<00:01:14.799> before<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.490> glovebox<00:01:15.700> will<00:01:16.390> connect

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
remove before the glovebox will connect

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.300 
remove before the glovebox will connect
this<00:01:19.299> thing<00:01:19.530> literally<00:01:20.530> there<00:01:20.740> is<00:01:22.170> remove<00:01:23.170> a

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
of it from this side it should pop out

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.200 
of it from this side it should pop out
from<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.950> other<00:02:43.070> side<00:02:45.640> if<00:02:46.640> you've<00:02:46.880> got<00:02:47.060> our

talks<00:02:47.890> t27

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
talks t27

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.940 
talks t27
bit<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:50.300> can<00:02:50.480> actually<00:02:50.660> unscrew<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.680> rather

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
bit you can actually unscrew it rather

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.630 
bit you can actually unscrew it rather
than<00:02:52.190> pushing<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.820> out<00:02:53.380> but<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:55.220> doesn't<00:02:55.460> sink

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
than pushing it out but it doesn't sink

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.750 
than pushing it out but it doesn't sink
the<00:02:55.730> harlot<00:02:56.060> if<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.210> just<00:02:56.360> push<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.630> through

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
the harlot if you just push it through

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.440 
the harlot if you just push it through
next<00:02:58.760> thing<00:02:59.120> so<00:02:59.870> this<00:03:00.580> duct<00:03:01.580> should<00:03:02.090> now<00:03:02.270> be

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
next thing so this duct should now be

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.590 
next thing so this duct should now be
free<00:03:02.780> at<00:03:03.140> one<00:03:03.380> end<00:03:03.760> at<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.880> other<00:03:05.000> end

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
free at one end at the other end

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.050 
free at one end at the other end
it's<00:03:06.020> just<00:03:06.320> pushed<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.380> bracket<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.850> we

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
it's just pushed on to the bracket so we

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.490 
it's just pushed on to the bracket so we
don't<00:03:11.300> need<00:03:11.360> two<00:03:11.600> hands<00:03:11.870> for<00:03:12.050> this<00:03:12.230> but

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
don't need two hands for this but

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.550 
don't need two hands for this but
basically<00:03:13.340> just<00:03:13.550> pull<00:03:13.940> in<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.630> direction<00:03:14.690> to
