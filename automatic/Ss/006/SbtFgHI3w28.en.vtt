00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.900
 she youtube today we will see 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.630
 the brothers of the damage I listened 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.040
 the album is sincerely there are some good 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.790
 things 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.320
 today we will see the singing of 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.300
 sirens I think it's really a 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.810
 super nice song it's gone on 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.810
 starts above 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.500
 for you are song we will start 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 by the minor then a minor and a 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.720
 major 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.350
 the action will make the match but finally 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.160
 kind of pitching had thought a presto 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.329
 lundanes so laminar understand the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.790
 inch will attack the second body 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.620
 starting from above down after the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.920
 three cars to his on the a34 and 5th 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.559
 rope starting from above they go up 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.830
 yb locke and go back he doubled who holds 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.759
 does loo if the three come block shooting 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.680
 lobed stations of the line r is going to do 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:21.240
 the same thing about the miner but we're going 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.470
 duty of sound he grows mostly heard 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.640
 if you have trouble stringing together 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.229
 agreements and make the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.030
 launches one after the other on 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.539
 gymnastics fingers all one 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.310
 process 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.800
 here you need her contact 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.150
 I 'm trained to say 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.740
 so laminar to the miners and through 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.110
 had so there will push him on the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.120
 third rope starting from above is 3 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.150
 fingers on last three 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.310
 but in fact the cold and that's all there is 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:55.730
 nothing more and bombay that twice not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:58.220
 too much there I did mid May 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.240
 and he's his real actually ben four 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.240
 times so he starts to sing 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.229
 and there comes a little change after that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.030
 it's do wah do it twice 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.860
 no for the big for the same the same 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.019
 way of attacking the ropes only for 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.340
 therefore the second rope for the 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:21.190
 three ladies back and twice 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.300
 that it takes me the same way to do 2 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.530
 if the soil in a soil was worried 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.209
 not dared did it to download it 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.650
 for the ground I take brothers 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.670
 last just reassembled actually like 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:47.680
 for the thumb friend he would have stolen these 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:48.850
 I repeat do do soil then the soil is from 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.940
 the attacker will safely 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.410
 last one each his choice actually 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.910
 it's according to what you prefer for 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.490
 acute leg to do it is not 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.970
 harm no less certain moment one 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:09.860
 start again 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:13.540
 do do sol ready 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.909
 and so we want to do it twice 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.379
 then we will make agreements we will 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:22.900
 count four times each time the bacon 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:25.930
 1 2 3 4 lille 2 3 4 the balance of three 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.689
 categories 1 2 3 4 10 years old she goes on 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.689
 do it twice so I repeat there 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.930
 twice and all that we call it is 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.040
 repeat both entirely all 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.830
 just because they are like ali 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.090
 shante once we did all that we 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.650
 arrives on the last straight line 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.990
 and there we will have agreements made 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:55.140
 sound the dow 2 3 4 the 2 3 4 the floor of 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.190
 three categories 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:05.310
 weight 4 then it redone so two 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:11.200
 time then we come back to the a23 4.2 3.4 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.810
 tons of three categories 2 3 4 days 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.060
 package 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.579
 the right to test 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.130
 me 4 x 4 then we come back on the back min 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.990
 only twice and then for 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.030
 finish actually was one too 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.330
 replays four times so we got to 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.330
 very early 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:40.530
 simply and finally we will finish 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:44.820
 with a minor to minors baho and 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.200
 theirs and let's resonate at the end I 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.880
 You speak 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.090
 why I do not know like the others 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.160
 wrote the lyrics with the agreements at 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.810
 on it you show the chords in 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.340
 videos not just because it 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.410
 takes a lot of time and because 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.030
 it's my job as a guitar teacher and 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.229
 that I give you courses you 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.419
 advise autonomous 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.950
 it's free after if you try it 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.690
 information do not hesitate you go 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.139
 really progress but compared to 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.910
 his videos 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.950
 it has nothing to do but in any case 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.530
 here I know graf and we are not going 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.120
 have fun writing the lyrics plus the 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.450
 of the agreement underneath no I'm doing some 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.190
 sheets 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.930
 I think it's even better because 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.130
 that in the end you take the cards you 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.360
 try to work you go 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.860
 really work you're going to do 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.180
 the effort to listen to the song go 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.070
 make the effort to try to understand 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.900
 that I write to find where 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.160
 and that's better because we have too much 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.020
 the habit of taking everything to her and 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.970
 everything and everything and well we give it all 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.570
 super no I think it's not the 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.610
 good solution 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.229
 the proof i know how to really play my 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.490
 guitar and I can teach you 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.510
 plenty of people are all coming out 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.860
 currently I am trying to 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.390
 do and it's not the case for all the 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.950
 world so maybe it would take 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.870
 put to see the real basics for 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.610
 really play the guitar on this 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.990
