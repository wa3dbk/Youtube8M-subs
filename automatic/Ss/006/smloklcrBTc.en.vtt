00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.180
 and I, I'm not listening to that from 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:24.890
 he turned on the radio 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:28.369
 in big things car 5 I'm going to 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.590
 teach something awesome something that does not 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.360
 I could believe 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.210
 I thought I was cheating my eyes when 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.559
 I was seeing this mode because it is 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.690
 absolutely awesome as 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.989
 obviously they have seen and read it and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.449
 reviewed in the title is a way that you 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.900
 transforms simply and simply into 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.820
 spider-man or good not completely in 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.770
 spider-man but what this mode does is 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.790
 that all the skills of spider-man 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.489
 or 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.730
 obviously very halo gta you do not have to 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.710
 shoot to take off like the cobweb and 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.960
 Well, all that, not because of the way maybe 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.940
 you can refine a bit and do that already 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.950
 you do not need to take out the gun and believe in 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.110
 a weapon that is like the cartridge of 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.300
 spider-man that works as with the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.479
 same principle of shooting something and that 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.940
 come out that cobweb but what impressive 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.979
 in this way it is that you can upload 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.050
 any building to anything to 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.060
 any solid object that is in the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.280
 map you can get anywhere 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.340
 you can upload any building that 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.799
 want 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 good for example if you want to get on 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.060
 a building not so high you can take out 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 like the gun and it's like the range of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.670
 gun and then it does not fire I go out close and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.859
 already but if you want to get something further 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.340
 this obviously obviously that coat 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.819
 sniper and then you do all the zooming so the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.990
 wherever you want and you shoot and the 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.329
 character will automatically fly 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.969
 as a spider-man towards that location 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.429
 I hit some fun using this 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.640
 as well as flying buildings 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.189
 when you put it in the first person is what 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.020
 more impressive because it looks like 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.050
 how do you really fly to the building like this 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.360
 as such it is web 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.290
 in fact in this part how can 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.640
 observe try to prove what what 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.220
 I did in the animation if they saw the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.080
 animation that I made of gta iv this me 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.510
 I rise from this point towards the month 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.580
 benches and more or less from the same place was 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.890
 as a kind of prediction because the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.520
 cable was as well as like it was like a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.050
 déjà vú animation ero yes yes yes you know what 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.830
 means that they have not had one that 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.360
 you make an animation and then what 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.849
 what you encouraged to happen in life 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.590
 real and they have not happened to anyone 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.750
 but well, that would be all for this 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.010
 video by this mode here I will leave you the 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.260
 link in the description of the video itself 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.660
 they want to try it and well there is also a 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.310
 spider-man costume that I did not use because 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.690
 It is very difficult to install and 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.849
 I honestly believe that it is installed with the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.620
 program that they go in and I did not want 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.360
 risk in addition that the suit the net not 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.819
 It's so cool and it's just like that for 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.970
 say look spider-man suit not what 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.970
 has it like that and obviously after 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.650
 that you have the opportunity to play as 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.250
 spider-man if you put all the suits and 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.170
 we believe true and your life then 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.940
 Well, you do not do it and it's good but 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.910
 that would be all I hope there was 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.239
 liked thank you for watching this video and 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.239
 until next time
