00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 although the downs he student already some 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.700
 The fort was going on for years 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.670
 2012 as the first with a three-cylinder engine 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.219
 the c-segment came the 2012 from the ford 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.160
 focus ecoboost and a point 0 3 cylinder 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.360
 with 100 and 125 hp and then he does 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.310
 actually very reasonable 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.350
 but if you have the 125 hp version in the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.130
 smaller fiesta than a best 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.020
 volt car 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.119
 so smooth enough to call the sport 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.070
 what happens when you get that 125 hp 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.260
 strong three-cylinder engine in a car 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.260
 another 350 kilo light will first 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.610
 then you get this 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.020
 catering 7 ecoboost a kind 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.480
 cross between modern dance in between 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.000
 giggling engine and old-fashioned 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.320
 basically everything else on this car 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.250
 the crossing is not entirely without a struggle 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 or push we go like you 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.790
 perhaps can see is the hood 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.140
 equipped with a kind of power dome and that 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.820
 the three-cylinder engine is perhaps 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140
 smaller but due to torbe pipes 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.400
 also a little higher 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.199
 it's still a bit of a work in 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.260
 progress to show that you are with 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.250
 little weight what he lost but 588 pounds 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.110
 have a lot of fun with it 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.580
 little power because essentially lies here 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.330
 same three-cylinder if you have one 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.840
 fiesta 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.640
 instead of 125 has 340 horsepower but still 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 agree 40 now to measure more than the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.970
 standard input 16 years in light that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.090
 must be fun 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.090
 No 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.940
 and in itself that I do drive is one 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.200
 chain them that anyway because 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.350
 it's really old-fashioned 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.790
 work everything is going to be very direct 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.800
 is going to be a very heavy link 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.210
 nieuwpoort very heavy 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.160
 have been confirmed but even 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.840
 you really have to work for that 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.790
 really up stairs and that makes it whole 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.360
 Buddhist car driving but its 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.360
 sends one 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.789
 write this in this old one because everything 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.689
 so immediately had you immediately feel what was there 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.140
 happens 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.140
 so you study 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.890
 how that is immediately but 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.510
 correct or not of course just what you 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.340
 like 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.410
 only and this is quite big but that 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.890
 engine does not completely match the rest of 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.110
 the car 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.470
 what is very working in this car 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.300
 except those lottery tickets 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.550
 normally ecoboost is correct 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.930
 very nice in focusing through marie such 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.790
 tourist sports car 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.270
 so that you do not do it but last 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.920
 1000 rpm 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.930
 that we have that extra boost and their 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.520
 have to switch continuously 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.650
 take out and look at the maximum 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.980
 boost it 's just two and a half thousand 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.570
 speed then you really attract full to five 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.510
 and half a thousand rpm and above that yes 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.799
 the cat tiel it a bit towards 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.689
 and actions only it lacks some drama 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.620
 it's wrong that experience but luckily for 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.620
 open there or bombs 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.950
 and that something is this the formula ford 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.620
 ecoboost the same principle as the chain 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.190
 but then implemented to the extreme 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.830
 same one point zero ecoboost but then 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.870
 two hundred and five horsepower it weighs 495 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.620
 kilos can go from zero to one hundred in four 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.050
 seconds 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.530
 uses one of the most beautiful on March 20 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.530
 he is red label 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.660
 when I say rodrigo the intention sheet per 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.930
 ran red ion 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.930
 not like that 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.160
 handbrake and a horn is but have that 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.670
 I still can't find it 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.570
 this is good for region that means that 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.170
 beautiful what 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.170
 way to 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.170
 control 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.530
 is that you do not want to know he barely weighs 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.150
 500 kilos has the larger turbo from to 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.870
 six ecoboost so the formula for the w 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.230
 so cut 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.430
 so now this 1 liter comes to 200 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.480
 Well 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.340
 andre of those so many 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.340
 go do is pack silent 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.379
 as a money again mentioned in 100 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.209
 four seconds and then stays 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.760
 continue and continue 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.950
 in this car feels like business forms 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.689
 describe as immediate 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:22.039
 otherwise what you do this car they go 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:24.320
 immediately you turn mm the tear was 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.320
 speed limiter 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.390
 and she goes with so much 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.090
 almost as fast as speed 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.990
 To keep in mind is that she is older so 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.610
 that me 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.650
 we have a combination of these 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.680
 from their old with grout 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.830
 want to do I myself could send it 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.930
 placed from the turbo and I am now whole 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.930
 kind of 5 tdi sound it a bit 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.420
 for yes and that the road lives off the fingers 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.710
 really weird so now no sleep the 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.620
 boat below 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.150
 but really array just so must 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.040
 all get warm but then you have too 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.040
 more like you've never had 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.100
 the idea 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.660
 holding here the sun runs off 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.430
 and then that transmission, she was you 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.280
 the six-speed box 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.600
 is the link with that you go away and 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.400
 if you are beautiful in one sentence it is girls 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.590
 just join the throttle awarded 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.280
 his traits 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.750
 here and back the two duos that go it 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.250
 all immediately a whole lot 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.290
 violence 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.020
 the sensation yes with that often later that 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.260
 sitting opposite you is very happy here 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.260
 weather 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.680
 nice are ecoboost and various 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.270
 applications but what do you have here 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.250
 practice it well apart from one 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.229
 nice media moment for fort and it 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.039
 tonight the hair of my haircut is not so whole 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.479
 a lot of 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.180
 and yet there is an important one somewhere 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.250
 learn in such an ecoboost day that you 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.919
 low power also low power 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.020
 need relatively than the couple well that 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.430
 they make a car with the sensation of 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.409
 this one 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.479
 the more or less daily employability 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.849
 of the chain and consumption in it 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.680
 price tag of the fiesta 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.180
 then you have a spectacular bomb 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.889
 with relatively low consumption at a 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.029
 somewhat affordable price tag 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:15.250
 of course we can only do that 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.250
 cheer and it becomes your joe
