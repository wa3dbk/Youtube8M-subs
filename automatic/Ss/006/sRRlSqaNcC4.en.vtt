00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.809
 drove so well here I am imprinted 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:14.340
 rules already stitched them but decided them 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:18.630
 too find a sheet here it can be seen 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.230
 because the shevchik is seen here is nothing 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.970
 terrible, I think you normally send 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.680
 you will remove the guilt so you see short i 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.720
 here talked about bust but here 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.590
 come here for the sake of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.920
 here on the beard cover a lot that's all 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.820
 normally natural and not necessary 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:46.610
 so the stationery knife and just 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.340
 cut off because you don't need anything 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.379
 carefully you can cut well i think 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.180
 that the ends of the fishing line but just a little kidding 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:02.520
 so know everything therefore 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 fuck them but only gently so if 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.770
 use on too tidy it 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.770
 can kill a notebook with no rule 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.770
 but so here it â€™s time to run do it removed 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.799
 we don't need everything 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.990
 great so removes even that 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.960
 need and sensitively removed 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.840
 barely stabbed the rule okay 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.409
 I shall throw off anything they will approach me but not 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:41.830
 I do nâ€™t know if you are prom 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:46.330
 want to make wah tetradochku you will 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.330
 just to the maximum carefully and 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.560
 cut off even 30 years 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.280
 weights 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.990
 the main thing is how to knit well and last 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.450
 for the latter, what is residual 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.270
 crawl on again quisque which 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.220
 you are not forced upon 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.280
 here and exactly find out or who you are not 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.280
 love 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.330
 do not like that 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.219
 came from the Internet reshebnik for the West 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:22.760
 Problems in Physics Law Chafing Dish 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:25.090
 yes he is not needed here his brother you will see 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.739
 one 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:35.480
 honestly this question is inappropriate because 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:38.480
 That's because it's not only 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.370
 deaths are unknown although for some reason 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.879
 There is, in principle, exactly no 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.379
 exactly neatly see trimmed 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.319
 on the lid that is, we have a spine 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:54.639
 perfect here now here 's the principle here 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:58.639
 it all needs a visa i repeat i took 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:01.969
 what I took for my notebook 60 sheets 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.299
 because a couple they will be removed 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:08.510
 dirty don't require our paint 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.349
 which if you have inkjet 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.879
 i.e. ink they are a laser printer 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.799
 then it will be painted on the hands here if 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:23.049
 do you usually have them too 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.049
 laser then your muscles don't be afraid 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.680
 king take turn atropine already 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.770
 there is mail to die we cut the sheets 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.660
 the rule is 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.450
 I beg you can even even one by one 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.390
 clean leaflet cut off but you have to 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.340
 do it neatly 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.340
 if you do a stamp or cut 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.320
 undesirable and even tear off 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.069
 it is undesirable that she herself everything 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.800
 cut off because basically all the whole 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.530
 the beauty of this notebook and how you understood with 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:05.019
 don't you know yes lies in these 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:07.209
 rules their names are shaking hands 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:12.010
 gently inflame near here 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:16.299
 alcoholic don't feel basic too 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:21.340
 sometimes fish shake neatly 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:28.060
 neatly all god i have already gone book 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:31.900
 cut oh oh oh that 's all and so we 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.020
 see that everything is ready in fact they are all 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.290
 date minus given 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.830
 notebook ready notebook all this is yours 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.160
 notebook 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.290
 see that is, here they are a lot to scroll through 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.070
 even here they are like she will they go all 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.070
 it is laid out 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:05:08.610
 here is a notebook 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 13 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:11.430
 14 16 17 18 19 20 stole wealth and so 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:15.139
 further rules rules rules rules 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.689
 rules rules rules rules rules 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.449
 goman in manga no such thing that is i'm in 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.990
 principle gathered them all together and on 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.430
 goes we see yes done here 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.939
 specially black sheet because here 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:35.300
 no rules then you can write 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:37.740
 held its rules there 1 will take the rule 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:44.069
 Well, if for example as an addition 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:48.180
 came up with yes that's through the same I don't 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:52.159
 I found there to enter you need not to print 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:57.469
 And write for smear prison for mask but 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:59.399
 this is your essence of the initiative and by the way about 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:01.930
 than I told you 

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:04.270
 white fences 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.419
 see in place cut some there 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.729
 white little freaks now show even 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:16.150
 I still got a couple of sheets crooked 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:20.919
 I have not gone white here I have a sheet 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:23.110
 after all, the white strip turned out 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.419
 here a white strip turned out because of them 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.870
 you just need to take a marker 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:32.289
 here is one marker from fluorescent to take 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:37.120
 this sheet which is white and simple 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:39.190
 neatly paint over why particles 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.770
 why neatly yes because he 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:51.220
 will shine here, this is very bad 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:52.300
 more precisely it is a big minus for external 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.800
 kind of notebook 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:07:00.250
 becoming yourself where the biggest if you 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.810
 more big-eyed so to speak just 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.970
 always flip through 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:07.360
 notebooks there are the most direct 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.849
 thin white here these paint 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.099
 if you have a desire you can take 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:14.620
 these ones are already above the principle of everything 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:17.800
 things up you can just take and paint 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.289
 all with marker 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.289
 click will be stained so here 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:26.440
 dyeing to steal from 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:30.970
 we will be black do not understand the difference on 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.610
 The camera is very well seen here with the principle of 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:37.060
 With this detail, everything is more accurate to the garden; 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:39.340
 the notebook itself we set aside here 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.590
 a lot of places here here somewhere under 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:48.220
 from here you see on this dish here 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:51.909
 the bookend will be stuck that is 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:56.469
 here you see everything 

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:59.190
 we made a notebook now made a price 

00:07:56.469 --> 00:08:00.879
 the next video will show how to do 

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:04.990
 spine how to glue 

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:07.690
 here is a piece of paper for me 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:10.719
 there is a piece of paper cloth cooked black 

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.949
 pre-printed and on sheets 

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:14.280
 this is the first part 

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:14.280
 behind
