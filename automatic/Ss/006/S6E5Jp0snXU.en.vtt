earlier you saw me make that batter and
here<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.620> just<00:02:26.620> going<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.950> spoon<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.400> over

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
here it is just going to spoon that over

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.500 
here it is just going to spoon that over
the<00:02:28.240> top<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.440> very<00:02:29.740> light<00:02:30.220> coating<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:31.060> did

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
it'll puff up just a little bit because

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.090 
it'll puff up just a little bit because
of<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.800> baking<00:02:45.250> soda<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.060> baking<00:02:46.090> powder

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
and then we'll finish it by actually

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.270 
and then we'll finish it by actually
inverting<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.260> whole<00:02:53.470> thing<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.160> the
