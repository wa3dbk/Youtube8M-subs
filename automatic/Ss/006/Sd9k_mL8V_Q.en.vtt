00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
here too for reverse sensing system this

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.709 
here too for reverse sensing system this
one<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.129> keyless<00:00:50.520> entry<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:51.539> I'll

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
one has that keyless entry so then I'll

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.510
