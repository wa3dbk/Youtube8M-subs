 me and we are in a new news 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:11.830
 attentive because a new study indicates 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.889
 that by the end of 2016 there will be 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.640
 sold 10.8 million helmets 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.619
 virtual reality the truth is that I 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.810
 This studio 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.800

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.199
 2016 will already be those helmets in the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.089
 market but not good the truth is that 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.120
 we still do not know anything about the project 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.010
 morpheus we know something about oculus that yes 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.770

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.410

 and do studies in the market and indicate 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.550
 that around 10.8 million 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.980
 people would have done with a 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.300
 virtual reality device here 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.770
 at the end of 2016 according to this study the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.180
 46% of buyers of this type of 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.610
 peripherals would be 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.190
 with him to use it on a pc while 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.430
 that only 28% would do it to use it in 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.140

 that are most interesting for this type of 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.440
 technology since they make up 76 per 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.600
 hundred of the uses that are being given 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.630
