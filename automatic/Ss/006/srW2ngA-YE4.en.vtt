so<00:03:41.579> before<00:03:42.030> March<00:03:42.359> it<00:03:42.630> was<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:43.310> one<00:03:44.310> year

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
so before March it was that one year

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.440 
so before March it was that one year
later<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:45.299> was<00:03:45.599> that<00:03:46.579> basically<00:03:47.579> by<00:03:47.910> including

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
later it was that basically by including

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.860 
later it was that basically by including
some<00:03:48.630> dentistry<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:51.060> few<00:03:51.299> other<00:03:51.450> bits<00:03:51.569> and

some dentistry and a few other bits and

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.539 
some dentistry and a few other bits and
pieces<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.680> main<00:03:52.889> one<00:03:53.130> thing<00:03:53.340> was

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
pieces but the main one thing was

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.569 
pieces but the main one thing was
dentistry<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:55.169> we've<00:03:55.410> got<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> tool<00:03:56.069> here<00:03:56.400> with

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
dentistry so we've got a tool here with

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.879 
dentistry so we've got a tool here with
thermal<00:03:57.000> imaging<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:58.109> can<00:03:58.410> make<00:04:00.889> inroads

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
thermal imaging that can make inroads

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.819 
thermal imaging that can make inroads
into<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.599> commonest<00:04:03.599> form<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.079> cancer<00:04:04.410> in

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.960 

I<00:04:22.660> began<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.870> become<00:04:24.020> aware<00:04:24.259> of<00:04:25.100> research

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
I began to become aware of research

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.890 
I began to become aware of research
regarding<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:27.349> toxicity<00:04:28.750> associated<00:04:29.750> with<00:04:29.870> a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
years ago some very good research was

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.850 
years ago some very good research was

coming from the University of Kentucky
by<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> very<00:04:37.940> well-known<00:04:38.889> biochemist

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
root canal teeth I could hardly believe

root canal teeth I could hardly believe
that<00:04:45.590> when<00:04:46.370> I<00:04:46.400> began<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.389> read<00:04:47.599> it<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:47.990> then

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
that when I began to read it and then

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.710 
that when I began to read it and then
quite<00:04:49.220> frankly<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:49.669> went<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.150> see<00:04:50.419> that

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
quite frankly I went to see that

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.830 
quite frankly I went to see that
biochemist<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.770> see<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.370> research<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:53.720> I

biochemist and see the research and I

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.560 
biochemist and see the research and I
became<00:04:54.320> convinced<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.430> root<00:04:55.669> canal<00:04:55.849> teeth<00:04:56.360> a

influence our systemic health that I

canal<00:05:34.849> teeth<00:05:35.090> this<00:05:35.960> particular<00:05:36.620> study<00:05:36.949> deals

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
canal teeth this particular study deals

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.360 
canal teeth this particular study deals
only<00:05:38.180> with<00:05:38.659> the<00:05:39.250> very<00:05:40.250> best<00:05:40.909> root<00:05:41.539> canal<00:05:41.900> teeth

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
only with the very best root canal teeth

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.510 
only with the very best root canal teeth
perfect<00:05:43.370> on<00:05:43.550> x-ray<00:05:44.389> and<00:05:45.009> asymptomatic<00:05:46.009> in

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
perfect on x-ray and asymptomatic in

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.640 
perfect on x-ray and asymptomatic in
excess<00:05:47.330> of<00:05:47.889> 98%<00:05:48.889> have<00:05:49.849> tested<00:05:50.449> severely<00:05:51.380> -

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
excess of 98% have tested severely -

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.490 
excess of 98% have tested severely -
extremely<00:05:52.070> toxic<00:05:52.659> so<00:05:53.659> we're<00:05:54.050> talking<00:05:54.199> about

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
extremely toxic so we're talking about

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.730 
extremely toxic so we're talking about
teeth<00:05:55.009> that<00:05:55.340> have<00:05:55.930> toxicities<00:05:56.930> quite<00:05:57.229> frankly

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
teeth that have toxicities quite frankly

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.330 
teeth that have toxicities quite frankly
that<00:05:58.039> make<00:05:58.639> toxins<00:05:59.570> like<00:05:59.870> botulism<00:06:00.500> plunks

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
that make toxins like botulism plunks

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.540 
that make toxins like botulism plunks
and<00:06:01.520> tetanus<00:06:02.030> toxin<00:06:02.690> those<00:06:03.409> toxins<00:06:03.979> look<00:06:04.250> pale

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
and tetanus toxin those toxins look pale

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.820 
and tetanus toxin those toxins look pale
in<00:06:04.849> comparison<00:06:05.270> with<00:06:05.659> the<00:06:05.750> toxins<00:06:06.229> associated

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
in comparison with the toxins associated

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:16.190 
in comparison with the toxins associated
with<00:06:06.919> root<00:06:07.130> canal<00:06:07.430> tea

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.170 

we<00:06:17.200> happen<00:06:17.650> to<00:06:17.680> see<00:06:18.010> in<00:06:18.160> this<00:06:18.310> office<00:06:18.820> people

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
we happen to see in this office people

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.620 
we happen to see in this office people
who<00:06:19.540> have<00:06:19.690> had<00:06:19.990> a<00:06:20.230> root<00:06:20.830> canal<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.630> only

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
who have had a root canal and only

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.590 
who have had a root canal and only
within<00:06:22.930> weeks<00:06:23.500> then<00:06:24.190> be<00:06:24.460> diagnosed<00:06:25.090> with<00:06:25.450> an

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
within weeks then be diagnosed with an

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.960 
within weeks then be diagnosed with an
autoimmune<00:06:25.750> disease<00:06:26.440> and<00:06:26.710> there's<00:06:27.490> nothing

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
autoimmune disease and there's nothing

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.820 
autoimmune disease and there's nothing
else<00:06:28.210> that<00:06:28.390> they<00:06:28.660> can<00:06:28.840> point<00:06:29.080> to<00:06:29.380> so<00:06:29.680> they

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
else that they can point to so they

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.680 
else that they can point to so they
begin<00:06:30.220> to<00:06:30.340> think<00:06:30.550> could<00:06:30.850> it<00:06:31.000> possibly<00:06:31.210> have

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
begin to think could it possibly have

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.410 
begin to think could it possibly have
been<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.380> root<00:06:32.890> canal<00:06:33.220> even<00:06:34.120> though<00:06:34.240> that's

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.420 
been the root canal even though that's

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.780 
been the root canal even though that's
frustrating<00:06:35.290> often<00:06:35.650> times<00:06:35.920> we<00:06:36.130> find<00:06:36.460> that

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
frustrating often times we find that

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.810 
frustrating often times we find that
that<00:06:37.570> people's<00:06:37.990> health<00:06:38.370> really<00:06:39.370> improves

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
that people's health really improves

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.210 
that people's health really improves
when<00:06:40.180> you<00:06:40.360> eliminate<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.440> toxicities

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
when you eliminate the toxicities

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.480 
when you eliminate the toxicities
associated<00:06:42.940> with<00:06:43.030> dentistry
