00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
grounded outfit you can go wrong when

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.050 
grounded outfit you can go wrong when
you<00:04:01.290> compare<00:04:01.770> him<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.070> dani<00:04:02.310> álvarez<00:04:02.670> who's<00:04:03.030> a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
you compare him to dani álvarez who's a

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.229 
you compare him to dani álvarez who's a
hundred<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.810> forty<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.590> he<00:04:04.950> rise<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.670> think

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
hundred and forty and he rise in I think

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.710 
hundred and forty and he rise in I think
he's<00:04:06.360> just<00:04:06.600> as<00:04:06.750> good<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:08.090> then<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:09.269> in<00:04:09.510> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
he's just as good and then it's in the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.690 
he's just as good and then it's in the
back<00:04:09.900> we've<00:04:10.530> got<00:04:12.050> Chiellini<00:04:13.050> who's<00:04:13.410> 21<00:04:13.800> k<00:04:14.100> you

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
back we've got Chiellini who's 21 k you

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.920 
back we've got Chiellini who's 21 k you
used<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:14.970> be<00:04:15.060> quite<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.330> bit<00:04:15.480> more<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.870> then

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
used to be quite a bit more and then

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.279 
used to be quite a bit more and then
when<00:04:16.650> 10<00:04:16.890> years<00:04:16.919> release<00:04:17.520> he<00:04:17.700> drops<00:04:17.940> 15<00:04:18.419> but<00:04:19.260> i

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
when 10 years release he drops 15 but i

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.279 
when 10 years release he drops 15 but i
think<00:04:19.560> 80<00:04:19.770> pace<00:04:20.130> on<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.460> centre-back<00:04:20.880> is

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
think 80 pace on a centre-back is

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.270 
think 80 pace on a centre-back is
whereas<00:04:22.289> all<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.590> need<00:04:22.770> an<00:04:22.950> 8
