00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
of the best in my opinion he's probably

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.410 
of the best in my opinion he's probably
literally<00:01:02.280> he's<00:01:03.059> only<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.539> worst<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.420> 3.0

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
literally he's only the worst of the 3.0

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.289 
literally he's only the worst of the 3.0
heroes<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.560> he's<00:01:08.130> still<00:01:08.369> he's<00:01:08.790> actually<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
heroes but he's still he's actually a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.580 
heroes but he's still he's actually a
pretty<00:01:09.330> good<00:01:09.570> figure<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.439> you're

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
pretty good figure and if you're

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
pretty good figure and if you're
wondering<00:01:10.619> why<00:01:11.189> he<00:01:11.220> has<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:11.610> extra<00:01:12.000> parts

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299

know it's a it's not hard feat to build
one<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> these<00:02:07.110> anyway<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.680> not<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
one of these anyway it's not that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.960 
one of these anyway it's not that
tedious<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:09.500> yeah<00:02:10.520> that's<00:02:11.520> building

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
tedious but yeah that's building

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.660 
tedious but yeah that's building
experience<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
now for the parts now that's not many

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.010 
now for the parts now that's not many
new<00:02:18.360> ones<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.900> photo<00:02:19.790> only<00:02:20.790> 12<00:02:21.569> notes<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
legs which come into this gray recolored

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.940 
legs which come into this gray recolored
lower<00:02:26.130> limb<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> arrows<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:30.950> I'll

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
lower limb all of the arrows and I'll

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.870 
lower limb all of the arrows and I'll
just<00:02:32.160> talk<00:02:32.400> about<00:02:32.550> these<00:02:33.090> now<00:02:33.360> many<00:02:34.140> people

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
just talk about these now many people

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.600 
just talk about these now many people
don't<00:02:35.880> like<00:02:36.120> how<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.420> fellow<00:02:37.610> figure

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
don't like how the fellow figure

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.190 
don't like how the fellow figure
actually<00:02:38.760> has<00:02:39.269> no<00:02:40.080> armor<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.530> here<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:42.200> put

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
actually has no armor on here so I put

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.710 
actually has no armor on here so I put
on<00:02:43.380> here<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.860> kind<00:02:44.099> of<00:02:44.160> took<00:02:44.370> away<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:45.150> agile

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
on here it kind of took away the agile

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.630 
on here it kind of took away the agile
look<00:02:48.739> from<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.860> figure<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> mean<00:02:50.489> he's

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
look from the figure I mean he's

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640 
look from the figure I mean he's
supposed<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.209> bird<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.870> eagle<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.500> be

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
supposed to be a bird and eagle to be

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650 
supposed to be a bird and eagle to be
specific<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.370> mean<00:02:53.790> he<00:02:53.880> has<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.090> be<00:02:54.360> quite

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
specific I mean he has to be quite

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.630 
specific I mean he has to be quite
slight<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.560> be<00:02:55.680> able<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.920> fly<00:02:56.160> all<00:02:56.340> around<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
slight to be able to fly all around the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.479 
slight to be able to fly all around the
jungle<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.510> kind<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.140> like<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.620> look<00:02:58.860> but

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
jungle so I kind of like this look but

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.789 
jungle so I kind of like this look but
again<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.060> thought<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.569> still<00:03:00.989> thought<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.440> looks

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
again I thought I still thought it looks

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.789 
again I thought I still thought it looks
a<00:03:01.890> bit<00:03:02.010> too<00:03:02.310> skimpy<00:03:03.019> look<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.349> look<00:03:04.530> kind<00:03:04.709> of

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
a bit too skimpy look it look kind of

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.620 
a bit too skimpy look it look kind of
weak<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.610> be<00:03:05.730> honest<00:03:06.000> doesn't<00:03:06.450> look<00:03:06.540> very

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
weak to be honest doesn't look very

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.830 
weak to be honest doesn't look very
muscular<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.950> instead<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:08.970> having<00:03:09.239> no<00:03:09.330> armor

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
muscular so instead of having no armor

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.930 
muscular so instead of having no armor
or<00:03:10.049> I'm<00:03:10.200> on<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.500> front<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.890> decided<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.790> put

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
or I'm on the front I decided to put

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.039 
or I'm on the front I decided to put
armor<00:03:12.269> on<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.750> back<00:03:14.120> because<00:03:15.120> then<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.780> still

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
armor on the back because then it still

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.800 
armor on the back because then it still
gives<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.410> agile<00:03:16.799> look<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.220> no<00:03:17.400> armor

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
gives the agile look with no armor

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.780 
gives the agile look with no armor
beefing<00:03:18.810> up<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.049> front<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:20.130> also<00:03:20.280> get<00:03:20.489> back

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
beefing up the front you also get back

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.319 
beefing up the front you also get back
plugging<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:21.930> think<00:03:22.079> that's<00:03:22.290> pretty<00:03:22.500> cool

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
plugging so I think that's pretty cool

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.120 
plugging so I think that's pretty cool
just<00:03:24.329> an<00:03:24.450> idea<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.019> could<00:03:25.140> use<00:03:25.410> my

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
just an idea that you could use my

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.520 
just an idea that you could use my

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
quickie I guess you I could provide you

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.059 
quickie I guess you I could provide you
with<00:03:30.390> now<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.019> body<00:03:31.350> I'm<00:03:31.560> going<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.799> go<00:03:31.920> on<00:03:32.040> a

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
little mini runs about it's exactly the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.520 
little mini runs about it's exactly the
same<00:03:34.560> as<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:35.160> 2<00:03:35.489> point<00:03:35.730> 0<00:03:35.850> forms<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.540> mean<00:03:37.350> in

the assembly tower through the storyline

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.690 
the assembly tower through the storyline
that<00:03:39.870> they<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:40.319> think<00:03:40.500> oh<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:41.130> body<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.459> fine

but i have a feeling that they're not
they<00:05:09.039> weren't<00:05:09.280> designed<00:05:09.639> for<00:05:09.820> this<00:05:10.030> they<00:05:10.509> look

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
they weren't designed for this they look

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.150 
they weren't designed for this they look
a<00:05:10.690> bit<00:05:10.780> too<00:05:12.090> small<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:13.599> mean<00:05:13.900> if<00:05:14.830> they<00:05:15.009> were<00:05:15.070> a

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
a bit too small I mean if they were a

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.779 
a bit too small I mean if they were a
bit<00:05:15.340> longer<00:05:15.699> just<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.419> bit<00:05:16.570> more<00:05:16.720> curved<00:05:17.759> now<00:05:18.759> I

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
bit longer just a bit more curved now I

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.999 
bit longer just a bit more curved now I
think<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.210> could<00:05:19.330> fly<00:05:19.570> a<00:05:19.599> bit<00:05:19.810> better<00:05:20.050> but

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
think you could fly a bit better but

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.279 
think you could fly a bit better but
they're<00:05:21.370> pretty<00:05:21.520> nice<00:05:21.759> I<00:05:22.090> mean<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.539> hope<00:05:23.139> this

they're pretty nice I mean I hope this
isn't<00:05:23.590> a<00:05:23.650> reason<00:05:23.830> why<00:05:24.130> they<00:05:24.280> didn't<00:05:24.550> include

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
isn't a reason why they didn't include

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.230 
isn't a reason why they didn't include
two<00:05:25.270> extra<00:05:25.630> pieces<00:05:26.039> because<00:05:27.039> he<00:05:27.159> has<00:05:27.639> 28
