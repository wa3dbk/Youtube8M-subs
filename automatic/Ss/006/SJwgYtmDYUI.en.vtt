in<00:00:05.150> this<00:00:06.150> lesson<00:00:06.390> we're<00:00:06.720> going<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.900> talk<00:00:07.200> about

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380 
in this lesson we're going to talk about

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.310 
in this lesson we're going to talk about
by<00:00:08.250> Cordle<00:00:08.820> diatonic<00:00:09.389> progressions<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.139> in

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
by Cordle diatonic progressions and in

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.470 
by Cordle diatonic progressions and in
essence<00:00:10.650> that's<00:00:10.800> what<00:00:11.010> we've<00:00:11.190> been<00:00:11.220> doing<00:00:11.550> but

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
essence that's what we've been doing but

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.030 
essence that's what we've been doing but
we<00:00:12.690> were<00:00:12.840> restricting<00:00:13.379> ourselves<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
we were restricting ourselves in the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.480 
we were restricting ourselves in the
previous<00:00:14.400> five<00:00:14.520> lessons<00:00:15.590> with<00:00:16.590> adjacent

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
previous five lessons with adjacent

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.760 
previous five lessons with adjacent
triads<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.720> dealt<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.200> sea<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.530> D

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
triads we dealt with the sea in the D

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.170 
triads we dealt with the sea in the D
minor<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.160> we're<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> key<00:00:20.610> of<00:00:20.670> C<00:00:20.730> so

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
minor because we're in the key of C so

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.610 
minor because we're in the key of C so
to<00:00:21.240> see<00:00:21.450> in<00:00:21.540> the<00:00:21.630> D<00:00:21.780> minor<00:00:21.990> triads<00:00:22.380> which<00:00:22.500> are

which are five and six but I want you to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.200 
which are five and six but I want you to
be<00:00:33.960> aware<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.440> concept<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:36.000> big

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
be aware of this concept of the big

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.900 
be aware of this concept of the big
picture<00:00:36.530> look<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.649> diagram<00:00:38.129> seven<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
picture look at diagram seven you have a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.970 
picture look at diagram seven you have a
chart<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.420> shows<00:00:39.899> each<00:00:40.289> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.679> six

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
chart that shows each of the six

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.329 
chart that shows each of the six
diatonic<00:00:41.519> triads<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.359> in<00:00:43.170> each<00:00:43.409> case<00:00:43.440> there

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
diatonic triads and in each case there

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:45.889 
diatonic triads and in each case there
are<00:00:44.519> five<00:00:44.820> other<00:00:44.850> tribes<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.570> could<00:00:45.749> go<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
are five other tribes you could go to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.299 
are five other tribes you could go to
now<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> makes<00:00:46.620> sense<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.039> we've

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
now that makes sense because we've

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.099 
now that makes sense because we've
excluded<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.969> seven<00:00:48.329> triad<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.960> be

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
excluded the seven triad that be

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.049 
excluded the seven triad that be
diminished<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.679> a<00:00:49.739> stable<00:00:50.309> chord<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.699> its<00:00:50.850> own

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
diminished as a stable chord on its own

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.790 
diminished as a stable chord on its own
if<00:00:51.659> you<00:00:51.809> want<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.019> study<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.409> own<00:00:52.559> go

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
if you want to study on your own go

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.079 
if you want to study on your own go
right<00:00:52.920> ahead<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.489> didn't<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.999> was

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
right ahead but I didn't think it was

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.779 
right ahead but I didn't think it was
warning<00:00:54.690> enough<00:00:55.050> studying<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.530> lesson

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
warning enough studying this lesson

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.829 
warning enough studying this lesson
let's<00:00:56.789> look<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> first<00:00:57.300> group<00:00:57.629> where<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
let's look at the first group where you

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.500 
let's look at the first group where you
have<00:00:57.960> C<00:00:58.229> to<00:00:58.260> D<00:00:58.469> minor<00:00:58.829> C<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.280> e<00:00:59.309> minor<00:00:59.640> C<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.999> FC<00:01:00.420> 2

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
have C to D minor C to e minor C to FC 2

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.259 
have C to D minor C to e minor C to FC 2
GC<00:01:00.929> to<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> minor<00:01:01.409> you<00:01:02.219> want<00:01:02.429> to<00:01:02.519> explore<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
GC to a minor you want to explore all of

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.850 
GC to a minor you want to explore all of
those<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:03.690> we've<00:01:03.839> already<00:01:04.019> covered<00:01:04.320> C<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.830> D

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
those now we've already covered C to D

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
those now we've already covered C to D
minor<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.840> but<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.170> would<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
minor right but then you would want to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.030 
minor right but then you would want to
explore<00:01:07.950> c2<00:01:08.790> e<00:01:08.850> minor<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:10.229> all<00:01:10.500> seven

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
explore c2 e minor with all seven

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.910 
explore c2 e minor with all seven
possible<00:01:11.490> bass<00:01:11.700> notes<00:01:12.030> underneath<00:01:12.689> okay<00:01:13.619> now

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
possible bass notes underneath okay now

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.620 
possible bass notes underneath okay now
do<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.310> how<00:01:14.340> big<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> vine

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
do you see how big this is it's a vine

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.240 
do you see how big this is it's a vine
it<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.930> keeps<00:01:16.110> growing<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.619> growing<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it just keeps growing and growing it is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.859 
it just keeps growing and growing it is
finite<00:01:17.729> though<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.180> don't<00:01:18.329> think<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
finite though so don't think that

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.319 
finite though so don't think that
there's<00:01:19.259> no<00:01:19.649> end<00:01:19.829> of<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.969> the<00:01:21.090> same

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
there's no end of this and then the same

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.480 
there's no end of this and then the same
thing<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:21.659> apply<00:01:21.890> for<00:01:22.890> each<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.310> these

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
thing would apply for each of these

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.149 
thing would apply for each of these
categories<00:01:23.810> where<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.899> have<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.439> diatonic

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
categories where you have a diatonic

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.889 
categories where you have a diatonic
triad<00:01:26.579> is<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> home-based<00:01:27.270> chord<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.719> then<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
triad is a home-based chord and then you

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.569 
triad is a home-based chord and then you
go<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.079> another<00:01:28.320> diatonic<00:01:28.799> try<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.219> it<00:01:29.310> isn't

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
go to another diatonic try and it isn't

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.520 
go to another diatonic try and it isn't
necessarily<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.090> neighbor<00:01:30.360> chord<00:01:30.780> very

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
necessarily a neighbor chord very

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.050 
necessarily a neighbor chord very
quickly<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.219> to<00:01:32.430> go<00:01:32.579> through<00:01:32.820> this

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
quickly I'm going to go through this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.230 
quickly I'm going to go through this
let's<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:34.049> over<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.469> example<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> D<00:01:35.969> minor

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
let's go over for example to the D minor

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.899 
let's go over for example to the D minor
section<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.560> had<00:01:37.740> d<00:01:37.979> minor<00:01:38.219> an<00:01:38.369> e-minor<00:01:38.729> we

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
section you had d minor an e-minor we

figure<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:58.990> out<00:01:59.140> it's<00:01:59.439> not<00:01:59.530> that<00:01:59.710> hard<00:02:00.030> what

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
figure this out it's not that hard what

certain<00:02:06.820> phenomenon<00:02:07.299> is<00:02:07.360> going<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.659> occur

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
when you skip accord because your chords

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.850 
when you skip accord because your chords
are<00:02:10.509> built<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.780> thirds<00:02:11.110> there's<00:02:11.410> not<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> lot<00:02:11.830> of

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
are built in thirds there's not a lot of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.930 
are built in thirds there's not a lot of
difference<00:02:12.250> between<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.550> D<00:02:12.790> minor<00:02:13.030> chord<00:02:14.940> and

difference between a D minor chord and
an<00:02:16.060> F<00:02:16.239> chord<00:02:16.269> that's<00:02:17.200> because<00:02:17.560> they<00:02:17.709> share<00:02:17.950> two

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
an F chord that's because they share two

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.190 
an F chord that's because they share two

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
apart which means every other cord out

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.870 
apart which means every other cord out
of<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.989> scale<00:02:23.260> will<00:02:23.980> have<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.280> comment<00:02:24.670> owns

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
of the scale will have to comment owns

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.759 
of the scale will have to comment owns
so<00:02:25.630> then<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.900> would<00:02:26.049> want<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.290> go<00:02:26.410> through<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
so then you would want to go through the

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.640 
so then you would want to go through the
same<00:02:27.069> thing<00:02:27.459> where<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.940> played<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.569> d<00:02:29.019> base<00:02:29.290> for

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
same thing where you played a d base for

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.080 
same thing where you played a d base for
the<00:02:29.739> D<00:02:29.920> minor<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.810> then<00:02:32.110> addy<00:02:32.319> base<00:02:32.560> for<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.860> f

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the D minor and then addy base for the f

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.420 
the D minor and then addy base for the f
well<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.390> case<00:02:34.450> what<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.080> get<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.980> just<00:02:36.340> a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
well in that case what you get is just a

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.330 
well in that case what you get is just a
D<00:02:36.580> minor<00:02:36.790> 7<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:38.140> that's<00:02:38.349> just<00:02:38.410> an<00:02:38.680> extension<00:02:39.130> of

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
D minor 7 so that's just an extension of

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.039 
D minor 7 so that's just an extension of
the<00:02:39.459> chord<00:02:39.819> when<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.090> use<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> chord<00:02:40.810> that's<00:02:40.989> a

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
the chord when you use a chord that's a

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.259 
the chord when you use a chord that's a
third<00:02:41.290> higher<00:02:41.620> but<00:02:42.370> then<00:02:42.549> if<00:02:42.640> we<00:02:42.790> move<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.239> the

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
third higher but then if we move to the

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.960 
third higher but then if we move to the
next<00:02:43.540> one<00:02:43.720> we<00:02:43.810> go<00:02:43.959> team<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:45.540> g<00:02:46.540> /<00:02:46.810> d<00:02:47.760> now<00:02:48.760> that's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
next one we go team on g / d now that's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.360 
next one we go team on g / d now that's
a<00:02:49.060> condom<00:02:49.450> aggression<00:02:49.930> let's<00:02:50.769> listen<00:02:51.099> to<00:02:51.250> it

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
going to be able to follow and here

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.320 
going to be able to follow and here
toons<00:03:56.930> then<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:58.310> most<00:03:58.610> tunes<00:03:58.850> are<00:03:58.940> diatonic
