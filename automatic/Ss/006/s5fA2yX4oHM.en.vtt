00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.819
 series of comfortable mountain bikes 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.620
 has several advantages 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.719
 features compared to ordinary 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.030
 mountain bikes adjustable by 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.190
 height steering wheel wide soft saddle 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.810
 sometimes with extra springs like 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.480
 plastic pedal rule soft 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.050
 wide grips or soft front handles 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.430
 shock absorber 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.920
 as well as on some models 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.840
 amortized transfer all these options 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.270
 can be combined with each other in one 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.370
 models immediately either individually or in 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.739
 This or that set all depends on 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.809
 the cost of the bike it picking well 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.300
 and of course from the manufacturer clinic 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.519
 comfortable bike we allocated not 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.289
 randomly relying on a great sales experience 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.659
 as well as studying the demand we came to the conclusion 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.550
 that many people are interested in universal 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.859
 bicycles on which you can ride on 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.899
 asphalt and rough roads that is 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.670
 for giving and the city the bicycle on which 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.499
 you can not skate long 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.210
 forward trying to reach the helm with 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.829
 more direct fit than mountain 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.359
 bike while running 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.979
 characteristics should not yield 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.989
 classic mountain models 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.120
 amateur and hi professional 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.920
 class mountain comfort bikes it 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.880
 exactly the line that meets all 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.219
 requirements 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.840
 You can adjust the height of the steering wheel when 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.210
 this you do not need to apply for 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.549
 help in masterful angle of slope 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.409
 will change the landing you will not be inclined 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.420
 over the frame however the frame geometry itself 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.729
 designed in such a way that 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.649
 the landing was smoother you play us here 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.750
 less gives advantages in 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.180
 flexibility of settings for a particular type 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.250
 gifts for example in a strong wind you can 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.109
 lower landing lowering the release 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.359
 to reduce resistance to oncoming 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.680
 the flow of shock-absorbing seatpost 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.320
 this pipe is installed 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.640
 bicycle saddle spring inside it 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.590
 or 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.420
 the rest depending on the model when 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.310
 hitting the bump the spring is triggered and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.930
 swallows bumps on some 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.430
 Models can be customized 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.560
 stiffness with simple 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.970
 hexagon just tightening or 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.310
 loosening the bolt at the bottom 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.259
 seatpost if you ride on 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.900
 asphalt can tighten the bolt a little 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.820
 when the spring gets harder on the grader 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.560
 or soil can be depreciated 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.020
 softer rowers and handles on the steering wheel 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.940
 made from soft materials this 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.590
 not just rubber it can be leather with 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.840
 interlayer of soft material 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.910
 the shape of such pens is wide to load 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.920
 distributed across the palm of your hand and they do not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.600
 numb with a long ride saddle 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.760
 wide forms will not allow you to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.870
 comfort rotate the pedals like on 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.090
 sport bike 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.100
 but distribute the load will provide 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.360
 support for the fifth point will prevent 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.100
 clamping soft tissue 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.060
 of course you can install all these 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.250
 options for an ordinary bike 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.700
 on his own but he cannot become 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.860
 more convenient 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.530
 as the frame geometry will not change 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.239
 frame geometry is the key 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.239
 convenience factor and landing
