literally 60 65 seats so I'd rather have
that<00:00:46.510> way<00:00:46.780> time<00:00:47.019> and<00:00:47.260> being<00:00:47.620> consistent<00:00:47.890> that

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
that way time and being consistent that

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
and becoming less persistent let me I

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:59.780

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
I think on average I would say 65% of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.660 
I think on average I would say 65% of
herbals<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:04.890> too<00:01:05.159> rare<00:01:05.400> I

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
herbals are going out here too rare I

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.250

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
don't see the younger generation are

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.000 
don't see the younger generation are
