00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.060 

ah

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:21.570 

got<00:00:12.070> the<00:00:12.280> hell<00:00:19.259> all<00:00:20.259> right<00:00:20.500> so<00:00:20.740> I<00:00:21.009> guess<00:00:21.189> right

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
got the hell all right so I guess right

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.249 
got the hell all right so I guess right
now<00:00:21.610> i'll<00:00:22.270> talk<00:00:22.599> a<00:00:22.630> little<00:00:22.840> about<00:00:22.930> the

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
now i'll talk a little about the

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.729 
now i'll talk a little about the
difference<00:00:23.590> between<00:00:23.710> a<00:00:24.540> 650<00:00:25.540> we're<00:00:26.470> really<00:00:26.649> a

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
difference between a 650 we're really a

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.370 
difference between a 650 we're really a
v-twin<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:28.770> 600<00:00:29.770> bike<00:00:30.279> so<00:00:31.029> 650<00:00:31.660> there<00:00:31.689> again

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
v-twin and a 600 bike so 650 there again

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.889 
v-twin and a 600 bike so 650 there again
be<00:00:32.619> twins<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.899> then<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.290> lost<00:00:35.559> 600<00:00:36.190> are<00:00:36.670> in<00:00:37.570> line

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
be twins and then a lost 600 are in line

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.220 
be twins and then a lost 600 are in line
force<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.280> they're<00:00:39.910> completely<00:00:40.540> completely

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
force and they're completely completely

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.860 
force and they're completely completely
different<00:00:41.860> types<00:00:42.070> of<00:00:42.280> engines<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:43.570> the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
different types of engines like the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.660 
different types of engines like the
easiest<00:00:44.230> way<00:00:44.470> for<00:00:44.500> me<00:00:44.770> to<00:00:44.890> explain<00:00:45.340> this<00:00:45.490> let

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
easiest way for me to explain this let

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.580 
easiest way for me to explain this let
me<00:00:45.700> go<00:00:45.850> ahead<00:00:45.910> and<00:00:46.000> close<00:00:46.150> my<00:00:46.210> visor<00:00:46.540> case<00:00:47.470> you

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
me go ahead and close my visor case you

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.010 
me go ahead and close my visor case you
guys<00:00:47.710> actually<00:00:47.980> want<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:48.460> hear<00:00:48.670> me<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
guys actually want to hear me the

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.830 
guys actually want to hear me the
easiest<00:00:50.830> way<00:00:51.100> for<00:00:51.130> me<00:00:51.580> to<00:00:51.610> explain<00:00:52.150> this<00:00:52.360> is

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
easiest way for me to explain this is

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.490 
easiest way for me to explain this is
going<00:00:53.710> from<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:55.090> hopefully<00:00:56.079> you<00:00:56.140> guys<00:00:56.290> want

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
going from and hopefully you guys want

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.140 
going from and hopefully you guys want
to<00:00:56.590> stand<00:00:56.800> this

Rob

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.960 

going<00:01:03.980> from<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:05.380> large<00:01:06.380> displacement<00:01:06.920> v8<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.260> a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
going from a large displacement v8 and a

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.730 
going from a large displacement v8 and a
turbo<00:01:10.970> four-cylinder<00:01:11.630> like<00:01:11.810> an<00:01:11.960> EVO<00:01:12.230> or<00:01:12.440> neste

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
turbo four-cylinder like an EVO or neste

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.350 
turbo four-cylinder like an EVO or neste
I<00:01:12.770> so<00:01:12.980> you're<00:01:13.160> basically<00:01:13.370> comparing

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
I so you're basically comparing

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.150 
I so you're basically comparing
something<00:01:14.720> like<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:15.140> Camaro<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.750> an<00:01:17.750> EVO<00:01:18.170> that

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
something like a Camaro to an EVO that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.080 
something like a Camaro to an EVO that
that<00:01:19.790> is<00:01:20.090> what<00:01:20.510> I<00:01:20.720> will<00:01:20.960> put<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.229> out<00:01:21.470> as<00:01:22.090> for

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
that is what I will put it out as for

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.760 
that is what I will put it out as for
people<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.600> are<00:01:23.690> thinking<00:01:24.110> about<00:01:24.410> what's

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
people that are thinking about what's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.330 
people that are thinking about what's
the<00:01:24.950> difference<00:01:25.280> between<00:01:25.370> a<00:01:26.200> 650<00:01:27.200> v-twin<00:01:28.100> or

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
the difference between a 650 v-twin or

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.330 
the difference between a 650 v-twin or
700<00:01:29.090> v-twin<00:01:29.890> versus<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:31.070> 600<00:01:31.820> in<00:01:31.970> line<00:01:32.890> with<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
700 v-twin versus a 600 in line with the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.010 
700 v-twin versus a 600 in line with the
650<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.509> have<00:01:36.070> lots<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.250> lazy<00:01:37.580> lazy<00:01:38.090> power<00:01:38.509> so

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
650 you have lots of lazy lazy power so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.380 
650 you have lots of lazy lazy power so
it's<00:01:39.290> like<00:01:39.470> I<00:01:39.650> red<00:01:40.369> line<00:01:40.610> at<00:01:40.850> ten<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:41.330> a<00:01:41.360> half

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
it's like I red line at ten and a half

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.020 
it's like I red line at ten and a half
right<00:01:41.720> there<00:01:41.900> that's<00:01:42.380> what<00:01:42.530> my<00:01:42.560> tax<00:01:42.860> says<00:01:43.070> and

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
right there that's what my tax says and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.780 
right there that's what my tax says and
I<00:01:44.540> have<00:01:44.900> low<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.710> like<00:01:45.950> tons<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.400> low-end

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
I have low it like tons of low-end

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.780 
I have low it like tons of low-end
torque<00:01:47.060> tons<00:01:48.050> of<00:01:48.200> mid-range<00:01:48.440> torque<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.430> then

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
torque tons of mid-range torque and then

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.400 
torque tons of mid-range torque and then
once<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.180> starts<00:01:50.390> getting<00:01:50.509> up<00:01:50.750> there<00:01:51.050> in<00:01:51.110> the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
once it starts getting up there in the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.580 
once it starts getting up there in the
rpms<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.100> starts<00:01:52.369> falling<00:01:52.820> on<00:01:52.940> his<00:01:53.060> face<00:01:53.330> so<00:01:54.200> I

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
rpms it starts falling on his face so I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.859 
rpms it starts falling on his face so I
can<00:01:55.009> actually<00:01:55.430> probably<00:01:55.940> out<00:01:56.420> sprint<00:01:56.899> a<00:01:57.430> 600cc

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
can actually probably out sprint a 600cc

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.510 
can actually probably out sprint a 600cc
Supersport<00:01:59.869> bike<00:02:00.080> up<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.860> around<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.340> don't

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
Supersport bike up to around I don't

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.840 
Supersport bike up to around I don't
know<00:02:01.640> 80<00:02:02.570> miles<00:02:02.899> per<00:02:03.050> hour<00:02:03.259> or<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:04.190> 70<00:02:04.670> miles

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
know 80 miles per hour or so 70 miles

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.040 
know 80 miles per hour or so 70 miles
per<00:02:04.970> hour<00:02:05.060> or<00:02:05.090> something<00:02:05.270> along<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.660> lines

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
per hour or something along that lines

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.889 
per hour or something along that lines
but<00:02:07.009> then<00:02:07.160> that<00:02:07.280> guy<00:02:07.399> is<00:02:07.460> going<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.390> 600

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
but then that guy is going to the 600

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.070 
but then that guy is going to the 600
blow<00:02:09.110> past<00:02:09.380> me<00:02:09.649> after<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.550> with<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.480> 600

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
blow past me after that and with a 600

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.460 
blow past me after that and with a 600
you<00:02:12.260> e<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.730> basically<00:02:13.970> don't<00:02:14.420> have<00:02:14.750> all<00:02:15.200> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
you e you basically don't have all the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.270 
you e you basically don't have all the
torque<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.270> low<00:02:17.420> ranges<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:19.010> may<00:02:19.130> have

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
torque in the low ranges you may have

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.699 
torque in the low ranges you may have
some<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.610> mid-range<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:21.319> probably<00:02:21.590> do

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
some in the mid-range you probably do

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.170 
some in the mid-range you probably do
have<00:02:21.740> some<00:02:22.069> in<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.370> mid-range<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:22.940> it's<00:02:23.030> just

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
have some in the mid-range but it's just

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.330 
have some in the mid-range but it's just
starting<00:02:23.480> out<00:02:23.630> in<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.319> low<00:02:24.620> range<00:02:24.830> you're<00:02:25.160> not

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
starting out in the low range you're not

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.120 
starting out in the low range you're not
gonna<00:02:25.459> have<00:02:25.700> very<00:02:25.970> much<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.450> anything

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
gonna have very much of anything

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.850 
gonna have very much of anything
so<00:02:28.730> it's<00:02:29.300> like<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:30.260> have<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.500> wait<00:02:30.650> for<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
so it's like you have to wait for the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.970 
so it's like you have to wait for the
RPMs<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.730> actually<00:02:32.410> speed<00:02:33.410> up<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.860> to

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
RPMs to actually speed up for you to

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.200 
RPMs to actually speed up for you to
actually<00:02:34.130> get<00:02:34.400> power<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.850> that's<00:02:34.970> gonna<00:02:35.090> be

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
actually get power and that's gonna be

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.360 
actually get power and that's gonna be
boom<00:02:35.510> power<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.490> is<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.660> addictive

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
boom power and that is that is addictive

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.910 
boom power and that is that is addictive

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
what the hell is that so you're either

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.310 
what the hell is that so you're either
going<00:03:14.960> to<00:03:15.020> have<00:03:15.080> like<00:03:15.940> easy<00:03:16.940> easy<00:03:17.320> drivability

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
going to have like easy easy drivability

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.130 
going to have like easy easy drivability
that<00:03:18.530> has<00:03:18.740> power<00:03:19.220> like<00:03:19.670> everywhere<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:21.020> you

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
that has power like everywhere and you

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.230 
that has power like everywhere and you
don't<00:03:21.350> need<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.560> rub<00:03:21.800> very<00:03:22.130> high<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:22.940> actually

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
don't need to rub very high to actually

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.360 
don't need to rub very high to actually
get<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.570> power<00:03:23.810> but<00:03:24.680> know<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.070> you're

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
get that power but know that you're

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.220 
get that power but know that you're
going<00:03:25.490> to<00:03:25.550> sacrifice<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.420> on<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.720> top<00:03:26.930> end

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
going to sacrifice it on the top end

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.470 
going to sacrifice it on the top end
versus<00:03:28.190> something<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:28.700> doesn't<00:03:29.000> have<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.180> lot

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
versus something that doesn't have a lot

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.540 
versus something that doesn't have a lot
of<00:03:29.510> power<00:03:29.920> but<00:03:30.920> all<00:03:31.100> of<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.220> sudden<00:03:31.460> you're

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
of power but all of a sudden you're

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.130 
of power but all of a sudden you're
going<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.730> get<00:03:31.850> that<00:03:31.970> instant<00:03:32.330> hit<00:03:32.600> the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
going to get that instant hit the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.890 
going to get that instant hit the
instant<00:03:33.530> hit<00:03:33.740> of<00:03:33.860> power<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.600> really<00:03:35.600> really

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
instant hit of power is really really

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.030 
instant hit of power is really really
addictive<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:37.190> can<00:03:37.220> actually<00:03:37.490> make<00:03:38.770> your<00:03:39.770> bike

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
addictive it can actually make your bike

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.120 
addictive it can actually make your bike
feel<00:03:40.310> much<00:03:40.790> much<00:03:41.210> faster<00:03:41.780> when<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.800> get<00:03:42.980> that

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
feel much much faster when you get that

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.250 
feel much much faster when you get that
instant<00:03:43.430> hit<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.270> instant<00:03:44.690> rush<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:45.050> power

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
instant hit that instant rush of power

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.870 
instant hit that instant rush of power
because<00:03:45.500> it's<00:03:45.710> like<00:03:45.860> you're<00:03:46.340> building<00:03:46.760> up

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
because it's like you're building up

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
like in your back it just pushes you

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.980 
like in your back it just pushes you

don't get with this guy here like to
actually<00:03:59.420> make<00:03:59.810> up<00:03:59.840> for<00:04:00.260> that<00:04:00.380> same<00:04:00.680> amount<00:04:00.920> of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
actually make up for that same amount of

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.290 
actually make up for that same amount of
power<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.580> need<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.240> larger<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:05.120> need<00:04:05.270> a

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
power you need a larger you need a

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.320 
power you need a larger you need a
larger<00:04:05.690> v-twin<00:04:06.080> basically<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:08.150> match

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
larger v-twin basically to match

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.090 
larger v-twin basically to match
something<00:04:08.630> like<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.900> 600<00:04:09.620> Super<00:04:09.830> Sport<00:04:10.010> you're

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
gonna need like a 750 or 800 between to

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.920 
gonna need like a 750 or 800 between to
match<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.700> same<00:04:13.940> type<00:04:14.180> of<00:04:14.209> power<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:14.780> you're

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
match the same type of power so you're

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.500 
match the same type of power so you're
going<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.080> need<00:04:15.500> more<00:04:15.709> cc's<00:04:16.359> basically<00:04:17.359> to

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
going to need more cc's basically to

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.780 
going to need more cc's basically to
actually<00:04:17.780> do<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.170> that's<00:04:18.500> correct<00:04:19.040> that's

the<00:04:19.940> same<00:04:20.180> as<00:04:20.480> it<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.470> car<00:04:21.709> world<00:04:21.950> it's

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
the same as it is in the car world it's

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.850 
the same as it is in the car world it's
not<00:04:22.310> any<00:04:22.580> different<00:04:22.900> all<00:04:23.900> right<00:04:24.050> like<00:04:24.440> my

mass<00:04:37.360> at<00:04:37.599> st.<00:04:37.749> performance<00:04:38.319> but<00:04:39.330> if<00:04:40.330> you're

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
mass at st. performance but if you're

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.850 
mass at st. performance but if you're
putzing<00:04:40.960> around<00:04:41.080> town<00:04:42.449> yeah<00:04:43.449> the<00:04:43.689> v8<00:04:43.960> is<00:04:44.139> very

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
putzing around town yeah the v8 is very

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.369 
putzing around town yeah the v8 is very
very<00:04:45.069> satisfying<00:04:45.789> to<00:04:45.939> actually<00:04:46.360> drive<00:04:47.080> you

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
very satisfying to actually drive you

very satisfying to actually drive you
get<00:04:47.529> that<00:04:47.650> instant<00:04:47.860> hit<00:04:48.249> of<00:04:48.370> power<00:04:48.580> right<00:04:49.270> away

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
get that instant hit of power right away

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.409 
get that instant hit of power right away
so<00:04:50.409> I<00:04:50.439> mean<00:04:50.680> that's<00:04:50.800> my<00:04:51.189> thoughts<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.789> if<00:04:52.029> if

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
so I mean that's my thoughts of it if if

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.920 
so I mean that's my thoughts of it if if
you<00:04:52.659> uh<00:04:52.689> if<00:04:54.120> you<00:04:55.120> just<00:04:55.360> kind<00:04:55.539> of<00:04:55.629> go<00:04:55.810> around

it look of it but you can get one that's
fully<00:06:21.189> fairing<00:06:21.580> you<00:06:22.300> know<00:06:22.419> there's<00:06:22.599> a<00:06:22.659> ninja

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
fully fairing you know there's a ninja

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.119 
fully fairing you know there's a ninja
650<00:06:23.469> out<00:06:23.589> there<00:06:25.349> there's<00:06:26.349> a<00:06:26.409> Honda<00:06:26.800> out<00:06:26.949> there

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:27.129 
650 out there there's a Honda out there

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:29.969 
650 out there there's a Honda out there
too<00:06:27.339> there's<00:06:27.669> a<00:06:27.729> lot<00:06:27.909> of<00:06:27.939> bikes<00:06:28.180> at<00:06:28.419> our<00:06:28.979> full

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
too there's a lot of bikes at our full

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.260 
too there's a lot of bikes at our full
fairing<00:06:30.339> they're<00:06:31.180> not<00:06:31.389> in<00:06:31.569> lines

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
fairing they're not in lines

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.260 
fairing they're not in lines
so<00:06:34.190> you<00:06:35.190> get<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:35.520> look<00:06:35.820> but<00:06:36.060> you're<00:06:36.150> not

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
so you get that look but you're not

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.400 
so you get that look but you're not
going<00:06:36.420> to<00:06:36.480> get<00:06:36.540> that<00:06:36.720> same<00:06:37.080> type<00:06:37.380> of

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
going to get that same type of

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.980 
going to get that same type of
performance<00:06:38.340> is<00:06:39.060> completely<00:06:39.630> on<00:06:39.810> the

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
performance is completely on the

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.990 
performance is completely on the
opposite<00:06:40.530> side<00:06:40.740> of<00:06:40.770> spectrums<00:06:41.400> once<00:06:41.700> for

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
opposite side of spectrums once for

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.040 
opposite side of spectrums once for
tuned<00:06:42.570> for<00:06:42.870> low<00:06:43.110> mid<00:06:43.560> range<00:06:43.800> one<00:06:44.100> is<00:06:44.280> tuned<00:06:44.520> for

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
tuned for low mid range one is tuned for

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.180 
tuned for low mid range one is tuned for
high<00:06:46.050> Rindge<00:06:46.380> and<00:06:46.590> above<00:06:47.070> performance<00:06:49.190> so

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
high Rindge and above performance so

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.230 
high Rindge and above performance so
really<00:06:50.430> think<00:06:50.550> about<00:06:50.670> what<00:06:50.940> you're<00:06:51.030> going<00:06:51.180> to

really think about what you're going to

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.610 
really think about what you're going to
