 last but not least, the press conference has receded and very much in the 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.969

 meet us on the occasion of the away game away at VfL Wolfsburg for 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.789
 the Danish league 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.489
 There was something in Duisburg a few years ago 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.380
 the US offered Egypt and then a rentable one 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.620
 Mark I put the same around the only one in the house of 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.390
 «I Thiesen spo2 corresponds to these documents year 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.500
 around and directly the question 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.390
 Answer No. 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 he has already reached the 40 points 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.720
 what do you want now 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.679
 in Wolfsburg 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.080
 this is clear with 40 points 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.530
 in the quarterfinals 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.130
 m, however, would be 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.170
 take every game Norman Borlaug win every game 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.890
 shape successfully 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.630
 The offers under the seabed is also due to our good game 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.920
 to deliver if possible also directly in the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.990
 Table is due to lead them 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.930
 the guests then played 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.390
 Support from the ranks come 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.100
 the support of the reference list 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.760
 that's me personally per cent too so that actually always stop the same » 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.689
 drove and the major doses should Hansa Studios Europeans in the 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.480
 Responsibility will take over the coach and we are always ready 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.310
 Sample rooms to deliver good game 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.970
 Market has not been able to join him in team training the week 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.710
 integrate 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.390
 Therefore, the question does not arise yes it secures the percent Germany 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760
 it should be good now 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.210
 six weeks 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.810
 from the training company Bornheim 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.229
 if possible Robert is thinking should you have a week 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.570
 have trained that is not the case 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.430
 yes an exciting situation is always dangerous Mr. Linder it was 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.620
 Already exciting a the warnings of the Germans can save 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.869
 it is about we have been curious also was one noticed that percent at 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.939
 the end of the team is up to now 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:17.369
 Madness IT worked well again and again with this pressure around the and 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.310
 you can tell that 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.459
 Percent have with one or the other players already 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.239
 Also, what percentage of the battery is that that really a bit 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.059
 becomes more 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.139
 Nevertheless, I always warned against saying now 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.649
 this comfortable starting position 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.669
 is all the final step that's just not it 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.379
 to the crew shows me cleaning up in the last 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.709
 Biden by units 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.530
 that she accepts it that way and I think percent anyway athletic 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.299
 Claimed we wanted 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.099
 make a big game in the end also the many 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.039
 Ferencz to be there 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.979
 Satisfied satisfied hopes to send on the trip home so I go 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.049
 So I send the team after all in a match percent with the default 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.029
 really to deliver and great games percent 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.439
 We then always designed the results in such a way that you can handle them as well 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.349
 Could live 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.419
 I relax around rooms 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.850
 we have to be highly concentrated 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.289
 Yes but 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.489
 and basically always new relaxation must by EHEC 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.729
 when playing soccer normally hearing cramped game or anxious 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.089
 then this is flawed and mostly not hit percent topped
