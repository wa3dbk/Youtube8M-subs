00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.859
 9th edition the flash 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.749
 I think it comes to crown and just to stay and 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.269
 show our maturation as 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:54.339
 party inside the city of judge from outside the 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.960
 whole life has always been a city that 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.269
 always had an electronic scene is very 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.730
 Nice but some time this week she 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.159
 came getting lost and I said that 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.710
 We are talking, we need to talk. 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.380
 to have a party is to have a sound 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.390
 different something new that comes to show 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.100
 a different sound than 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.229
 out-of- court population that is already 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.689
 used to listen to and perform the 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.880
 party since the first edition called the 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.310
 corep that is the design in the party that years 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.259
 of residents of the party will enter with the 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.149
 people in this project and since then 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.030
 people have been practically doing 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.130
 arrow each time and this back and seven 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.560
 September and the party 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.829
 a year the party started the bias 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.799
 on top of who does not sack are the parties that 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.500
 happen on terraces of houses buildings 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.979
 and has now been adapted by a 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.399
 bid more peace and love in the garden and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.069
 Portuguese athlete of nature and so I 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.890
 I wanted to know first one was this 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.860
 maturation of the event that started 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.479
 as one of the top non-stop suites for 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.289
 few people and now has a 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.030
 much larger dimension as was the trajectory 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.590
 It was very cool when Victor opened 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.810
 the doors for us, we did not expect 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.580
 who was going to take this proportion 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.810
 only that the party was a very 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.819
 Nice and I believe that there in the 4th farm 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.090
 edition that had a meeting with the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.709
 bank and such and we decided that he already had 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.049
 The story I saw had its history 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.400
 at the front but we had to pass the 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.950
 party to another location 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.739
 we think it's bad and another even the super cool 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.780
 that there is a structure that I never 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.880
 I did not see much that religion and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.769
 so it opened the doors for us too 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.590
 very nice and is a space for our 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.380
 home to people in victory and went there the river 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.840
 show flash today make buy the paper 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.850
 independent saints and that they 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.980
 provide an interesting market 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.690
 the days that come from outside bring things 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.760
 to serve as a reference for the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.410
 people and also the public nor the people 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.959
 learn to deal with the things that the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.549
 audience also wants to hear us 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.200
 apply something new and also lose 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.410
 reference of the dance record I think it is 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.810
 Today the party is facing a referential 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.790
 not only the shapes in the whole region 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.760
 I'm going to put the electronic scene in 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.489
 evidence so far from this thing is 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.829
 clear it is independent as with 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.690
 a male has these colleagues through the 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.400
 next ban is to mess with them 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.470
 in this 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.299
 and it 's with a chair and pick up the microphone 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.909
 and one thing so I think it is 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.610
 important to be told is the following is the 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:29.700
 judge forano loves to speak ill of the city 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.010
 we love from outside we are the judge 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.769
 foranos with great pride and we want 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.079
 every passing day to do something for 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.359
 city do something nice 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.069
 we are from the inside yes but we are not 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.930
 we are better than anyone else 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.150
 then so that forane judge speaks 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.340
 bad of the city that speaks that does not have 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.900
 nothing that I know what I think before 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.280
 speak ill try to do something for the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.250
 town is what we're trying 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.069
 to do something different is some 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.829
 thing is substantial and something that 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.959
 that has concreteness that it is good that it is 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.730
 of quality is done by new ones. 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.209
 miners from the interior yes but with much 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.099
 proud 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.010
 that's the danger of touching 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.220
 here in the main of Jesus of Brazil 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.139

 So we're being inserted into the scene. 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.280
 Brazilian electronics back from the tables 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.560
