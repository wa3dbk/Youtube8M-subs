brush<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.189> work<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.620> 1920s<00:00:34.620> makeup

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
brush just to work that in 1920s makeup

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.830 
brush just to work that in 1920s makeup
tended<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.760> quite<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> lot<00:00:36.540> heavier

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
tended to be quite a lot heavier

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
tended to be quite a lot heavier
obviously<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.649> was<00:00:37.739> much<00:00:37.980> less<00:00:38.190> advanced<00:00:38.550> back

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
obviously it was much less advanced back

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.720 
obviously it was much less advanced back
in<00:00:39.000> those<00:00:39.149> days<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.920> know<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.520> want

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
in those days so you know really we want

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.119 
in those days so you know really we want
a<00:00:41.910> really<00:00:42.510> flawless<00:00:42.750> skin<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.829> because

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
a really flawless skin with this because

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.779 
a really flawless skin with this because
it<00:00:44.190> would<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.370> been<00:00:44.489> much<00:00:44.760> heavier<00:00:46.789> then

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it would have been much heavier then

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.279 
it would have been much heavier then
we're<00:00:47.940> thinking<00:00:48.270> back<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> silent

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
we're thinking back to like the silent

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.689 
we're thinking back to like the silent
movies<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> makeup<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:51.530> much<00:00:52.530> darker<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
movies so the makeup was much darker so

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.010 
movies so the makeup was much darker so
that<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> came<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> kind<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
that it came so that it kind of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.380 
that it came so that it kind of
translated<00:00:55.530> onto<00:00:55.980> film<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.180> black

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
translated onto film which is all black

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.040 
translated onto film which is all black
and<00:00:57.539> white<00:00:57.629> back<00:00:57.899> then<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:59.160> I<00:01:00.050> wouldn't

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and white back then so I wouldn't

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.330 
and white back then so I wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:01.140> say<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> most<00:01:02.070> feminine

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
necessarily say it's the most feminine

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.219 
necessarily say it's the most feminine
and<00:01:02.989> perfectly<00:01:03.989> applied<00:01:04.260> look<00:01:06.049> it's<00:01:07.049> really

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and perfectly applied look it's really

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
important part of this we need to do the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.130 
important part of this we need to do the
little<00:04:42.500> mouth<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:43.220> goes<00:04:44.000> can't<00:04:44.360> stand<00:04:44.810> quite

dolly actually it goes in here and then

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.850 
dolly actually it goes in here and then
it<00:04:51.280> goes<00:04:52.280> around<00:04:52.580> here<00:04:56.320> now<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.380> color<00:04:57.680> of

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860

sure<00:06:15.500> that<00:06:15.740> it's<00:06:15.890> blended<00:06:16.370> because<00:06:16.640> it<00:06:16.730> will

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
sure that it's blended because it will

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.910 
sure that it's blended because it will
really<00:06:17.090> stand<00:06:17.510> out

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.220 

did<00:06:21.920> you<00:06:22.040> ever<00:06:22.130> contour<00:06:22.550> your<00:06:22.670> face<00:06:22.960> is<00:06:23.960> it

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
because you don't like contour because

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.300 
because you don't like contour because
you<00:06:27.590> find<00:06:27.860> that<00:06:27.950> it's<00:06:28.160> harder<00:06:28.460> to<00:06:28.550> blend<00:06:28.790> or
