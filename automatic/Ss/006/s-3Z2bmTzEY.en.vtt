00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
very I was giving him just gallons and

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.380 
very I was giving him just gallons and
gallons<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.770> feed<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> was

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
gallons of feed and I was what I was

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.210 
gallons of feed and I was what I was
wanting<00:01:27.750> something<00:01:28.020> that's<00:01:28.350> gonna<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.829> easier

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
wanting something that's gonna be easier

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.770 
wanting something that's gonna be easier
for<00:01:29.250> him<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.520> digest<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
for him to digest because that's what I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
for him to digest because that's what I
figured<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.470> problem<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.950> he's<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.100> he's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
figured was the problem is he's not he's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.539 
figured was the problem is he's not he's
just<00:01:32.850> when<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> look<00:01:33.750> at<00:01:33.869> his<00:01:33.990> poop<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.250> right

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
just when I look at his poop it's right

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.600 
just when I look at his poop it's right
there<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:35.880> he's<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.270> even<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
there it's he's not even in it so the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
there it's he's not even in it so the
extruded<00:01:39.090> feet<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.659> more<00:01:40.229> easier<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.740> digest

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
extruded feet is more easier to digest

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
extruded feet is more easier to digest
when<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.520> put<00:01:41.759> him<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.000> within<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.600> first

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
when I put him on it within the first

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.929 
when I put him on it within the first
five<00:01:43.049> days

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
five days

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.450
