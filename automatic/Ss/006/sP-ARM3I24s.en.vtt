Gulf<00:01:55.910> and<00:01:56.180> look<00:01:56.390> at<00:01:56.510> storms<00:01:56.870> we<00:01:57.410> can<00:01:57.560> fly<00:01:57.740> all

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
Gulf and look at storms we can fly all

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.610 
Gulf and look at storms we can fly all
the<00:01:58.160> way<00:01:58.190> out<00:01:58.340> as<00:01:58.760> far<00:01:59.060> as<00:01:59.300> off<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.140> coast<00:02:00.530> of

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
the way out as far as off the coast of

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.740 
the way out as far as off the coast of
Africa<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.340> look<00:02:01.460> at<00:02:01.550> this<00:02:01.640> Aaron<00:02:01.940> Saharan<00:02:02.600> air

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
Africa to look at this Aaron Saharan air

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.650 
Africa to look at this Aaron Saharan air
layer<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.640> be<00:02:04.640> able<00:02:04.760> to<00:02:04.910> loiter<00:02:05.150> there<00:02:05.479> for

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
layer and be able to loiter there for

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.960 
layer and be able to loiter there for
almost<00:02:05.780> 10<00:02:06.110> hours<00:02:06.140> if<00:02:06.740> we<00:02:06.860> start<00:02:07.250> from<00:02:07.370> Wallops

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
almost 10 hours if we start from Wallops

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.600 
almost 10 hours if we start from Wallops
so<00:02:08.149> well<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.509> becomes<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.899> very<00:02:09.229> great<00:02:09.950> location

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
so well it becomes a very great location

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.520 
so well it becomes a very great location
for<00:02:10.640> us<00:02:10.790> to<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.030> able<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.300> reach<00:02:11.510> storms<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.140> to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
for us to be able to reach storms and to

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.990 
for us to be able to reach storms and to
be<00:02:12.620> able<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.980> have<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> maximum<00:02:13.760> amount<00:02:13.850> of

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
be able to have the maximum amount of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.809 
be able to have the maximum amount of
time<00:02:14.209> on<00:02:14.390> those<00:02:14.660> storms

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.910 

well<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.689> better<00:02:20.840> we<00:02:20.989> understand<00:02:21.560> them<00:02:21.799> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
well the better we understand them the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.069 
well the better we understand them the
better<00:02:22.099> we<00:02:22.400> can<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.819> prepared<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:23.329> if<00:02:23.629> we<00:02:23.749> have

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
better we can be prepared so if we have

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.989 
better we can be prepared so if we have
a<00:02:24.109> better<00:02:24.379> understanding<00:02:24.469> that<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.340> storm<00:02:25.969> is

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:25.999 
a better understanding that the storm is

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.259 
a better understanding that the storm is
going<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.239> intensify<00:02:26.480> or<00:02:27.230> as<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:27.499> said<00:02:27.680> not<00:02:28.269> then

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
going to intensify or as I said not then

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.910 
going to intensify or as I said not then
they<00:02:29.359> could<00:02:29.510> be<00:02:29.599> better<00:02:29.780> prepared<00:02:30.019> but<00:02:30.829> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
they could be better prepared but the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.440 
they could be better prepared but the
more<00:02:31.099> information<00:02:31.340> we<00:02:31.609> have<00:02:31.909> in<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.120> more<00:02:32.329> we

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
more information we have in the more we

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.390 
more information we have in the more we
understand<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.049> actual<00:02:33.230> dynamics<00:02:33.889> of<00:02:34.310> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
understand the actual dynamics of the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.220 
understand the actual dynamics of the
storm<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:35.120> better<00:02:35.329> we<00:02:35.540> can<00:02:35.569> help<00:02:35.840> people<00:02:36.139> be

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
storm the better we can help people be

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.620 
storm the better we can help people be
prepared
