00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.929 
so it's really nice overall I think like
turning<00:02:05.009> into<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.189> well<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.610> should<00:02:05.820> be

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
turning into a well if you should be

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.819 
turning into a well if you should be
able<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.509> all<00:02:06.659> times<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:07.350> lose<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> lot<00:02:07.799> of

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
able to at all times you lose a lot of

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.260 
able to at all times you lose a lot of
damage<00:02:08.160> when<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.489> turn<00:02:08.640> into<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.849> wolf<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
damage when you turn into a wolf you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.680 
damage when you turn into a wolf you
lose<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> range<00:02:10.500> spell<00:02:11.009> aspect<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:12.420> bet<00:02:12.599> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
lose the range spell aspect you bet you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.540 
lose the range spell aspect you bet you
gain<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> few<00:02:12.959> things<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.410> return<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> think

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
gain a few things in return so I think

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.559 
gain a few things in return so I think
you<00:02:14.730> should<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.910> always<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.180> able<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.420> turn

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
you should be always be able to turn

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.660 
you should be always be able to turn
back<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.930> forth<00:02:16.250> as<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.310> see<00:02:17.520> right<00:02:17.640> here

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
back and forth as you see right here

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.520 
back and forth as you see right here
