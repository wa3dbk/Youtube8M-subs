 sticks in the wheels of a bouquet garni 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.560

 such injustice and hop shit langoustines 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.709
 now we will try this is the 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.659
 first thing the guest had to have at home 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.720
 a little bit impressed and that he 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:11.290

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.299

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.419
 use what is found in this workshop 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.449
 in his kitchen what is 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:24.099
 extraordinary and we go with everything and 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:24.099
 shampoos just the shampoo 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:32.050

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.320
 almost heartbroken because it takes 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.280
 dismantle what you did a pleasure 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.280
 ephemeral makes it a 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.239
 it's a superb dish that makes you want 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.340
 to be eaten and that final is rather 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.090
 interesting to me there is protein 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.940
 and vegetables 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.530

 there is human and it's not a robot that 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.890
 was going to provide the steering wheel we it's 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.450
 brake a bit later a little earlier 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.980
 a little stronger a little less strong 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.090

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.730

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.349
