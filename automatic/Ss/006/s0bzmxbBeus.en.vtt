00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.880
This time we test Citroen DS5 with the 1.6-liter 200 hp engine.

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:09.234
This is turbocharged 4-cylinder engine.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:21.200
Cruise control is set to 94 km/h, which corresponds to 90 on DriftBox.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.440
After driving 5 km average fuel consumption is about 5 l/100km.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.480
Engine speed is about 2300 rpm on 6th gear.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.440
Air conditioning is turned on and set to 22 degrees.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:00.160
We are approaching the end of the measurement section, already passed 11 km and average fuel consumption is 5 l/100km at 90 km/h. 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.040
I will also show average fuel from a much longer distance.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.040
This result is achieved by a number of journalists who drove the car earlier.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:30.080
After driving 2164 km average fuel consumption is 8.9 l/100km.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:41.920
This time we drive 144 km/h which is equivalent to 140 km/h by DriftBox.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.600
The engine speed is 3500 rpm on 6th gear.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.280
Average fuel consumption after 5 kilometers is 9.2 l/100km.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:07.200
We finish our measurement. At 140 km/h after 10 kilometers trip average fuel consumption is 8.4 l/100km.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.120
And now burning on a cold motor. First start today.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.880
The first results of average consumption occurred after a few hundred meters.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.240
At the beginning it was about 20 l/100km.

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.589
Average fuel consumption after the first kilometer - 15.5 l/100km.

00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:26.194
Average fuel consumption after two kilometers - 11,2 l/100km.

00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:29.794
Average fuel consumption after three kilometers - 9,5 l/100km.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.234
Average fuel consumption after five kilometers - 7,5 l/100km.

00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:36.914
...even 7,4 :)
