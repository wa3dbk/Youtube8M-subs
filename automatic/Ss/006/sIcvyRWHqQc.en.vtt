00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
hey whats up guys today we're looking at

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.300 
hey whats up guys today we're looking at
a<00:00:15.000> mod<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.540> i<00:00:15.690> stumbled<00:00:16.020> upon<00:00:16.290> this<00:00:17.010> mod<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
a mod that i stumbled upon this mod is

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.089 
a mod that i stumbled upon this mod is
called<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.910> trampoline<00:00:18.480> mod<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.099> basically

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
called the trampoline mod and basically

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.730 
called the trampoline mod and basically
what<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> mod<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.849> is<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.390> adds<00:00:22.080> trampolines

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
what the mod is is it adds trampolines

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.100 
what the mod is is it adds trampolines
so<00:00:23.279> let's<00:00:23.460> get<00:00:23.580> started<00:00:23.730> um<00:00:24.180> let<00:00:24.840> me<00:00:24.869> show<00:00:25.050> you

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
so let's get started um let me show you

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.080 
so let's get started um let me show you
how<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.290> make<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.560> trampoline<00:00:26.009> first<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.939> do

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
how to make the trampoline first we do

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.050 
how to make the trampoline first we do
need<00:00:27.270> some<00:00:27.450> wool<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.960> some<00:00:28.500> iron<00:00:28.770> ingot<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
need some wool and some iron ingot so

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.759 
need some wool and some iron ingot so
let's<00:00:30.210> make<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.390> trampoline<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.320> put<00:00:31.500> wool

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
let's make a trampoline so we put wool

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.970 
let's make a trampoline so we put wool
here<00:00:32.390> here<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:34.019> put<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:34.199> ink<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.620> right

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
here here and you put your ink it right

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.799 
here here and you put your ink it right
there<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.519> got<00:00:35.699> yourself<00:00:35.820> some<00:00:36.629> low

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
there and you got yourself some low

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.869 
there and you got yourself some low
powered<00:00:37.230> trampolines<00:00:37.800> take<00:00:38.760> some<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.030> those

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
powered trampolines take some of those

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.939 
powered trampolines take some of those
over<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.150> and<00:00:42.360> then<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.780> put<00:00:43.019> our<00:00:43.230> low

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
over here and then we put our low

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.340 
over here and then we put our low
trampoline<00:00:44.580> like<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.140> got

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
trampoline like this and you got

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.240 
trampoline like this and you got
yourself<00:00:46.470> a<00:00:47.000> medium<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.650> I<00:00:49.650> do<00:00:49.710> need<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.100> make

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
yourself a medium and I do need to make

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.600 
yourself a medium and I do need to make
more<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.519> these<00:00:50.729> to<00:00:51.600> make<00:00:51.750> two<00:00:51.960> more<00:00:53.900> um<00:00:55.430> here<00:00:56.430> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
more of these to make two more um here I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.920 
more of these to make two more um here I
need<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.479> more<00:00:58.549> here<00:00:59.549> and<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.269> you<00:01:00.510> put<00:01:00.720> in

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
need one more here and then you put in

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
need one more here and then you put in
your<00:01:01.140> medium<00:01:01.610> trampolines<00:01:02.610> in<00:01:03.299> the<00:01:03.690> middle

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
your medium trampolines in the middle

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.950 
your medium trampolines in the middle
like<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> got<00:01:05.129> yourself<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
like this and you got yourself a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.100 
like this and you got yourself a
high-powered<00:01:06.960> trampoline<00:01:07.799> put<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> there

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
high-powered trampoline put that there

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.929 
high-powered trampoline put that there
okay<00:01:10.110> now<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.530> our<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:11.280> low<00:01:11.909> medium

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
okay now that we have our on low medium

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.390 
okay now that we have our on low medium
and<00:01:12.570> high<00:01:12.659> when<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> trampoline

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and high when you make the trampoline

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.180 
and high when you make the trampoline
rim<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.510> make<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.840> rim<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.290> put<00:01:16.560> wall

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
rim and to make the rim you put wall

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.800 
rim and to make the rim you put wall
like<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.910> and<00:01:18.350> then<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.470> put<00:01:19.620> a<00:01:19.830> low<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
like this and then you put a low in the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
like this and then you put a low in the
middle<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.650> got<00:01:22.800> yourself<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
middle and then you got yourself a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.650 
middle and then you got yourself a
trampoline<00:01:23.730> rim<00:01:23.940> this<00:01:24.120> is<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.480> outside

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
trampoline rim this is what the outside

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.780 
trampoline rim this is what the outside
of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> trampoline<00:01:25.800> this<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.160> what<00:01:26.370> prevents

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
of the trampoline this is what prevents

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.890 
of the trampoline this is what prevents
you from<00:01:26.910> fall<00:01:27.390> damage<00:01:28.010> put<00:01:29.010> that<00:01:29.190> there<00:01:29.900> exit

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you from fall damage put that there exit

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.200 
you from fall damage put that there exit
this<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.350> let's<00:01:31.650> make<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:32.040> trampoline<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.790> do

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this and let's make a trampoline I do

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.150 
this and let's make a trampoline I do
need<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.480> fence<00:01:33.870> so<00:01:34.380> let<00:01:34.650> me<00:01:34.770> get<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.130> fence<00:01:35.580> um

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
need a fence so let me get a fence um

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.180 
need a fence so let me get a fence um
here<00:01:38.160> we<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.640> put<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.630> up<00:01:40.380> put<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.920> there

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
here we go put that up put that there

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.380 
here we go put that up put that there
there<00:01:42.120> there<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:43.760> and<00:01:44.760> then<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.909> put<00:01:45.120> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
there there there and then you put the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.960 
there there there and then you put the
rim<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.230> the<00:01:46.260> side<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.820> this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.820 

side<00:01:55.360> I've<00:01:55.930> made<00:01:56.230> a<00:01:58.020> demonstration<00:01:59.020> but<00:01:59.680> we'll

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
side I've made a demonstration but we'll

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.180 
side I've made a demonstration but we'll
get<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.010> that<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:01.330> sec<00:02:01.690> um<00:02:02.020> put<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.980> there

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
get to that in a sec um put that there

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.360 
get to that in a sec um put that there
and<00:02:03.370> then<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:03.940> either<00:02:04.090> put<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.750> UM<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.370> low

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
and then you either put the UM the low

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.840 
and then you either put the UM the low
the<00:02:07.270> medium<00:02:07.660> or<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.960> high<00:02:08.590> whichever<00:02:09.550> one<00:02:09.729> you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
the medium or the high whichever one you

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.370 
the medium or the high whichever one you
want<00:02:09.940> in<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.240> middle<00:02:10.540> so<00:02:10.960> I'm<00:02:11.050> going<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.230> put

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
want in the middle so I'm going to put

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.460 
want in the middle so I'm going to put
the<00:02:11.530> high<00:02:12.840> trampoline<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.050> then<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.290> just

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
the high trampoline and then you just

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.510 
the high trampoline and then you just
basically<00:02:14.710> jump<00:02:15.520> oh<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.930> then<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.560> hold<00:02:21.400> down

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
basically jump oh and then you hold down

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.370 
basically jump oh and then you hold down
the<00:02:21.700> shift<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.270> then<00:02:22.690> he<00:02:22.870> won't<00:02:22.990> be<00:02:23.140> able<00:02:23.200> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
the shift and then he won't be able to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.670 
the shift and then he won't be able to
jump<00:02:23.590> anymore<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.160> I'm<00:02:25.000> up<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.540> set<00:02:26.470> up<00:02:26.560> a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
jump anymore and I'm up I set up a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.250 
jump anymore and I'm up I set up a
demonstration<00:02:26.890> here<00:02:27.840> with<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> couple<00:02:29.200> of

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
demonstration here with a couple of

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.990 
demonstration here with a couple of
friends<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.620> mine<00:02:29.800> they're<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.430> having<00:02:30.820> a

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
friends of mine they're just having a
