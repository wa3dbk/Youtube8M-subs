00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
we want for them to be able to do in

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
we want for them to be able to do in
order<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> successful<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.410> they<00:00:58.530> live<00:00:58.770> up

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
order to be successful and they live up

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.069 
order to be successful and they live up
to<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.100> I've<00:01:00.000> seen<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> lot<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.719> positive

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
to that I've seen a lot of positive

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
to that I've seen a lot of positive
effects<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.649> kids<00:01:01.890> i<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> behaviors

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
effects the kids i think the behaviors

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.490 
effects the kids i think the behaviors
have<00:01:03.390> improved<00:01:05.030> it's<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.630> calmer<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
have improved it's it's calmer in the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.570 
have improved it's it's calmer in the
hallways<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> walk<00:01:08.340> through<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
hallways when you walk through the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.120 
hallways when you walk through the
hallways<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.659> academic<00:01:10.290> scores<00:01:10.530> have

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
hallways I think academic scores have

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.060 
hallways I think academic scores have
increased<00:01:11.189> also<00:01:12.290> because<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> behaviors<00:01:13.860> are

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
increased also because the behaviors are

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.800 
increased also because the behaviors are
better<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> classroom<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.119> well<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.659> it's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
better in the classroom as well so it's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
better in the classroom as well so it's
it<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.409> helped<00:01:16.650> produce<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.040> better<00:01:17.130> learning

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it it's helped produce a better learning

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.359 
it it's helped produce a better learning
environment<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:18.390> aspect<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.259> our<00:01:19.409> PBIS<00:01:20.009> plan

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
environment one aspect of our PBIS plan

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.480 
environment one aspect of our PBIS plan

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
is to use a reward system which is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.719 
is to use a reward system which is
called<00:01:24.030> pride<00:01:24.360> bucks<00:01:24.740> students<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.430> are

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
called pride bucks students if they are

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.399

doing the right thing then they have
positive<00:01:29.070> reinforcement<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.909> they<00:01:30.090> can

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
positive reinforcement and they can

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
positive reinforcement and they can
trade<00:01:30.540> them<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:30.869> something<00:01:31.770> tangible
