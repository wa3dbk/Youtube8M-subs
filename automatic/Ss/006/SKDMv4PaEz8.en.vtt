and use worldedit i know i've used
worldedit<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.729> couple<00:01:06.030> times<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:07.229> i<00:01:07.290> say<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
worldedit a couple times when i say a

worldedit a couple times when i say a
couple<00:01:07.590> times<00:01:07.770> i<00:01:07.950> mean<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> lot<00:01:08.299> mainly<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
couple times i mean a lot mainly for the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
couple times i mean a lot mainly for the
floors<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:11.010> buildings<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.580> why<00:01:11.760> i

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
floors of the buildings is why i

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.960 
floors of the buildings is why i
actually<00:01:12.270> did<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.549> floors<00:01:14.790> can

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
actually did that because the floors can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.660 
actually did that because the floors can
be<00:01:15.000> very<00:01:15.810> repetitive<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.740> annoying<00:01:17.100> so

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
be very repetitive and very annoying so

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.929 
be very repetitive and very annoying so
i<00:01:17.729> use<00:01:18.060> worldedit<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.979> basically<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.759> make

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
i use worldedit to basically just make

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.179 
i use worldedit to basically just make
my<00:01:21.060> own<00:01:21.090> stuff<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.860> really<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.040> just

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
my own stuff so like really if I just

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.749 
my own stuff so like really if I just
wanted<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.549> boom<00:01:24.350> boom<00:01:25.880> it's<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.299> oh

is<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:32.369> change

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
is that one there we go I can change

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.179 
is that one there we go I can change
that<00:01:32.840> but<00:01:33.840> yeah<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.409> obviously<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.100> can

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
that but yeah so you obviously you can

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.410 
that but yeah so you obviously you can
use<00:01:35.310> worldedit<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.390> using

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
use worldedit as you can see I'm using

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.990 
use worldedit as you can see I'm using
it<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> there's<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> can

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it so there's this so much more you can

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.929 
it so there's this so much more you can
do<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.650> PC<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.549> even

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
do now now that's on PC you can even

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.260 
do now now that's on PC you can even
expand<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.930> basically<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
expand it so basically it's the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.249 
expand it so basically it's the
possibilities<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.299> endless<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
possibilities are endless really so you

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.710 
possibilities are endless really so you
can<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.950> much<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:48.360> hopefully

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
can do so much more and then hopefully

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.350 
can do so much more and then hopefully
I'm<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.439> believe<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:49.920> move<00:01:50.310> all<00:01:50.579> Mets<00:01:51.090> from

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
I'm I believe we can move all Mets from

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.630

ads I plan on getting uh what's the mod
shaders<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:17.800> think<00:02:18.010> it's<00:02:18.130> what<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.640> worry

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
shaders I think it's what it is to worry

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.190 
shaders I think it's what it is to worry
like<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.090> bushes<00:02:19.420> actually<00:02:19.720> move<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.110> all

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
like the bushes actually move and all

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.500 
like the bushes actually move and all
that<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> actually<00:02:21.880> planning<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.210> get<00:02:22.300> all

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
that so I actually planning to get all

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.030 
that so I actually planning to get all
that<00:02:22.690> bagent<00:02:23.410> see<00:02:23.500> there's<00:02:23.680> actually<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.010> lot

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
that bagent see there's actually a lot

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.100 
that bagent see there's actually a lot
more<00:02:24.190> force<00:02:24.700> than<00:02:24.790> all<00:02:25.060> these<00:02:25.240> buildings<00:02:25.510> so

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
more force than all these buildings so

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.070 
more force than all these buildings so
it's<00:02:26.890> getting<00:02:27.160> there<00:02:27.190> slowly<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:28.090> do<00:02:28.630> plan<00:02:29.020> on

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
it's getting there slowly I do plan on

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.950 
it's getting there slowly I do plan on
actually<00:02:29.770> making<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.790> into<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.150> server

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
actually making this into a server

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.200 
actually making this into a server
eventually<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.220> hopefully<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.090> can

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
eventually so hopefully that can

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.460 
eventually so hopefully that can
actually<00:02:34.360> happen<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:36.070> yeah<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:37.210> is<00:02:37.480> new

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
actually happen so yeah this is new

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.820 
actually happen so yeah this is new
field<00:02:38.710> on<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.880> PC<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.050> think<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.380> looks<00:02:41.560> very

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
field on on PC I think it looks very

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.550 
field on on PC I think it looks very
good<00:02:42.580> it's<00:02:43.180> making<00:02:43.720> my<00:02:43.870> life<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.380> much<00:02:44.440> easier

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
good it's making my life so much easier

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.040 
good it's making my life so much easier
so<00:02:45.370> I'm<00:02:45.700> extremely<00:02:46.240> happy<00:02:46.420> with<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.870> I'm

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
so I'm extremely happy with it I'm

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.720 
so I'm extremely happy with it I'm
figuring<00:02:47.590> out<00:02:47.650> how<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.830> play<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.190> PC<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.550> little

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
figuring out how to play on PC a little

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.450 
figuring out how to play on PC a little
bit<00:02:48.820> more<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.290> hopefully<00:02:50.650> by<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.980> next<00:02:51.310> update

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
bit more so hopefully by the next update

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.030 
bit more so hopefully by the next update
all<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.780> buildings<00:02:53.170> will<00:02:53.320> actually<00:02:53.710> be<00:02:53.800> done

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
all the buildings will actually be done

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.860 
all the buildings will actually be done
when<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.280> comes<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.550> floors<00:02:54.850> then<00:02:55.570> maybe<00:02:55.750> we

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
when it comes to floors then maybe we

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.960 
when it comes to floors then maybe we
can<00:02:56.080> actually<00:02:56.260> start<00:02:56.530> making<00:02:56.890> just<00:02:57.520> new<00:02:57.730> ones

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
can actually start making just new ones

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.420 
can actually start making just new ones
and<00:02:58.360> new<00:02:58.510> buildings<00:02:58.690> expanding<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.740> then

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
and new buildings expanding it and then

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.720 
and new buildings expanding it and then
once<00:03:00.730> we<00:03:00.940> export<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.660> over<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.080> one<00:03:02.320> we<00:03:03.310> can

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
once we export it over to the one we can

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.510 
once we export it over to the one we can
even<00:03:03.970> grow<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.240> from<00:03:04.420> there<00:03:04.570> as<00:03:04.690> well<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.520> thank
