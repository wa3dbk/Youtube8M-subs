back<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.209> again<00:03:34.449> punch<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.959> body<00:03:35.079> weak<00:03:35.980> him

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
back in again punch to the body weak him

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.780 
back in again punch to the body weak him
down<00:03:36.340> first

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
down first

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.240 
down first
now<00:03:36.969> ship<00:03:37.269> out<00:03:37.419> away<00:03:37.629> and<00:03:37.930> then<00:03:38.739> in<00:03:38.889> control

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
now ship out away and then in control

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.699 
now ship out away and then in control
this<00:03:39.760> is<00:03:39.909> important<00:03:40.419> make<00:03:40.750> sure<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:41.049> stand<00:03:41.530> out

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
this is important make sure in stand out

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.390 
this is important make sure in stand out
let's<00:03:41.889> go<00:03:41.979> one<00:03:42.159> more<00:03:42.189> round<00:03:42.430> faster<00:03:47.280> get<00:03:48.280> in

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
let's go one more round faster get in

00:03:48.400 --> 00:04:05.190 
let's go one more round faster get in
over<00:03:48.519> in<00:03:48.810> get<00:03:49.810> put<00:03:50.019> him<00:03:50.139> out<00:03:50.229> away<00:03:52.109> go

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.670 

okay<00:04:06.200> enough<00:04:06.980> that's<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.939> idea<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.620> lot<00:04:09.620> of

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
okay enough that's the idea a lot of

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.709 
okay enough that's the idea a lot of
time<00:04:10.010> when<00:04:10.219> you<00:04:10.250> do<00:04:10.489> this<00:04:10.670> look<00:04:10.939> very<00:04:11.180> simple

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
time when you do this look very simple

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.050 
time when you do this look very simple
basic<00:04:11.930> movement<00:04:12.530> is<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:12.799> very<00:04:13.040> basic<00:04:13.879> of

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
basic movement is this very basic of

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.270 
basic movement is this very basic of

the body if you understand the technique
well<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.350> can<00:04:18.500> shift<00:04:18.769> weight<00:04:18.979> you<00:04:19.130> understand

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
well you can shift weight you understand

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.430 
well you can shift weight you understand
it<00:04:19.669> well<00:04:19.910> you<00:04:20.090> can<00:04:20.239> know<00:04:20.359> what<00:04:20.539> to<00:04:20.570> do<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:21.259> is

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
it well you can know what to do this is

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.990 
it well you can know what to do this is
important<00:04:21.979> to<00:04:22.039> understand<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.490> otherwise<00:04:22.940> I

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
important to understand that otherwise I

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.460 
important to understand that otherwise I
wouldn't<00:04:23.210> have<00:04:23.270> many<00:04:23.600> people<00:04:23.990> coming<00:04:24.229> attack

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
wouldn't have many people coming attack
