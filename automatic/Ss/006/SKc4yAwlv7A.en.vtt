00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
bit of a painful process but I'm hoping

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.450 
bit of a painful process but I'm hoping
that<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.140> doing<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.650> I'm<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.190> inspire

you<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:42.390> start<00:01:42.600> going<00:01:42.870> through<00:01:42.900> your<00:01:43.350> closet

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you to start going through your closet

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.040

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
the way this closet is set up i suspect

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.200 
the way this closet is set up i suspect
that<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.530> will<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.920> about<00:01:47.190> half<00:01:47.610> by<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:47.970> time

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that we will be about half by the time

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
this I look out and I still think well

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.980 
this I look out and I still think well
that's<00:02:35.580> kind<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.940> cute<00:02:36.120> but<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.420> I'm<00:02:36.540> going<00:02:36.870> by

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
that's kind of cute but if I'm going by

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.920 
that's kind of cute but if I'm going by
one<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.500> my<00:02:37.710> theories<00:02:38.490> which<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.120> if<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.630> didn't

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
one of my theories which is if I didn't

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.470 
one of my theories which is if I didn't
wear<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:41.010> than<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.220> year<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.880> don't

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
wear it in more than a year and I don't

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.460 
wear it in more than a year and I don't
think<00:02:42.660> I've<00:02:42.750> actually<00:02:42.900> worn<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.350> in

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
think I've actually worn this in

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.590 
think I've actually worn this in
probably<00:02:43.980> two<00:02:44.160> years<00:02:44.190> then<00:02:45.030> I'm<00:02:45.210> getting<00:02:45.510> rid

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
probably two years then I'm getting rid

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.370 
probably two years then I'm getting rid
of<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.780> right

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.290

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
one of those things I'm just gonna have

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.820 
one of those things I'm just gonna have
to<00:04:01.900> wing<00:04:02.050> it<00:04:02.940> should<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:04.000> keep<00:04:04.209> this<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.830> haven't

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
to wing it should I keep this I haven't

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.619 
to wing it should I keep this I haven't
worn<00:04:06.069> this<00:04:06.430> in<00:04:08.010> easily<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.129> few<00:04:09.430> years<00:04:09.730> but<00:04:10.569> I

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
worn this in easily a few years but I

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.910 
worn this in easily a few years but I
think<00:04:10.900> I've<00:04:10.989> hung<00:04:11.170> on<00:04:11.349> to<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.560> because<00:04:11.799> it

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
think I've hung on to it because it

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.110 
think I've hung on to it because it
feels<00:04:12.069> like<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.340> staple<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:14.610> like<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.760> could<00:04:15.970> go

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
feels like a staple and like it could go

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.740 
feels like a staple and like it could go
under<00:04:16.389> anything<00:04:17.970> but<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.000> now<00:04:19.209> see<00:04:19.479> that<00:04:19.510> it's

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
under anything but I now see that it's

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.870 
under anything but I now see that it's
the<00:04:19.900> wrong<00:04:20.079> size<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:21.220> I'm<00:04:21.340> gonna<00:04:21.459> have<00:04:21.699> to<00:04:21.850> say
