actually started part of my hair so that
I<00:01:09.830> can<00:01:10.130> use<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.590> curl<00:01:12.970> boosting<00:01:13.970> jelly<00:01:14.270> which

I can use the curl boosting jelly which
has<00:01:15.350> like<00:01:15.650> a<00:01:16.390> jelly<00:01:17.530> it's<00:01:18.530> not<00:01:18.740> really<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.979> jelly

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
has like a jelly it's not really a jelly

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.650 
has like a jelly it's not really a jelly
I<00:01:19.610> don't<00:01:19.850> know<00:01:19.940> how<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.120> explain<00:01:20.450> the

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
I don't know how to explain the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.110 
I don't know how to explain the
consistency<00:01:21.470> it's<00:01:21.950> not<00:01:22.160> slimy<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:23.600> it's<00:01:23.810> not

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
consistency it's not slimy but it's not

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.030 
consistency it's not slimy but it's not
hard<00:01:26.120> either<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.170> know<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.650> if<00:01:27.800> you<00:01:27.890> were

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
hard either but I know that if you were

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.219 
hard either but I know that if you were
to<00:01:28.130> leave<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:28.460> out<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.880> probably<00:01:29.150> would<00:01:29.930> dry<00:01:30.200> up

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
to leave it out it probably would dry up

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.250 
to leave it out it probably would dry up
so<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:31.100> applied<00:01:31.760> that<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.270> my<00:01:32.300> hair<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:32.930> I<00:01:33.050> use

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
so I applied that to my hair and I use

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.350 
so I applied that to my hair and I use
my<00:01:33.470> tangle<00:01:33.830> teezer<00:01:34.040> here<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.700> go<00:01:35.060> ahead<00:01:35.119> and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
my tangle teezer here to go ahead and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.790 
my tangle teezer here to go ahead and
get<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.570> rest<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.840> those<00:01:35.930> tangles<00:01:36.380> out<00:01:36.500> and

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
get the rest of those tangles out and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.550 
get the rest of those tangles out and
then<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.369> started<00:01:37.970> twisting<00:01:38.360> my<00:01:38.450> hair<00:01:38.479> as<00:01:38.990> I

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
then I started twisting my hair as I

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.650 
then I started twisting my hair as I
normally<00:01:39.619> would<00:01:40.220> with<00:01:40.670> any<00:01:40.940> other<00:01:41.210> product

and<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:25.280> am<00:02:26.200> clearly<00:02:27.730> not<00:02:28.730> going<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.030> leave<00:02:29.300> them

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
and I am clearly not going to leave them

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.690 
and I am clearly not going to leave them
like<00:02:29.600> this<00:02:29.780> I'm<00:02:30.470> going<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.920> separate<00:02:31.280> them<00:02:31.400> so

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
like this I'm going to separate them so

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.890 
like this I'm going to separate them so
I'm<00:02:32.000> separating<00:02:32.599> my<00:02:32.690> twists<00:02:32.990> here<00:02:33.520> about

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
I'm separating my twists here about

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.480 
I'm separating my twists here about
three<00:02:35.900> or<00:02:35.990> four<00:02:36.200> times<00:02:36.380> each<00:02:36.860> side<00:02:37.250> of<00:02:37.400> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
three or four times each side of the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.550 
three or four times each side of the
twist<00:02:37.819> again<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:38.599> let<00:02:38.870> my<00:02:38.959> hair<00:02:39.140> naturally

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
twist again I let my hair naturally

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.740 
twist again I let my hair naturally
separate<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.040> don't<00:02:40.340> really<00:02:40.550> force<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.450> as

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
separate I don't really force it so as

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.350 
separate I don't really force it so as
you<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:42.620> see<00:02:42.680> here<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:43.430> pretty<00:02:44.209> much

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
you can see here it is pretty much

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.059 
you can see here it is pretty much
completely<00:02:44.720> separated<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.500> still<00:02:45.770> have<00:02:45.920> some

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
completely separated I still have some

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.920 
completely separated I still have some
parts<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.430> are<00:02:46.550> not<00:02:46.880> all<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.300> way<00:02:47.360> separated

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
parts that are not all the way separated

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.330 
parts that are not all the way separated
because<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.290> wanted<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.770> still<00:02:49.010> have<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.160> little

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
because I wanted to still have a little

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.430 
because I wanted to still have a little
bit<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.580> definition<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:50.240> my<00:02:50.330> hair<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:50.840> I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
bit of definition in my hair and I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.010 
bit of definition in my hair and I
really<00:02:51.470> really<00:02:52.400> really<00:02:52.849> like<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.510> way<00:02:53.660> that

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
really really really like the way that

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.190 
really really really like the way that
it<00:02:54.290> turned<00:02:54.560> out<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:55.069> looks<00:02:55.220> really<00:02:55.550> good<00:02:56.200> and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
it turned out it looks really good and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.740 
it turned out it looks really good and
but<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.770> course<00:02:58.099> I<00:02:58.370> had<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.880> pick<00:02:59.330> my<00:02:59.480> hair<00:02:59.720> out

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
but of course I had to pick my hair out

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.589 
but of course I had to pick my hair out
just<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:00.890> could<00:03:01.069> disguise<00:03:01.700> my<00:03:01.970> sides<00:03:02.239> I

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
just so that I could disguise my sides I

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.270 
just so that I could disguise my sides I
actually<00:03:03.200> didn't<00:03:03.560> want<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.770> pin<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.040> up<00:03:04.130> this

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
actually didn't want to pin it up this

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.550 
actually didn't want to pin it up this
time<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:04.550> wanted<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.060> wear<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.330> out<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:06.410> wear

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
time I wanted to wear it out so to wear

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.440 
time I wanted to wear it out so to wear
it<00:03:06.650> fuller<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.310> pick<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.670> out<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.000> they<00:03:08.120> can<00:03:08.300> have

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
it fuller I pick it out so they can have

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.940 
it fuller I pick it out so they can have
a<00:03:08.480> little<00:03:08.630> bit<00:03:08.750> more<00:03:08.959> volume<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.680> can't

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
a little bit more volume and you can't

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
a little bit more volume and you can't
tell<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.190> I'm<00:03:10.460> missing

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
tell that I'm missing

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.510 
tell that I'm missing
a<00:03:11.150> lot<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.840> volume<00:03:12.050> on

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.660 

and<00:03:16.520> I<00:03:17.360> am<00:03:17.540> finished<00:03:17.990> it's<00:03:18.770> not<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.280> best

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
and I am finished it's not the best

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.080 
and I am finished it's not the best
twist<00:03:20.300> out<00:03:20.480> I've<00:03:20.660> ever<00:03:20.840> had<00:03:21.140> but<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.620> do<00:03:22.090> like

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
twist out I've ever had but I do like

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.880 
twist out I've ever had but I do like
the<00:03:23.270> results<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.960> I'll<00:03:24.230> play<00:03:24.530> with<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.830> a

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
the results and I'll play with it a

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.560 
the results and I'll play with it a
little<00:03:25.010> bit<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:27.760> decided<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:28.880> wearing<00:03:29.300> it<00:03:29.390> out

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
little bit I decided that wearing it out

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.900 
little bit I decided that wearing it out
was<00:03:29.840> not<00:03:30.110> an<00:03:30.260> option<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:30.920> pinned<00:03:31.520> it<00:03:31.610> up<00:03:31.760> with

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
was not an option so I pinned it up with

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.360 
was not an option so I pinned it up with
a<00:03:31.940> cute<00:03:32.240> little<00:03:32.270> scarf<00:03:32.890> thanks<00:03:33.890> for<00:03:34.040> watching
