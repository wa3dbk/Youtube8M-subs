 comics to think of new readers of

 the meat universe with a preface 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.320
 presenting the main characters and 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.760
 a chronology that traces the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.920
 major events that took place in 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.600
 this universe before seen the animated series 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.400
 is a not insignificant addition to read the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.350
 comics without being obligatory 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.239
 since if the first two volumes of the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.740
 comics batman beyond was in great 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.360
 part that an adaptation of the series 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.290
 animated is published at the same time as 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.670
 dissemination of the latter 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.500
 it's very different when the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.850
 publication resumes in 2010 with the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.310
 episodes contained in this volume the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.380
 return of silence the annual number 4 of 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.359
 superman batman present at the very beginning of 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.039
 volume and published a month before the return 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.289
 comics batman beyond goes elsewhere 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.729
 serve to mark this change side 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.259
 scenario paul ellis offers us a 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.030
 relatively classic history but 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.439
 interesting and well constructed which has the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.630
 deserves to involve quite a lot of 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.950
 important characters and known that 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.149
 will allow neophyte readers to 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.670
 to be able to understand a little more 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.920
 easily their evolution next to city or 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.569
 had too polite scriptwriter transcribed 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.280
 also very good bruce wayne relationship 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.929
 terry mcginnis and for those who saw 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.579
 the animated series we feel the change of 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.770
 time this one becoming more mature and 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.179
 darker a good episode that brings 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.340
 really good the new direction 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.810
 taken by the comics then it's adam 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.219
 beach m taking over the script 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.959
 for both stories the return of 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.490
 silence and industrial revolution 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.749
 my opinion is basically the same for 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.090
 the two arts that I really have a lot 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.740
 loved in the first one that takes place a 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.299
 year after the feature turned on the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.279
 return of the joker who is passing this 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.479
 word - an excellent animated I took 

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:08.979
 a lot of fun to find the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.880
 elements of batman mythology in 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.010
 their bio version 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.930
 the second him trade and me bound 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.700
 only to this universe what can 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.930
 to be make it a little less accessible 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.260
 in his references for the new 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.819
 readers 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.349
 luckily that does not prevent 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.849
 understand to follow and appreciate 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.260
 the story 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.340
 the stories outside of that are at each 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.800
 very well rhythmic 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.750
 a lot of suspense action once 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.730
 benches and especially I loved 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.750
 discover the evolution of relationships 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.960
 within the bad family 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.980
 in this special atmosphere 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.120
 after no need to worry about 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.340
 those who discover the universe 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.170
 of batman beyond this new status quo and 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.550
 explain as and when the volume and 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.720
 when we reach the end we only have one 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.350
 only desire is to know what will 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.300
 to arrive then 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.800
 side drawing for the annual first 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.660
 I found the style of renato guen is 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.370
 quite appropriate the work of 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.840
 the artist is doing very well this tone of your 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.210
 nature the characters have some 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.380
 strong expressions and mark even if of 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.570
 blow I sometimes find them a little too much 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.100
 frozen on some boxes cutting 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.320
 is fairly classic but remains very 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.120
 effective and never breaks the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.410
 rhythm of the story 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.420
 as for ryan benjamines who ensures the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.010
 almost the entire volume for me his 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.930
 work is also really successful 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.100
 his style quite few details and 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.840
 especially in terms of decorations and 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.640
 backgrounds further accentuates the 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.530
 expressions and dynamics very neat 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.970
 of his characters in reverse time 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.410
 stories I found we were staying 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.970
 in a graphic style in the end enough 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.930
 close to the original animated ci is 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.330
 really not to displease me 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.620
 cutting is also classic with 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.030
 few full pages that were there 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.600
 often used for the end click 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.610
 a chapter 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.620
 but without being overloaded with 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.790
 unnecessary dialogues batista crisis and 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.290
 bordeaux tip six cases are in charge 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.850
 of two chapters epilogue 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.050
 but containing only a few elements of the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.610
 main narrative but who come 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.150
 develop the background of two others 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.040
 characters 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.330
 so I was not bothered by the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.350
 change of style with benyamin who 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.760
 is still quite important 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.350
 I find that it highlights this 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.840
 sensation of following the narrative comes to 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.520
 our protagonist rather successful so 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.600
 all the same, it's still quite short and the 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.150
 two artists propose boards 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.440
 really beautiful and well worked and 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.209
 finally for my greatest pleasure I 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.550
 found the beautiful blankets of 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.620
 batman beyond all drawn by dustin 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.209
 nguyen except that of the number 1 drawn 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.520
 by john williams iii but just as 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.440
 sublime to conclude according to me batman 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.700
 beyond volume 1 the return of silence is 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.709
 a very good reading 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.450
 even before I had seen the cartoon 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.130
 the preface of urban and the annual of 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.209
 superman batman gives enough 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.040
 keys to be able to appreciate 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.690
 history and the protagonists we have 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.760
 right to two bows well written in a 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.200
 quite dark atmosphere the character of the 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.430
 different characters and the relationship 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.100
 that they have between them are important 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.510
 and their interest all that with a style 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.320
 graph in the whole pretty close 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.810
 cartoon 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.100
 simple but very dynamic that you 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.000
 so be fans of Batman cartoon 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.780
 beyond whether or not you have 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.820
 tension to follow the publication 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.800
 next series of future aids or 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.720
 No, I invite you to discover the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.650
 adventures of terry mcginnis you should 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.650
 have a great time
