00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 as they come in no time from this 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.189
 a wonderful aromatic crouch 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.070
 delicious pesto can prepare 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:20.100
 with the help of foreign mixas I show that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:22.650
 they have them now 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.170
 seen in many gardens 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.109
 read on quite a few and that is that 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.550
 the garlic's rough that's actually 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.279
 not at all with the truncheon in front of vanins 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.149
 but she smells it the same way she is quite 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.219
 finely aromatic and has just this 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.140
 typical garlic taste but quite 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.510
 mild yes and from this wonderful 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.760
 garlic's rough I do today completely 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.090
 quickly a little pesto with the help of my 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.860
 little friend here and it is great 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.340
 that's just what I'm telling them now 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.590
 very shortly after a note of nimble 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.949
 mix on the rocks countries think so 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.140
 with the proven plastic containers 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.170
 and now there is one too 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.869
 glass containers are super handy 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.360
 because there is an adapter for it 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.650
 fits on every glass 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.240
 thus you can directly in the glass 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:21.650
 use and you can then use the glasses 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.650
 but also screw it right away and even 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.520
 use as a reservoir completely 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.010
 practically so that's really fun 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.170
 and that's why I thought ready 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.360
 today with these new glasses the pesto 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.630
 So I need my first 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.250
 adapter I screw on then 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.660
 I need to do nothing more 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.160
 yes and now I just have mine 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.720
 ingredients directly here 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:53.160
 I have this wonderful one here 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:55.410
 garlic's rough comes in there 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.780
 I'll take that first 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.020
 the solid ingredients I have now 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.180
 sunflower seeds 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.170
 But you can also do something completely different 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.880
 make it clean 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.920
 I get almonds to try them too 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.920
 sometimes a variant with walnuts is also 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.940
 very tasty or with pumpkin seeds because 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.940
 Of course it should not be missing 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.830
 and very important olive oil 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.150
 yes and finally comes the good rough 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.750
 The garlic robbery can be neat 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.750
 what is it? 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.190
 make sure you have the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.530
 garlic 's not necessarily rough 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.770
 gather roadside because they know yes 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.980
 the exhaust and it is also very important 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.810
 Rinse well are open for it 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.810
 sometimes like some insects in it 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.480
 so 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.740
 neatly fits in something 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.400
 As you can see, I use the clubs 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:20.530
 hood with the flowers because they are too 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:22.360
 very delicious aromatic good and now who 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.819
 lust can still half 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.379
 grab the garlic clove if you 're more likely to 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.930
 aromatic pesto then want to leave 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:38.379
 they just go away like that and now it is 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.159
 small fly with sand edge i would 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.159
 Let's go 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.729
 that was it 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:20.690
 that goes quickly or look that 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.250
 Smells and I can now directly 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.270
 I produce in large quantities 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.870
 have enough praise left and packs that 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.830
 right in a small bubble the 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.960
 to be included and so I have 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.600
 always a good supply of delicious 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.100
 pesto in the fridge 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.840
 So I can give you real tip 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.580
 Do not just try this with me 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.050
 basil tastes delicious but st 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.639
 also with wild herbs 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.940
 There you can let the fantasy run free 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.940
 Just let it try and enjoy
