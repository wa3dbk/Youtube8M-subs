kind episode in this episode we're going

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.280 
kind episode in this episode we're going
to<00:00:09.179> be<00:00:09.269> discussing<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.290> turbo<00:00:10.710> yeast<00:00:10.950> mash

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
to be discussing the turbo yeast mash

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.419 
to be discussing the turbo yeast mash
while<00:00:13.290> there's<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> lot<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.920> bad<00:00:14.070> rep<00:00:14.309> around

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
while there's a lot of bad rep around

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.039 
while there's a lot of bad rep around
turbo<00:00:14.849> yeast<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.389> definitely<00:00:15.780> recommend

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
turbo yeast we definitely recommend

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.830 
turbo yeast we definitely recommend
starting<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.590> way<00:00:16.770> for<00:00:17.010> new<00:00:17.100> distillers

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
starting this way for new distillers

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.170 
starting this way for new distillers
it's<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.109> easy<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.039> super<00:00:20.430> cheap<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.090> you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
it's so easy and it's super cheap so you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.460 
it's so easy and it's super cheap so you
can<00:00:21.300> really<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.750> process<00:00:22.170> under<00:00:22.350> your

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
can really get the process under your

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.259 
can really get the process under your
belt<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> couple<00:00:23.130> batches<00:00:23.279> without

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
belt with a couple batches without

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.150 
belt with a couple batches without
really<00:00:24.420> breaking<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> bank<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.070> be

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
really breaking the bank and to be

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.070 
really breaking the bank and to be
honest<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.670> still<00:00:26.730> use<00:00:27.150> turbo<00:00:27.420> yeast<00:00:27.599> matches

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
honest I still use turbo yeast matches

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.839 
honest I still use turbo yeast matches
especially<00:00:28.800> when<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.220> doing<00:00:29.429> something<00:00:29.460> like

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
especially when I'm doing something like

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
especially when I'm doing something like
using<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.510> essences<00:00:30.960> turbo<00:00:31.800> u<00:00:31.920> s--

using one of my essences turbo u s--
matches<00:00:32.340> are<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.640> pretty<00:00:32.850> simple<00:00:33.770> you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
matches are really pretty simple you

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
matches are really pretty simple you
just<00:00:34.800> make<00:00:35.100> sugar<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.579> water<00:00:35.610> add<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.870> east

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
just make sugar with water add the east

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
just make sugar with water add the east
let<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.649> ferment<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.879> should<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.149> good<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
let it ferment and you should be good to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.959 
let it ferment and you should be good to
go<00:00:39.450> with<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> distilling<00:00:40.320> process<00:00:40.879> there's<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
go with the distilling process there's a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.639 
go with the distilling process there's a
couple<00:00:42.149> optional<00:00:42.660> extras<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.530> add

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
couple optional extras that we can add

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.110 
couple optional extras that we can add
in<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.219> we'll<00:00:44.370> discuss<00:00:44.640> later<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:45.000> this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
in that we'll discuss later on this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.389 
in that we'll discuss later on this
video<00:00:45.500> but<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.620> begin<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.980> we've<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.280> got

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
video but to begin with we've just got

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.000 
video but to begin with we've just got
three<00:00:47.670> gallons<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.090> warm<00:00:48.300> water<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.559> 18

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
three gallons of warm water and 18

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:01.490 
three gallons of warm water and 18
pounds<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.370> sugar

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.880 

we<00:01:02.500> got<00:01:02.650> the<00:01:02.800> sugar<00:01:03.010> into<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.250> water<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.890> stir

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
we got the sugar into the water and stir

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.830 
we got the sugar into the water and stir
it<00:01:06.040> all<00:01:06.160> in<00:01:07.860> again<00:01:08.860> we<00:01:08.979> used<00:01:09.160> warm<00:01:09.490> water<00:01:09.840> just

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
it all in again we used warm water just

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.870 
it all in again we used warm water just
to<00:01:10.930> help<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.170> sugar<00:01:11.320> dissolve<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.580> we've<00:01:12.729> got

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
to help the sugar dissolve and we've got

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.020 
to help the sugar dissolve and we've got
together<00:01:13.150> two<00:01:13.479> gallons<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.930> water<00:01:14.110> later<00:01:14.410> on

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
together two gallons of water later on

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.250 
together two gallons of water later on
so<00:01:16.030> now<00:01:16.150> we've<00:01:16.390> got<00:01:16.510> the<00:01:16.600> sugar<00:01:16.810> mostly

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
so now we've got the sugar mostly

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.770 
so now we've got the sugar mostly
dissolved<00:01:18.030> we're<00:01:19.030> gonna<00:01:19.150> add<00:01:19.330> back<00:01:19.510> in<00:01:19.660> our

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
dissolved we're gonna add back in our

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
dissolved we're gonna add back in our
cool<00:01:19.930> water<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.619> help<00:01:20.740> cool<00:01:20.920> down<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.250> mash

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.950 

generally<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:24.970> want<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.240> add<00:01:25.330> until<00:01:25.780> it's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
generally you want to add until it's

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.390 
generally you want to add until it's
about<00:01:26.050> five<00:01:26.380> or<00:01:26.530> six<00:01:26.650> gallons<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:27.130> total

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
about five or six gallons of total

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.620 
about five or six gallons of total
liquid<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.729> all<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.910> sugar<00:01:34.090> dissolved<00:01:34.540> in

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
liquid with all the sugar dissolved in

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.370 
liquid with all the sugar dissolved in
the<00:01:34.690> cool<00:01:34.899> water<00:01:35.140> added<00:01:35.560> is<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.990> about

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
the cool water added is just about

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.620 
the cool water added is just about
lukewarm<00:01:39.039> temperature<00:01:39.300> which<00:01:40.300> should<00:01:40.509> be

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
lukewarm temperature which should be

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.170 
lukewarm temperature which should be
fine<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.960> add<00:01:41.080> your<00:01:41.259> yeast<00:01:41.850> cut<00:01:42.850> open<00:01:43.090> the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
fine to add your yeast cut open the

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.730 
fine to add your yeast cut open the
yeast<00:01:43.360> packet<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.869> pour<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.229> entire<00:01:44.470> thing

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
Eastin put the lid on and you should be

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.170 
Eastin put the lid on and you should be
ready<00:01:55.630> for<00:01:55.899> fermentation<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> 48<00:01:58.119> hour
