00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
so let me tell you a little bit about

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.959 
so let me tell you a little bit about
what's<00:01:34.369> involved<00:01:34.759> in<00:01:35.149> this<00:01:35.299> new<00:01:35.569> engine

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
what's involved in this new engine

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.910 
what's involved in this new engine
firstly<00:01:37.969> we<00:01:38.090> fit<00:01:38.299> a<00:01:38.329> new<00:01:38.569> cylinder<00:01:38.960> head<00:01:39.289> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
firstly we fit a new cylinder head the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.130 
firstly we fit a new cylinder head the
cinder<00:01:40.250> head<00:01:40.429> is<00:01:40.609> gas<00:01:40.909> flowed<00:01:41.270> ported<00:01:41.990> and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
cinder head is gas flowed ported and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.580 
cinder head is gas flowed ported and
matched<00:01:43.069> together<00:01:44.030> with<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.450> new<00:01:44.659> supercharger

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
matched together with a new supercharger

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.770 
matched together with a new supercharger
which<00:01:45.770> runs<00:01:46.280> faster<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.149> produces<00:01:47.600> more

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
which runs faster and produces more

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.459 
which runs faster and produces more
power<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:49.340> exhaust<00:01:49.700> system<00:01:50.149> is<00:01:50.299> changed<00:01:50.899> this

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
power the exhaust system is changed this

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.410 
power the exhaust system is changed this
is<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.770> ensure<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.159> correct<00:01:52.700> back<00:01:52.880> pressures

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
is to ensure that correct back pressures

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.959 
is to ensure that correct back pressures
are<00:01:53.659> maintained<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:54.770> also<00:01:55.579> obviously

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
are maintained and also obviously

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.559 
are maintained and also obviously
produces<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.780> great<00:01:57.200> exterior<00:01:57.979> noise<00:01:58.359> we<00:01:59.359> now

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
produces a great exterior noise we now

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.169 
produces a great exterior noise we now
fit<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.869> new<00:02:00.140> air<00:02:00.319> cleaner<00:02:00.619> system<00:02:00.920> which<00:02:01.849> gives

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
fit a new air cleaner system which gives

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.600 
fit a new air cleaner system which gives
more<00:02:02.420> power<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:03.049> of<00:02:03.619> course<00:02:03.890> gives<00:02:04.189> great

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
more power and of course gives great

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.179 
more power and of course gives great
noise<00:02:04.819> inside<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.629> car<00:02:05.899> all<00:02:06.229> together<00:02:06.709> with

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
noise inside the car all together with

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.400 
noise inside the car all together with
these<00:02:07.429> hardware<00:02:08.209> components<00:02:08.899> obviously

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
these hardware components obviously

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.949 
these hardware components obviously
