very nice and it looks like with the you
got<00:00:56.239> kind<00:00:56.449> of<00:00:56.479> a<00:00:56.569> collaboration<00:00:57.109> going<00:00:57.229> on

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
got kind of a collaboration going on

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.689 
got kind of a collaboration going on
with<00:00:57.469> all<00:00:57.530> sorts<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.859> book<00:00:58.069> builds<00:00:58.399> here<00:00:58.519> and

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
with all sorts of book builds here and

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.669 
with all sorts of book builds here and
each<00:00:58.819> one<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.149> you<00:00:59.329> built<00:00:59.629> kind<00:00:59.870> of<00:00:59.989> an<00:01:00.350> actual

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
each one of you built kind of an actual

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:01.989 
each one of you built kind of an actual
book<00:01:00.889> and<00:01:01.069> then<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.280> scene<00:01:01.429> on<00:01:01.579> top<00:01:01.729> of<00:01:01.879> it

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
book and then the scene on top of it

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.229 
book and then the scene on top of it
yeah<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:03.319> idea<00:01:03.589> is<00:01:03.859> that<00:01:04.280> originally<00:01:05.150> it

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
yeah so the idea is that originally it

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.640 
yeah so the idea is that originally it
was<00:01:05.330> just<00:01:05.390> children's<00:01:05.900> books<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.409> they<00:01:06.470> kind

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
was just children's books and they kind

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.050 
was just children's books and they kind
of<00:01:06.740> branched<00:01:07.130> out<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.310> little<00:01:07.520> bit<00:01:07.700> from<00:01:07.880> there

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
of branched out a little bit from there

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.050 
of branched out a little bit from there
but<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:09.680> yeah<00:01:09.890> we<00:01:10.010> each<00:01:10.159> built<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.610> book<00:01:10.820> and

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
but so yeah we each built the book and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.270 
but so yeah we each built the book and
then<00:01:11.360> as<00:01:11.570> if<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:12.320> know<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.590> story<00:01:12.799> was<00:01:12.950> coming

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
then as if you know the story was coming

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.610 
then as if you know the story was coming
to<00:01:13.400> life<00:01:13.550> we<00:01:13.940> have<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.150> characters<00:01:15.050> popping

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
to life we have the characters popping

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.310 
to life we have the characters popping
out<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.550> stories<00:01:16.910> okay<00:01:17.570> very<00:01:17.930> cool<00:01:18.170> so

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
out of the stories okay very cool so

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.510 
out of the stories okay very cool so
we'll<00:01:18.410> keep<00:01:18.500> moving<00:01:18.620> down<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.100> next<00:01:19.340> scene

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
we'll keep moving down to the next scene

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.180 
we'll keep moving down to the next scene
then<00:01:19.730> all<00:01:20.150> right<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.420> mean<00:01:20.810> in<00:01:20.930> Spacek<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:21.650> I

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
then all right I mean in Spacek and I

went with Harry Potter and there were
there<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.370> couple<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.700> books<00:01:25.910> I<00:01:26.090> was<00:01:26.210> trying<00:01:26.480> to

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
there a couple of books I was trying to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.770 
there a couple of books I was trying to
choose<00:01:26.780> between<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.530> we<00:01:28.220> were<00:01:28.280> kind<00:01:28.490> of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
choose between and we were kind of

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.760 
choose between and we were kind of
coming<00:01:29.780> down<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.140> home<00:01:30.260> stretch<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.710> I

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
coming down to the home stretch and I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.530 
coming down to the home stretch and I
finally<00:01:31.010> just<00:01:31.160> settled<00:01:31.610> on<00:01:31.730> this<00:01:31.910> one

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
finally just settled on this one

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.410 
finally just settled on this one
and<00:01:33.200> yeah<00:01:33.800> it's<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.250> potions<00:01:34.760> class<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.300> you

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
and yeah it's a potions class so you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.460 
and yeah it's a potions class so you
have<00:01:35.540> Harry<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.290> Professor<00:01:36.980> Snape<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:38.470> think

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
have Harry and Professor Snape I think

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.960 
have Harry and Professor Snape I think
that's<00:01:39.650> about<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:39.980> I<00:01:40.220> was<00:01:40.340> one<00:01:40.610> thing<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:40.850> was

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
that's about it I was one thing I was

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.330 
that's about it I was one thing I was
kind<00:01:41.120> of<00:01:41.150> happy<00:01:41.330> with<00:01:41.420> is<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.320> tile<00:01:42.770> spacing

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
kind of happy with is the tile spacing

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.640 
kind of happy with is the tile spacing
technique<00:01:43.730> which<00:01:44.150> I'd<00:01:44.990> seen<00:01:45.260> it<00:01:45.350> done<00:01:45.500> with<00:01:45.620> a

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
technique which I'd seen it done with a

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.070 
technique which I'd seen it done with a
herringbone<00:01:45.950> pattern<00:01:46.130> before<00:01:46.880> but<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.450> put

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
herringbone pattern before but I put

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.540 
herringbone pattern before but I put
down<00:01:48.230> that<00:01:48.410> same<00:01:48.680> pattern<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:49.340> try<00:01:49.490> playing

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
down that same pattern and try playing

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.370 
down that same pattern and try playing
with<00:01:49.850> different<00:01:50.270> arrangements<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.020> tiles

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
with different arrangements of the tiles

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.590 
with different arrangements of the tiles

this<00:03:09.610> build<00:03:09.910> built<00:03:10.300> before<00:03:10.840> they<00:03:11.350> even

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
this build built before they even

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.520 
this build built before they even
started<00:03:12.280> like<00:03:12.940> almost<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.960> whole<00:03:14.110> month<00:03:14.410> before

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530

started like almost a whole month before
they<00:03:14.920> started<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.870> that's<00:03:17.080> why<00:03:17.230> mine<00:03:17.470> doesn't

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
they started so that's why mine doesn't

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.140 
they started so that's why mine doesn't
actually<00:03:17.950> have<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.370> template<00:03:19.000> that

particular<00:03:28.870> build<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.530> this<00:03:30.370> window<00:03:30.820> this

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
particular build is this window this

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.620 
particular build is this window this
round<00:03:31.390> window<00:03:31.720> here<00:03:32.110> because<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.220> doesn't

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
round window here because it doesn't

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.170 
round window here because it doesn't
technically<00:03:34.630> fit<00:03:35.290> there<00:03:35.590> but<00:03:36.070> it<00:03:36.310> works<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.970> I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
technically fit there but it works and I

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.780 
technically fit there but it works and I
was<00:03:37.360> really<00:03:37.660> happy<00:03:38.080> that<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.320> worked<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:39.280> yeah

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
was really happy that it worked so yeah

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.010 
was really happy that it worked so yeah
that's<00:03:40.390> pretty<00:03:40.420> much<00:03:40.660> it

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
that's pretty much it

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
and this is also a bit of a throw

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.800 
and this is also a bit of a throw
together<00:04:05.500> build<00:04:06.190> but<00:04:06.489> there's<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.450> lot<00:04:07.600> of<00:04:07.690> fun

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
together build but there's a lot of fun

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.240 
together build but there's a lot of fun
it's<00:04:07.959> one<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.200> two<00:04:08.380> Robin<00:04:08.770> Hood<00:04:08.920> builds<00:04:09.160> that

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
it's one of two Robin Hood builds that

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.420 
it's one of two Robin Hood builds that
we<00:04:09.340> have<00:04:09.489> in<00:04:09.640> this<00:04:09.760> layout<00:04:11.400> which<00:04:12.400> is

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
we have in this layout which is

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.640 
we have in this layout which is
unintentional<00:04:13.120> but<00:04:13.239> I<00:04:13.270> think<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:14.170> works<00:04:14.440> out

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
unintentional but I think it works out

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.540 
unintentional but I think it works out
pretty<00:04:14.739> nicely<00:04:15.040> because<00:04:15.220> they're<00:04:15.400> different

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
pretty nicely because they're different

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.880 
pretty nicely because they're different
scales<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.330> they're<00:04:17.169> different<00:04:17.470> scenes<00:04:17.680> from

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
scales and they're different scenes from

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.640 
scales and they're different scenes from
the<00:04:18.070> book<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.549> is<00:04:19.180> highlighting<00:04:19.750> two<00:04:19.900> to

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
the book and is highlighting two to

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.130 
the book and is highlighting two to
separate<00:04:21.330> two<00:04:22.330> separate<00:04:22.690> parts<00:04:22.930> of<00:04:23.050> the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
separate two separate parts of the

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.690 
separate two separate parts of the
really<00:04:23.320> classic<00:04:23.770> story<00:04:24.040> so<00:04:24.430> it's<00:04:24.550> something

hello I'm Ben Merrill I built corduroy

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.990 
hello I'm Ben Merrill I built corduroy
from<00:04:53.920> the<00:04:54.010> book<00:04:54.130> of<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.340> same<00:04:54.520> title

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
from the book of the same title

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.450 
from the book of the same title
I<00:04:55.120> built<00:04:55.780> this<00:04:55.930> because<00:04:56.830> it's<00:04:56.980> one<00:04:57.340> of<00:04:57.370> my

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
I built this because it's one of my

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.420 
I built this because it's one of my
favorite<00:04:57.760> books<00:04:57.880> as<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.450> young<00:04:59.170> lad<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.710> I

favorite books as a young lad and I

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.040 
favorite books as a young lad and I
think<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.030> story<00:05:01.240> resonates<00:05:01.630> with<00:05:01.720> each<00:05:01.900> of

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
think the story resonates with each of

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.720 
think the story resonates with each of
us<00:05:02.200> says<00:05:02.410> it's<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.680> story<00:05:02.950> of<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.130> broken<00:05:03.340> bear

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
us says it's the story of a broken bear

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.970 
us says it's the story of a broken bear
living<00:05:04.360> for<00:05:04.600> a<00:05:04.630> wholeness<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.170> a<00:05:05.260> home<00:05:05.500> and

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
living for a wholeness and a home and

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.940 
living for a wholeness and a home and
it's<00:05:06.400> not<00:05:06.610> sleep<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:07.150> find<00:05:08.080> someone<00:05:08.500> to<00:05:08.650> accept

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
it's not sleep I find someone to accept

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.580 
it's not sleep I find someone to accept
him<00:05:09.040> as<00:05:09.280> he<00:05:09.400> is<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:09.910> he's<00:05:10.420> made<00:05:10.660> whole<00:05:10.900> and<00:05:11.530> I

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
him as he is that he's made whole and I

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.710 
him as he is that he's made whole and I
think<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:11.920> resonates<00:05:12.100> well<00:05:12.820> with<00:05:12.850> the<00:05:13.540> soul

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
think that resonates well with the soul

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.020 
think that resonates well with the soul
of<00:05:13.750> each<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:14.140> us<00:05:14.310> this<00:05:15.310> is<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.460> really<00:05:15.820> cool

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
of each of us this is a really cool

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.430 
of each of us this is a really cool
little<00:05:16.210> build<00:05:16.480> what's<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.840> structure<00:05:17.260> like

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
little build what's the structure like

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.230 
little build what's the structure like
in<00:05:17.650> there<00:05:17.770> keeping<00:05:18.100> that<00:05:18.160> all<00:05:18.340> together<00:05:18.490> is<00:05:18.940> a
