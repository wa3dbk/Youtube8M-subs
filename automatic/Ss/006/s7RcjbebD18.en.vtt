00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.310 
and stir it continuously and at this
point<00:02:42.100> I'm<00:02:42.340> going<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.670> add<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.060> cashew<00:02:43.480> nuts

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.340 

and<00:02:47.320> cook<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.220> again<00:02:48.610> until<00:02:49.150> it's<00:02:49.540> smooth<00:02:50.020> nice

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
and cook it again until it's smooth nice

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.350 
and cook it again until it's smooth nice
and<00:02:50.740> soft<00:02:51.420> then<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.600> has<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.080> reach<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.320> hard

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
and soft then it has to reach the hard

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.910 
and soft then it has to reach the hard
stage<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:56.590> take<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:57.010> out

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.740 

when<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.099> add<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.459> potatoes<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.360> cashew

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
when you add the potatoes and the cashew

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.619 
when you add the potatoes and the cashew
nut<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.650> reduces<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.549> heat<00:03:04.730> again<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.510> it

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
nut it reduces the heat again and it

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.970 
nut it reduces the heat again and it
went<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.349> Fahrenheit<00:03:07.989> 290<00:03:08.989> centigrade<00:03:09.590> so

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
went on to Fahrenheit 290 centigrade so

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.580 
went on to Fahrenheit 290 centigrade so
now<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.700> am<00:03:10.790> keep<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.390> stirring<00:03:11.900> until<00:03:12.260> it

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
now I am keep on stirring until it

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.839 
now I am keep on stirring until it
becomes<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.370> soft<00:03:13.780> hardball<00:03:14.780> stage<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.730> it

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
becomes to the soft hardball stage so it

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.920 
becomes to the soft hardball stage so it
will<00:03:17.090> take<00:03:17.329> another<00:03:17.750> few<00:03:18.109> minutes

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
will take another few minutes

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.839 
will take another few minutes
it<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.140> nearly<00:03:21.650> there<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.129> the<00:03:22.250> soft<00:03:22.549> ball

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
it is nearly there to the soft ball

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.379 
it is nearly there to the soft ball
stage<00:03:22.879> and<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.129> how<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.459> looks<00:03:25.670> like<00:03:25.879> in<00:03:26.209> a

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
stage and this is how it looks like in a

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.140 
stage and this is how it looks like in a
minute<00:03:26.569> I<00:03:26.930> am<00:03:26.959> going<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.379> transfer<00:03:27.620> this<00:03:28.150> into

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
minute I am going to transfer this into

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.860 
minute I am going to transfer this into
a<00:03:29.829> play<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:31.159> I<00:03:31.219> old<00:03:31.670> already<00:03:32.359> and<00:03:32.720> I'm<00:03:32.840> going

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
a play that I old already and I'm going

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.530 
a play that I old already and I'm going
to<00:03:33.170> spread<00:03:33.439> it<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:33.829> top

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.440 

I<00:03:37.010> transit<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.219> on<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.730> tray<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.390> am

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
I transit that on to the tray and I am

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.770 
I transit that on to the tray and I am
going<00:03:39.659> to<00:03:39.750> leave<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.469> till<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.829> cools<00:03:41.099> down

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
going to leave it on till it cools down

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.630 
going to leave it on till it cools down
so<00:03:42.780> after<00:03:43.409> that<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.590> am<00:03:43.799> going<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.069> cut<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.459> into

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
so after that I am going to cut it into

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.899 
so after that I am going to cut it into
squares<00:03:44.939> I<00:03:47.359> cut<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.569> other<00:03:48.750> dorsi<00:03:49.439> into

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
squares I cut the other dorsi into

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.530 
squares I cut the other dorsi into
squares<00:03:50.909> and<00:03:52.159> it's<00:03:53.159> ready<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.909> can<00:03:54.150> store

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
squares and it's ready you can store

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.819 
squares and it's ready you can store
this<00:03:54.689> in<00:03:55.319> an<00:03:55.590> aircon<00:03:56.189> tight<00:03:57.090> container<00:03:57.829> for

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
this in an aircon tight container for

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.610 
this in an aircon tight container for
about<00:03:59.129> two<00:03:59.760> weeks<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.599> I<00:04:00.989> hope<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.439> will

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
about two weeks and I hope you will

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.900 
about two weeks and I hope you will
enjoy<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:02.189> recipe<00:04:02.400> thank<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.239> for<00:04:03.450> watching
