00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
off it was hot like basically down to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.660 
off it was hot like basically down to
here<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.550> was<00:00:23.699> pointed<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.710> even<00:00:26.490> got

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
here and it was pointed so I even got

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
here and it was pointed so I even got
the<00:00:26.789> point<00:00:27.029> like<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.240> made<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.570> flat<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.260> then<00:00:28.590> I

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the point like I made it flat and then I

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.220 
the point like I made it flat and then I
rounded<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> edges<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.900> think<00:00:31.109> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
rounded the edges so I just think it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.780 
rounded the edges so I just think it
made<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.920> her<00:00:32.279> look<00:00:32.460> nice<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> um<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.860> wrote<00:00:35.760> on

this scissor when I cut her hair and
it's<00:00:53.010> fairly<00:00:53.250> new<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.420> absolutely<00:00:54.570> must

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.540 
it's fairly new so you absolutely must
make<00:00:55.199> sure<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> scissors<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.309> dull

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
make sure that the scissors not dull

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.220 
make sure that the scissors not dull
otherwise<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:57.239> knock<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> hair<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
otherwise it will knock up the hair and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.740 
otherwise it will knock up the hair and
if<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.039> scissor<00:00:59.280> has<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.090> rust<00:01:00.420> or

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
if the scissor has some like rust or

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.590 
if the scissor has some like rust or
some<00:01:01.050> sticky<00:01:01.559> stuff<00:01:01.770> or<00:01:01.949> whatever<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.730> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
some sticky stuff or whatever on it that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.179 
some sticky stuff or whatever on it that
will<00:01:03.750> absolutely<00:01:04.170> ruin<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> hair<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
will absolutely ruin the hair and it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.980 
will absolutely ruin the hair and it
will<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.460> almost<00:01:05.670> impossible<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
will be almost impossible like to get it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.260 
will be almost impossible like to get it
out<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:08.130> always<00:01:08.400> make<00:01:08.520> sure<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> good

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
out so always make sure you have a good

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
out so always make sure you have a good
clean<00:01:09.630> scissor<00:01:11.030> ok<00:01:12.030> next<00:01:12.600> thing<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
clean scissor ok next thing this is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
clean scissor ok next thing this is
probably<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> most<00:01:14.729> important<00:01:15.360> thing

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
probably like the most important thing

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.039 
probably like the most important thing
ever<00:01:15.780> make<00:01:16.740> sure<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.400> head<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.240> tilted

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
ever make sure the head is not tilted

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.039 
ever make sure the head is not tilted
because<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.189> look<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.390> tilt<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> head<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
because like look if I tilt the head a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
because like look if I tilt the head a
little<00:01:22.259> bit<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.850> makes<00:01:23.850> such<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> big

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
little bit it makes such a big

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.289 
little bit it makes such a big
difference<00:01:24.950> like<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.189> was<00:01:26.369> even<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:27.060> it's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
difference like it was even now it's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.080 
difference like it was even now it's
like<00:01:27.450> sort<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> head<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
like sort of not so if the head is

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
like sort of not so if the head is
tilted<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.960> can't<00:01:31.229> even<00:01:31.380> sort<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.979> see

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
tilted and you can't even sort of see

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.140 
tilted and you can't even sort of see
that<00:01:32.820> her<00:01:33.090> head<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.299> tilted<00:01:33.829> at<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that her head is tilted at all so you

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
that her head is tilted at all so you
always<00:01:36.299> must<00:01:36.630> look<00:01:36.869> over<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.380> over<00:01:37.470> again

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
always must look over and over again

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280 
always must look over and over again
because<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.460> head<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.640> tilted<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
because if the head is tilted you and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.960 
because if the head is tilted you and
you<00:01:40.619> start<00:01:41.040> cutting<00:01:41.430> what<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.880> would

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you start cutting what you think would

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.389 
you start cutting what you think would
be<00:01:42.150> even<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.409> find<00:01:43.770> out<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.189> head

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
be even and then you find out the head

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.270 
be even and then you find out the head
was<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:45.420> straight<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.649> fix<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
was not straight then you fix it and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.910 
was not straight then you fix it and
then<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.670> had<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.030> giant<00:01:48.329> slant<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.409> your

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
then you had this giant slant in your

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.649 
then you had this giant slant in your
doll's<00:01:50.130> hair<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.149> will<00:01:51.329> end<00:01:51.540> up

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
doll's hair and then you will end up

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539 
doll's hair and then you will end up
having<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.140> cut<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> way<00:01:52.590> too<00:01:52.649> short<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.280> it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
having to cut it way too short then it

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.420 
having to cut it way too short then it
should<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.740> wanted<00:01:56.219> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
should be like that then you wanted to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.260 
should be like that then you wanted to
cut<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.689> I'll<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.439> take<00:01:58.619> forever
