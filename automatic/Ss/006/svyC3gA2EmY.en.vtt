00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.390
 well all guys friezes etf that you 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.590
 speak well yes you are not dead 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 we anyway after this 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.800
 bullshit poised quickly one thing 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.740
 before the actual video starts 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.980
 let's say commentaries and then practically 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.960
 you should go through my channel 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.480
 I know you've already been through my channel 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.120
 is not that this is your introducing the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 bla bla all shit anyway passed 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.059
 from my channel which will be in description 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 because I created a new one 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.789
 because on the other they were practically 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.480
 all inactive because 1900 members e 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.969
 200 closed is little especially the 50 likes 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.340
 of the 200 locks are few, however 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.859
 pass by the canal I will not treat 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.670
 only video decodes but other games 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.920
 like I do n't know minecraft then we'll see 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.100
 depends on what you want from 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.240
 the one I want to see here is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.280
 however, well then they are not dead was 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.299
 really long and I didn't do it 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.850
 resent on this channel on plan and vi 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.509
 I explain very quickly the causes of 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 my absence 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:29.070
 then I was practically active 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.659
 during much of spring 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.390
 let's say march april may 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.049
 I was inactive for school 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.060
 because I had two bars three materials below 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:46.609
 and in June I managed to recover them 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.240
 so practically the school was the 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:53.270
 main cause here and then obviously 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.700
 if one doesn't play and it's ok I had these 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.280
 two three subjects below and you mean network 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.780
 and it 's ok with the two or three subjects below 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.810
 but it is not that you no longer have the hands for 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.899
 play and yes I will also explain 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.440
 because of this if I go wrong at school 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:14.599
 consequently my father and my mother 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.280
 I do not know what I like doing 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.450
 go out at night with friends 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.780
 I had to return the motor sooner or later 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.750
 sky therefore motor excluded anyway e 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.660
 then I don't know I get the xbox this one 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.049
 stuff here so I couldn't play 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:37.269
 they made it like a two-hour Saturday 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:42.769
 so afternoon for a little fun 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:45.349
 little later since I didn't play for two 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.280
 three full months so I don't have 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.280
 could do gameplay 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.340
 hand tactics if it's a little way 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.090
 let's say and then I became a little bit 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.430
 sense hands and so I had to 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.970
 get used to playing for the month of 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.419
 June 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.260
 I played a little bit to rehabilitate myself 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.330
 here and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.370
 and for now all went well I am 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.370
 finding good on this mode that is 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.379
 tct all against all and you will know it 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.680
 for sure because it is not unknown 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.659
 obviously however these were more or 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.610
 less the causes here is the school in general 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:28.230
 here, however, I describe the game 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.420
 even if you have already understood it from the title 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.269
 of the miniature and you can understand it well 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:38.579
 alone from what you saw up to 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:42.629
 now it's a double tct mob on the map 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:46.200
 hard with the g 36 c ridiculous class 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.510
 quickly that it seems to me that it was from 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.680
 36 c charged muffler tormented 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:57.900
 secondary plus 9 silenced c4 radar 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:01.230
 Portable the perk were the initial cause 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.840
 they were quick and jackal extraction 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.609
 predator and those of specialist le 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.549
 you can see mameli anyway game 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.769
 prestigious relationship shooter chosen 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.359
 here is a game in my opinion enough 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.160
 good 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.620
 in the first moby put us the timer 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:22.830
 because it was pretty fast in my opinion 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:26.039
 it was a very good time or 125 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.870
 seconds which are two minutes and 5 seconds 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:32.280
 bono in my opinion and in the second one there is 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.190
 I put it anyway I can tell you 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.699
 at 985 seconds then three minutes and 5 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.169
 seconds 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.970
 however, all five seconds anyway 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.710
 I would say that the gameplay is already almost finished 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.260
 I'm doing this with m 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.690
 four hours before he leaves for 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.760
 sardinia for two weeks anyway a 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.440
 you will see another video not commented by 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.530
 myself 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.120
 write me in the comments what you want if 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.310

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:09.060
 pct type gameplay i know how to do one 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:13.470
 moab blows m9 crap weapon in the city a 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.990
 firing in fire I don't know says these 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.030
 gameplay propose I will try 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.620
 now not during the holidays because 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.940
 obviously I don't bring the xbox behind 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.940
 however try here to suggest them 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.720
 so he made me say pleasure to 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.880
 make a comment 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.320
 for the clans I think I will return 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.570
