it to break off root sections because it

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.720 
it to break off root sections because it
just<00:00:37.350> makes<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> harder<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.280> plant<00:00:38.520> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
you that you get them in the 4 pack this

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.709 
you that you get them in the 4 pack this
one<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.699> falling<00:01:00.120> apart<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:00.480> bit

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
one is falling apart a little bit

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.299 
one is falling apart a little bit
because<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.199> roots<00:01:01.410> aren't<00:01:01.680> completely

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
because the roots aren't completely

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
because the roots aren't completely
established<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> original<00:01:03.899> pot<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.409> it's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
established in the original pot and it's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.550 
established in the original pot and it's
okay<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.760> make<00:01:05.970> sure<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.570> take<00:01:07.320> care

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
not to break any of the root part so I'm

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.730 
not to break any of the root part so I'm
going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.510> put<00:01:09.689> three<00:01:09.930> plants<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.680> it

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
going to put three plants in here and it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.609 
going to put three plants in here and it
sounds<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.280> not<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> lot<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.659> strawberries

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
sounds like not a lot but strawberries

into<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> fruit<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.420> long<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
into the fruit and so as long as you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.410

at<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.360> time<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.659> year<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:30.990> keeping<00:01:31.320> them

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
at this time of year I'm keeping them

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.280 
at this time of year I'm keeping them
inside<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.829> nursery<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:33.869> keep<00:01:34.049> them<00:01:34.460> warmer

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
inside my nursery to keep them warmer

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.749 
inside my nursery to keep them warmer
which<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> other<00:01:37.740> another<00:01:38.130> advantage<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
which is the other another advantage of

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.219 
which is the other another advantage of
having<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> small<00:01:39.659> container<00:01:39.960> like

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
having them in a small container like

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.200 
having them in a small container like
this<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.860> root<00:01:41.070> systems<00:01:41.610> will<00:01:41.850> maybe

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
this the root systems will maybe

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.069 
this the root systems will maybe
maintain<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.320> warmer<00:01:44.180> with<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> limited<00:01:45.750> space

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
maintain a warmer with a limited space

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.710 
maintain a warmer with a limited space
I'm<00:01:46.530> taking<00:01:47.399> care<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:50.490> press<00:01:51.119> down<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.450> the

I'm taking care to to press down on the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
soil just enough to get the plants

in<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> tight<00:02:04.680> space<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.100> want<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> give<00:02:05.520> them

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
in a tight space you want to give them

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.479 
in a tight space you want to give them
as<00:02:05.820> much<00:02:05.850> space<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> pot<00:02:07.079> as<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.740> by

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
as much space in the pot as you can by

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.869 
as much space in the pot as you can by
spacing<00:02:09.030> them<00:02:09.179> properly<00:02:09.509> and

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
spacing them properly and

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.699 
spacing them properly and
then<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.480> want<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.900> make<00:02:12.079> sure<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.379> they're<00:02:12.560> to

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
then I want to make sure that they're to

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.860 
then I want to make sure that they're to
the<00:02:12.829> level<00:02:13.159> that<00:02:13.189> they<00:02:13.519> were<00:02:13.879> when<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.329> got<00:02:14.599> them

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
the level that they were when I got them

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.770 
the level that they were when I got them

the level of soil is below the lip of

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
the pot because we want to be able to

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.520 
the pot because we want to be able to

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
allow water to seep in to the soil here

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.410 
allow water to seep in to the soil here
and<00:02:24.590> not<00:02:24.859> just<00:02:25.129> run<00:02:25.310> over<00:02:25.340> if<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.939> had<00:02:26.090> like<00:02:26.359> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
and not just run over if you had like a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.259 
and not just run over if you had like a
a<00:02:26.750> mound<00:02:27.230> it'd<00:02:27.829> make<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.370> harder<00:02:28.879> for<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.239> to

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
a mound it'd make it harder for you to

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.589 
a mound it'd make it harder for you to
get<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:29.870> soil<00:02:30.290> saturated<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.849> I'm<00:02:32.239> looking

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
get that soil saturated so I'm looking

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.059 
get that soil saturated so I'm looking
to<00:02:32.629> make<00:02:32.930> sure<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.439> level<00:02:33.890> will<00:02:34.040> be

to make sure that this level will be

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.789 
to make sure that this level will be
below<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.849> lip<00:02:35.060> when<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.269> start<00:02:35.689> after<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.500> water

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
below the lip when I start after I water

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.979 
below the lip when I start after I water
these<00:02:37.069> in<00:02:37.310> in<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.549> second<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.510> level<00:02:38.840> will<00:02:38.959> go

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
these in in a second the level will go

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.839 
these in in a second the level will go
down<00:02:39.139> just<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.650> little<00:02:39.889> bit<00:02:40.010> more<00:02:40.219> as<00:02:40.400> well<00:02:40.639> as

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
down just a little bit more as well as

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.929 
down just a little bit more as well as
the<00:02:41.150> soil<00:02:41.420> compacts<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:42.170> little<00:02:42.409> bit<00:02:42.939> more

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
the soil compacts a little bit more

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.030 
the soil compacts a little bit more
tightly<00:02:44.209> it's<00:02:45.019> critical<00:02:45.590> when<00:02:45.680> you're<00:02:45.829> first

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
tightly it's critical when you're first

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.099 
tightly it's critical when you're first
watering<00:02:46.819> your<00:02:46.909> plants<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.540> make<00:02:47.689> sure<00:02:47.930> that

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
watering your plants to make sure that

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.009 
watering your plants to make sure that
you<00:02:48.260> don't<00:02:48.409> inundate<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.540> put<00:02:50.840> too

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
you don't inundate and and and put too

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.140 
you don't inundate and and and put too
much<00:02:51.169> water<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.859> initially<00:02:52.669> because<00:02:52.970> it's

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
much water on initially because it's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.179 
much water on initially because it's
going<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:53.329> take<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.569> little<00:02:53.840> bit<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.230> time<00:02:55.159> for

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:55.189 
going to take a little bit of time for

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.110 
going to take a little bit of time for
the<00:02:55.549> water<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.060> start<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:57.400> seep<00:02:58.400> into<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.760> soil

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
the water to start to seep into the soil

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.649 
the water to start to seep into the soil
so<00:02:59.389> that<00:02:59.659> I<00:02:59.870> can<00:03:00.169> get<00:03:00.349> some<00:03:00.500> water<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.889> here<00:03:01.040> and

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
so that I can get some water in here and

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.330 
so that I can get some water in here and
as<00:03:02.659> I<00:03:02.810> already<00:03:03.109> see<00:03:03.349> water<00:03:03.709> wanting<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.189> run

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
as I already see water wanting to run

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.550 
as I already see water wanting to run
off<00:03:04.519> I'm<00:03:04.700> going<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.879> stop<00:03:05.200> let<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.349> water

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
off I'm going to stop let that water

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.460 
off I'm going to stop let that water
sink<00:03:06.950> in<00:03:07.189> and<00:03:07.480> as<00:03:08.480> soon<00:03:08.569> as<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.930> see<00:03:09.109> that<00:03:09.319> that

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
sink in and as soon as I see that that

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.780 
sink in and as soon as I see that that
happens<00:03:09.709> I'm<00:03:10.099> going<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.310> add<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.430> little<00:03:10.549> more

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
happens I'm going to add a little more

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.179 
happens I'm going to add a little more
and<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:12.290> I'm<00:03:12.439> going<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.590> stop<00:03:12.889> you<00:03:12.919> don't

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
and then I'm going to stop you don't

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.430 
and then I'm going to stop you don't
want<00:03:13.400> too<00:03:13.549> much<00:03:14.949> overflow<00:03:15.949> here<00:03:17.169> but<00:03:18.169> you<00:03:18.290> can

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
want too much overflow here but you can

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.780 
want too much overflow here but you can
see<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.739> that's<00:03:18.919> starting<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.310> sink<00:03:19.639> in

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
see that that's starting to sink in

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.449 
see that that's starting to sink in
nicely

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.250 

and<00:03:25.060> your<00:03:25.180> first<00:03:25.390> watering<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.019> really

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
and your first watering is really

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.809 
and your first watering is really
important<00:03:26.680> because<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:27.129> allows<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.609> to<00:03:27.700> get

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
important because it allows you to get

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.660 
important because it allows you to get
that<00:03:28.079> complete<00:03:29.159> saturation<00:03:30.159> for<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.430> first

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
that complete saturation for the first

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.929 
that complete saturation for the first
time<00:03:30.909> it<00:03:31.239> settles<00:03:31.719> the<00:03:31.900> plants<00:03:32.290> even<00:03:32.590> further

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 
time it settles the plants even further

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.819 
time it settles the plants even further
settles<00:03:33.939> the<00:03:34.090> soil<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:34.930> want<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.709> see

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
settles the soil and you want to see

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.410 
settles the soil and you want to see
that<00:03:36.010> water<00:03:36.189> coming<00:03:36.459> out<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.790> bottom<00:03:36.969> just

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
that water coming out of the bottom just

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.880 
that water coming out of the bottom just
like<00:03:37.599> that<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.109> that's<00:03:38.260> how<00:03:38.349> you<00:03:38.469> know<00:03:38.680> you've

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
like that and that's how you know you've

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.520 
like that and that's how you know you've
got<00:03:39.099> a<00:03:39.689> competitor<00:03:40.689> ation<00:03:40.959> throughout<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
got a competitor ation throughout the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.720 
got a competitor ation throughout the
entire<00:03:42.120> root<00:03:43.120> zone<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.989> soil<00:03:44.290> area<00:03:45.250> there<00:03:45.489> and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
entire root zone the soil area there and

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.759 
entire root zone the soil area there and
so<00:03:46.480> once<00:03:46.689> you<00:03:46.810> see<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:46.989> then<00:03:47.409> you're<00:03:47.530> pretty

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
so once you see that then you're pretty

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.679 
so once you see that then you're pretty
much<00:03:47.950> good<00:03:48.219> to<00:03:48.310> go

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
much good to go

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.629 
much good to go
