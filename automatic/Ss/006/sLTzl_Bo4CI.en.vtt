00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.080
 good these attached to a new video 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.600
 good it seems that the world dawn 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.370
 a pretty unique news we could 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.289
 say and it's good that a user had 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.209
 purchased in global counter strike 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:19.830
 offensive a custom knife that 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:22.349
 It cost 23 thousand 850 dollars 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.470
 If the knife is only red and and 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.320
 is they do not do anything special or convert 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.650
 to enemies in chickens or 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.530
 they turn into killer lollipops not 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.000
 it just kills and is red it does 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.350
 the same with normal knife but good 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.880
 being this color of this design so 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.290
 special as the one you have in the 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.080
 description you can see a video of this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.930
 knife in the in the description and the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.430
 I really do not know if man would be wrong 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.530
 when you buy it you would think it was two 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.990
 dollars with 30 but the truth is that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.730
 as I say that 23 thousand 850 has been spent 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.440
 dollars and really this is news 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.610
 quite unique but it's not the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.380
 only person who has spent a 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.299
 globality in strange objects 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.130
 in a video game or not in fact in 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.890
 endowed also by an object or a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.590
 object was sold for 38 thousand dollars and the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.439
 most special case that has the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.880
 opportunity to tell was in 2010 where 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:26.780
 a man named jon jay cocks in 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.569
 intropy and universe then he sold his 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.819
 space station that did the 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:36.350
 within the game often it was a 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:39.799
 solid for 635 thousand dollars an amount 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.250
 well quite impressive at 685 thousand 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.950
 dollars is a lot more than half 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.020
 million dollars is to be charged in 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.700
 the swamps not really so the 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.200
 knife the price of the knife is left 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.060
 the height of the bitumen when I tell you what 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.429
 of the space station but it's that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.929
 it really is also impressive nothing 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.259
 in people who have a lot of money it 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.670
 spend on things very truly 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.679
 strange but good is your money and I know 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.530
 they can spend on whatever comes out 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.250
 very balls really the truth then 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.540
 because it is badly invested is another is another 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.730
 story so nothing else 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.880
 We will let the gentleman enjoy his car 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.460
 and I red blood super cool 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.040
 that goes forming with the 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.200
 colleagues because of my mother I hallucinate 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.610
 Really, I mean it very seriously 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.740
 I hallucinate but it is colorines I do not expect 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.450
 I hope you beat him and I think it's better 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.300
 it was a bet of no eggs 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.400
 to buy it and what do I know are between 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.720
 very wealthy people or something and good 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.670
 are they spending or a joke because I 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.320
 I think that even if I had a bad leftover 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.710
 If the money does not think I bought a 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.050
 knife in a game for 23 thousand 850 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.940
 dollars the truth is that I do not 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.610
 I would think very much very much 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.250
 being very millionaire so good nothing 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.690
 more kids this will be everything and anything we 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.440
 a in the next video will be present 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.440
 until the alleged
