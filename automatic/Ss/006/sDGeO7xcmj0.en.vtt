00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.300
 this is the quiz esa k3 light from the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.509
 nuclear exit know that berlin now in 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.070
 this video even imagine 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.350
 with this set from the different ones 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 I can therefore single components here 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.010
 I'm already at the beginning with something like that 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.150
 has never had to do anything like 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.070
 reach a lot 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.370
 the set is the first one here 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.220
 from the us series as well reflector 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.489
 silver is a rectangular one 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.530
 softbox with a reflected flies 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.520
 in the area you can see that one 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.520
 a little bit of service is then quite easy 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.690
 look and the back is because of the biz 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.060
 series I is again equal 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.590
 easy if the whole is then built 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.210
 I 've already set it up before 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.410
 but I made it clear that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.640
 is incredibly complicated and that one 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.060
 bit stupid looks when the movie 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.430
 purely 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.760
 I have just shown what them 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.880
 demonstrate how easy the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.540
 assemble 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.970
 this is one 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.890
 steel construction in it are so left 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.630
 too small plastic chopsticks and if 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 you press together then you can 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.680
 the whole time wonderful just like that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.350
 assemble and fold up and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.570
 then has a small pack size you can see 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.360
 you have to rebuild the whole thing 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.640
 Just bring it here on one side then 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.430
 one folds this mechanism into the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.659
 permanent also a short pages and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.369
 I think that 's a pretty expensive one 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.229
 system over other systems the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.549
 has just by this rigidity the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.920
 through these rods has just come through 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.600
 So this mechanism does not happen 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.860
 The whole thing is very flexible 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.049
 but it just stays in the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.000
 basic form of basic construction supplies 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.530
 has just built up just like always 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.040
 you have it right and needs it 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.900
 used also included in the set 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.100
 next to it a so-called reflector 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.860
 for indirect flash 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.390
 It is then attached to the lightning on the day 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.799
 before that just becomes one 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.000
 closed to a rubber inside 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.720
 I'll show you that too 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.340
 again extra 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.780
 I just let him off 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.710
 and to be able to better represent with it 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.409
 and the great thing about this Saturday is just that 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.079
 these 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.520
 These metals surface metallic like 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.719
 surface does not stop just right 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.950
 I can only reflect with it 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.149
 also steer properly with this tree 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.890
 experience driving on the other side 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.440
 soften the light then 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.489
 simply this marked white surface 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.230
 they have seen 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.750
 the great thing about this tree is just now 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.860
 so I can turn right so me 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.660
 can never be right yes if you will 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.980
 that means I can do it 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.140
 Just take it easy on the lightning 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.400
 on it and if I lift now then ever 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.890
 after how English this tunnel 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.629
 do where the light can go through 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.549
 I'm just here so the best 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.849
 variations make previously content just 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.650
 almost to such a small sports flash 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.940
 level that I come out the front then that 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.489
 that would be a joke 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.069
 is, of course, also a 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.849
 a little bit are very clear 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.040
 Immediately put then yes you can 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.079
 Right types on the picture in front 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.700
 steer the liechtenstein team correctly 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.079
 and the whole is then here so it 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.480
 also the time just right 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.980
 if it is attached to joke next to it 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.859
 to represent a single person 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.049
 and was also an emotion here with that 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.700
 can shape light 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.470
 the next thing we are afraid of them is that 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.239
 it is inconspicuous that is just 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.680
 Just always that has just synonymous of 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.750
 normal softbox a child that's just 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.910
 just this overflight in front of the light 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.609
 Diffuse does not do anything for anyone here 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.560
 come back to us and know how the 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.829
 softbox and then the whole thing becomes easy 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.190
 placed here above the corner and 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.660
 here then for the life of this 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.519
 stiffness of these strands that is too 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.380
 beach beautiful can not deliver 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.000
 it is so easy to attach or have 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.519
 the me so a small mini softbox 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.680
 always so will the joke and on it comes 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.410
 that not this is a very nice 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.329
 not rich then we have 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.040
 here are ten slides for different 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.099
 for temperatures and lighting moods the 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.510
 so look so are in different 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.079
 colors as a product of this stands 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.579
 available 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.919
 i will show you different colors till 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.840
 to ten different colors and that 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.430
 whole system is designed to that 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.750
 So you, of course, once 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.310
 so can attach to the picture 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.120
 but I have to say it directly 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.799
 So there is no west 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.180
 mounting possibility beyond just 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.940
 that we make this closure 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.889
 and where it fits in well, that's why 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.480
 in addition to this venture on the 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.639
 back practically where the view 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.970
 on it is set as you can diesel 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.830
 vehicles 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.120
 These color films simply go there 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.500
 The funny comes in and then you can 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.220
 I hereby also you can do it too 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.260
 see it already 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.760
 that is now blue politician 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.470
 Logically, it is so 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.500
 background from the table because you can 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.730
 enduring excellence 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.080
 I tried it, there are nice ones 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.640
 light effects that is also a lot of fun 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.780
 especially with that you have to snap 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.430
 also think a bit depending 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.960
 in which environment and with which 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.780
 do not just work around us 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.640
 for example, somehow coni neon tubes 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.780
 somewhere and then just with the 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.760
 pure blue light to flash 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.190
 which can be nice looks that normal 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.630
 on the edge as I said these color slides the 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.690
 are also great with it 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.720
 get a headset here in these colors 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.900
 Let's get to the final 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.420
 and that is the softbox here 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.670
 itself which one uses here and that 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.590
 This is just over here again 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.510
 the velcro at the end of the 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.880
 softbox, of course, then also 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.500
 times these stickers then on the 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.880
 hold the emergency lane on the lightning long 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.410
 that's also the right one here 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.520
 hard plastic so that nothing 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.290
 Somehow shaky with time 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.710
 may be going on that we just because 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.360
 over the joke so put it over here 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.830
 Of course you can do it even if it is 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.970
 of course, that's a little tighter too 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.910
 flexible you can do that a bit now 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.080
 under the wide we make it easy 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.850
 one more thing so i got used to it 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.810
 I always do it that I 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.120
 then only a joke 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.770
 on the one hand is designed for firming optionally is 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.530
 the bottom then I press that we the 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.110
 page and then lay down here easy 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.139
 the flash about it because the pages with 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.669
 the one with the bed before this 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.530
 softbox itself that's just always 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.510
 the flat the long side so once 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.740
 up here and one is to talk down and 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.270
 of course easier when it first opens 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.650
 one side is attached when that's on 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.660
 then you have to stick to both sides 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.160
 dear to the page make a purely the 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.900
 a bit difficult there you have to stop at 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.690
 take care a little bit of construction 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.340
 now I have attached to her with 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.020
 this covered or just too 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.580
 Do not even use it without you 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.440
 just go and do it too 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.090
 look a little better like that with the 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.960
 joke in it looks and then yes I can 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.910
 just start 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.070
 So the whole thing and as I said 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.870
 Let's demonstrate this on and off 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.130
 it will be this mechanism of on the 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.139
 put a page to the set up 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.120
 condition an extreme stability gives that 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.860
 would if I was amazed 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.389
 I have not seen anything like this before 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.760
 is really so strong to be so stiff 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.340
 can and on the other side has just 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.919
 even that just dismantle it all the time 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.260
 then back up again very easily 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.060
 a small pack size then accommodate 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.380
 Of course you can do it that way 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.270
 use that one has told her and 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.229
 christoph brocks well but me 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.060
 Of course, it can also be due now 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.880
 this attachment option must 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.560
 we also the possibility of this this 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.760
 Of course, I also use the box myself 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.930
 can have me so a bit just 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.800
 That's not a bit like that 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.650
 I think for example now 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.820
 just make the bag out of it 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.350
 practically just has it in addition and 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.950
 Now just put the box together 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.440
 would build 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.510
 although she is attached to the picture 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.160
 also funny with it but with it 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.690
 If you can do things then you must never 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.940
 Underestimate in photography 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.639
 Of course, always about light and if I am 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.380
 which somehow dedicates itself to a way 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.880
 made what looks extremely great and 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.250
 Wiegel looks like this is the poet 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.389
 It pretty much in German said it 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.160
 do not really care 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.660
 So you can also in the normal types the 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.070
 that for example just has to take 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.260
 think a little bit creatively 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.820
 be and then maybe then falls well 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.960
 sometimes one or the other so 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.150
 then you can with such things 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.960
 nor do completely different things so I 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.510
 it collected enough 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.870
 So you know that was here now 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:30.360
 the light rom az and that knox sak 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.110
 three poets said in our shop for 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.110
 pending lightning
