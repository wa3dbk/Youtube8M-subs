in<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.850> local<00:04:05.150> Baptist<00:04:05.630> Church<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:06.110> was<00:04:06.230> a

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
in the local Baptist Church it was a

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.990 
in the local Baptist Church it was a
completely<00:04:06.620> secret<00:04:07.010> thing<00:04:07.310> in<00:04:07.700> advance

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
completely secret thing in advance

nobody knew it in

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.050 
nobody knew it in
so<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:09.930> separated<00:04:10.800> my<00:04:11.069> religious<00:04:11.700> beliefs

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
so I separated my religious beliefs

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.740 
so I separated my religious beliefs
totally<00:04:13.020> from<00:04:13.590> any<00:04:13.739> aspects<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.450> statehood<00:04:15.450> or

totally from any aspects of statehood or
governance<00:04:16.680> do<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.430> think<00:04:17.730> that<00:04:18.560> do<00:04:19.560> you

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
governance do you think that do you

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.970 
governance do you think that do you
think<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.130> troubling<00:04:20.639> now<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.850> see<00:04:21.980> people

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
think it is troubling now to see people

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.980 
think it is troubling now to see people
running<00:04:23.310> for<00:04:23.490> president<00:04:23.550> doing<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.660> by

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
running for president doing so by

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.310 
running for president doing so by
essentially<00:04:26.389> preaching<00:04:27.389> sermons<00:04:27.570> by<00:04:27.930> talking

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
essentially preaching sermons by talking

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.629 
essentially preaching sermons by talking
about<00:04:28.500> their<00:04:28.680> faith<00:04:28.889> as<00:04:29.070> if<00:04:29.220> that<00:04:29.400> is<00:04:29.520> a

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
about their faith as if that is a

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.400 
about their faith as if that is a
qualification<00:04:30.030> I<00:04:30.300> believe<00:04:30.510> us<00:04:30.690> I<00:04:30.840> think<00:04:30.990> in<00:04:31.320> a

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
qualification I believe us I think in a

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.150 
qualification I believe us I think in a
in<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.850> slight<00:04:32.850> way<00:04:33.180> it's<00:04:33.510> even

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
in a slight way it's even

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.740 
in a slight way it's even
unconstitutional<00:04:35.160> for<00:04:36.090> an<00:04:36.330> incumbent

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
unconstitutional for an incumbent

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.950 
unconstitutional for an incumbent
president<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:38.190> claim<00:04:39.350> that<00:04:40.350> his<00:04:40.980> own<00:04:41.310> faith

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
president to claim that his own faith

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.650 
president to claim that his own faith
should<00:04:42.960> prevail<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.880> in<00:04:44.880> other<00:04:45.090> faiths<00:04:45.419> are

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
should prevail and in other faiths are

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.210 
should prevail and in other faiths are
not<00:04:46.910> warranting<00:04:47.910> equal<00:04:48.690> treatment<00:04:49.040> under<00:04:50.040> the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
not warranting equal treatment under the

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.310 
not warranting equal treatment under the
laws<00:04:50.430> under<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:51.270> president's<00:04:51.690> policies<00:04:52.139> I

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
laws under the president's policies I

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.409 
laws under the president's policies I
think<00:04:52.590> that's<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.610> know<00:04:53.729> it<00:04:53.970> may<00:04:54.090> not<00:04:54.270> be<00:04:54.389> a

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
think that's a you know it may not be a

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.760 
think that's a you know it may not be a
legal<00:04:54.750> violation<00:04:55.169> of<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.290> Constitution<00:04:55.710> but

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
legal violation of the Constitution but

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.159 
legal violation of the Constitution but
I<00:04:55.860> think<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.100> violates<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.490> First<00:04:56.729> Amendment

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
I think it violates the First Amendment

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.330 
I think it violates the First Amendment
separation<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:58.290> I<00:04:58.560> think<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.919> other<00:04:59.160> thing

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
separation and I think the other thing

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.010 
separation and I think the other thing
is<00:04:59.490> that<00:04:59.700> we<00:04:59.990> have<00:05:00.990> seen<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:03.060> what<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:03.660> consider

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
is that we have seen the what I consider

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.140 
is that we have seen the what I consider
to<00:05:04.110> be<00:05:04.139> an<00:05:04.320> unwarranted<00:05:05.100> intrusion<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:05.850> the

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
to be an unwarranted intrusion of the

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.440 
to be an unwarranted intrusion of the
religious<00:05:06.950> community<00:05:07.970> into<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.000> political

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
religious community into the political

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.719 
religious community into the political
campaigns<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.340> think<00:05:11.460> both<00:05:11.930> the

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
campaigns so I think both the

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.980 
campaigns so I think both the
president's<00:05:14.729> using<00:05:15.030> his<00:05:15.180> power<00:05:15.419> to<00:05:15.780> promote

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
president's using his power to promote

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.620 
president's using his power to promote
Christianity<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:17.120> Christians<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.180> use<00:05:18.419> their

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
Christianity and Christians to use their

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.730 
Christianity and Christians to use their
power<00:05:18.840> to<00:05:19.020> try<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.200> get<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.560> particular

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
power to try to get that particular

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.980 
power to try to get that particular
chosen<00:05:20.370> person<00:05:20.760> to<00:05:21.270> be<00:05:21.419> in<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.660> White<00:05:21.810> House

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
chosen person to be in the White House

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.680 
chosen person to be in the White House
both<00:05:22.620> violate<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.430> principles<00:05:23.850> that<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.150> tried

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
both violate the principles that I tried

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.420 
both violate the principles that I tried
to<00:05:24.720> observe<00:05:25.470> when<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:25.740> was<00:05:25.890> in<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.100> White<00:05:26.280> House

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
to observe when I was in the White House

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.090 
to observe when I was in the White House
do<00:05:27.000> you<00:05:27.210> think<00:05:27.660> that<00:05:27.930> one<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:28.919> leading

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
do you think that one of the leading

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.460 
do you think that one of the leading
contenders<00:05:29.550> for<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.729> Republican<00:05:30.210> nomination

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
contenders for the Republican nomination

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.980 
contenders for the Republican nomination
is<00:05:31.470> Mitt<00:05:31.919> Romney<00:05:32.310> who<00:05:33.120> is<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.270> Mormon<00:05:33.690> he<00:05:33.870> would

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
is Mitt Romney who is a Mormon he would

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.080 
is Mitt Romney who is a Mormon he would
be<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.260> first<00:05:34.490> Mormon<00:05:35.490> nominee<00:05:35.910> for

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
be the first Mormon nominee for

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.909 
be the first Mormon nominee for
president<00:05:36.270> do<00:05:36.990> you<00:05:37.050> think<00:05:37.380> that<00:05:37.680> we<00:05:37.889> have

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
president do you think that we have

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.210 
president do you think that we have
progressed<00:05:38.729> far<00:05:39.150> enough<00:05:39.360> as<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:40.680> country<00:05:41.100> in

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
progressed far enough as a country in

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.850 
progressed far enough as a country in
terms<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.639> recognizing<00:05:42.590> religion<00:05:43.590> as<00:05:43.710> no

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
terms of recognizing religion as no
