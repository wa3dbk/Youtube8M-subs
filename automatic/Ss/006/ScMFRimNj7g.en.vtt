00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
as we're on a standard ECU I think it's

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.460 
as we're on a standard ECU I think it's
superb<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.780> they<00:02:08.810> get<00:02:08.960> a<00:02:08.990> bit<00:02:09.140> more<00:02:09.229> power

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
superb and they get a bit more power

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
superb and they get a bit more power
then<00:02:10.060> watch<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.210> space
