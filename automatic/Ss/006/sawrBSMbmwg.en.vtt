00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.040
 chains to whom we challenge 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.900

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.760
 have to take up the challenge and in this 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.770
 video it's me who will introduce you 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.910
 the challenge I'm going to ask you to 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.440
 pick up and watch the video 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.170
 until the end we will see 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.030
 the challenge that will launch you so here 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.320
 little precision about challenges we 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.180
 same we had never done before 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.030
 this is the first time and dr alex has 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.750
 chose what so I chose the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.310
 bench press the maximum weight a 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.189
 pushed in three minutes 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.869
 so it's very simple you put three 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.700
 minutes on chrono and in three minutes 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.619
 you will have to push the most 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.150
 kilos you can load the boat this 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.950
 that you want you can discharge it 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.999
 and charged it for three minutes 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.499
 no problem 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.299
 you have to make complete dreams 

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.799
 that is to say down the bar touching 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.140
 the chest is towards the arms 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.789
 completely without help setting the bar and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.009
 took off without help 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.049
 you can of course redo 100 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.049
 kg to 10 kg to 20 kg as you want 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.969
 but in the end we make dreams total 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.670
 pushed with the number of kilos it takes 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.009
 and it will be and forgive it will be the one who 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.899
 will have pushed the most pounds here to 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.159
 send of course the losses you 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.329
 made both men and women is 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.490
 will score the best results 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.439
 it's gone with his shows ciociu fact 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.479
 a little explanation about the barthe has 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.380
 chose the weights all right ok well that's it 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.380
 the players to the ego 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.020
 ok you deny the heat alex there ok 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.759
 so excluded a little this bar there so that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.420
 it's a 15 kg bar got closer 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.760
 of me it is a 15 kg bar so me 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.010
 I chose to start with 100 kg 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.890
 so started but at the pen pass 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.810
 then as soon as stÃ©phanie I go to 80 kg 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.630
 and the little more people I spend at 50 kg 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.600
 to finish so the bar did 15 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.940
 kilos we did we put 2 5 and 2 5 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.030
 on each side ok ok so that makes 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.120
 5 kg to get to 20 with there 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.100
 then he has 15 kg and 15 kg of flesh 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.819
 side it's 3 points 50 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.690
 it happens that I would finish 295 and 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.480
 15 again and finally 10 and 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.970
 10 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.629
 that make sense so I make a 100 kg to 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.760
 81 kg then at 50 hockey this party you are 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.930
 hot hot hot ever made i think 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.939
 that I took a strategy 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.829
 you will benefit me I hope in any case 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.159
 we tear them off a body 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.159
 times 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:26.810
