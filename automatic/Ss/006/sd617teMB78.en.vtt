00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
well as diesel go but what makes it

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.200 
well as diesel go but what makes it
really<00:03:56.800> special<00:03:56.950> is<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.580> fact<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:57.850> it<00:03:58.000> works

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
really special is the fact that it works

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.970 
really special is the fact that it works
brilliantly<00:03:58.510> well<00:03:59.140> with<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.440> HP<00:03:59.860> the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
brilliantly well with the HP the

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
the gears are changing and we've done

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.460 
the gears are changing and we've done
what<00:04:03.550> about<00:04:03.850> 140<00:04:04.570> kilometers<00:04:04.990> already<00:04:05.260> today

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
what about 140 kilometers already today

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.560 
what about 140 kilometers already today
and<00:04:05.770> you<00:04:06.460> just<00:04:06.730> don't<00:04:06.940> know<00:04:07.120> when<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:07.390> gears

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
and you just don't know when the gears

lineup<00:06:59.740> later<00:07:00.070> on<00:07:00.310> overall<00:07:01.150> I<00:07:01.300> think<00:07:01.390> the

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
lineup later on overall I think the

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.660 
lineup later on overall I think the
third<00:07:01.870> generation<00:07:02.230> x5<00:07:02.620> totally<00:07:03.160> rocks<00:07:03.400> and

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670 
third generation x5 totally rocks and

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.490 
third generation x5 totally rocks and
when<00:07:03.940> BMW<00:07:04.090> brings<00:07:04.630> this<00:07:04.750> to<00:07:04.810> India<00:07:05.230> I<00:07:05.380> think

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:05.500 
when BMW brings this to India I think

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.620 
when BMW brings this to India I think
this<00:07:05.950> will<00:07:06.070> cause<00:07:06.280> quite<00:07:06.640> a<00:07:06.940> stir<00:07:07.270> in<00:07:07.510> the

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630 
this will cause quite a stir in the

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.650 
this will cause quite a stir in the
premium<00:07:08.050> SUV<00:07:08.290> segment
