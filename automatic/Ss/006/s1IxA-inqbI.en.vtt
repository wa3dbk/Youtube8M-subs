00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
so we can move forward as opposed to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.859 
so we can move forward as opposed to
just<00:01:25.860> sweeping<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.820> under<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.119> rug<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.720> don't

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
just sweeping it under the rug you don't

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
just sweeping it under the rug you don't
erase<00:01:28.259> history<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:29.070> things<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.460> happen

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
erase history because things that happen

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.980 
erase history because things that happen
in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> past<00:01:29.909> happened<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.720> could<00:01:30.869> learn

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
in the past happened so we could learn

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
from them they happen so we cannot make

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.910
