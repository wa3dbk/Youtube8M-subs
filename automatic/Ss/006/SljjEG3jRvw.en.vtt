let's<00:01:56.460> try<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.820> he's<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.299> be

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
let's try them out he's not going to be

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.120 
let's try them out he's not going to be
better<00:01:57.540> than<00:01:57.780> alaba<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> don't<00:01:58.619> want<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.920> put

better than alaba so I don't want to put
him<00:01:59.250> there<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.149> maybe<00:02:00.570> he'll<00:02:00.869> do<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> better

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
him there but maybe he'll do a better

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.020 
him there but maybe he'll do a better
job<00:02:01.380> than<00:02:01.680> Rafi<00:02:01.950> Nia's<00:02:02.159> doing<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.670> we're<00:02:02.939> going

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
job than Rafi Nia's doing so we're going

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.399

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
potentially you know change the squad up

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.690 
potentially you know change the squad up
depending<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.200> whether<00:02:07.350> how<00:02:07.560> well<00:02:08.429> he<00:02:08.550> does

it's worth hundreds of thousands of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.460 
it's worth hundreds of thousands of
coins<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.510> because<00:02:16.720> he<00:02:16.810> has<00:02:16.930> informed

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.479 
mackay-steven but then the rest of the
team<00:02:19.959> was<00:02:20.110> absolutely<00:02:20.530> trash<00:02:20.799> I<00:02:21.010> say<00:02:21.280> that

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
team was absolutely trash I say that

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
though and then I go behind because

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.300

horrible<00:02:24.459> past<00:02:24.849> whenever<00:02:25.150> dosti<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.599> think

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
horrible past whenever dosti I think

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.300 
horrible past whenever dosti I think
they're<00:02:25.989> actually<00:02:26.379> cost<00:02:26.769> me<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.980> goal<00:02:27.129> and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
they're actually cost me the goal and

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.649 
they're actually cost me the goal and
then<00:02:27.580> he<00:02:27.670> gets<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.909> little<00:02:28.030> bit<00:02:28.209> lucky<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.599> you

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
then he gets a little bit lucky as you

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.270 
then he gets a little bit lucky as you
can<00:02:28.780> see<00:02:28.959> there<00:02:29.170> he<00:02:29.260> managed<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.530> get<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:29.829> second

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280
