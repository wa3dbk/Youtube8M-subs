00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
okay some things you need for that are

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.139 
okay some things you need for that are
you<00:00:41.540> need<00:00:41.660> a<00:00:41.750> computer<00:00:42.820> with<00:00:43.820> a<00:00:43.850> firewire<00:00:44.510> port

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
you need a computer with a firewire port

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.100 
you need a computer with a firewire port
well<00:00:47.149> sometimes<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:49.250> might<00:00:49.400> be<00:00:49.550> saying<00:00:50.110> what

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
well sometimes you might be saying what

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.450 
well sometimes you might be saying what
if<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:51.230> don't<00:00:51.290> even<00:00:51.440> know<00:00:51.620> what<00:00:51.740> firewire<00:00:52.160> port

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
if I don't even know what firewire port

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.660 
if I don't even know what firewire port
is<00:00:52.580> first<00:00:53.360> let<00:00:53.450> me<00:00:53.510> explain<00:00:53.810> that<00:00:54.670> firewire

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
is first let me explain that firewire

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.640 
is first let me explain that firewire
ports<00:00:56.090> allow<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.630> edit<00:00:56.810> video<00:00:57.079> on<00:00:57.440> your

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
ports allow you to edit video on your

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.500 
ports allow you to edit video on your
computer

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
computer

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.200 
computer
one<00:00:59.510> of<00:00:59.630> the<00:00:59.690> ways<00:00:59.810> you<00:00:59.840> can<00:01:00.079> edit<00:01:00.260> video<00:01:00.940> Mac's

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
one of the ways you can edit video Mac's

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.719 
one of the ways you can edit video Mac's
use<00:01:03.110> USB<00:01:04.180> but<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.329> faster<00:01:06.049> way<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.680> doing<00:01:07.610> that

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
use USB but the faster way of doing that

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.840 
use USB but the faster way of doing that
is<00:01:08.000> by<00:01:08.210> doing<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.780> by<00:01:09.140> firewire<00:01:09.950> what<00:01:10.729> if<00:01:10.790> I

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
is by doing it by firewire what if I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.740 
is by doing it by firewire what if I
don't<00:01:11.030> have<00:01:11.149> a<00:01:11.180> firewire<00:01:11.630> on<00:01:11.810> my<00:01:12.159> computer

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
don't have a firewire on my computer

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.960 
don't have a firewire on my computer
well<00:01:14.750> that's<00:01:15.259> where<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:16.399> little<00:01:16.790> thingy

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
well that's where this little thingy

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.559 
well that's where this little thingy
comes<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.869> use<00:01:18.340> this<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.549> firewire<00:01:20.060> PCI

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
comes in to use this is a firewire PCI

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:27.090 
comes in to use this is a firewire PCI
card<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.710> it<00:01:22.609> is<00:01:22.759> used<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:24.850> give<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:26.090> firewire

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
card and it is used to give you firewire

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.499 
card and it is used to give you firewire
on<00:01:28.100> your<00:01:28.340> computer<00:01:28.700> if<00:01:28.819> you<00:01:28.880> don't<00:01:29.090> have<00:01:29.270> any

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
on your computer if you don't have any

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.929 
on your computer if you don't have any
this<00:01:30.409> is<00:01:30.590> what<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> firewire<00:01:31.219> port<00:01:31.549> looks<00:01:31.700> like

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
this is what a firewire port looks like

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.209 
this is what a firewire port looks like
just<00:01:32.209> in<00:01:32.270> case<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.539> were<00:01:32.630> wondering<00:01:33.219> usually

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
just in case you were wondering usually

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.789 
just in case you were wondering usually
Macintosh<00:01:34.789> has<00:01:34.999> come<00:01:35.240> with<00:01:35.389> them<00:01:35.569> and<00:01:35.799> they

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
Macintosh has come with them and they

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.199 
Macintosh has come with them and they
should<00:01:36.859> be<00:01:37.130> using<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.429> instead<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:37.939> us

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
should be using that instead of us

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.499 
should be using that instead of us
because<00:01:38.659> this<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.770> lot<00:01:40.039> fire<00:01:40.280> faster<00:01:41.270> and

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
because this is a lot fire faster and

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.499 
because this is a lot fire faster and
it's<00:01:41.600> specifically<00:01:42.380> designed<00:01:42.469> to<00:01:43.509> transfer

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
it's specifically designed to transfer

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.379 
it's specifically designed to transfer
radio<00:01:44.779> from<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.139> camera<00:01:45.529> to<00:01:45.649> your<00:01:45.740> computer

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
radio from a camera to your computer

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:52.419 
radio from a camera to your computer
well<00:01:47.389> this<00:01:48.049> is<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.229> PCI<00:01:48.619> card<00:01:48.709> and<00:01:50.409> how<00:01:51.429> I'm

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
well this is a PCI card and how I'm

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.190 
well this is a PCI card and how I'm
gonna<00:01:52.549> explain<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.149> how<00:01:53.749> to<00:01:53.810> put<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.109> in

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
gonna explain to you how to put it in

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.349 
gonna explain to you how to put it in
your<00:01:54.289> computer<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:54.920> how<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.189> install<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.179> they

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
your computer and how to install it they

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.089 
your computer and how to install it they
were<00:01:56.450> set<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:56.749> up<00:01:57.219> so<00:01:59.289> when<00:02:00.289> I<00:02:00.319> got<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.829> it

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
were set it up so when I got this it

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:08.080 
were set it up so when I got this it
came<00:02:01.310> with<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.729> firewire<00:02:04.479> cable<00:02:05.859> this<00:02:06.859> is<00:02:07.249> the<00:02:07.789> 6

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
came with a firewire cable this is the 6

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.480 
came with a firewire cable this is the 6
pin<00:02:08.360> side<00:02:10.750> where<00:02:11.750> your<00:02:11.959> plug<00:02:12.200> where<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:13.250> plug

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
pin side where your plug where you plug

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.699 
pin side where your plug where you plug
into<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:15.050> demonstrate<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.560> for

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
into that and I can demonstrate that for

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.960 
into that and I can demonstrate that for
you

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.240 

so<00:02:23.970> here's<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> six<00:02:24.569> pin<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:25.620> just<00:02:25.830> simply

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
so here's the six pin and it just simply

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.910 
so here's the six pin and it just simply
just<00:02:26.670> plugs<00:02:27.510> beautifully<00:02:28.610> into<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> port

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
just plugs beautifully into the port

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.110 
just plugs beautifully into the port
okay<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.760> here<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.110> 4<00:02:37.349> pin<00:02:37.620> side<00:02:38.120> that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
okay and here is the 4 pin side that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.039 
okay and here is the 4 pin side that
plugs<00:02:39.360> into<00:02:39.540> your<00:02:39.659> camera<00:02:41.360> ok<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.420> now<00:02:42.959> I'm

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
plugs into your camera ok so now I'm

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.809 
plugs into your camera ok so now I'm
gonna<00:02:43.170> explain<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.680> how<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.010> set<00:02:44.159> it<00:02:44.370> how

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
gonna explain to you how to set it how

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.170 
gonna explain to you how to set it how
to<00:02:44.940> put<00:02:45.299> in<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.659> piece<00:02:45.840> PCI<00:02:46.650> firewire<00:02:47.519> card<00:02:48.200> well

black one is usually black that's your

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.479 
black one is usually black that's your
rim<00:03:07.500> but<00:03:07.769> we're<00:03:08.010> not<00:03:08.129> going<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.310> talk<00:03:08.430> about

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
rim but we're not going to talk about

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.440 
rim but we're not going to talk about
that<00:03:08.930> okay<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.530> PCI<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.579> have<00:03:12.000> two<00:03:12.390> of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
that okay so this is PCI I have two of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.770 
that okay so this is PCI I have two of
them<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.840> my<00:03:12.870> computer<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:14.329> I'm<00:03:15.329> gonna<00:03:15.569> show

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
them in my computer and I'm gonna show

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.630 
them in my computer and I'm gonna show
you<00:03:15.840> how<00:03:16.079> to<00:03:16.109> do<00:03:16.400> put<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.519> in<00:03:18.799> so<00:03:19.799> hopefully<00:03:20.280> you

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
you how to do put it in so hopefully you

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.240 
you how to do put it in so hopefully you
can<00:03:20.700> see<00:03:21.620> what<00:03:22.620> I'm<00:03:22.739> doing<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:24.180> if<00:03:24.389> not<00:03:25.099> I'll<00:03:26.099> be

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
can see what I'm doing is if not I'll be

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.440 
can see what I'm doing is if not I'll be
mad<00:03:26.430> okay<00:03:27.169> so<00:03:28.169> you<00:03:28.620> take<00:03:28.829> your<00:03:28.859> firewire<00:03:29.549> PCI

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
mad okay so you take your firewire PCI

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.979 
mad okay so you take your firewire PCI
card<00:03:31.280> before<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.730> put<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.299> in<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:33.750> want<00:03:33.900> to

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
card before you put it in you want to

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.659 
card before you put it in you want to
make<00:03:34.049> sure<00:03:34.169> your<00:03:34.410> computer<00:03:34.829> is<00:03:34.859> off<00:03:35.099> because

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
make sure your computer is off because

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:36.759 
make sure your computer is off because
if<00:03:36.000> it's<00:03:36.150> running

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
if it's running

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.869 
if it's running
there's<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.889> high<00:03:38.099> chance<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:38.760> getting

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
there's a high chance of you getting

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.170 
there's a high chance of you getting
shocked<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:40.519> think<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.609> guys<00:03:41.760> would<00:03:41.970> want

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
shocked and I think you guys would want

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.869 
shocked and I think you guys would want
that<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:43.530> turn<00:03:43.799> off<00:03:43.950> your<00:03:44.129> computer<00:03:44.280> that's

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
that so turn off your computer that's

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.890 
that so turn off your computer that's
what<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.090> do<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.480> then<00:03:47.239> then<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.269> get<00:03:48.660> your

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
what you do and then then you get your

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.680 
what you do and then then you get your
card<00:03:49.650> okay<00:03:51.079> then<00:03:52.079> what<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.560> do<00:03:52.910> how<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:53.940> plug

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
card okay then what you do how you plug

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.379 
card okay then what you do how you plug
it<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:55.079> and<00:03:55.319> set<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.650> up<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.910> what<00:03:57.209> we'll<00:03:57.359> be

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
it in and set it up is what we'll be

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.750 
it in and set it up is what we'll be
following<00:03:57.690> next<00:03:59.150> so<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.660> take<00:04:00.870> your<00:04:01.049> card<00:04:01.260> and

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
following next so you take your card and

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.670 
following next so you take your card and
you<00:04:02.760> put<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.269> so<00:04:04.199> that<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:06.480> port<00:04:06.840> side<00:04:07.650> of

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
you put it in so that the port side of

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.689 
you put it in so that the port side of
it<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:09.540> port<00:04:09.810> side<00:04:10.079> this<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.220> port<00:04:11.489> side

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
it the port side this is the port side

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.449 
it the port side this is the port side
by<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.879> way<00:04:12.379> you<00:04:13.379> do<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.949> port<00:04:14.190> side<00:04:14.340> is

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
by the way you do it so the port side is

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.560 
by the way you do it so the port side is
facing<00:04:14.609> outward

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.650 

now<00:04:19.170> there<00:04:19.560> should<00:04:19.800> be<00:04:20.030> stick<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.150> inside<00:04:21.270> here

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
now there should be stick it inside here

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.700 
now there should be stick it inside here
for<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.870> second<00:04:22.170> there<00:04:22.980> should<00:04:23.190> be<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:24.090> little

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.730 

this<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:29.310> see<00:04:29.490> this<00:04:29.670> thing<00:04:29.880> right<00:04:30.030> here<00:04:30.060> that

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
this you see this thing right here that

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.480 
this you see this thing right here that
allows<00:04:31.740> PCI<00:04:32.220> slots<00:04:33.180> come<00:04:33.540> in<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:35.070> should<00:04:35.310> be<00:04:35.340> on

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
allows PCI slots come in it should be on

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.220 
allows PCI slots come in it should be on
the<00:04:35.550> inside<00:04:35.610> computer<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:38.870> in<00:04:39.870> order<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.080> do

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
the inside computer and in order to do

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.850 
the inside computer and in order to do
that

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
that

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.240 
that
take<00:04:41.160> off<00:04:41.340> your<00:04:42.180> your<00:04:42.990> side<00:04:43.260> or<00:04:43.500> just<00:04:43.650> hop<00:04:43.980> or

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
take off your your side or just hop or

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.150 
take off your your side or just hop or
whatever<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:46.410> that<00:04:46.680> should<00:04:46.830> be<00:04:46.890> pretty<00:04:47.070> easy

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
whatever and that should be pretty easy

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.220 
whatever and that should be pretty easy
to<00:04:47.520> do<00:04:49.400> so<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.460> take<00:04:50.640> your<00:04:50.670> port<00:04:51.030> side<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.570> you

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
to do so you take your port side and you

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.910 
to do so you take your port side and you
plug<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.800> get<00:04:52.980> a<00:04:53.010> little<00:04:53.070> bush<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:54.800> tell<00:04:55.800> you

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
plug it to get a little bush I tell you

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.450 
plug it to get a little bush I tell you
it<00:04:56.370> snaps<00:04:56.730> in<00:04:56.940> like<00:04:56.970> that<00:04:57.240> we<00:04:57.780> have<00:04:57.900> before<00:04:58.460> we

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
it snaps in like that we have before we

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.020 
it snaps in like that we have before we
have<00:04:59.670> we<00:05:00.480> now<00:05:00.660> have<00:05:01.020> this<00:05:01.610> firewire<00:05:02.610> port

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
have we now have this firewire port

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.750 
have we now have this firewire port
right<00:05:03.870> there

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
right there

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.280 
right there
and<00:05:05.760> of<00:05:05.940> course<00:05:06.180> there<00:05:06.660> are<00:05:06.690> other<00:05:06.930> different

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
and of course there are other different

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.830 
and of course there are other different
kinds<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:07.590> PCI<00:05:07.950> slots<00:05:08.340> make<00:05:09.090> sure<00:05:09.240> it's<00:05:09.390> tight

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
kinds of PCI slots make sure it's tight

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.630 
kinds of PCI slots make sure it's tight
knock<00:05:10.170> them<00:05:10.350> anywhere<00:05:10.710> it's<00:05:11.040> pretty<00:05:11.310> situated

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
knock them anywhere it's pretty situated

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.360 
knock them anywhere it's pretty situated
in<00:05:11.910> pretty<00:05:12.150> well<00:05:15.680> that's<00:05:16.680> really<00:05:17.010> secure

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
in pretty well that's really secure

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.030 
in pretty well that's really secure
that's<00:05:18.240> not<00:05:18.480> going<00:05:18.660> anywhere

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
that's not going anywhere

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.710 
that's not going anywhere

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
it also has an internal fire air port

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.000 
it also has an internal fire air port
right<00:05:21.870> there<00:05:21.900> because<00:05:22.290> it<00:05:22.500> tastes<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:22.950> know

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010

everything<00:05:23.610> anything<00:05:24.410> now<00:05:25.410> I'm<00:05:25.470> putting<00:05:26.000> the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
everything anything now I'm putting the

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:38.060 
everything anything now I'm putting the
side<00:05:29.040> cover<00:05:29.700> back<00:05:29.850> on<00:05:36.500> there's<00:05:37.500> a<00:05:37.620> possible

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
side cover back on there's a possible

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:50.300 
side cover back on there's a possible
past<00:05:38.310> trying<00:05:38.820> to<00:05:39.000> hold<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.330> camera<00:05:48.680> so<00:05:49.680> you

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
past trying to hold the camera so you

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.410 
past trying to hold the camera so you
put<00:05:50.520> the<00:05:50.610> top<00:05:50.850> on<00:05:52.250> as<00:05:53.250> follows<00:05:54.030> it's<00:05:54.240> pretty

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
put the top on as follows it's pretty

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:03.339
