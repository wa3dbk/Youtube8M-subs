00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
of my 5d Mark 3 workflow that has

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.879 
of my 5d Mark 3 workflow that has
changed<00:00:07.710> from<00:00:08.130> using<00:00:08.490> Final<00:00:08.760> Cut<00:00:08.820> Pro<00:00:08.940> 7<00:00:09.389> and

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
changed from using Final Cut Pro 7 and

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.990 
changed from using Final Cut Pro 7 and
transcoding<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.010> 5<00:00:11.190> beat<00:00:11.400> RGB<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
transcoding with 5 beat RGB and

switching to Final Cut Pro 10 the Final
Cut<00:00:17.730> Pro<00:00:17.850> 7<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.539> workflow<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.140> working<00:00:19.470> fine

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
Cut Pro 7 the workflow was working fine

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.349 
Cut Pro 7 the workflow was working fine
for<00:00:19.710> me<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:20.630> it<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:22.880> extremely<00:00:23.880> slow

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
for me but it was just extremely slow

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.170 
for me but it was just extremely slow
and<00:00:24.960> having<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.769> transcode<00:00:26.279> all<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> media

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
and having to transcode all the media

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.990 
and having to transcode all the media
and<00:00:27.810> basically<00:00:28.800> losing<00:00:29.250> hours<00:00:29.840> of<00:00:30.840> time

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
and basically losing hours of time

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.160 
and basically losing hours of time
transcoding<00:00:33.000> during<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> day<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.809> know<00:00:33.930> came

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
transcoding during the day you know came

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.479 
transcoding during the day you know came
to<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> point<00:00:34.620> where<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.920> had<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.280> make<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to a point where I had to make a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.850 
to a point where I had to make a
decision<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.260> whether<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> go<00:00:37.829> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
decision you know whether to go to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.080

the<00:00:53.789> old<00:00:53.910> way<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.300> doing<00:00:54.480> things<00:00:55.219> but<00:00:56.219> after

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the old way of doing things but after

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.040 
the old way of doing things but after
using<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.510> bit<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> month

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
using it for a little bit over a month

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
using it for a little bit over a month
I've<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:59.070> gotten<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.399> love<00:00:59.730> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I've really gotten to love it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.270 
I've really gotten to love it
and<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.260> straightforward<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and it's a really straightforward and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.570 
and it's a really straightforward and
simple<00:01:02.520> workflow<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
simple workflow and I think it's it's a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.660 
simple workflow and I think it's it's a
workflow<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.590> people<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.369> are

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
workflow that is for people that are

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.240 
workflow that is for people that are
editing<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.990> outputting<00:01:13.680> directly

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
editing and you know outputting directly

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
editing and you know outputting directly
to<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> web<00:01:14.869> for<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> web<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.439> people

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
to the web for the web you know people

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
to the web for the web you know people
that<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:16.950> doing<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.200> know

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that are doing you know you know

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
that are doing you know you know
high-end<00:01:19.860> projects<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.759> feature<00:01:21.000> films<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
high-end projects or feature films I

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.200 
high-end projects or feature films I
don't<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.960> Final<00:01:22.229> Cut<00:01:22.350> Pro<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:23.000> ready<00:01:24.000> for

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
don't think Final Cut Pro is ready for

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
don't think Final Cut Pro is ready for
that<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.960> people<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that but for people that are going to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.219 
that but for people that are going to
the<00:01:25.920> web<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.460> myself<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.630> perfect

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the web like myself it's a perfect

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.679 
the web like myself it's a perfect
workflow<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.640> let's<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:29.970> import<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> file

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
workflow so let's just import a file

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.370 
workflow so let's just import a file
here<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.610> only<00:01:32.759> thing<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.020> create

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
here the only thing I do here is create

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.880 
here the only thing I do here is create
optimized<00:01:35.009> media<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.540> takes<00:01:36.750> your<00:01:36.930> h.264

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
optimized media so this takes your h.264

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.880 
optimized media so this takes your h.264
and<00:01:37.920> transcodes<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.030> into<00:01:39.960> promise<00:01:40.380> 42<00:01:42.890> okay

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and transcodes it into promise 42 okay

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.219 
and transcodes it into promise 42 okay
let's<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.189> take<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.899> portion<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
let's just take a little portion of a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
let's just take a little portion of a
clip<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:47.600> load<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> into<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> timeline<00:01:50.030> okay

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
clip here load it into the timeline okay

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.840 
clip here load it into the timeline okay
so<00:01:51.090> once<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.720> man<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.460> saying<00:01:53.729> I'm

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
so once it's a man that you saying I'm

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.969 
so once it's a man that you saying I'm
finished<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.630> my<00:01:54.810> inner<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.740> notice

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
finished this is my inner you can notice

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.270 
finished this is my inner you can notice
here<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.369> actually<00:01:56.520> transporting<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
here it's actually transporting in the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.420 
here it's actually transporting in the
background<00:01:59.280> so<00:02:00.030> that's<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.689> quickly<00:02:01.110> done

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
background so that's really quickly done

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.910 
background so that's really quickly done

okay let's just do let's apply a little
color<00:02:05.189> correction<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.299> quick<00:02:06.810> little

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
color correction here a quick little

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.360 

okay<00:02:12.069> just<00:02:12.940> raise<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.510> exposure<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
okay just raise the exposure get the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.020 
okay just raise the exposure get the
most<00:02:15.640> out<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.300> dynamic<00:02:16.540> range<00:02:17.730> lower<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
most out of the dynamic range lower the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.300 
most out of the dynamic range lower the
blacks

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
blacks

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.040 
blacks
raise<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.580> lights<00:02:24.030> slower<00:02:25.030> than<00:02:25.360> bit<00:02:25.540> tones<00:02:25.840> a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
raise the lights slower than bit tones a

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.620 
raise the lights slower than bit tones a
little<00:02:26.440> bit<00:02:27.300> okay

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.110 

okay<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.810> looks<00:02:34.900> pretty<00:02:35.140> good<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> that's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
okay that looks pretty good so that's

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.290 
okay that looks pretty good so that's
the<00:02:40.660> before<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.950> after<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
the before this is the after so just the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.110 
the before this is the after so just the
basic<00:02:43.750> primary<00:02:44.050> career<00:02:44.730> direction<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:45.910> just

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
basic primary career direction for just

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.090 
basic primary career direction for just
an<00:02:46.239> example<00:02:46.780> there<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.290> once<00:02:47.560> I've<00:02:47.739> corrected

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
an example there so once I've corrected

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.340 
an example there so once I've corrected
and<00:02:49.080> usually<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.110> apply<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:51.390> another<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.540> usually

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
and usually I apply a another I usually

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.930 
and usually I apply a another I usually
apply<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.650> sharpening<00:02:55.890> mask<00:02:56.890> or<00:02:57.130> something<00:02:57.550> but

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
apply a sharpening mask or something but

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.550 
apply a sharpening mask or something but
for<00:02:58.269> this<00:02:58.390> example<00:02:58.569> we<00:02:58.959> don't<00:02:59.140> have<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.410> do

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
for this example we don't have to do

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.160 
for this example we don't have to do
that<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.030> next<00:03:01.180> thing<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.600> like<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.900> do<00:03:02.050> is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
that and the next thing I like to do is

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.280 
that and the next thing I like to do is
reduce<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.739> noise<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:04.030> use<00:03:04.300> neat<00:03:04.750> videos

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
reduce the noise and I use neat videos

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.979 
reduce the noise and I use neat videos
noise<00:03:06.069> reduction<00:03:06.340> tool<00:03:07.440> let's<00:03:08.440> launch<00:03:08.680> that

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
noise reduction tool let's launch that

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.199 
noise reduction tool let's launch that
and<00:03:10.989> as<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:11.950> can<00:03:12.069> see<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.610> neat<00:03:12.819> video

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
and as you can see the neat video

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.479 
and as you can see the neat video
plug-in<00:03:13.840> even<00:03:14.319> if<00:03:14.440> you've<00:03:14.620> applied<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.040> color

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
plug-in even if you've applied a color

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.750 
plug-in even if you've applied a color
crush<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.299> actually<00:03:17.370> takes<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.579> raw

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
crush and it actually takes the raw

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.020 
crush and it actually takes the raw
image<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.870> reduce<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.350> noise<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.310> can

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
image to reduce the noise so you can

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.720 
image to reduce the noise so you can
either<00:03:22.380> reduce<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.680> noise<00:03:23.799> first<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.610> in

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
either reduce the noise first and in

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.759 
either reduce the noise first and in
apply<00:03:25.000> color<00:03:25.720> correction<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.230> reason<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.590> like

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
apply color correction the reason I like

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.650 
apply color correction the reason I like
to<00:03:26.799> apply<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.190> color<00:03:27.519> correction<00:03:27.850> first<00:03:28.299> is

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
to apply the color correction first is

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.690 
to apply the color correction first is
once<00:03:28.930> you've<00:03:29.079> applied<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.560> neat<00:03:29.769> video

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
once you've applied the neat video

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.009 
once you've applied the neat video
plug-in<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.450> kind<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.870> slows<00:03:32.769> down<00:03:33.040> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
plug-in it kind of slows down the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.170 
plug-in it kind of slows down the
computer<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.410> that's<00:03:35.829> just<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.250> prior<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.820> lot<00:03:37.030> of

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350

correction and we've done the noise
reduction<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.660> next<00:04:13.930> step<00:04:14.140> is<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.560> export<00:04:15.010> and
