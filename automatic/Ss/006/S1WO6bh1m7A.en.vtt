in hit FX he's better than I can in
MotoGP<00:01:01.390> so<00:01:03.250> they've<00:01:04.250> certainly<00:01:04.489> made<00:01:04.970> a

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
MotoGP so they've certainly made a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.149 
MotoGP so they've certainly made a
really<00:01:05.420> good<00:01:05.690> playable<00:01:06.200> model<00:01:06.590> here<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.040> the

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
really good playable model here and the

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.040 
really good playable model here and the
rider<00:01:07.370> moves<00:01:07.700> around<00:01:07.880> quite<00:01:08.360> well<00:01:08.390> obviously

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
rider moves around quite well obviously

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.649 
rider moves around quite well obviously
he<00:01:09.740> can<00:01:09.920> take<00:01:10.130> major<00:01:10.490> crashes<00:01:11.119> because<00:01:11.390> there

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
he can take major crashes because there

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.870 
he can take major crashes because there
wouldn't<00:01:11.780> be<00:01:11.869> much<00:01:12.049> point<00:01:12.350> otherwise<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:13.700> guy

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
wouldn't be much point otherwise the guy

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.910 
wouldn't be much point otherwise the guy
would<00:01:14.030> be<00:01:14.060> dead<00:01:14.299> every<00:01:14.630> five<00:01:14.869> minutes

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
would be dead every five minutes

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.039 
would be dead every five minutes
it's<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:16.460> quick<00:01:16.729> these<00:01:16.939> bikes<00:01:17.240> it's<00:01:17.540> difficult

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
it's so quick these bikes it's difficult

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.980 
it's so quick these bikes it's difficult
oiling<00:01:18.350> everything<00:01:18.799> but<00:01:19.689> picking<00:01:20.689> out

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
oiling everything but picking out

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.690 
oiling everything but picking out
gradually

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.280 

and<00:01:24.000> working<00:01:24.299> our<00:01:24.540> way<00:01:24.570> around<00:01:27.290> just

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and working our way around just

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.289 
and working our way around just
generally<00:01:28.770> getting<00:01:28.920> feel<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.090> can't

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
generally getting feel for it you can't

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
generally getting feel for it you can't
make<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> mistake<00:01:30.869> around<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.500> through<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
make a mistake around here through the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
make a mistake around here through the
lampposts<00:01:32.970> there's<00:01:33.119> no<00:01:33.270> problem

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960

think<00:01:36.899> that's<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.229> take<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> look<00:01:37.590> at<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.740> rider

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950

how<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.590> works<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.069> steering<00:02:02.520> wheel<00:02:02.549> I

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
how it works of a steering wheel I

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.749 
how it works of a steering wheel I
haven't<00:02:04.229> tried<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.130> developers<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
haven't tried it and the developers that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.419 
haven't tried it and the developers that
were<00:02:05.909> there<00:02:06.090> didn't<00:02:06.929> know<00:02:07.140> I've<00:02:07.950> been<00:02:08.190> playing

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
were there didn't know I've been playing

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.150 
were there didn't know I've been playing
it<00:02:08.549> with<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.729> controller<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.239> seems<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.160> could

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
it with the controller it seems so could

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.800 
it with the controller it seems so could
be<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> little<00:02:11.670> bit<00:02:11.880> tricky<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.269> play<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
be a little bit tricky to play with a

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.340 
be a little bit tricky to play with a
wheel<00:02:14.030> in<00:02:15.030> which<00:02:15.239> case<00:02:15.450> obviously<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:16.080> have<00:02:16.319> a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
wheel in which case obviously I have a

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.680 
wheel in which case obviously I have a
controller<00:02:16.890> plugged<00:02:17.160> into<00:02:17.340> my<00:02:17.549> PC<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.180> well<00:02:18.209> so

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
controller plugged into my PC as well so

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.620 
controller plugged into my PC as well so
I'd<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.380> skip<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:20.040> controller<00:02:20.519> play<00:02:20.850> for

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
I'd have to skip to controller play for

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.840 
I'd have to skip to controller play for
the<00:02:21.690> bikes<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.350> back<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.860> wheel<00:02:23.040> for

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
the bikes and then back to the wheel for

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.570 
the bikes and then back to the wheel for
the<00:02:24.360> cars<00:02:24.860> but<00:02:25.860> either<00:02:26.010> way<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.220> think<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.519> a

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
the cars but either way I think it's a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.160 
the cars but either way I think it's a
nice<00:02:26.700> addition<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.360> I'm<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.720> join<00:02:28.109> a

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
nice addition so I'm going to join a

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.440 
nice addition so I'm going to join a
race<00:02:28.859> I<00:02:29.100> think<00:02:29.130> set<00:02:29.579> up<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.730> race<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.269> a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
race I think set up a race in just a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.150 
race I think set up a race in just a
moment<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.640> corner<00:02:32.970> here<00:02:33.920> I've<00:02:34.920> been<00:02:35.130> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
moment and this corner here I've been a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.009 
moment and this corner here I've been a
long<00:02:35.370> time<00:02:35.609> since<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.030> played<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.450> crew<00:02:36.720> really

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
long time since I played the crew really

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.449 
long time since I played the crew really
quite<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> few<00:02:37.650> months<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.070> was<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.370> those

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
quite a few months it was one of those

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.349 
quite a few months it was one of those
games<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:39.030> meant<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.109> play<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.410> loads

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
games that meant to play it loads

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.670 
games that meant to play it loads
fortunately<00:02:42.359> I<00:02:42.390> wasn't<00:02:42.780> able<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.989> keep<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.470> at

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
fortunately I wasn't able to keep up at

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.560 
fortunately I wasn't able to keep up at
the<00:02:43.799> time<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.310> content<00:02:45.269> when<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.420> was

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the time with the content when it was

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.330 
the time with the content when it was
released<00:02:45.799> quite<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:46.920> way<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> would<00:02:47.250> have

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
released quite the way I would have

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.099 
released quite the way I would have
liked<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.910> kind<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.299> when<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.630> start<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.959> fall

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
liked and kind of when you start to fall

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.949 
liked and kind of when you start to fall
behind<00:02:49.260> on<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.590> game<00:02:49.769> like<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.840> kind<00:02:51.840> of

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
behind on a game like this you kind of

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.360 
behind on a game like this you kind of
almost<00:02:52.109> lose<00:02:52.350> interest<00:02:52.799> because<00:02:53.010> everyone's

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
almost lose interest because everyone's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.220 
almost lose interest because everyone's
got<00:02:53.489> better<00:02:53.880> cars<00:02:54.180> everyone's<00:02:54.720> been<00:02:54.870> all<00:02:54.959> over

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
got better cars everyone's been all over

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.479 
got better cars everyone's been all over
the<00:02:55.320> place<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.709> done<00:02:55.829> all<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:55.980> challenges

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
the place and done all the challenges

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.069 
the place and done all the challenges
you<00:02:56.730> sort<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:56.940> out<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.359> loop<00:02:57.570> as<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.930> were

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
you sort of out of the loop as it were

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.280 
you sort of out of the loop as it were
and<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:59.130> just<00:02:59.459> didn't<00:02:59.820> get<00:02:59.940> back<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.329> it<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.600> you

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
and I just didn't get back to it and you

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.539 
and I just didn't get back to it and you
know<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.620> gonna<00:03:01.799> really<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:02.190> me<00:03:02.370> back

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
know this is gonna really get me back

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.300 
know this is gonna really get me back
onto<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:03.090> here<00:03:03.600> I'm<00:03:03.750> setting<00:03:04.019> up<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.410> race<00:03:04.650> so

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
onto it here I'm setting up a race so

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
onto it here I'm setting up a race so
I'm<00:03:05.549> just<00:03:05.760> positioning<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.720> finish<00:03:07.049> line

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
I'm just positioning a finish line

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.640 
I'm just positioning a finish line
somewhere<00:03:08.720> as<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.810> sliding<00:03:10.049> actually<00:03:10.470> where

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
somewhere as you sliding actually where

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.990 
somewhere as you sliding actually where
to<00:03:10.859> where<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.430> race<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.440> can<00:03:13.769> just

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
to where to race and now I can just

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.300 
to where to race and now I can just
randomly<00:03:15.000> put<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> race<00:03:16.019> somewhere<00:03:19.310> generally

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
randomly put a race somewhere generally

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.800 
randomly put a race somewhere generally
it<00:03:20.370> will<00:03:20.459> follow<00:03:20.700> roads<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.299> if<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:21.480> go<00:03:21.600> well

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
it will follow roads but if you go well

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.259 
it will follow roads but if you go well
offroad<00:03:22.200> then<00:03:22.470> obviously<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:23.040> will<00:03:23.069> go<00:03:24.030> across

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
offroad then obviously it will go across

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.620 
offroad then obviously it will go across
country

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
country

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:33.360 
country

right what am I gonna do now me wanted
to<00:03:33.460> stretch<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.940> demo<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.510> am<00:03:34.630> aware<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:34.990> they

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
to stretch the demo I am aware that they

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.290 
to stretch the demo I am aware that they
only<00:03:35.470> have<00:03:35.740> a<00:03:35.770> certain<00:03:35.830> area<00:03:36.370> currently<00:03:37.150> in

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
only have a certain area currently in

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.210 
only have a certain area currently in
this<00:03:37.480> early<00:03:37.900> build<00:03:38.170> that<00:03:38.680> you're<00:03:38.830> supposed<00:03:39.130> to

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
this early build that you're supposed to

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.760 
this early build that you're supposed to
ride<00:03:39.460> around<00:03:39.790> but<00:03:40.060> I'm<00:03:40.180> always<00:03:40.360> looking<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:41.080> to

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
ride around but I'm always looking to to

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.610 
ride around but I'm always looking to to
get<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> edge<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.240> that<00:03:43.390> area<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.990> find

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
get to the edge of that area and find

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.950 
get to the edge of that area and find
something<00:03:44.830> that<00:03:45.010> nobody<00:03:45.520> else<00:03:45.610> has<00:03:45.820> seen<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.270> do

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
something that nobody else has seen I do

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.230 
something that nobody else has seen I do
have<00:03:47.170> another<00:03:47.320> video<00:03:47.650> coming<00:03:47.740> up<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:49.180> know

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
have another video coming up you know

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.580

this is in development so you will see
things<00:05:17.140> like<00:05:17.320> that<00:05:17.850> that's<00:05:18.850> a<00:05:19.510> lot<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:19.990> it

to all of this you know once we see a

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.350 
to all of this you know once we see a
final<00:05:23.770> build<00:05:24.070> in<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.310> few<00:05:24.490> months<00:05:24.760> time<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.000> I'm

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
final build in a few months time and I'm

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.140 
final build in a few months time and I'm
sure<00:05:25.390> lots<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.290> it<00:05:26.410> things<00:05:26.680> will<00:05:26.800> be<00:05:26.980> improved

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
sure lots of it things will be improved

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.360 
sure lots of it things will be improved
a<00:05:28.420> mr.<00:05:29.230> checkpoint<00:05:29.680> that's<00:05:29.920> one<00:05:30.100> thing<00:05:30.280> as

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
a mr. checkpoint that's one thing as

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.520 
a mr. checkpoint that's one thing as
well<00:05:30.580> with<00:05:30.880> their<00:05:31.060> bikes<00:05:31.300> is<00:05:31.690> because<00:05:32.020> of<00:05:32.230> the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
well with their bikes is because of the

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.140 
well with their bikes is because of the
vehicles<00:05:32.890> a<00:05:32.950> bit<00:05:33.040> narrower

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
vehicles a bit narrower

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.110 
vehicles a bit narrower
takes<00:05:34.720> up<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:35.020> smaller<00:05:35.980> contact<00:05:36.520> patches<00:05:37.000> of

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
takes up a smaller contact patches of

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.940 
takes up a smaller contact patches of
work<00:05:37.300> and<00:05:37.840> you've<00:05:38.140> got<00:05:38.290> to<00:05:38.380> really<00:05:38.500> be<00:05:38.680> quite

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
work and you've got to really be quite

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.500 
work and you've got to really be quite
precise<00:05:39.340> from<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.580> check<00:05:39.790> points<00:05:40.150> I<00:05:40.270> found

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
precise from the check points I found

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.760 
precise from the check points I found
there<00:05:41.460> so<00:05:43.110> as<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.200> can<00:05:44.290> see<00:05:44.350> I<00:05:44.500> like<00:05:44.680> the

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
there so as you can see I like the

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.370 
there so as you can see I like the
weight<00:05:44.920> stands<00:05:45.340> up<00:05:45.460> on<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.730> bike<00:05:46.290> and<00:05:47.290> of

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
weight stands up on the bike and of

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.870 
weight stands up on the bike and of
course<00:05:47.560> if<00:05:47.710> you<00:05:47.830> push<00:05:48.130> forward<00:05:48.400> he'll<00:05:48.700> lean

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
course if you push forward he'll lean

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.610 
course if you push forward he'll lean
forward<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.480> you<00:05:49.930> know<00:05:50.050> when<00:05:50.230> you're<00:05:50.380> in<00:05:50.410> a

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
forward and you know when you're in a

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.240 
forward and you know when you're in a
tough<00:05:50.800> position<00:05:50.980> for<00:05:51.280> racing<00:05:52.830> on<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:53.950> the<00:05:54.040> salt

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
tough position for racing on to the salt

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.990 
tough position for racing on to the salt
flats<00:05:56.040> this<00:05:57.040> was<00:05:57.190> just<00:05:57.370> it's<00:05:57.610> just<00:05:57.820> turned

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
flats this was just it's just turned

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.510 
flats this was just it's just turned
into<00:05:58.180> a<00:05:58.270> little<00:05:58.510> exploration<00:05:59.500> of<00:06:00.040> this<00:06:00.160> area

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
into a little exploration of this area

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.920 
into a little exploration of this area
but<00:06:00.700> you<00:06:00.760> can<00:06:00.940> see<00:06:01.120> for<00:06:01.330> yourselves<00:06:01.660> you<00:06:01.810> know

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
but you can see for yourselves you know

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.020 
but you can see for yourselves you know
the<00:06:02.140> visuals<00:06:02.470> have<00:06:02.560> improved<00:06:02.950> regarding<00:06:03.940> the

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
the visuals have improved regarding the

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.930 
the visuals have improved regarding the
physics<00:06:04.650> the<00:06:05.650> monster<00:06:06.190> truck<00:06:06.400> certainly<00:06:06.820> had

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
physics the monster truck certainly had

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.340 
physics the monster truck certainly had
a<00:06:06.970> bit<00:06:07.150> more<00:06:07.300> realism<00:06:07.630> to<00:06:07.780> it<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.170> way<00:06:08.290> it

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
a bit more realism to it the way it

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.790 
a bit more realism to it the way it
worked<00:06:08.640> the<00:06:09.640> cars<00:06:10.270> in<00:06:10.720> general<00:06:11.230> feel<00:06:11.500> much

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
worked the cars in general feel much

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.430 
worked the cars in general feel much
better<00:06:11.830> to<00:06:12.250> drive<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:13.240> bike<00:06:13.450> is<00:06:13.810> arcade<00:06:14.200> light

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
better to drive the bike is arcade light

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.290 
better to drive the bike is arcade light
but<00:06:14.740> loads<00:06:15.010> of<00:06:15.190> fun<00:06:15.370> as<00:06:15.520> you<00:06:15.640> can<00:06:15.790> see<00:06:15.970> here

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
but loads of fun as you can see here

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.610 
but loads of fun as you can see here
something<00:06:16.630> I've<00:06:16.870> enjoyed<00:06:17.280> and<00:06:18.280> then<00:06:18.970> you<00:06:19.150> have

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
something I've enjoyed and then you have

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.950 
something I've enjoyed and then you have
the<00:06:20.620> dragsters<00:06:21.160> which<00:06:21.430> probably<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.360> weakest

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
the dragsters which probably the weakest

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.140 
the dragsters which probably the weakest
point<00:06:23.200> at<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.410> moment<00:06:23.850> we'll<00:06:24.850> look<00:06:24.940> at<00:06:25.090> the

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
point at the moment we'll look at the

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.360 
point at the moment we'll look at the
drift<00:06:25.360> cars<00:06:25.600> in<00:06:25.930> another<00:06:26.260> video

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
drift cars in another video

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.530 
drift cars in another video
to<00:06:28.880> those<00:06:29.060> and<00:06:30.550> you<00:06:31.550> could<00:06:31.760> see<00:06:32.000> some<00:06:32.419> of<00:06:32.449> my

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
to those and you could see some of my

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.409 
to those and you could see some of my
terrible<00:06:32.960> drifting<00:06:33.470> like<00:06:33.970> don't<00:06:34.970> quite<00:06:35.300> have

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
terrible drifting like don't quite have

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.530 
terrible drifting like don't quite have
the<00:06:35.540> time<00:06:35.750> to<00:06:35.870> get<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.080> hang<00:06:36.199> of<00:06:36.290> it<00:06:37.330> I'm<00:06:38.330> Way

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
the time to get the hang of it I'm Way

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.689 
the time to get the hang of it I'm Way
behind<00:06:38.600> now<00:06:39.110> I'm<00:06:39.350> completely<00:06:40.010> lost<00:06:40.250> in<00:06:40.550> this

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 
behind now I'm completely lost in this

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:42.189 
behind now I'm completely lost in this
race<00:06:40.940> and<00:06:41.210> there<00:06:41.419> were<00:06:41.570> supposed<00:06:41.840> to<00:06:41.870> be<00:06:41.930> going

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
race and there were supposed to be going

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:43.840 
race and there were supposed to be going
this<00:06:42.410> checkpoint<00:06:42.710> right<00:06:43.340> in<00:06:43.460> the<00:06:43.520> middle<00:06:43.699> with

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
this checkpoint right in the middle with

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.159 
this checkpoint right in the middle with
you<00:06:43.940> I'm<00:06:44.090> sure<00:06:44.330> there<00:06:44.570> was<00:06:44.660> a<00:06:44.690> better<00:06:44.900> way<00:06:44.960> in

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
you I'm sure there was a better way in

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.170 
you I'm sure there was a better way in
there<00:06:45.350> than<00:06:45.500> that<00:06:45.680> and<00:06:46.340> then<00:06:46.610> I<00:06:46.639> thought<00:06:47.000> oh

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
there than that and then I thought oh

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.780 
there than that and then I thought oh
you<00:06:47.479> know<00:06:47.510> what<00:06:47.900> trapped<00:06:48.860> by<00:06:49.040> cars<00:06:49.370> I'm<00:06:49.639> gonna

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
you know what trapped by cars I'm gonna

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.939 
you know what trapped by cars I'm gonna
hit<00:06:49.970> this<00:06:50.090> ramp<00:06:50.389> and<00:06:50.810> just<00:06:51.320> call<00:06:51.560> it<00:06:51.590> a<00:06:51.800> day

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
hit this ramp and just call it a day

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:56.139 
hit this ramp and just call it a day
that's<00:06:52.190> it<00:06:52.370> for<00:06:52.580> me<00:06:52.699> for<00:06:52.910> now<00:06:52.970> more<00:06:53.810> soon
