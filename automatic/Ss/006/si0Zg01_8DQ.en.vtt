something<00:00:08.940> similar<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.570> wall<00:00:09.840> clock<00:00:10.110> and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
something similar to this wall clock and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.919 
something similar to this wall clock and
decided<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.860> recreate<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:11.790> under<00:00:11.910> $20<00:00:12.690> I

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
decided to recreate it for under $20 I

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.589 
decided to recreate it for under $20 I
tweaked<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.620> project<00:00:14.219> some<00:00:14.549> here<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.330> there

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
tweaked the project some here and there

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.260 
tweaked the project some here and there
to<00:00:16.049> make<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> little<00:00:16.440> easier<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.949> DIY<00:00:17.550> so
