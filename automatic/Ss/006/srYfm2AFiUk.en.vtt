Curtis I love her videos I follow her on
Instagram<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.210> she<00:02:27.390> posted<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.810> picture<00:02:27.840> i

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
Instagram and she posted a picture i

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.590 
Instagram and she posted a picture i
forget<00:02:29.160> what<00:02:29.280> color<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.700> was<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.150> she<00:02:30.330> had<00:02:30.510> her

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
forget what color it was but she had her

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.840 
forget what color it was but she had her
old<00:02:30.870> version<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.470> her<00:02:31.650> new<00:02:31.830> version<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.460> they

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
old version in her new version and they

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.700 
old version in her new version and they
both<00:02:33.030> looked<00:02:33.420> completely<00:02:33.870> different<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.680> I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
both looked completely different so I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.920 
both looked completely different so I
guess<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.190> quality<00:02:35.580> control<00:02:36.000> isn't<00:02:36.300> all<00:02:36.900> that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
guess the quality control isn't all that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.020 
guess the quality control isn't all that
great<00:02:37.320> I've<00:02:37.680> read<00:02:37.890> some<00:02:38.070> reviews<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.850> like
