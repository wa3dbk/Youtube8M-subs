00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.240
 Hall together and welcome to 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.210
 a new video of me and this time 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.299
 is there a noble cache of the right one 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.710
 nice fresh and chocolate tastes 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.779
 for this we first prepare the norma 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.970
 cake bottom in front for the voter film 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.769
 scripts and melted butter need 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.689
 The biscuits would be with the help of one 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.759
 rolling pin is crumbled and in one 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.680
 bowl and then can 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.029
 the melted butter and everything 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.680
 must be stirred well 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.480
 I always like to do that too 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.470
 hands because then again rough pieces 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.470
 short green can 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.400
 then I have one already 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.830
 baking mold prepared in the ground 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.660
 what paper has clamped and then 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.970
 Here are the crumbs firmly to the ground 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.170
 depressed 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.030
 that's the way it is now in the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.940
 fridge and we are preparing the cream 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.180
 before we need doctor on 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.020
 cream cheese white couvert st anna park 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.540
 or cream stiff sugar cream and one 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.900
 vanilleschote the quantities 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.430
 you will also find links in the infobox 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.020
 the first thing we do is put the cream in one 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.030
 pot and scratch the mark of us 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.229
 vanilleschote from that we also in 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.229
 give the pot to it 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.100
 now the sugar is added and 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.720
 even the white couverture and then 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.830
 Let's put the pot in medium heat 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.830
 on the stove 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.920
 if the white couverture then too 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.780
 You can start melting all the time 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.270
 Stir together until the couverture 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.920
 then completely melted and then 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.280
 came the top again from the stove 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.280
 down 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.210
 We are now filling the mass in one 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.649
 bowl and mix for 15 to 20 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.969
 for minutes until they complete 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.829
 has cooled 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.750
 At the same time consistency will be 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.590
 a little creamier and the bulk in itself 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.590
 gets a little lighter 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.600
 here can now about the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.610
 half of his partners to the mixed yes 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.140
 also briefly under and then can 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.620
 spoonful of cream cheese in the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.620
 bowl 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.239
 Last but not least, there will be the rest 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.980

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.330
 cream already finished and can be on the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.330

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.160
 I have this here with one too 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.750
 small angle palette smoothed 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.069
 but of course you can also just as 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.069
 use a spoon well 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.130
 before it goes into the fridge now 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.990
 are still fresh raspberries with me 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.360
 on it and here could also others 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.130

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.840
 cake decorated with it now 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.250
 even so that he is not so strong later 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.240
 and the fruits are no longer on it 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.880
 can place 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.040
 then the cheesecake for at least 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.870

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.730

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.170

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.790

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.920
 You only have to do it with a knife 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.840
 Carefully write over the couverture 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.770
 and then the rolls are completely formed 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.350
 as if by itself 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.940

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.160
