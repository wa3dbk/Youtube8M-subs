00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.330 
but that will clear any debris that
might<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.270> stuck<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> seat<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.590> that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
might be stuck in the seat of that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.889 
might be stuck in the seat of that
pressure<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.880> temperature<00:01:51.329> or<00:01:51.479> leaf<00:01:51.630> valve

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
pressure and temperature or leaf valve

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.350 
pressure and temperature or leaf valve
so<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.829> would<00:01:53.250> I'd<00:01:53.399> try<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.909> before<00:01:54.210> I'd

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so that would I'd try that before I'd

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:03.890 
so that would I'd try that before I'd
replace<00:01:54.689> any<00:01:54.930> parts<00:01:55.320> that's<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.710> sure

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.960
