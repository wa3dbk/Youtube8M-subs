00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.800
 hello friends I bring you a little interview that I have done for the site 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.420
 web page elections rointa 2010 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.360
 What is your opinion of the current electoral process? 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.270
 in which the Quintana Roo will choose governor presidents 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.649
 municipal and local deputies 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.440
 It is a very important moment in our state 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.460
 we are about to decide if we are still fucked by a ball of nepotistas that 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.440
 are in power or we make a radical change and straighten out the future of 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.359
 Quintana Roo 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.710
 in the specific case of cozumel 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.060
 What is the municipality of Quintana Roo that you most refer to in your documentaries? 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.440
 aurelio joaquin is the candidate of the pri to the municipal presidency and fredy 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.649
 marrufo martín for a deputation 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.720
 what do you think of this 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.920
 by fredy marrufo 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.200
 I can not say anything 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.530
 but because I do not have a fucking idea of ​​who 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.540
 of aurelio I can tell you that he really wants it but that is not enough to 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.160
 convince really I think it's an inept lack of preparation but about 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.430
 a whole lick boots ferebro gonzález and veto because here 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.059
 there are opposition options or characters that can be good 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.710
 options in cozumel 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.090
 there are brave people 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.770
 honest 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.360
 honest and prepared in all parties 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.900
 even in the PRI unfortunately only a small group of relatives is 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.410
 the one who maintains power at all costs 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.580
 uncles brothers and so on, the documentary that had the most impact on the community 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.960
 or the subject is seen in my personal opinion 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.250
 it's the challenge because it's remastered 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 it seems to you that it has the greatest impact of all its production 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.340
 you have additional anecdotes from this documentary 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.700
 The most watched video is actually the butterfly effect 1 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.030
 crime the most bitchy however the one that I feel that more impact caused was the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.640
 tertiary of aces three thousand visits in the first days 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.850
 beto because remastered is a compilation of two videos before 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.520
 the 2009 elections 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.020
 that came back up at the request of the people 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.290
 There are really many people who do not like the little marranito 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.110
 the documentaries in which you refer to Roberto Borge undoubtedly take a 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.380
 special dimension now that is candidate of the pri to the governorship 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.870
 there is evidence by the date of publication on youtube that these videos 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.869
 and your vision of this character is prior to his nomination 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.829
 who Roberto Borge is a pig 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.150
 is the worst brain error gonzález 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.609
 he is a prepotent junior and without preparation 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.499
 is the puppet of the precious gober is to be governed again by an inept 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.060
 like the last three governors of the state 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.840
 it is highly valued in its purest expression is a social parasite 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.900
 is a wasteful of the money of the people a cutter of the freedom of 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.629
 expression 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.239
 by getting 'youtube' to block one of my videos and send me a 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.289
 My account's low warning 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:47.269
 Felix Gonzalez singing is also a central character in several of your 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.699
 documentaries 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.129
 your vision of him is reflected in your videos 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.059
 a few months from the end of his administration what opinion do you have of 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.189
 his performance as governor 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.769
 he governs despite some of my criticisms 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.079
 considered that he has worked 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.200
 oo but he has worked 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.870
 the chair has been big 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.620
 and is determined to remain in power despite the fact that the people no longer want it 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.219
 neither him nor his family 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.169
 by nepotistas and enrich themselves illicitly 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.270
 in your opinion 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.719
 that says there between Felix González and Roberto Borge 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.249
 beto because you are the way the government intends to remain in power 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.879
 since this one is only a puppet besides that maintaining the power is not 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.279
 will leak information about the illicit enrichment of the González family 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.769
 It is true that they are a well-to-do family in the state but these years 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.779
 seen the exponential enrichment that they have had 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:41.049
 considering your mastery of the topic related to the political community and 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.900
 came after the power of cozumel 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.040
 There is something that the Quintana Roo should know about this couple Felix 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.859
 gonzález roberto borge 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.999
 considering that they could continue in power 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.589
 they are the worst thing that has happened to quintana roo 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.849
 and it's the perfect time to send them to hell 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.700
 in the first communication I had with you 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.589
 you expressed your reservations 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:05.589
 Care and need to preserve and protect your identity 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.760
 you talked about being threatened 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.519
 even death 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.329
 has those threats name and origin 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.370
 every day I receive emails thanking for the videos and congratulating myself 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.190
 and from time to time I also get told by my mother 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.479
 threats of death 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.360
 that they are going to plant a brick in my house when they identify me 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.940
 that will make me dizzy that the fuck will 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.180
 in short, I'm just very cautious of people who know my identity because 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.409
 have really tried several times to check my account identify me 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.430
 but I have always been stripped 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.099
 hahaha that assholes 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.639
 the first time I saw one of your documentaries 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.979
 I was struck by the Spanish narrator's style 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.749
 This style has been adopted outside of Spain for the narration of 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:55.199
 cocos circumstances to his ironic since to the nine discs the accent 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.879
 Castilian causes us to laugh 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:01.989
 It is also clear the handling of graphics and the post-production work in their 

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:03.080
 pieces 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.110
 You can talk to us about the time it takes you and the effort it represents 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.819
 the production of his documentaries 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.530
 I really took these videos very seriously 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.409
 the voice is of Jorge of the reader of texts that are out 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.159
 and it is the most popular in Spanish of the network 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.610
 He also did research work in the field and in the network 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.729
 the animations and other voices are from another little problem called I thought cited rock 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.990
 and it takes me about a week to prepare a five-minute video 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.870
 He also used other audio and video editing programs 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.879
 and above all I use a program called jaima ip 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.389
 which serves for the fabric jacales pinch and can not identify 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.179
 twitter since it only provides them with a modem from the region that is 

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:45.580
 find off 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.800
 tt moved for the creation of his documentaries 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.650
 the tiredness of seeing how idiotic people rule us 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.839
 and every day he fucks us more 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.279
 nobody pays me I did them of my own free will and in my free time 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.789
 in your most recent video 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.589
 you open saying that they did not arrive at the price 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:06.360
 you have been offered money for stopping producing your videos 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.310
 not at all 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.689
 that what I do not want people to think melendi or boat 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.490
 I really want to make this very clear 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.300
 I was surprised to see in his most recent video that the last three ads 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.869
 documentaries with which you say goodbye 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:21.180
 Why are you leaving 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.580
 the million dollar question 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.129
 I'm going for lack of time 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.179
 This time of year I am somewhat busy and lack of time to do the 

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.139
 documentaries 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.210
 I'm not going to a campaign or anything like that 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.020
 maybe later I'll return I've been invited to do serious journalism 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.099
 also and due to lack of time I will not enter but I will try to return 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:42.139
 as a veto because remastered 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.430
 I must say that at the time of writing these questions 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.669
 I have felt somewhat restricted and have tried to be careful not to do 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.430
 questions that lead us to know your identity 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.449
 although at the same time 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.759
 reiterated the commitment I have in mind not to ask personal data 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.719
 in this context 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:02.680
 There is something you want to tell about you 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.270
 two 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.520
 Hostal 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.520
 2 peace 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.360
 j 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.110
 p 

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:27.479
 dozens add something more 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:30.520
 thank you for taking the time out of this interview 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.520
 thank you very much for roo quintana elections 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.650
 a greeting from this side of the screen
