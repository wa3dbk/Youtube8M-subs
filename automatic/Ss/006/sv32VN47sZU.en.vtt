00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
were Maxis Dragonoid it would be his

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.619 
were Maxis Dragonoid it would be his
left<00:00:38.190> arm<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.610> looks<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> right<00:00:39.360> arm

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629

left arm it looks like the right arm
from<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> front<00:00:40.309> but<00:00:41.309> anyways<00:00:41.700> here's<00:00:42.600> him

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
from the front but anyways here's him

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.580 
from the front but anyways here's him
open<00:00:43.160> he<00:00:44.160> pops<00:00:44.399> open<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.440> he<00:00:46.440> has<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
open he pops open like this he has a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.069 
open he pops open like this he has a
little<00:00:46.860> green<00:00:47.039> eye<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:48.180> least<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.629> assume<00:00:48.750> it's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
little green eye at least I assume it's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
little green eye at least I assume it's
an<00:00:49.200> eye<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.980> don't<00:00:50.399> really<00:00:50.550> know<00:00:50.760> him

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
an eye in there I don't really know him

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.590 
an eye in there I don't really know him
and<00:00:52.489> graphics<00:00:53.489> are<00:00:53.579> both<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.000> confusing

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and graphics are both kind of confusing

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.310 
and graphics are both kind of confusing
so<00:00:55.640> when<00:00:56.640> he<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.000> opens<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.629> can<00:00:57.840> he<00:00:58.199> has

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so when he just opens you can he has

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.040 
so when he just opens you can he has
these<00:00:58.469> two<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:59.090> like<00:01:00.090> things<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.660> pull<00:01:00.840> out
