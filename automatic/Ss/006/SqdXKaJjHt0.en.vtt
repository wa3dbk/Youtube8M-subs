00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
something new and fresh now I certainly

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.030 
something new and fresh now I certainly
don't<00:00:30.420> need<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.630> new<00:00:30.840> tablet<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.500> currently<00:00:31.800> have

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
don't need a new tablet I currently have

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.069 
don't need a new tablet I currently have
three<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.489> household<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.149> moment<00:00:33.480> but

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
three in a household at the moment but

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.900 
three in a household at the moment but
I've<00:00:34.230> looked<00:00:34.410> at<00:00:34.590> why<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
I've looked at why I have now and I

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.400 
I've looked at why I have now and I
suddenly<00:00:36.180> feel<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.750> generation<00:00:37.290> behind

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
suddenly feel a generation behind

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.319 
suddenly feel a generation behind
because<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> market<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.460> super<00:00:38.700> moving<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
because the market is super moving so

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.860 
because the market is super moving so
fast

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
fast

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.440 
fast
so<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:40.770> tablet<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:41.879> me<00:00:41.969> next

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
so which tablet is it to be for me next

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
so which tablet is it to be for me next
now<00:00:43.050> bear<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.620> mind<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.399> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
now bear in mind that this is going to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.880 
now bear in mind that this is going to
be<00:00:44.670> completely<00:00:45.539> my<00:00:45.840> own<00:00:45.989> personal<00:00:46.410> opinion

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
be completely my own personal opinion

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
be completely my own personal opinion
and<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.579> probably<00:00:47.850> shouldn't<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.719> following

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and you probably shouldn't be following

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.680 
and you probably shouldn't be following
my<00:00:49.320> mindset<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> buyer's<00:00:50.309> guide<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> am<00:00:51.660> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
my mindset as a buyer's guide but I am a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.450 
my mindset as a buyer's guide but I am a
consumer<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.590> think<00:00:53.010> about<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> same

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
consumer so I do think about the same

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.160 
consumer so I do think about the same
things<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.910> when<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> am<00:00:54.539> buying<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.989> tablet

time for reading books going on websites
using<00:01:18.299> Google<00:01:18.720> Currents<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> just

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
using Google Currents so it just

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800 
using Google Currents so it just
everything<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.220> amazing<00:01:20.610> about<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
everything is amazing about it so that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.800 
everything is amazing about it so that
just<00:01:21.840> leaves<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.680> tablet<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.460> prime<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
just leaves one tablet the prime and the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
just leaves one tablet the prime and the
honest<00:01:25.140> truth<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.590> since<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.369> Nexus<00:01:26.700> arrived

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
honest truth is since the Nexus arrived

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.450 
honest truth is since the Nexus arrived
it<00:01:27.570> hasn't<00:01:28.020> had<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> look<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.829> my<00:01:29.040> household

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it hasn't had a look in in my household

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.300 
it hasn't had a look in in my household
its<00:01:30.420> value<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.079> also<00:01:31.259> plummeting<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.159> need

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
its value is also plummeting so I need

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850 
its value is also plummeting so I need
to<00:01:32.430> sell<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> right<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.619> actual

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to sell it right now and that in actual

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.069 
to sell it right now and that in actual
fact<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.579> Amazon<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.299> want<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.689> buy

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
fact it's on Amazon if you want to buy

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.100 
fact it's on Amazon if you want to buy
it<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.950> I'll<00:01:38.189> probably<00:01:38.579> only<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:39.060> about<00:01:39.329> 250

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it but I'll probably only get about 250
