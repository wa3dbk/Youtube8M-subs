00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.080 

okay<00:03:08.080> we<00:03:09.069> used<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.400> little<00:03:09.580> bit<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.760> curry

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
okay we used a little bit of curry

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.699 
okay we used a little bit of curry
powder<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:11.590> use<00:03:11.800> some<00:03:12.069> ground<00:03:12.670> ginger<00:03:12.790> not<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
powder we use some ground ginger not the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.220 
powder we use some ground ginger not the
fresh<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.310> dry<00:03:15.670> we<00:03:16.450> use<00:03:16.600> some<00:03:16.840> cinnamon

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
fresh but that dry we use some cinnamon

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.040 
fresh but that dry we use some cinnamon
a<00:03:17.830> little<00:03:18.130> bit<00:03:18.489> of<00:03:18.580> salt<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.600> believe<00:03:19.870> we

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
a little bit of salt and I believe we

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:33.350 
a little bit of salt and I believe we
some<00:03:20.380> cumin<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.890> there<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:22.470> mix<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.709> up

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.860 

and<00:03:34.379> there's<00:03:35.379> not<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:36.189> it<00:03:36.519> if<00:03:36.879> you<00:03:37.480> happen<00:03:37.689> to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
and there's not of it if you happen to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.740 
and there's not of it if you happen to
have<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.310> little<00:03:39.549> extra<00:03:39.969> salt<00:03:40.239> shaker<00:03:40.569> or

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
have like a little extra salt shaker or

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.330 
have like a little extra salt shaker or
whatever<00:03:41.079> that<00:03:41.170> would<00:03:41.409> probably<00:03:41.620> be<00:03:41.769> nice<00:03:42.010> to

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
whatever that would probably be nice to

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.330 
whatever that would probably be nice to
do<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.700> get<00:03:42.909> it<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.090> little<00:03:43.150> bit<00:03:43.359> more<00:03:43.510> even

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
do that get it a little bit more even

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.800 
do that get it a little bit more even
you<00:03:45.340> don't<00:03:45.519> want<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.849> whole<00:03:46.090> lot<00:03:46.329> i<00:03:46.359> wouldn't

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
you don't want a whole lot i wouldn't

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.860 
you don't want a whole lot i wouldn't
cover<00:03:47.019> this<00:03:47.489> with<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.790> spice<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.510> think<00:03:49.780> you

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
cover this with the spice I think you

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.390 
cover this with the spice I think you
just<00:03:49.900> kind<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.319> want<00:03:50.379> up<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.739> little<00:03:50.980> sampling

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
just kind of want up a little sampling

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.830 
just kind of want up a little sampling
of<00:03:51.579> this<00:03:53.939> we're<00:03:54.939> going<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.090> serve<00:03:55.390> this<00:03:55.420> with

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
of this we're going to serve this with

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.780 
of this we're going to serve this with
our<00:03:56.079> hummus<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.720> hummus<00:03:58.720> is<00:03:58.870> rather<00:03:59.760> not<00:04:00.760> a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
our hummus and hummus is rather not a

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.149 
our hummus and hummus is rather not a
strong<00:04:01.209> taste<00:04:01.599> but<00:04:02.379> you<00:04:02.590> really<00:04:02.769> don't<00:04:02.950> want

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
strong taste but you really don't want

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.839 
strong taste but you really don't want
to<00:04:03.219> overpower<00:04:03.730> all<00:04:04.359> of<00:04:04.599> your<00:04:04.750> flavors<00:04:05.849> so

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:15.179 
we've got more than enough spice here
for<00:04:10.139> several<00:04:12.780> actually<00:04:13.780> for<00:04:14.139> I<00:04:14.169> think<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.799> when

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
for several actually for I think I when

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.009 
for several actually for I think I when
I<00:04:15.220> did<00:04:15.519> it<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.760> didn't<00:04:16.060> use<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.329> whole<00:04:16.479> package

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
I did it I didn't use the whole package

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.050 
I did it I didn't use the whole package
and<00:04:17.169> I<00:04:17.650> still<00:04:17.919> had<00:04:18.070> a<00:04:18.099> little<00:04:18.370> spice<00:04:18.669> left<00:04:21.060> so

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
and I still had a little spice left so

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.980 
and I still had a little spice left so
we're<00:04:22.150> going<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.330> go<00:04:22.360> ahead<00:04:22.509> and<00:04:22.630> stick<00:04:22.960> that
