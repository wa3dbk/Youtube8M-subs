the<00:00:50.969> no<00:00:51.180> spitting<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> cold<00:00:51.809> looks<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.440> my

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
the no spitting the cold looks like my

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.049 
the no spitting the cold looks like my
max<00:00:52.800> distance<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:53.519> are<00:00:53.699> four<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
max distance of these are four and a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.880 
max distance of these are four and a
half<00:00:54.089> meters<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.409> I'm<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.589> to<00:00:55.649> do<00:00:55.769> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
half meters so what I'm going to do is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.130 
half meters so what I'm going to do is
do<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.219> half<00:00:56.430> spin<00:00:56.670> throwing<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:03.960> will

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
do some half spin throwing this one will

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
do some half spin throwing this one will
probably<00:01:04.350> work<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.339> five<00:01:05.549> meter<00:01:05.759> mark

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
probably work from the five meter mark

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.340 
probably work from the five meter mark
I'm<00:01:06.360> gonna<00:01:06.509> do<00:01:06.600> some<00:01:06.750> rotational<00:01:07.020> through<00:01:07.320> I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
I'm gonna do some rotational through I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
I'm gonna do some rotational through I
look<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.649> 100<00:01:08.009> yards<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
look like 100 yards we're going to do a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.760 
look like 100 yards we're going to do a
half<00:01:09.659> spin<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.170> Colt<00:01:12.500> alright<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.680> was

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
half spin with the Colt alright that was

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
half spin with the Colt alright that was
a<00:01:13.830> two<00:01:14.039> meter<00:01:14.250> Caston<00:01:15.180> row<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.539> the<00:01:15.600> Colt<00:01:15.810> so

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
a two meter Caston row for the Colt so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
a two meter Caston row for the Colt so
I'm<00:01:16.350> assuming<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.070> back<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.940> full

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
I'm assuming that to go back for full

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
I'm assuming that to go back for full
spin<00:01:18.619> probably<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:19.800> point<00:01:20.039> seven<00:01:20.310> five

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
spin probably two point seven five

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.210 
spin probably two point seven five
meters<00:01:23.840> next<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.050> one<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.530> own<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.800> absence

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
meters next is one of my own an absence

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.330 
meters next is one of my own an absence
blade<00:01:26.520> rope<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> now<00:01:31.860> we're<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.069> to<00:01:32.130> go<00:01:32.220> back

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
blade rope so now we're going to go back

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.309 
blade rope so now we're going to go back
to<00:01:32.399> four<00:01:32.700> half<00:01:32.880> meters<00:01:33.179> give<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.690> two<00:01:33.960> spins

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
to four half meters give you two spins

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:46.100 
to four half meters give you two spins
and<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:39.830> is<00:01:40.830> spins<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:45.270> last<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.750> landed

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and it is spins that last one landed

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.990 
and it is spins that last one landed
like<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.069> I'll<00:01:47.340> prior<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.759> go<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> little

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
like this so I'll prior to go a little

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.209 
like this so I'll prior to go a little
bit<00:01:48.209> more<00:01:48.240> maximum<00:01:48.840> five<00:01:49.020> point<00:01:49.259> three<00:01:49.289> five

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.459 

nothing<00:01:53.219> to<00:01:53.310> work<00:01:53.460> let's<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.030> try<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.469> three

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
nothing to work let's just try a three

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:01.249 
nothing to work let's just try a three
spoons<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.250> could<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.549> that<00:02:00.079> looks<00:02:01.079> like

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
spoons so we could do that looks like

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:10.040 
spoons so we could do that looks like
I'm<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.439> far<00:02:01.710> enough

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.600 

that<00:02:11.050> was<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.230> cold<00:02:11.440> throwers<00:02:11.800> three<00:02:12.310> spins

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
that was the cold throwers three spins

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.820 
that was the cold throwers three spins
let's<00:02:13.090> try<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.360> Condor<00:02:13.780> dismissals<00:02:14.260> now<00:02:14.380> when

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
let's try the Condor dismissals now when

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.370 
let's try the Condor dismissals now when
I<00:02:14.860> get<00:02:15.010> my<00:02:15.160> knife<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.520> do<00:02:15.580> kind<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.660> throw

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
I get my knife I do kind of this throw

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.479 
I get my knife I do kind of this throw
and<00:02:17.410> I've<00:02:17.620> been<00:02:17.709> doing<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.980> for<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.220> long<00:02:18.430> time

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
and I've been doing it for a long time

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.760 
and I've been doing it for a long time
whenever<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.239> do<00:02:19.330> like<00:02:19.599> full<00:02:19.810> spin<00:02:20.080> throws<00:02:20.319> this

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
whenever I do like full spin throws this

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.680 
whenever I do like full spin throws this
is<00:02:20.920> great<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.280> handle<00:02:21.550> works<00:02:21.880> fine<00:02:22.150> it's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
is great the handle works fine it's

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.259 
is great the handle works fine it's
perfectly<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:23.769> when<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.920> try<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.160> do<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:25.090> same

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
perfectly but when I try to do the same

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.390 
perfectly but when I try to do the same
type<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.510> grip<00:02:25.840> with<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.440> diamond<00:02:26.950> point

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
type of grip with this diamond point

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.610 
type of grip with this diamond point
right<00:02:27.700> here<00:02:27.880> it's<00:02:28.480> really<00:02:28.720> hard<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.230> it's<00:02:29.500> not

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
right here it's really hard to it's not

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.339 
right here it's really hard to it's not
as<00:02:29.769> stable<00:02:30.099> that's<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.730> switch<00:02:30.970> from<00:02:31.360> my<00:02:32.140> little

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
as stable that's a switch from my little

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.400
