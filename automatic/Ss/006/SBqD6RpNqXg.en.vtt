I<00:00:01.100> thought<00:00:02.100> doing<00:00:02.370> up<00:00:02.550> there<00:00:02.730> on<00:00:02.909> my<00:00:03.259> machines

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
I thought doing up there on my machines

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.309 
I thought doing up there on my machines
since<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:06.000> last<00:00:06.210> one<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.509> did<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.750> just<00:00:07.049> about

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
since the last one I did was just about

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.770 
since the last one I did was just about
coils<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.250> it<00:00:08.460> was<00:00:08.550> quite<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> while<00:00:09.090> ago

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
coils and it was quite a while ago

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.980 
coils and it was quite a while ago
this<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:12.650> all<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.980> machine<00:00:14.269> I'm<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
this is all that is machine I'm in the

this is all that is machine I'm in the
process<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.560> building<00:00:16.789> ran<00:00:17.789> out<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> gas<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
process of building ran out of gas and

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.189 
process of building ran out of gas and
all<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.539> back<00:00:21.810> bit<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:24.359> jig<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
all this back bit is the jig just to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.520 
all this back bit is the jig just to
hold<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.529> together<00:00:26.000> the<00:00:27.000> frame<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.980> frame<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
hold it together the frame the frame is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.590 
hold it together the frame the frame is
steel<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> bit<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.180> brass<00:00:36.480> hex<00:00:36.989> bar<00:00:38.600> just

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
steel this a bit of brass hex bar just

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.490 
steel this a bit of brass hex bar just
brush<00:00:39.930> round<00:00:40.200> bar<00:00:40.530> steel<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.570> bridge<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.930> these

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
brush round bar steel a bridge do these

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.010 
brush round bar steel a bridge do these
two<00:00:43.739> pieces<00:00:44.129> together<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.750> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
two pieces together and then this is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.619 
two pieces together and then this is
just<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:47.100> was<00:00:47.280> steel<00:00:47.789> square<00:00:49.100> but<00:00:50.390> but<00:00:51.390> better

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
just it was steel square but but better

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
just it was steel square but but better
twist<00:00:52.020> into<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:58.699> obviously<00:01:00.859> I'll<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.920> chopping

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
twist into it obviously I'll be chopping

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.270 
twist into it obviously I'll be chopping
it<00:01:02.430> off<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:05.000> when<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> work<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:07.250> where<00:01:08.250> I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.679 
it off here and when I work out where I
want<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> top<00:01:09.000> I'll<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.270> chopping<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
want it on the top I'll be chopping it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.830 
want it on the top I'll be chopping it
off<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.020> then<00:01:10.140> maybe<00:01:10.650> adding<00:01:11.240> not<00:01:12.240> sure<00:01:12.510> maybe

a little brass ball or something got a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.969 
a little brass ball or something got a
breath<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.409> look<00:01:16.610> for<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> vise<00:01:18.770> put<00:01:19.770> enough

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
breath and look for the vise put enough

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.120 
breath and look for the vise put enough
of<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.189> vise<00:01:20.340> sorry<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:22.130> top

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
of the vise sorry for the in top

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
of the vise sorry for the in top
contacts<00:01:23.549> grew<00:01:23.790> post<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:25.369> drilled<00:01:26.369> everything

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
contacts grew post I drilled everything

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
contacts grew post I drilled everything
out<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.600> far<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:30.079> ice<00:01:31.079> hole<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.890> need<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
out so far the ice hole I just need to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.880 
out so far the ice hole I just need to
slit<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.850> put<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> hole<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.540> side

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
slit and put a hole in the side

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.109 
slit and put a hole in the side
obviously<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.460> where<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> coil<00:01:35.939> is

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
obviously this is where the coil is

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.550 
obviously this is where the coil is
going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.420> mounted<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.700> rear<00:01:38.970> spring<00:01:39.560> is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
going to be mounted the rear spring is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710 
going to be mounted the rear spring is
going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.829> mounted<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.369> here<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:42.450> then

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
going to be mounted up here and then

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.020 
going to be mounted up here and then
this<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:44.479> for<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.100> bottom<00:01:47.100> part<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
this is for the for the bottom part of a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210 
this is for the for the bottom part of a
clip<00:01:48.299> card

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220

I<00:01:52.700> don't<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:53.730> it's<00:01:54.000> too<00:01:54.180> bad<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.630> say<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
I don't think it's too bad to say that

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.710 
I don't think it's too bad to say that
I've<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.230> been<00:01:55.410> using

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
I've just been using

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.870 
I've just been using
butane<00:01:57.720> propane<00:01:58.070> gas<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:01.080> make<00:02:01.440> it<00:02:04.880> there's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
butane propane gas to make it there's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.450 
butane propane gas to make it there's
all<00:02:06.090> my<00:02:09.710> on<00:02:10.710> different<00:02:11.220> types<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:13.460> brazing

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
all my on different types of brazing

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.540 
all my on different types of brazing
rods<00:02:14.730> I've<00:02:15.270> found<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.780> copper<00:02:16.530> ones<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
rods I've found the copper ones to be a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.430 
rods I've found the copper ones to be a
lot<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.180> best<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:18.600> far

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
lot the best one so far

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.690 
lot the best one so far
got<00:02:20.370> my<00:02:22.010> flux<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.190> there<00:02:24.320> I'll<00:02:25.320> get<00:02:25.710> starch<00:02:26.130> I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
got my flux in there I'll get starch I

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.950 
got my flux in there I'll get starch I
use<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.870> pinpoint<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:29.910> my<00:02:30.540> two<00:02:30.600> big

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
use the pinpoint and then my two big

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.680 
use the pinpoint and then my two big
ones<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.620> mean<00:02:32.490> he<00:02:32.700> was<00:02:32.820> just<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.240> one<00:02:33.510> for

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
ones I mean he was just this one for

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.650 
ones I mean he was just this one for
heating<00:02:33.990> up<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:35.040> I'll<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.370> lie<00:02:36.000> down

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
heating up so I'll just lie down

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.430 
heating up so I'll just lie down
sort<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.650> like<00:02:37.970> first<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:39.360> when<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.320> was

brazing<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.190> had<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.370> facing<00:02:41.790> towards

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
brazing this I had it facing towards

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.590 
brazing this I had it facing towards
that<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.600> then<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:46.410> other<00:02:46.470> one<00:02:47.600> wasn't

these<00:03:09.870> are<00:03:09.930> all<00:03:10.080> prototype<00:03:10.890> machines<00:03:17.570> this<00:03:18.570> is

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
these are all prototype machines this is

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.449 
these are all prototype machines this is
a<00:03:18.750> Rory<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:20.150> found<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.510> used<00:03:22.470> really<00:03:22.920> thin

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
a Rory I found it I used really thin

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.530 
a Rory I found it I used really thin
brass<00:03:23.820> off<00:03:24.630> an<00:03:24.810> old<00:03:24.989> clock<00:03:25.380> for<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.550> then

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
brass off an old clock for that and then

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.430 
brass off an old clock for that and then
just<00:03:28.050> wrap<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> motor<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> bit<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.170> brass

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
just wrap the motor in in a bit of brass

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.870 
just wrap the motor in in a bit of brass
real<00:03:32.370> thin<00:03:32.640> breath<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:34.560> then<00:03:35.400> some<00:03:35.610> copper

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
real thin breath and then some copper

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.990 
real thin breath and then some copper
wire<00:03:37.820> put<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.850> watch<00:03:39.630> back<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:41.489> back<00:03:41.820> of

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
wire put a watch back on on the back of

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.180 
wire put a watch back on on the back of
it<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:43.560> give<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.890> bit<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.810> funky<00:03:45.810> look

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
it just to give it a bit of a funky look

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.970 
it just to give it a bit of a funky look
and<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:48.480> haven't<00:03:49.020> got<00:03:49.170> come<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:49.410> there<00:03:49.740> yet

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
and I haven't got come on there yet

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.320 
and I haven't got come on there yet
because<00:03:50.220> I've<00:03:50.340> made<00:03:50.520> another<00:03:50.730> machine<00:03:51.120> which

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
because I've made another machine which

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.730 
because I've made another machine which
is<00:03:51.510> at<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.380> taro<00:03:52.650> shop<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:54.140> that's<00:03:55.140> using<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
is at the taro shop and that's using the

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.950 
is at the taro shop and that's using the
cow<00:03:55.920> at<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.160> moment<00:03:56.550> this<00:03:57.240> is<00:03:57.390> another<00:03:57.660> broad

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
cow at the moment this is another broad

cow at the moment this is another broad
type<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.380> man<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.830> used<00:03:59.460> I<00:04:01.460> used<00:04:02.460> an<00:04:02.850> actual<00:04:03.080> toy

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
type of man I used I used an actual toy

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.750 
type of man I used I used an actual toy
machine<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:07.530> frame<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.220> just<00:04:08.580> cut

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
machine for this the frame I just cut

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.090 
machine for this the frame I just cut
the<00:04:08.850> side<00:04:09.090> plate<00:04:09.420> off<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:10.230> then<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> bridged<00:04:10.830> on

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
the side plate off and then a bridged on

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.550 
the side plate off and then a bridged on
that<00:04:11.280> key<00:04:13.700> well<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:15.690> was<00:04:15.840> I<00:04:15.870> was<00:04:16.140> originally

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
that key well that was I was originally

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.280 
that key well that was I was originally
going<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.739> use<00:04:16.980> it<00:04:17.190> for<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.850> coil<00:04:18.120> machine<00:04:18.290> but

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
going to use it for a coil machine but

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.710 
going to use it for a coil machine but
then<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.440> decided<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:21.920> put<00:04:22.920> motor<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.720> and

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
then I decided to put motor on it and

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.480 
then I decided to put motor on it and
turn<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.560> into<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.800> Rory

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
turn it into a Rory

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.380 
turn it into a Rory
however<00:04:27.300> album<00:04:27.780> really<00:04:28.110> mastered<00:04:28.770> the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
however album really mastered the

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.110 
however album really mastered the
armature<00:04:30.390> bar<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.370> don't<00:04:32.730> know<00:04:32.820> if<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:32.970> can

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
armature bar and I don't know if you can

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.390 
armature bar and I don't know if you can
see<00:04:33.360> there<00:04:33.720> but<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.350> made<00:04:34.770> out<00:04:34.980> of<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.220> piece

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
see there but the I made out of a piece

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.690 
see there but the I made out of a piece
of<00:04:35.610> copper<00:04:36.420> wire<00:04:36.860> pretty<00:04:37.860> strong<00:04:38.160> copper<00:04:38.430> wire

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
of copper wire pretty strong copper wire

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.530 
of copper wire pretty strong copper wire
and<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:40.550> snapped<00:04:41.550> where<00:04:41.850> I've<00:04:42.000> sold<00:04:42.330> it

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
and it's snapped where I've sold it

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.620 
and it's snapped where I've sold it
there<00:04:42.870> because<00:04:43.530> it's<00:04:43.830> spinning<00:04:44.010> too<00:04:44.190> fast

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
there because it's spinning too fast

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
there because it's spinning too fast
this<00:04:45.630> motor<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.050> actually<00:04:46.320> out<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.470> the

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.630 

electric<00:04:49.650> toothbrush<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.520> found<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.330> there<00:04:52.640> but

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
electric toothbrush I found in there but

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.100 
electric toothbrush I found in there but
I'll<00:04:54.090> probably<00:04:54.210> have<00:04:54.450> another<00:04:54.690> blast<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:55.080> that

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
I'll probably have another blast of that

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.300 
I'll probably have another blast of that
another<00:04:55.500> day<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:59.150> this<00:05:00.980> probably<00:05:01.980> would<00:05:02.130> have

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
another day and this probably would have

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.640 
another day and this probably would have
anything<00:05:02.850> but<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.510> just<00:05:03.960> wanted<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.410> make<00:05:04.620> a

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
anything but I just wanted to make a

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.010 
anything but I just wanted to make a
mock<00:05:04.919> mock-up<00:05:05.490> of<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:06.500> machine<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:08.280> wood<00:05:08.990> so<00:05:09.990> I

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
mock mock-up of a machine in wood so I

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.400 
mock mock-up of a machine in wood so I
had<00:05:10.169> something<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.650> go<00:05:10.830> off<00:05:10.890> for<00:05:11.300> measurements

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
had something to go off for measurements

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.620 
had something to go off for measurements
it's<00:05:13.410> all<00:05:13.650> correct<00:05:14.610> measurements<00:05:15.150> all

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
it's all correct measurements all

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.730 
it's all correct measurements all
correct<00:05:16.080> scale<00:05:17.270> in<00:05:18.270> fact<00:05:18.480> if<00:05:18.750> I<00:05:19.020> did<00:05:19.169> say<00:05:19.410> up<00:05:19.560> it

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
correct scale in fact if I did say up it

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.860 
correct scale in fact if I did say up it
probably<00:05:20.010> would<00:05:20.160> work<00:05:20.400> what<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.660> I<00:05:23.870> daresay

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
probably would work what and I daresay

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.610 
probably would work what and I daresay
I'd<00:05:25.169> probably<00:05:26.330> fall<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.540> bits<00:05:27.690> it's<00:05:28.080> any<00:05:28.230> soft

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
I'd probably fall to bits it's any soft

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.870 
I'd probably fall to bits it's any soft
light<00:05:28.950> wood<00:05:29.360> and<00:05:30.360> then<00:05:30.540> this<00:05:31.530> is<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.400> first<00:05:32.610> of

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
light wood and then this is the first of

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.920 
light wood and then this is the first of
a<00:05:32.940> machine<00:05:33.270> I'm<00:05:33.450> hit

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930

he was the stump peg off a bike quite a

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.280 
he was the stump peg off a bike quite a

brazing<00:05:44.120> some<00:05:45.120> bits<00:05:45.330> went<00:05:45.510> good<00:05:45.660> some<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.140> went

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
brazing some bits went good some it went

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.060 
brazing some bits went good some it went
bad<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:46.830> just<00:05:47.640> braised<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.740> normal<00:05:49.740> contact

that back on there which goes on this
back<00:06:44.470> bit<00:06:44.710> and<00:06:44.950> then<00:06:45.100> it<00:06:45.220> rotates<00:06:45.850> with<00:06:46.060> the

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
back bit and then it rotates with the

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.270 
back bit and then it rotates with the
wire<00:06:47.760> and<00:06:49.230> once<00:06:50.230> that's<00:06:50.440> on<00:06:50.620> there<00:06:50.680> then<00:06:51.600> I'll

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
wire and once that's on there then I'll

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.440
