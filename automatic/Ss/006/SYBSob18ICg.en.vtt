00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.469
 Everyone is well with you there 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.220
 good in today's video and owes me three 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.560
 hardcore research team that the cimex 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.890
 in my opinion it could actually be 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 call root cut in field promises that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.380
 I think the team is flash is the way 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.619
 more have campaigns mainly in the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.420
 record can by itself glass is already a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.010
 gameplay more stopped the game more 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.790
 people stops along with much more 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.480
 caution of what not only remained but even 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.930
 so I like the record 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.590
 but as it is the duty of the team camper met is 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 you your only goal is to kill, huh? 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.920
 you do not have the objective of capturing anything 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.609
 nor of catcher tags and in these things 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.379
 So you have to kill and then some. 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:09.210
 people are entitled to stay 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:11.520
 champion of the corner but i deitadinho 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.250
 I still like the hardcore 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.400
 You accompanying my channel for some 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.500
 of my first videos, by the way, it's just me 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.520
 brought the departure of hardcore after 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.189
 I've been playing more, just kept going. 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.009
 A lot of anger but I've been learning and it's 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.930
 And just looking at the field in taking care of 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.020
 car on the sidewalk do not know what it is 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:40.350
 making a stab 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.140
 just to be smart and all bad people 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.700
 all wrong 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.040
 so this video is actually a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.729
 to complain about the few 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.939
 hardcore players are not is not and 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.780
 never been anyone specifically there anymore 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.780
 of people who play operating and playing 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.950
 of Grenadier and bazooka I even tried to 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.110
 leave 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.299
 in fact the day I played from there 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.910
 I was dissatisfied with the amount 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.160
 of grenadier and rpg fields that were 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.070
 by having 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.950
 silas is no need of any 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.690
 do not play a grenadier and rpg 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.420
 Only for those who do not know, you have only not 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.800
 I'm mistaken 25% of your life. 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.530
 is I think 25% of their normal life and 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.630
 so with few shots you can 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.020
 kill the enemy so you do not need 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.200
 rpg or grenadier and you will 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.240
 to be able to perceive also in this game play 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.790
 I think I died ten or eleven 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:49.010
 times something like that and half of them 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.770
 were grenadier and rpg deaths and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.970
 I knew he was coming from the 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.850
 other side of the world practically lies 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.700
 It came from the other side of the map and then 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.510
 man can get a book and that's it 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.100
 stupid, I do not get very angry 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.010
 these things because the andrÃ© knows that 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.709
 has its defects there of support nor 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.459
 that we know that the game has 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.350
 your faults but I need 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.930
 also defend a little of 3 because it is 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.910
 a game that I really like to play more 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.390
 that in certain feasts of the Lord I see that 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.640
 It's the players that end up 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.130
 spoiling between steels that end up 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:40.580
 spoiling the game and that ends up being eaten 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:43.070
 It's really annoying and you can see 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.020
 also I was playing on her 36 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.760
 does not love you so well 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.470
 but the radio was when you need 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.670
 few children to notice as I 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.650
 I told her, she looks good beyond the cup. 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.230
 most of the weapons you think do not 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.230
 to be so good if you want the Pope 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.930
 especially you guys want the gun 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.400
 I indicate that you will play in the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.760
 hardcore and I think you're going to give yourself 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.640
 better in hardcore and in the record too I 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.610
 I think it's a much more realistic way 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.769
 say so 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.079
 No, I'm not comparing anything. 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.800
 ps3 with no need to comment and talk 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:26.020
 not the one you want a realistic way that 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.510
 really simulate what's going on 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.530
 Are you going to play bf3? No, that's not what. 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.260
 I'm saying 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.060
 I say in the matter of you taking a shot 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.280
 and become damaged are 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.490
 seeing in that track the gameplay who she 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.710
 it's all red the muffled sound the sound 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.900
 the gameplay muffled by you I 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.480
 I took a shot and you really stay 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.780
 unified against it and I think it's 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.560
 Realist only stayed with the forum as 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.750
 Wanna call it a lonely stay, you take 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.270
 a shot can hide in a while 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.930
 You 're 100% alive. 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.880
 recovered so I think that in this 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.400
 aspect to aiea including also 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.790
 information on the screen is you do not have a 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.830
 radar they come in and you do not have to 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.380
 information on how many bullets or how many 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.030
 you still have the score without 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.640
 danger of living for you 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.860
 so I think in these respects in these 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.440
 So I believe that the 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.090
 hardcore has become more realistic and looks 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.590
 Only I told you 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.690
 this rpg on the other side of the world 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.390
 practically because I was in a corner 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.240
 of the map and he played a wealth of the other 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.470
 side of the map and I died and he succeeded 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.440
 kill me and kill another friend still 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.640
 then why I return even I 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.540
 I'm complaining 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.460
 Look at the hardwood and that's it. I claim it. 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.150
 even though it has no need 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.300
 I think that's it up there and there 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.900
 coming back from the last video I 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.680
 I made that life-saving class right between 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.530
 parentheses 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.260
 I said about mp7 with fire rap and 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.130
 Sorry, I did not have a fever. 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.800
 fire 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.540
 I went to see after the video she is not 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.330
 the field in fact was not only with indy 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.310
 and I apologize for you even there 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.370
 another information that is now schepp 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.680
 that he slowed down the footsteps of his friends 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.430
 of his and the enemies increased it 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.830
 who does you schepp pro the normal he just 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.520
 makes you see the equipment 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.470
 enemies 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.629
 then only correcting these two 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.090
 information the last video I ask 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:37.360
 Sorry, I 'm wrong, I 'm here. 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.360
 apologizing but at least that's it 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.000
 good what implies arrives at the end is e 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.190
 I hope you do not take offense 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.930
 I'm complaining about hardcore and nor 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.169
 no one specifically 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:54.940
 but what is complaining about who plays 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:57.639
 Grace on the edge and it's hardcore. 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.349
 so this is it follow me on twitter how much 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.620
 on facebook page leaving profile 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:04.569
 also staff of the faces and marriage 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.229
 in can add trade all six 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:12.520
 why and why? 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.479
 worth the video sign up for the channel only 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.039
 that 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:17.039
 Lacquer kiss went
