00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
put too much paper in so we just need to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.219 
put too much paper in so we just need to
reduce<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.030> down<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.149> 12<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:41.750> we<00:01:41.929> should<00:01:42.110> be

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
reduce it down to 12 and we should be

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.770 
reduce it down to 12 and we should be
good<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.470> go<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.130> it's<00:01:43.880> really<00:01:44.119> these<00:01:44.270> two<00:01:44.330> key
