00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
hey guys the level-cap here today I want

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.930 
hey guys the level-cap here today I want
to<00:00:07.140> talk<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.500> about<00:00:07.620> red<00:00:08.099> dot<00:00:08.370> sights<00:00:08.700> and

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
to talk to you about red dot sights and

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.060 
to talk to you about red dot sights and
their<00:00:09.059> portrayal<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.809> video<00:00:10.230> games<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.740> lot<00:00:10.920> of

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
their portrayal in video games a lot of

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.799 
their portrayal in video games a lot of
video<00:00:11.250> games<00:00:11.519> don't<00:00:11.700> take<00:00:11.969> advantage<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.630> some

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
video games don't take advantage of some

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.600 
video games don't take advantage of some
of<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> best<00:00:13.259> benefits<00:00:13.799> they<00:00:13.950> offer<00:00:13.980> shooters

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
of the best benefits they offer shooters

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.400 
of the best benefits they offer shooters
in<00:00:14.849> real<00:00:15.120> life<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> think<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.260> is

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
in real life and I think this is

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.410 
in real life and I think this is
something<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.770> could<00:00:17.010> easily<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.670> fixed<00:00:17.699> now

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
something that could easily be fixed now

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.240 
something that could easily be fixed now
for<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.690> sake<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.900> consistency<00:00:19.650> I'd<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.100> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
for the sake of consistency I'd like to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.160 
for the sake of consistency I'd like to
focus<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> EOTech<00:00:21.180> sight<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.960> very

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
focus on the EOTech sight it's a very

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.230 
focus on the EOTech sight it's a very
popular<00:00:22.470> site<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.220> been<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.670> virtually

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
popular site and it's been in virtually

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.540 
popular site and it's been in virtually
all<00:00:24.269> tactical<00:00:24.960> shooters<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.160> very<00:00:26.310> easy

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
all tactical shooters so it's very easy

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.790 
all tactical shooters so it's very easy
to<00:00:26.670> make<00:00:26.939> comparisons<00:00:27.750> between<00:00:27.810> video<00:00:28.500> games

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to make comparisons between video games

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.099 
to make comparisons between video games
and<00:00:29.070> even<00:00:29.400> real<00:00:29.699> life<00:00:29.939> now<00:00:30.330> video<00:00:30.570> games<00:00:30.810> do

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
and even real life now video games do

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.020 
and even real life now video games do
actually<00:00:31.529> portray<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> lot<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> real-world

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
actually portray a lot of the real-world

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.270 
actually portray a lot of the real-world
benefits<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.719> red<00:00:33.930> dot<00:00:34.110> sights<00:00:34.469> provide<00:00:34.950> for

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
benefits that red dot sights provide for

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.639 
benefits that red dot sights provide for
example<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.790> floating<00:00:36.420> targeting<00:00:37.050> reticle<00:00:37.440> in

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
example a floating targeting reticle in

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.750 
example a floating targeting reticle in
the<00:00:37.739> center<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the center you don't have to have a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.940 
the center you don't have to have a
reticle<00:00:39.210> attached<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.260> an<00:00:40.410> iron<00:00:40.710> sight

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
reticle attached to an iron sight

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.889 
reticle attached to an iron sight
housing<00:00:41.160> below<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.300> gives<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> nice

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
housing below it so it gives you a nice

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.799 
housing below it so it gives you a nice
clear<00:00:43.649> optic<00:00:44.219> picture<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.000> red<00:00:45.149> dot<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.510> also

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
clear optic picture the red dot is also

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
clear optic picture the red dot is also
high<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.289> contrast<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.190> makes<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> easier

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
high in contrast so it makes it easier

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.279 
high in contrast so it makes it easier
for<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> target<00:00:48.539> things<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.989> dark

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
for you to target things in dark

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
for you to target things in dark
environments<00:00:49.410> where<00:00:50.100> iron<00:00:50.430> sights<00:00:50.700> might

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
environments where iron sights might

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.639 
environments where iron sights might
otherwise<00:00:51.239> fail<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.289> also<00:00:52.410> get

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
otherwise fail and you can also get

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
contrast of the red dot makes it to
appear<00:01:35.759> floating<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.540> front<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
appear floating in front of you and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.319 
appear floating in front of you and
having<00:01:37.799> both<00:01:38.009> eyes<00:01:38.250> open<00:01:38.520> allows<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> see

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
having both eyes open allows you to see

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.840 
having both eyes open allows you to see
past<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.930> optic<00:01:40.409> housing<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> optic

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
past the optic housing so the optic

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.819 
past the optic housing so the optic
isn't<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.479> obstructing<00:01:43.079> your<00:01:43.229> vision<00:01:43.439> for

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
isn't really obstructing your vision for

isn't really obstructing your vision for
the<00:01:43.950> most<00:01:44.130> part<00:01:44.369> now<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> truly<00:01:45.000> understand

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the most part now to truly understand

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
the most part now to truly understand
the<00:01:45.600> benefit<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> two<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.350> open<00:01:46.799> aiming<00:01:47.159> you

the benefit of two I open aiming you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.490 
the benefit of two I open aiming you
have<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.759> try<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.450> real<00:01:48.750> life<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.350> I'm

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
have to try it out in real life but I'm

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.929 
have to try it out in real life but I'm
gonna<00:01:49.619> try<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:49.950> simulate<00:01:50.250> or<00:01:50.670> rather

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
gonna try and simulate or rather

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.910 
gonna try and simulate or rather
illustrate<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.799> an

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
illustrate it here for you I have an

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
illustrate it here for you I have an
actual<00:01:53.189> yo<00:01:53.490> Tex<00:01:53.820> sight<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> camera

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
actual yo Tex sight here with a camera

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
actual yo Tex sight here with a camera
mounted<00:01:55.290> behind<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.219> gonna<00:01:56.310> do

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
mounted behind it and what I'm gonna do

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.179 
mounted behind it and what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:56.790> I'm<00:01:56.880> gonna<00:01:57.000> change<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.659> basically<00:01:58.500> focal

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
is I'm gonna change the basically focal

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
is I'm gonna change the basically focal
point<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.450> we're<00:02:00.600> looking<00:02:00.719> past

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
point here so that we're looking past

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.499 
point here so that we're looking past
the<00:02:01.500> optic<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:02.219> because<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> lens<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.270> fairly

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the optic now because the lens is fairly

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.359 
the optic now because the lens is fairly
wide<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.320> camera<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.070> almost

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
wide on this camera I can almost

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.490 
wide on this camera I can almost
completely<00:02:05.759> remove<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.540> EOTech<00:02:06.810> housing

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
completely remove the EOTech housing

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.619 
completely remove the EOTech housing
from<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.890> image<00:02:08.129> altogether<00:02:08.879> which<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.300> very

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
from this image altogether which is very

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.180 
from this image altogether which is very
similar<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> effect<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.860> would<00:02:10.979> have

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
similar to the effect you would have

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.400 
similar to the effect you would have
with<00:02:11.700> two<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.910> open<00:02:12.360> aiming<00:02:12.690> all<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> sudden

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
with two I open aiming all of a sudden

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.730 
with two I open aiming all of a sudden
the<00:02:13.500> matter

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the matter

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
the matter
of<00:02:13.830> housing<00:02:14.310> around<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.670> EOTech<00:02:14.940> site

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
of housing around the EOTech site

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.660 
of housing around the EOTech site
becomes<00:02:15.720> far<00:02:16.110> less<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.440> an<00:02:16.740> issue<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.430> can

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
becomes far less of an issue and I can

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.180 
becomes far less of an issue and I can
see<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:18.000> red<00:02:18.300> dot<00:02:18.480> perfectly<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:19.980> see

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
see that red dot perfectly and I can see

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.890 
see that red dot perfectly and I can see
my<00:02:20.340> targets<00:02:20.820> perfectly<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.750> not

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
my targets perfectly and it's just not

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.990 
my targets perfectly and it's just not
obstructing<00:02:22.500> my<00:02:22.680> vision<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.550> reason<00:02:23.850> why<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
obstructing my vision the reason why a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.120 
obstructing my vision the reason why a
lot<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.330> high<00:02:24.630> quality<00:02:24.740> red<00:02:25.740> dot<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
lot of high quality red dot and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.130 
lot of high quality red dot and
holographic<00:02:26.820> sights<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.240> big<00:02:27.510> housing<00:02:27.990> is

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
holographic sights have big housing is

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.360 
holographic sights have big housing is
because<00:02:28.410> they're<00:02:28.590> designed<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:29.040> hold<00:02:29.160> up

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
because they're designed to hold up

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.600 
because they're designed to hold up
under<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:30.060> stresses<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.540> military<00:02:31.230> combat

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
under the stresses of military combat

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.920 
under the stresses of military combat
explosions<00:02:32.610> going<00:02:32.880> off<00:02:33.150> dropping<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
explosions going off dropping the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.990 
explosions going off dropping the
weapons<00:02:34.260> from<00:02:34.410> high<00:02:34.650> heights<00:02:35.010> they<00:02:35.580> basically

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
weapons from high heights they basically

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.030 
weapons from high heights they basically
have<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.360> protect<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.020> optics<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:37.770> need<00:02:38.010> a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
have to protect the optics so you need a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.710 
have to protect the optics so you need a
lot<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.430> metal<00:02:38.700> around<00:02:38.820> them<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.360> make<00:02:39.510> them

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
lot of metal around them to make them

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.300 
lot of metal around them to make them
safe<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.320> what<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:40.650> do<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.010> try<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
safe so what can we do to try and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.980 
safe so what can we do to try and
simulate<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.880> current<00:02:42.240> effect<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.720> video

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
simulate this current effect in video

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.810 
simulate this current effect in video
game<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.560> optic<00:02:44.010> housing<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.550> games

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
game so that optic housing in games

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.760 
game so that optic housing in games
isn't<00:02:45.060> pretty<00:02:45.630> much<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.020> only<00:02:46.050> deciding

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
isn't pretty much the only deciding

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.440 
isn't pretty much the only deciding
factor<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.160> whether<00:02:47.400> or<00:02:47.640> not<00:02:47.760> you're<00:02:47.970> using<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
factor of whether or not you're using a

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.510 
factor of whether or not you're using a
red<00:02:48.630> dot<00:02:48.840> sight<00:02:49.140> well<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.680> decided<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.310> play

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
red dot sight well I decided to play

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.340 
red dot sight well I decided to play
around<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.940> Photoshop<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.660> try<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.050> create<00:02:52.260> a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
around in Photoshop and try and create a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.890 
around in Photoshop and try and create a
similar<00:02:52.770> effect<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.400> too<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.790> open<00:02:54.450> aiming

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
similar effect to that too I open aiming

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.540 
similar effect to that too I open aiming
effect<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.350> you'll<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.800> real<00:02:56.040> life<00:02:56.340> and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
effect that you'll get in real life and

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.190 
effect that you'll get in real life and
I've<00:02:56.670> done<00:02:56.970> some<00:02:57.120> overlays<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.750> battlefield

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
I've done some overlays in battlefield

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.260 
I've done some overlays in battlefield
to<00:02:58.320> illustrate<00:02:58.830> what<00:02:59.010> I've<00:02:59.190> achieved<00:02:59.550> I<00:03:00.000> first

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
to illustrate what I've achieved I first

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.060 
to illustrate what I've achieved I first
decided<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.230> throw<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.770> bit<00:03:01.950> of

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
decided to just throw a bit of

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.580 
decided to just throw a bit of
transparency<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.300> optic<00:03:03.690> itself<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.440> we

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
transparency on the optic itself so we

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.960 
transparency on the optic itself so we
could<00:03:04.770> kind<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.010> see<00:03:05.100> through<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:05.850> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
could kind of see through it so the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.460 
could kind of see through it so the
housing<00:03:06.360> would<00:03:06.510> have<00:03:06.630> been<00:03:06.810> such<00:03:07.080> an<00:03:07.260> issue

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
housing would have been such an issue

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.410 
housing would have been such an issue
this<00:03:08.040> didn't<00:03:08.490> really<00:03:08.640> have<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.940> effect<00:03:09.210> I<00:03:09.300> was

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
this didn't really have the effect I was

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.460 
this didn't really have the effect I was
looking<00:03:09.690> for<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.930> kind<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.110> looks<00:03:10.290> like<00:03:10.380> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
looking for it kind of looks like a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.220 
looking for it kind of looks like a
ghost<00:03:10.890> sight<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.370> then<00:03:11.790> decided<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.390> put<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.810> lens

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
ghost sight I then decided to put a lens

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.230 
ghost sight I then decided to put a lens
blur<00:03:13.560> effect<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.340> image<00:03:14.550> itself<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.090> take

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
blur effect on the image itself and take

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.610 
blur effect on the image itself and take
away<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.690> transparency

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
away the transparency

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.470 
away the transparency
it's<00:03:16.950> definitely<00:03:17.100> simulated<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.120> blurriness

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
it's definitely simulated the blurriness

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.300 
it's definitely simulated the blurriness
I<00:03:18.780> see<00:03:18.960> in<00:03:19.080> real<00:03:19.290> life<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:19.710> I<00:03:19.890> think<00:03:19.920> we<00:03:20.190> need

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
I see in real life but I think we need

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.040 
I see in real life but I think we need
to<00:03:20.460> add<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.790> transparency<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.720> as<00:03:21.840> well

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
to add the transparency in as well

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.780 
to add the transparency in as well
personally<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:22.800> think<00:03:22.920> this<00:03:23.190> illustrates<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
personally I think this illustrates the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.370 
personally I think this illustrates the
effect<00:03:23.880> pretty<00:03:24.300> darn<00:03:24.540> well<00:03:24.810> but<00:03:25.080> it's<00:03:25.260> a

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
effect pretty darn well but it's a

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.440 
effect pretty darn well but it's a
little<00:03:25.560> too<00:03:25.830> blurry<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.700> be<00:03:26.820> aesthetically

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
little too blurry to be aesthetically

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.640 
little too blurry to be aesthetically
pleasing<00:03:27.480> it's<00:03:28.080> still<00:03:28.290> gotta<00:03:28.470> look

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
pleasing it's still gotta look

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.470 
pleasing it's still gotta look
attractive<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.520> video<00:03:29.760> game<00:03:30.000> audience

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
attractive to the video game audience

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.060 
attractive to the video game audience
this<00:03:30.810> image<00:03:31.170> looks<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.560> little<00:03:31.680> bit<00:03:31.890> more

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
this image looks a little bit more

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.950 
this image looks a little bit more
marketable<00:03:32.730> however<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.780> little

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
marketable however it's just a little

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.780 
marketable however it's just a little
too<00:03:34.200> transparent<00:03:34.500> towards<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.310> bottom<00:03:35.520> of

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
too transparent towards the bottom of

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.280 
too transparent towards the bottom of
the<00:03:35.850> site<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.120> I'm<00:03:36.360> gonna<00:03:36.510> add<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.960> a<00:03:37.050> little

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
the site so I'm gonna add in a little

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.200 
the site so I'm gonna add in a little
bit<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.590> gradient<00:03:37.950> there<00:03:38.490> I<00:03:38.670> still<00:03:38.970> think

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
bit of a gradient there I still think

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.490 
bit of a gradient there I still think
the<00:03:39.330> size<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.780> housing<00:03:40.200> would<00:03:40.350> be

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the size of the housing would be

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.200 
the size of the housing would be
considered<00:03:40.920> too<00:03:41.130> much<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.490> a<00:03:41.580> detriment<00:03:42.030> on

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
considered too much of a detriment on

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.460 
considered too much of a detriment on
this<00:03:42.390> site<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:42.750> I'm<00:03:42.840> going<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.080> increase<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
this site so I'm going to increase the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.080 
this site so I'm going to increase the
opacity<00:03:43.560> overall<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.610> see<00:03:44.760> what<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.030> looks

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
opacity overall and see what that looks

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.240 
opacity overall and see what that looks
like<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.020> really<00:03:46.290> only<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.560> 10<00:03:46.860> percent

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
like this is really only a 10 percent

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.070 
like this is really only a 10 percent
opacity<00:03:47.460> effect<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.420> top<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> site

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
opacity effect on the top of the site

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.810 
opacity effect on the top of the site
and<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.290> think<00:03:49.320> it<00:03:49.680> looks<00:03:49.890> just<00:03:50.220> fine<00:03:50.550> it's

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
and I think it looks just fine it's

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.700 
and I think it looks just fine it's
still<00:03:51.030> marketable<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.840> you're<00:03:52.350> not<00:03:52.500> really

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
still marketable and you're not really

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.530 
still marketable and you're not really
worried<00:03:53.100> about<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.460> housing<00:03:53.940> size<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.420> the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
worried about the housing size of the

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.330 
worried about the housing size of the
site<00:03:54.750> anymore<00:03:55.110> you're<00:03:55.530> more<00:03:55.740> concerned<00:03:56.130> with

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
site anymore you're more concerned with

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.160 
site anymore you're more concerned with
what<00:03:56.790> kind<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.090> targeting<00:03:57.510> reticle<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.020> has

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
what kind of targeting reticle it has

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.840 
what kind of targeting reticle it has
towards<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.650> center<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.160> optic<00:03:59.520> so

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
towards the center of the optic so

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.220 
towards the center of the optic so
really<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.240> whole<00:04:00.390> effect<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.840> be<00:04:00.870> achieved

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
really this whole effect can be achieved

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.650 
really this whole effect can be achieved
by<00:04:01.320> adding<00:04:01.680> an<00:04:01.770> opacity<00:04:02.250> mask<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.090> optic

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
by adding an opacity mask to the optic

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.870 
by adding an opacity mask to the optic
layer<00:04:03.990> in-game<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.190> even<00:04:05.490> just<00:04:05.760> add

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
layer in-game and you can even just add

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.100 
layer in-game and you can even just add
a<00:04:05.910> little<00:04:06.150> bit<00:04:06.270> more<00:04:06.390> blur<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.960> that

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
a little bit more blur to that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.960 
a little bit more blur to that
battlefield<00:04:07.440> 4<00:04:07.830> is<00:04:07.860> already<00:04:08.100> adding<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.730> blur

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
battlefield 4 is already adding a blur

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.120 
battlefield 4 is already adding a blur
layer<00:04:09.210> to<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.930> optics<00:04:10.320> when<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.680> aim<00:04:10.890> down

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
layer to the optics when you aim down

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.190 
layer to the optics when you aim down
sight<00:04:11.550> so<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.060> don't<00:04:12.360> imagine<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.870> would<00:04:13.050> be<00:04:13.170> a

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
sight so I don't imagine this would be a

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.500 
sight so I don't imagine this would be a
complicated<00:04:13.890> addition<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.000> video<00:04:15.240> game

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
complicated addition to the video game

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.960 
complicated addition to the video game
anyway<00:04:16.049> it's<00:04:16.230> just<00:04:16.290> an<00:04:16.560> idea<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.010> had<00:04:17.489> I'm<00:04:17.700> tired

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
anyway it's just an idea I had I'm tired

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.370 
anyway it's just an idea I had I'm tired
of<00:04:18.120> seeing<00:04:18.390> some<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.750> crappy<00:04:19.260> or

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
of seeing some of the crappy or

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.199 
of seeing some of the crappy or
real-life<00:04:19.890> sites<00:04:20.190> doing<00:04:20.549> really<00:04:20.760> well<00:04:21.000> in

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
real-life sites doing really well in

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.909 
real-life sites doing really well in
video<00:04:21.540> games<00:04:21.870> simply<00:04:22.200> because<00:04:22.650> they<00:04:22.770> have

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
video games simply because they have

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.250 
video games simply because they have
minimal<00:04:23.250> housing<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.240> would<00:04:24.600> love<00:04:24.750> having<00:04:24.990> to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
minimal housing I would love having to

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.850 
minimal housing I would love having to
become<00:04:25.500> far<00:04:25.800> less<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:26.160> an<00:04:26.280> issue

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
become far less of an issue

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.920
