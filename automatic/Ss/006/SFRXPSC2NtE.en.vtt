00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
the real tractor so that's cool to have

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.460 
the real tractor so that's cool to have
some<00:01:37.259> adalian<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.540> same<00:01:39.540> thing<00:01:39.570> orbital

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
some adalian here same thing orbital

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.770 
some adalian here same thing orbital
precision<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> 16<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:42.420> what<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
precision with the 16 so that's what it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.230 
precision with the 16 so that's what it
number<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> series<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.939> tractor

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
number is in the series and the tractor

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.460 
number is in the series and the tractor
there<00:01:47.390> let's<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.570> started<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> tractor

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
there let's get started with the tractor

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.929 
there let's get started with the tractor
