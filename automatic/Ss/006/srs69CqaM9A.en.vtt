00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.039
 j 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.810
 so today in all of europe 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.030
 aabar liked first job for this purpose my first job is real job this 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.960
 chord whose piano 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.400
 after a few odd jobs 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.870
 and so I'll show you we'll demonstrate it's a upright piano 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.520
 the om will disassemble just now explain a little high 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
 the different parts the essential parts of the gift 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.140
 so just for the little story the piano is where a burying his 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.900
 198 by christophe maury and csa followed hockey at his bank 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.040
 the cordeau pants life finally a number of other instruments 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.049
 who was stringed 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:02.050
 to hit too 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.390
 but where in europe to hit or to pass 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.870
 for that 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.729
 the piano is here it is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.870
 it's unique 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.210
 a wonderful magical instrument adventure 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.540
 and so can start for example a little bit 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.540
 So here is no doubt open and percent 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.270
 1 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359
 when we ask ourselves here we see 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.180
 the essential components of the gift 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.180
 these are the pieces by making these pieces of wood here this 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 who hits the he will be playing the strings 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.430
 and of 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.800
 shouts of support 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.760
 % 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.360
 the second this convoy 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.080
 then basta 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.330
 it is a big city of wood 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.370
 it's a permit 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.370
 so here stop that part of it all 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.980
 it's a duty 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.930
 so the three for the three main parts the hammer then the hammer 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.690
 is to be saved is assured by that 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.280
 relative to the key via mechanics 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.710
 on his side of all this is that he is here 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.790
 for 100 th 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.310
 who serve as intermediaries 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.690
 but their collaborators 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.719
 it is at the stage armandie with strings 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:12.299
 they would have almost never spent enough percent and that of not 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.549
 no longer appear 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.439
 the outdoors about the importance of being sufficiently 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.159
 mbia energy e 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.069
 to the surrounding air 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.280
 she would grant it is in contact with the land of harmony through the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.040
 knight 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.930
 and these are the vibrations transmitted from the rope 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.070
 at tabarly 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.349
 six days later meters to be born 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.370
 to agitate the Iron Age in sound farms to make music 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.569
 i am now going to montreal for what the tuner 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.029
 piano evoking a crime to grant 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.340
 the other will consist 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.590
 haha 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.540
 with the arrivals the voltage the voltage is high 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.540
 through his home 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.059
 so that's the agreed upon these basic tools of the agreement in which we 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.649
 1 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.549
 r 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.790
 so if the hypothesis of a return of tales and legends lacordaire 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.740
 his mother are today 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.190
 he is more than on order in amplitude 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.470
 it is precisely because 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.550
 for 100 th on that note 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.280
 for 163 arnott rope 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.439
 for that the decors drawn by hundreds by the same frequency 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.430
 than the other bodies 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.569
 connect them the gypsy wants to tune this show there 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.569
 fathers 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.890
 pity just play either by following 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.090
 for 100 th of the skill granted for the master hour the same frequency 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.569
 that the three between strings 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.369
 those who are struck by this piece 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:00.340
 in its part 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.810
 for that the chord part 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.789
 so from port is for 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:08.729
 and more than 200 strings on all the channels we have to grant all 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:09.749
 strings one by one 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.619
 I did not talk to them about part percent 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:15.799
 harmonization for 100 th the harmonization it consists 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.489
 arrived the piano frame 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.809
 she stamps 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.949
 the couple happened and that's a bit like the coach of the 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.000
 color years 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.009
 by car 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:26.029
 % 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:28.879
 the milk the hammers 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.550
 forbes hammers 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.159
 we come back to a rounded shape 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.460
 reading it we know it's his face-to-face compound of this hardness 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.440
 and to try the form the hardness the absent and the striking position 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.729
 possibly win 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.729
 this settlement in stages on the turn so it is the hardness 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.539
 pella and form that will determine the wrong piano 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.689
 we have some newspapers different tools to pay to do 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:54.800
 harmonization 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.950
 so that's the tools the typical tools of 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.510
 the price of the dollar which makes her relegation 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.919
 that's just the fact it's a 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.659
 it's a rare it's just a paper pub 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.569
 it's glass paper 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:08.949
 with that 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.940
 if and if and if and port are worn 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.630
 for that to hit his turntable cd 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.070
 the patches that melt they make holes 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.050
 in 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.430
 when we make a death we close we do a sanding junk then we do on 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.900
 place or vote but it depends on the case 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.030
 and the happy ones 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.030
 it makes 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.860
 the first rookie available will tell if the afp agreement 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.740
 and the second thing is on the tightrope 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.629
 it's the 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.139
 It's less his door and he 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.139
 to do this apply 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.360
 several ski formulas I'm here for the rest but if it's a tool that 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.110
 who is who and who is smaller and more practical for the right knee 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.680
 % and so with that 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 for me that we're going we're going to get stung 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.400
 the early flutter if the six meters passed 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:00.370
 anyway 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.040
 and conversely it can also be read hardening it soissons evening by typing with the 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.210
 pecq the back of small 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.150
 I also receive with products that seem 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
 less than a year ago we can use it 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.860
 the great frustration that I have and that I experienced when I was at 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.499
 bordeaux is that he could not adjust the sound as you want it is 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:24.139
 over there 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.189
 we could think that I also wanted to apply everything you want 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:29.120
 our perfect course in sum 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.469
 what to go back in the cinema rooms the couple 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:35.979
 that's what we want liverpool has achieved from sÃ¨te 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.110
 of this note 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.469
 and being that limitations meet 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:42.129
 in the exercise of its business 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:45.110
 % little by little the group 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.069
 so that never in me the idea of 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:50.990
 the cdu of a woody magic wand and virtual piano 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.990
 on which we could just for all his part 

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.689
 and percent and so this tool this virtual gift 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.930
 that's all in what party 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.930
 a little bit but later 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:11.449
 m 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:12.059
