made<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.450> do<00:01:20.570> but<00:01:21.470> because<00:01:22.160> it<00:01:22.490> is<00:01:22.790> kind<00:01:23.300> of

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
made to do but because it is kind of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.630 
made to do but because it is kind of
made<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.660> do<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.140> tricep<00:01:24.590> does<00:01:24.800> get<00:01:25.010> some

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
made to do it the tricep does get some

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.790 
made to do it the tricep does get some
benefit<00:01:26.120> out<00:01:26.180> of<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.530> what<00:01:27.620> you're<00:01:27.710> going

used my tricep has to engage so it's now
a<00:01:52.190> primary<00:01:52.730> instead<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.480> a<00:01:53.600> secondary<00:01:54.140> like<00:01:54.470> a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
a primary instead of a secondary like a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.240 
a primary instead of a secondary like a
regular<00:01:54.710> pushup<00:01:55.810> okay<00:01:56.810> also<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.220> is

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
very weird and it's going to be very

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.669 
very weird and it's going to be very
awkward<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:08.239> do<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.689> with<00:02:09.019> you<00:02:09.229> have<00:02:09.409> no

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679

awkward to do this with you have no
strength<00:02:10.069> in<00:02:10.280> it

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
strength in it

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.670 
strength in it
