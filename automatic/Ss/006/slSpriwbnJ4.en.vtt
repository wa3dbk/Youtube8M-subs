00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.829

 cold but this afternoon it will be 30 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.590
 degrees and I am wearing a sleeveless dress 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.300

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.489

 beneath it I buy sandals 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.420
 with such coarse heels and light blue and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.690
 those are also the case I really love 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.689

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 okay i'm taking my risk 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.789
 I actually think it 's pretty sneaky 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.159
 a little bit exciting but yes that is 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.079
 healthy tension I think because in itself 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.459
 I learned pretty well but me 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.670
 won't say too much because tells 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 very nice weather I say as used 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.819
 a you can see it well must now 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.109

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.549
 early in the morning 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.549
 I think it's already above 20 degrees 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.190
 well i just passed my exam and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.740

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.100

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.600
 I agree with two exam baby I am 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.490
 really very curious 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.960
 that 's when I see it now I'm ahead 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.230

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.560
 for have compared the answers 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.540
 but I'm going to win home now 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.010

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.260
 I am just now to see him I have first 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:18.420

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.060
 super hot i also got ice cream 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.380
 for a short while and yes it was pretty good 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.060
 pressure on the road because everyone who wants 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.550
 of course towards the sun so I have 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.400
 stood a bit of a traffic jam but yes me 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.900
 am now just home and I am going this yes 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.280
 but electrically just take off there 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.310
 maybe also a little bit of it 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.330
 enjoy the sun if it is still there so yes 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.170
 I'm going to do here 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.610
 old flowers and new flowers me 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.310
 of course I also have the balcony 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.290
 us and yes it is that is actually in 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.390
 basically I just leave 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.010
 but I am really so happy that I have more 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.900
 of just the dress I today 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.760
 I got that out of here, I do have it whole 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.040
 sticky and so sitting by a car 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.780
 so this is really tasty for a while 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.760
 I treated myself to one 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.350
 cornetto that I am going to eat as soon as I find 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.020
 Really that I have earned you and after 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.090
 two exams and meanwhile work too 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.580
 can read a book for life 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.150
 so a shelley booklet you don't have that 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.780
 I've got her on the event 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.939
 so I'm going to relax for a moment 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.799
 I have only spent half an hour I think 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.480
 sat in the sun and then I started 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.670
 a little thunder and air it 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.989
 already a little gray and a little too 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.000
 so, for example, blow a little and 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.970
 then I always go in and I am 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.680
 in the meantime, start cooking and 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.500

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.439

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.159

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.930

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.180
 I lie in bed nicely 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.590
 and we are now done with monopoly me 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.770
 I just don't feel like it anymore 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.080
 I lost fat 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.600
 I was really in for it 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.240
 with many hundreds of euros extra is 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.580
 with tails and so on a deal 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.020
 that I have exchanged with 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.810
 With Robin he had a lot of thinking 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.610
 streets complete making it into one 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.220
 time with all his money even my house 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.139
 I buy it and eventually also hotels 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.699
 and every click doesn't know what was about 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.110
 I got there in double the chance 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.509
 and I lost all my money in one go 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.900
 I had to sell houses 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:33.639
 so yes or not so very successful but 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.349
 well that robin also looked at you won 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.910
 because he doesn't win that often 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:40.240
 that it doesn't change the one that wins 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.070
 but yes well yes this was my day before 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.009
 today i have had my exams and 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.020
 I'm really happy with that 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.580
 rash that I have now 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.009
 to your benefit or to you have the result 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.550
 all answers compared 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:57.070
 and that I made about 9 mistakes on my own 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.509
 have one outdated and you can go with it 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.520
 the exams 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.580
 Have 14 errors so we must be genuine 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.900
 very crazy happen I still want you there 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.940
 I could really go for it 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.830
 just keep an entire year and learning 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.419
 a book 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.880
 Well, it's likely we will leave it 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.710
 hope it is but i will probably go to bed 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.419
 on it and it still goes songs 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.699
 simply watch television addicted to 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.710
 a series on netflix 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.720
 so but i'm totally devastated 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.340
 totally tired today so I'm going 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.960
 nice to bed 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.150
 thank you for looking and then 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.150
 I'll see you again tomorrow
