 a goal we do not know anymore at 50 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.650
 we see everything is not possible to do 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.170
 to come someone does not serve what 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.990
 it does not take long how it goes 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.820
 comes from one side we see who as soon as he has 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.470
 a little too much drunk or who goes and then what 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.170
 trophy but no we do not sell so much 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.930

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 what to order soil and you the traces 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.390
 of alcohol will tell itself there are people 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.920
 they are doing very well 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.569
 alcohol and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.610
 we are friends we are still time 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.790
 do not go back to people's lives 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.130
 to say that people are there 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.220

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.569
 alcoholic to others okay 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.870
 but finally what I mean is that 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.310
 we have enough that we have these numbers 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.300
 who are really dramatic and we 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.360
 let's try to convince the managers of 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.180
 bars and discos stopped at 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.709
 give up before the alcohol really from 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.709
 comments of strong alcohol all 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.200
 just some techniques to 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.060
 people simply to human beings 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.709
 simply see that there 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.230

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.540

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.610

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.769

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.030
