00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.250
 We all know well those turtles 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.550
 so interesting nature animals 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.910
 noble and also long-lived according to their habitat 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.580
 there are land-type turtles 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.230
 marine and freshwater is also one of 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.409
 the oldest reptiles and 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.630
 amazing about the planet 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:26.029
 in fact some scientists speculate 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.050
 that the first turtle appeared 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.789
 almost 215 million years ago many other 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.070
 curiosities about turtles 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.350
 we were seeing a short time ago 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.370
 when I showed you that the list of 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.840
 five turtles that are scary remember 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.760
 Well, something that is not 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.970
 we delved too much was the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.800
 longevity of the turtles known by 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.000
 all is the fact that the turtles 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.730
 they live for many years but how much 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.090
 let's find out the life of the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.820
 turtles as it happens with any other 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.950
 organism of the animal kingdom each species 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.380
 of turtle has a life span or a 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.049
 different life expectancy 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.579
 the lifetimes of the turtles 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.920
 wild are not the same as those of 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:16.189
 those who live in captivity for 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.409
 supposedly a turtle that has been raised 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.060
 as a pet you can have a life more 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.460
 longeva than those who live in the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.640
 nature faced with hostility 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.039
 of the environment the average life 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 of a turtle is usually between 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.130
 50 and up to 80 years some types 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.220
 can reach 100 years 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.649
 but this is considered a fact 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.899
 extraordinary there are even stories 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.259
 of long-lived turtles that have reached 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.649
 the 300 years something totally fortuitous and 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.289
 neither scientifically proven in 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.920
 Any case have enough time 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.200
 to enjoy life, let's not see 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.439
 below how to do it to know the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.319
 age of the turtles how to know the age 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.539
 of a turtle unlike the 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.759
 trees whose rings indicate 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.340
 unfailingly how many years have 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.160
 lived the age of the turtles can not 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.620
 be determined with such accuracy 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.780
 and the lines that line his face pacho 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.290
 they are more ambiguous and do not offer as much 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.030
 precision in the image however if 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.580
 It can be estimated roughly 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.280
 how old is the specimen that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.320
 let's observe analyzing its carapace of 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.680
 way very similar to what we do with 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.990
 tree rings of course 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.240
 this is only possible for those 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.670
 turtles that have type cover 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.160
 they are the ones with the scales 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.490
 that shed relative information about 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.010
 his age on the other hand the more 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.350
 old be a turtle will lose more 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.570
 portions of your shield what can 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.340
 also tell us if we are facing 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.610
 a young individual or one in the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.460
 end of his life the turtles are 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.910
 truly amazing creatures do not 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.500
 do you think other things you know about 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.500
 these ancient reptiles
