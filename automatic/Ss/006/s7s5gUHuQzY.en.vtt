and<00:01:05.159> yeah<00:01:06.159> that<00:01:06.400> was<00:01:06.430> two<00:01:07.240> millimeter<00:01:07.689> big

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.920 

now<00:01:18.590> I'll<00:01:18.800> be<00:01:18.979> using<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.750> completely<00:01:20.750> different

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
now I'll be using a completely different

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.120 
now I'll be using a completely different
pig<00:01:21.380> which<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.550> jes3<00:01:23.450> pick<00:01:23.800> I've<00:01:24.800> used

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
pig which is the jes3 pick I've used

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.420 
pig which is the jes3 pick I've used
these<00:01:25.430> ones<00:01:25.880> for<00:01:26.510> a<00:01:27.020> very<00:01:27.890> long<00:01:28.070> time<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.369> think

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
these ones for a very long time I think

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.980 
these ones for a very long time I think
of<00:01:28.640> Justin<00:01:29.150> for<00:01:29.300> 12<00:01:29.540> years

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
of Justin for 12 years

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:43.060 
of Justin for 12 years
solid<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:32.170> they<00:01:33.170> do<00:01:33.229> have<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.560> sharp<00:01:34.190> point<00:01:42.070> but

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
solid and they do have a sharp point but

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.719 
solid and they do have a sharp point but
I<00:01:43.220> wanted<00:01:43.550> to<00:01:43.610> change<00:01:43.970> that<00:01:44.240> because<00:01:45.460> any<00:01:46.460> time

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
I wanted to change that because any time

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.670 
I wanted to change that because any time
whenever<00:01:46.909> somebody<00:01:47.869> asks<00:01:47.930> me<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.229> play<00:01:48.500> my

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
whenever somebody asks me to play my

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.010 
whenever somebody asks me to play my
guitar<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:48.979> show<00:01:49.460> me<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.570> then<00:01:50.690> they'd<00:01:50.840> give

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
guitar and show me and then they'd give

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.450 
guitar and show me and then they'd give
me<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.200> normal-sized<00:01:51.740> pick<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.190> was<00:01:52.310> like

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
know how to play it and stuff so I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.430 
know how to play it and stuff so I
wanted<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.530> stop<00:01:58.250> doing<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.759> actually

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
wanted to stop doing that actually

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.859 
wanted to stop doing that actually
and<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:00.950> just<00:02:01.550> started<00:02:01.820> experimenting<00:02:02.330> using

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
and I just started experimenting using

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.190 
and I just started experimenting using
different<00:02:03.350> type<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.530> fix<00:02:03.890> materials<00:02:08.200> actually

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
different type of fix materials actually

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.470 
different type of fix materials actually
it<00:02:09.500> feels<00:02:09.769> really<00:02:10.100> small<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:11.000> I'm<00:02:11.090> gonna<00:02:11.300> get

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
it feels really small so I'm gonna get

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.820 
it feels really small so I'm gonna get
rid<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.959> one<00:02:12.850> or<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.930> one<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> half

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
rid of this one or the one and a half

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:38.100 
rid of this one or the one and a half
millimeter<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:18.110> Gator<00:02:18.380> grips

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.520 

and<00:02:39.220> then<00:02:40.220> yeah<00:02:40.640> now<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.480> like<00:02:41.780> these<00:02:41.959> cinema

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530

pics you get a lot more response from

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.550 
pics you get a lot more response from
the<00:02:45.440> pic<00:02:45.620> itself<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:50.120> bends<00:02:50.560> on

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
the pic itself because it it it bends on

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:09.550 
the pic itself because it it it bends on
certain<00:02:51.950> parts

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.030 

you<00:03:10.560> yeah<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:12.420> works<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.320> all<00:03:13.440> words<00:03:13.680> it's<00:03:13.980> just

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
you yeah it works in all words it's just

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.480 
you yeah it works in all words it's just
a<00:03:14.310> matter<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.970> personal<00:03:15.360> preference<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.490> big

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
a matter of personal preference and big

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.040 
a matter of personal preference and big
angles<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.180> stuff<00:03:18.420> yeah<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:19.200> use<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.890> slight

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
angles and stuff yeah I do use a slight

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.940 
angles and stuff yeah I do use a slight
angle<00:03:22.050> like<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:23.240> to<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:25.140> picket<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.710> you<00:03:25.800> get

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
angle like that to to picket so you get

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:42.380 
angle like that to to picket so you get
also<00:03:26.280> kind<00:03:26.580> of<00:03:26.640> Scratchy

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.620 

yes<00:03:43.390> so<00:03:44.110> I<00:03:44.140> hope<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:45.150> clears<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.360> up<00:03:46.450> the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
yes so I hope that clears it up the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.170 
yes so I hope that clears it up the
mystery<00:03:47.050> of<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.320> pic<00:03:47.560> okay<00:03:48.460> so<00:03:48.520> use<00:03:48.940> whatever

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
mystery of the pic okay so use whatever
