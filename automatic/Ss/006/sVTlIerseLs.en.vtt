00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

this<00:00:00.630> year<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.260> guess<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:02.040> really<00:00:02.190> just<00:00:02.460> wanted

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
this year I guess I really just wanted

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:13.039 
this year I guess I really just wanted
to<00:00:02.820> show<00:00:03.000> you<00:00:03.030> how<00:00:03.300> it<00:00:03.449> plays<00:00:11.690> so<00:00:12.690> this<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.990> a

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
to show you how it plays so this is a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.110 
to show you how it plays so this is a
giant<00:00:13.380> sandbox<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:14.340> were<00:00:14.429> making<00:00:14.880> a

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
giant sandbox that were making a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.890 
giant sandbox that were making a
universe<00:00:15.990> size<00:00:16.260> sandbox<00:00:17.570> it's<00:00:18.570> full<00:00:18.779> of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
universe size sandbox it's full of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.810 
universe size sandbox it's full of
choices

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.670 

like<00:00:22.480> here<00:00:22.750> we're<00:00:22.960> at<00:00:22.990> the<00:00:23.170> boundary<00:00:23.590> between

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
like here we're at the boundary between

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.439 
like here we're at the boundary between
two<00:00:24.250> warring<00:00:24.640> factions<00:00:25.390> I<00:00:26.760> could<00:00:27.760> join<00:00:28.000> in<00:00:28.029> I

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
two warring factions I could join in I

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:49.600 
two warring factions I could join in I
could<00:00:28.869> take<00:00:29.050> sides

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.590 

so<00:00:50.610> that's<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.880> tiny<00:00:51.240> glimpse<00:00:51.540> of<00:00:51.870> space<00:00:52.200> combat

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
so that's a tiny glimpse of space combat

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.760 
so that's a tiny glimpse of space combat
but<00:00:54.600> I've<00:00:54.690> only<00:00:54.840> got<00:00:55.080> three<00:00:55.350> bed<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
but I've only got three bed it's of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250 
but I've only got three bed it's of
those<00:00:55.920> loads<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.340> i<00:00:56.400> want<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> show<00:00:56.790> you<00:00:57.260> like

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
those loads that i want to show you like

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.400 
those loads that i want to show you like
this<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.060> is<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.540> solar<00:01:00.780> system<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
this so this is the solar system that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.140 
this so this is the solar system that
we're<00:01:01.530> currently<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.310> where<00:01:02.640> that

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
we're currently at that's where that

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.180 
we're currently at that's where that
battle<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.660> taking<00:01:03.840> place<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.530> battles<00:01:05.010> like

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
battle is taking place but battles like

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.340 
battle is taking place but battles like
that<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.760> taking<00:01:06.540> place<00:01:06.570> across<00:01:07.050> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
that are taking place across the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.480 
that are taking place across the
universe<00:01:09.740> by<00:01:10.740> pull<00:01:10.950> back<00:01:11.160> a<00:01:11.190> little<00:01:11.340> bit<00:01:13.490> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
universe by pull back a little bit you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.150 
universe by pull back a little bit you
could<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.600> other<00:01:15.690> stars<00:01:16.110> nearby<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.130> I

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
could see the other stars nearby that I

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.270 
could see the other stars nearby that I
can<00:01:17.400> reach<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.820> my<00:01:17.940> current<00:01:18.180> hyperdrive<00:01:19.280> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
can reach with my current hyperdrive and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.890 
can reach with my current hyperdrive and
I'm<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> pull<00:01:20.880> back<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.600> more

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
I'm going to pull back a little bit more

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.040 
I'm going to pull back a little bit more
to<00:01:21.960> give<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.380> sent<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> size<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> game

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
to give you sent to the size of the game

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.680 
to give you sent to the size of the game
when<00:01:25.050> I<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.560> need<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.479> keep<00:01:27.479> in

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
when I do I really need you to keep in

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.870 
when I do I really need you to keep in
mind<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.140> understand<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.009> every<00:01:29.580> one<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
mind to understand that every one of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.260 
mind to understand that every one of
these<00:01:29.970> points<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.540> light<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.920> son<00:01:32.340> number

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
these points of light is a son number

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.719 
these points of light is a son number
one<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> those<00:01:33.630> sons<00:01:34.020> has<00:01:34.920> its<00:01:35.100> own<00:01:35.310> solar

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
one of those sons has its own solar

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.359 
one of those sons has its own solar
system<00:01:35.900> with<00:01:36.900> planet-sized<00:01:37.830> planets

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
system with planet-sized planets

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.380 
system with planet-sized planets
orbiting<00:01:38.790> around<00:01:38.910> it<00:01:39.350> those<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.590> life

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
orbiting around it those have life

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.340 
orbiting around it those have life
ecology

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:56.410 

and<00:01:48.220> I<00:01:48.400> can<00:01:48.520> even<00:01:48.610> go<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.880> little<00:01:49.060> faster

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.679 

now<00:01:57.049> most<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.470> these<00:01:57.560> places<00:01:57.890> have<00:01:58.450> never<00:01:59.450> been

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
now most of these places have never been

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:07.740 
now most of these places have never been
visited<00:02:00.340> many<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.490> them<00:02:01.610> never<00:02:01.790> will<00:02:02.030> be

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.220 

over<00:02:08.530> there<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.580> distance<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.750> center

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
over there in the distance is the center

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.560 
over there in the distance is the center
of<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.410> galaxy<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:13.120> where<00:02:13.330> we're<00:02:13.480> all

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
of the galaxy that's where we're all

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.240 
of the galaxy that's where we're all
trying<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.900> get<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.560> I'm<00:02:17.830> going<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.070> do

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
trying to get to and I'm going to do

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.870 
trying to get to and I'm going to do
something<00:02:18.490> really<00:02:18.760> stupid<00:02:20.460> I've<00:02:21.460> just<00:02:21.520> got<00:02:21.760> to

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
something really stupid I've just got to

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.490 
something really stupid I've just got to
pick<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.390> these<00:02:22.480> at<00:02:22.690> random<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.350> can

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
pick one of these at random and we can

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.970 
pick one of these at random and we can
go<00:02:26.650> there<00:02:27.450> now<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:28.630> was<00:02:28.810> okay<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.440> rehearsal

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
go there now this was okay in rehearsal

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.390 
go there now this was okay in rehearsal
otherwise<00:02:30.370> would<00:02:30.670> be<00:02:30.700> here<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:32.130> if<00:02:33.130> anything

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
otherwise would be here but if anything

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.070 
otherwise would be here but if anything
horrible<00:02:33.760> goes<00:02:34.180> wrong<00:02:34.450> just<00:02:34.480> keep<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.050> mind

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
horrible goes wrong just keep in mind

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:44.360 
horrible goes wrong just keep in mind
that<00:02:35.440> i've<00:02:36.310> not<00:02:36.520> been<00:02:36.550> here<00:02:36.850> before

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.300 

cool<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.750> here<00:02:49.959> we<00:02:50.080> are<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.290> an<00:02:50.590> undiscovered

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
cool so here we are in an undiscovered

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.580 
cool so here we are in an undiscovered
solar<00:02:51.730> system<00:02:52.240> probably<00:02:52.840> no<00:02:53.110> one's<00:02:53.260> ever<00:02:53.380> been

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
solar system probably no one's ever been

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.510 
solar system probably no one's ever been
here<00:02:53.770> before<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:54.340> can<00:02:54.880> do<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.090> scan<00:02:59.340> and<00:03:00.340> when<00:03:00.489> I

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
here before I can do is scan and when I

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.130 
here before I can do is scan and when I
do<00:03:00.640> you'll<00:03:00.970> see<00:03:01.150> some<00:03:01.330> points<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.690> interest

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
do you'll see some points of interest

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.240 
do you'll see some points of interest
that<00:03:02.410> red<00:03:03.220> one<00:03:03.250> down<00:03:03.640> there<00:03:03.940> is<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.600> beacon<00:03:08.250> and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
that red one down there is a beacon and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.650 
that red one down there is a beacon and
I've<00:03:09.340> made<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.000> there's<00:03:10.330> always<00:03:10.630> a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
I've made it so that there's always a

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.570 
I've made it so that there's always a
beacon<00:03:11.080> near<00:03:11.319> where<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.680> warp<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.160> just<00:03:12.430> for

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
beacon near where I warp in just for

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:26.450

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
and and this is the planet that we've

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.690 
and and this is the planet that we've
just<00:03:42.120> found<00:03:42.620> just<00:03:43.620> an<00:03:43.800> alien<00:03:44.160> world<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.610> we

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
found together this is planet III and

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.730 
found together this is planet III and
it's<00:03:50.940> not<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.570> prettiest<00:03:52.200> planet<00:03:52.560> I've

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740

seen better but I've also seen a lot

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:04.340 
seen better but I've also seen a lot
worse<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.470> could<00:03:58.710> do<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.890> scan<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:03.170> it's<00:04:04.170> like

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
worse so I could do a scan and it's like

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.380 
worse so I could do a scan and it's like
