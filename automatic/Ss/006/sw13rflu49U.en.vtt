never underestimate the value of
tactical<00:01:59.630> insertion<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.290> always<00:02:00.500> be

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
tactical insertion and always be

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.320 
tactical insertion and always be
checking<00:02:00.950> your<00:02:00.979> corners<00:02:01.430> and<00:02:01.460> realize<00:02:02.060> that

checking your corners and realize that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.550 
checking your corners and realize that
these<00:02:02.420> engagement<00:02:02.900> distance<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.229> going<00:02:03.410> to<00:02:03.470> be

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
these engagement distance is going to be

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.930 
these engagement distance is going to be
really<00:02:03.650> small<00:02:04.040> so<00:02:04.100> use<00:02:04.550> that<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.850> your

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
really small so use that to your
