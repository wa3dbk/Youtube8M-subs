that by holding on the home button for

that by holding on the home button for
three<00:01:52.460> seconds<00:01:52.850> then<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.960> power<00:01:54.110> plan<00:01:54.320> for<00:01:54.470> 10

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
three seconds then the power plan for 10

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.350 
three seconds then the power plan for 10
seconds<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.160> then<00:01:55.280> letting<00:01:55.670> go<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:55.880> power<00:01:56.150> one

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
seconds and then letting go to power one

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.540 
seconds and then letting go to power one
after<00:01:56.690> those<00:01:56.840> 10<00:01:57.080> seconds<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:58.250> will<00:01:58.430> just

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
after those 10 seconds it will just

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.760 
after those 10 seconds it will just
simply<00:01:58.910> go<00:01:59.060> back<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.840> connector<00:02:00.380> iTunes

simply go back to the connector iTunes
screen<00:02:01.160> which<00:02:01.790> will<00:02:01.970> happen<00:02:02.150> user<00:02:02.660> just<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.320> bit

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.469 

so<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.070> won't<00:02:07.280> let<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:07.550> go<00:02:07.790> into<00:02:07.940> DFU<00:02:08.300> mode

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479

as you click it you have to hold your
home<00:03:11.570> button<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.050> power<00:03:12.290> button<00:03:12.410> for<00:03:12.650> 10

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
home button and power button for 10

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.430 
home button and power button for 10
seconds<00:03:13.430> then<00:03:14.030> like<00:03:14.269> over<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.660> power<00:03:15.080> button

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
seconds then like over the power button

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.770 
seconds then like over the power button
after<00:03:15.709> those<00:03:16.040> 10<00:03:16.280> seconds<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.600> pretty

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
after those 10 seconds this is pretty

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.100 
after those 10 seconds this is pretty
quick

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
quick

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.009 
quick
I<00:03:18.350> even<00:03:18.890> mess<00:03:19.130> up<00:03:19.510> things<00:03:20.510> like<00:03:20.570> four<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:20.989> five

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
I even mess up things like four to five

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.710 
I even mess up things like four to five
times<00:03:21.320> in<00:03:21.590> this<00:03:21.709> video<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.820> it's<00:03:23.090> really<00:03:23.330> based

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
times in this video so it's really based

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.990 
times in this video so it's really based
on<00:03:23.870> timing<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:25.519> reason<00:03:25.730> why<00:03:25.820> they<00:03:25.880> don't

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
on timing and the reason why they don't

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.310 
on timing and the reason why they don't
work<00:03:26.150> for<00:03:26.269> me<00:03:26.390> is<00:03:26.450> because<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:26.810> have<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.959> faulty

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
work for me is because I have a faulty

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.410 
work for me is because I have a faulty
home<00:03:27.530> button<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:28.310> it's<00:03:28.430> not<00:03:28.580> as<00:03:28.790> reliable<00:03:29.090> as

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
home button so it's not as reliable as

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.540 
home button so it's not as reliable as
it<00:03:29.510> was<00:03:29.690> when<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.870> first<00:03:30.080> got<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.500> plus<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> thing

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
it was when I first got it plus a thing

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.640 
it was when I first got it plus a thing
I<00:03:31.640> only<00:03:31.850> held<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.239> for<00:03:32.420> like<00:03:32.570> like<00:03:33.260> nine<00:03:33.620> or

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
I only held it for like like nine or

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.000 
I only held it for like like nine or
eight<00:03:33.980> seconds<00:03:34.930> instead<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.170> actual<00:03:36.590> ten

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
eight seconds instead of the actual ten

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.460 
eight seconds instead of the actual ten
seconds<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.489> should<00:03:37.730> have<00:03:37.820> done<00:03:38.080> so<00:03:39.080> as<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.410> can

try<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:05.209> you're<00:04:05.599> going<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.810> get<00:04:05.900> these<00:04:06.020> same

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
try and you're going to get these same

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.930 
try and you're going to get these same
processes<00:04:06.470> you<00:04:06.800> would<00:04:06.950> have<00:04:07.069> had<00:04:07.250> when<00:04:07.849> you

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
processes you would have had when you

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.290 
processes you would have had when you
first<00:04:08.150> jump<00:04:08.450> in<00:04:08.750> your<00:04:08.930> own<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.550> device<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:11.120> don't

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
first jump in your own I device so don't

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.180 
first jump in your own I device so don't
close<00:04:11.450> out<00:04:11.660> anything<00:04:12.050> now<00:04:12.650> tiny<00:04:12.890> umbrella

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
close out anything now tiny umbrella

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.420 
close out anything now tiny umbrella
might<00:04:13.599> stop<00:04:14.599> working<00:04:14.920> that's<00:04:15.920> fine

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
might stop working that's fine

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.770 
might stop working that's fine
you<00:04:16.760> can<00:04:16.940> go<00:04:17.000> ahead<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.239> close<00:04:17.480> out<00:04:17.690> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
you can go ahead and close out the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.650 
you can go ahead and close out the
program<00:04:18.200> we<00:04:18.530> don't<00:04:18.799> really<00:04:18.889> need<00:04:19.160> it<00:04:19.419> we<00:04:20.419> only

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
program we don't really need it we only

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.390 
program we don't really need it we only
need<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:20.989> for<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.200> ex<00:04:21.350> recovery<00:04:21.440> mode<00:04:22.040> option

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
need it for the ex recovery mode option

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.810 
need it for the ex recovery mode option
so<00:04:22.430> it's<00:04:22.730> not<00:04:22.880> really<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:24.820> guess

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
so it's not really that I guess

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.760 
so it's not really that I guess
important<00:04:26.570> when<00:04:27.020> we're<00:04:27.169> doing<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.440> jailbreak

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
important when we're doing the jailbreak

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.210 
important when we're doing the jailbreak
process<00:04:29.410> so<00:04:30.410> it's<00:04:30.500> going<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.740> tell<00:04:30.860> us<00:04:30.889> to<00:04:30.950> put

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
process so it's going to tell us to put

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.520 
process so it's going to tell us to put
our<00:04:31.310> advice<00:04:31.610> into<00:04:31.850> DFU<00:04:32.120> mode<00:04:32.270> again<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.380> we're

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
our advice into DFU mode again and we're

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.629 
our advice into DFU mode again and we're
going<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.740> do<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:33.919> same<00:04:34.100> process<00:04:34.310> again

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
going to do the same process again

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.840 
going to do the same process again
luckily<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.660> did<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.200> on<00:04:36.290> my<00:04:36.410> first<00:04:36.590> try<00:04:36.740> so<00:04:37.130> it's

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
luckily I did it on my first try so it's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.469 
luckily I did it on my first try so it's
definitely<00:04:38.180> based<00:04:38.419> on<00:04:38.800> trial<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:39.950> error<00:04:40.479> and

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
definitely based on trial and error and

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.390 
definitely based on trial and error and
if<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.290> do<00:04:42.410> mess<00:04:42.620> up<00:04:42.650> that's<00:04:42.979> why<00:04:43.130> I'm<00:04:43.190> just

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
if you do mess up that's why I'm just

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.680 
if you do mess up that's why I'm just
going<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.580> go<00:04:43.639> back<00:04:43.669> into<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.240> connect<00:04:44.570> to

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
going to go back into the connect to

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.690 
going to go back into the connect to
itunes<00:04:44.810> screen<00:04:45.350> so<00:04:45.950> uh<00:04:45.979> nothing<00:04:46.340> else<00:04:46.550> is

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
itunes screen so uh nothing else is

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.360 
itunes screen so uh nothing else is
going<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:46.910> happen<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:48.410> once<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.680> have<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:48.950> into

going to happen so once you have it into

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.250 
going to happen so once you have it into
DFU<00:04:49.700> mode<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:50.240> second<00:04:50.510> time<00:04:50.690> you<00:04:50.900> should<00:04:51.139> be

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.820 

given<00:05:17.479> this<00:05:17.600> takes<00:05:17.930> a<00:05:18.080> really<00:05:18.320> long<00:05:18.590> process

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830

error and geeks is kind of uh I guess a
lengthy<00:05:28.520> process<00:05:29.770> so<00:05:30.770> 4/3<00:05:31.220> times<00:05:31.430> you<00:05:31.520> can

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
lengthy process so 4/3 times you can

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.279 
lengthy process so 4/3 times you can
tell<00:05:31.729> you<00:05:31.850> to<00:05:32.000> put<00:05:32.270> your<00:05:32.419> iDevice<00:05:32.780> into<00:05:33.020> DFU

reboot<00:06:32.970> method<00:06:33.419> it<00:06:33.660> pretty<00:06:33.960> much<00:06:34.139> erases<00:06:34.740> that

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
reboot method it pretty much erases that

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.350
