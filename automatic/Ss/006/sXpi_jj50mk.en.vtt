 hello again dear friends 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.130
 you have already been told about the jacket for 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.869
 motorists of right there today you 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.850
 I want to show the same windbreaker 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.850
 brands which our spring and autumn 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.400
 key of the winds is the same as in winter 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.050
 jackets used proprietary system 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.399
 climate control specifically 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.460
 adapted to weather conditions 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.520
 off season primarily winds to auto jack 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.590
 protects you from cold wind and rain but 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.780
 spring and autumn are capricious and if

 suddenly bad weather change someone system 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.980
 climate control take care to 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.660
 you were comfortable and not very hot to me 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.520
 I like that Petrovka author for 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.649
 I am ready for any weather changes and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.690
 thanks to the climate control system you 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.789
 can not take off buying buying sitting at the wheel 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.820
 car or when you go in warm 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.820
 the room 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.979
 nano light jacket top fabric will protect

 you from wind and rain 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.940
 it consists of two layers the top layer 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.930
 treated by impregnation based on 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.909
 nanotechnology 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.700
 she repels moisture not allowing her 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.649
 soak besides the fabric after on on 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.330
 handling little dirty and easy as 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:26.080
 testing is not at all superfluous for 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:28.210
 motorists inner layer this 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.470
 special membrane it has a high 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.299
 vapor permeability 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.520
 which means that the membrane breathes well 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.539
 in this we can be sure to spend 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.940
 simple experiment 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.369
 take a bonfire card with a sample cloth 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.670
 which is attached to all auto clothes 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.490
 goal we put this card cloth down 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.649
 hot fluid wrap through 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.159
 some time moisture appears on the film 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.810
 this is steam that has passed through the fabric 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.810
 condenses on its surface 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.900
 Coats have auto jack 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.120
 very interesting lining it consists 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.900
 from high-tech materials 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.850
 collected from around the world 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.530
 materials are specially selected and 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.150

 working ventilation system received 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.890
 name back ventilation system she 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.860
 evenly distributes heat inside 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.630
 goblets and ventilate the inner layers of the eyelids 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.970
 ventilation system consists of three 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.190
 components durable fabric countries pigs 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.200
 throw out is used where protection is needed 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.240
 from wiping thanks to a special 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.670

 zebra she breathes well and provides 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.580
 air circulation in the lining 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.770
 and the highest vapor permeability 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.750
 ultralight mesh drive without and and 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.790
 located in the armpits where 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.890
 most heat she 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.200
 freely passes warm air inside 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.940
 lining warm air mixed with 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.160
 more cool evenly 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.590
