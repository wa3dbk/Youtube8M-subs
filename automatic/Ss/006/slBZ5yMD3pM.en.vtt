 7th May 15 by removing the hood by 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.300
 example you can sing it in a 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.930
 tone slightly higher we 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.090
 let's start by playing a single 5 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.829
 that is to say instead of the soil 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.909
 traditional you will move your 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:32.020
 fourth finger on the fifth string 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.020
 third place of the fifth port 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.750
 and we go while keeping the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.770
 second and fourth finger up 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.770
 a toy a bass on the first string 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 so who starts from the sun 5 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.060
 remove the third must and put the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.140
 first finger on the second 15 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.810
 first recourse of course 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.460
 we remove the finger first strings 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.480
 d 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.480
 second third 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.290
 second empty and when playing the 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.540
 first empty strings added 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.340
 the third must on the second box 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.010
 of the third string so as to play 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.510
 a real eight minors 7th 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.230
 and only 5 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.230
 a sign 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.140
 then we will play a back 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.690
 since agreeing 2 to the agreement of 5 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.239
 and we will slide the entire back position 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:56.390
 of boxes that the waters will play a re 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.690
 always since the acord of at the agreement of 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.690
 5 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.590
 and we will remake one 5 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.630

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.600

 on the second box of the 6th string 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.710
 then we will remove the third must 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.570
 and we're just going to move this 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.570
