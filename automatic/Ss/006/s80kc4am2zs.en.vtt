00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.819
 we do not have this wave perrino 23-20 arrives 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.220
 because it does not charge and taking here a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.190
 reading a behavior in order 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.090
 positive there must be approximately 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:20.000
 from 1 to 1.3 volts n was just seen from 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:25.200
 0 to 0.3 volts and in this they have to see 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.700
 2.80 2.7 2.6 here we see that it is 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.550
 arriving 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.500
 the normal voltage although this is not the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 voltage that charges the battery but when 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.540
 the test is done with the lane with the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.910
 charger or with the usb cable has to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.650
 vote roughly about this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.640
 voltage so that all things are 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.590
 normal 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.430
 this phone here the one with the fault 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.940
 so let's show here 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.870
 when we connect here 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 we see what 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.130
 when we take the reading of voltages 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.990
 we see that they have no voltage alone 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.960
 they have here from line 3 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.700
 here if there is a normal voltage of 0.2 to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.340
 0.3 theresa voltage is not coming 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.840
 if I ask for proof here to the lines and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.840
 food is coming 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.000
 if I look at what is coming to the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.810
 power to the load line there the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.160
 we see 5.45 that is the same as the suit that 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.160
 is coming out from the charger 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.159
 but that does not happen or alves is 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.150
 to guano in this case if it happened but that 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.300
 a positive line is not coming 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.659
 then of what we know is that the 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.140
 line before entering 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.020
 when loading power alice makes contact 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.270
 in the in in a capacitor 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.840
 but when I analyze the only component 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.450
 that I can analyze from that positive line 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.890
 which is the capacitor has short in its 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.990
 two points 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.450
 of contact that should say that this 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.950
 capacitor this earth or this line 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.680
 this earth we have to lift the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.600
 capacitor either a track I test it 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.970
 if the capacitor can start it and 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.680
 change for one of them or leave it 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.570
 without the capacitor and try because in 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.660
 this case the phone is charging 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.850
 phone starts to show the lightning 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.870
 try to load but it heats up 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.450
 phone sometimes charges out there 30% 40% 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.819
 stops charging and starts to overheat 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.610
 then in this case we have discovered 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.560
 the flaw is that the line has a 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.569
 short capacitor let's remove it and 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.849
 we try to see 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.700
 good just remove the condenser the 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.040
 phone is still short the line continues 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.130
 still short then I still have 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.380
 two more things to do 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.180
 here we are going to try it on this side is 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.880
 normal that each continuous earth but 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.620
 here should not continue I'm missing two 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.690
 things to do a remove the pin from 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.180
 load to see if internally state united 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.850
 with the earth the other thing would be to remove the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.950
 Notifier day that does have two 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.830
 tracks to lands internally I also know 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.080
 what would that do to me and if none of the 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.630
 two remove the short on that helix line 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.240
 of power and I could only fix it 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.340
 if I remove propeller the power if I would not have 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.990
 to send direct charge to the pin 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:39.130
 positive I grab and the positive point does not 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.410
 I let him touch this line he raised 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.300
 I send a cable from there to the point 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.130
 positive battery was going to charge 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.400
 directly without having to take the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.530
 battery but you have to remove it do not leave it 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.420
 so soldier as in original but 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.560
 lift it up and let it fly that does not 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.780
 touch the base where I was going to weld 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.640
 and just remove the charging pin and the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.810
 short continues on the line 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.350
 leaving me as the last option to withdraw the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.510
 diode and try it 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.210
 Well , we have here the phone already 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.860
 we have also removed the god and follow 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.109
 not working 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.760
 the short continues on the track wanting 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.980
 say that we do not have any other 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.460
 alternative but change the power isr 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.800
 but this phone was hit and here 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.600
 we see how this sun has also sunk 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.390
 armor has pretty sinking this 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.670
 shielding has other hits here and the 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.110
 the one here is also badly beaten 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.690
 meaning that it was a strong blow 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.550
 of the phone then I will not risk 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.650
 to change the inside that the phone 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.140
 can turn off what I'm going to do is that 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.350
 I'm already here preparing the pizza 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.230
 removed the positive pizza because when 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.360
 sun of the pin the footprint to be free there 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.919
 will not be making contact with 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.690
 no other as here with labor 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.030
 but from here I'm going to take out a cable 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.130
 direct to the positive pin of the battery 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.040
 then the voltage that I entered by the 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.140
 charger will go directly to the battery 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.570
 and will load it and so I will be able to use 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.130
 I will be able to apply this same method 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.270
 to any blackberry any 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.970
 phone that does not want to charge 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.820
 and here we see how it takes work to 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.310
 be able to solve this failure not 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.140
 had for circuit change but that 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.330
 simply power propeller that does not 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.770
 wants to answer how the phone is 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.870
 turning on and running normal 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.150
 then we already see here the four lines 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.790
 they are welded and they have left 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.800
 these surgical head with a scalpel 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.650
 that have good sharpness in the 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.680
 positive track because I did not want that 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.330
 I made contact and from here I will send 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.099
 the cable now yes to the positive line 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.400
 and here we see then the work 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:55.310
 finished there we see that afterwards they are a 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.699
 cable to the positive pin that do not touch and neither 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.830
 can not touch the base where I was going to 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.629
 soldier if you do not want to damage the pizza 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.750
 they leave the pizza alone in the air 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:07.060
 Poite to the pin and 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.850
 the battery positive is here 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.880
 and there I would have to load and get the 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.200
 required voltage here the end of the 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.900
 drums 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.680
 let's then see if the 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:24.280
 voltage we will turn then the voltage is 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.990
 going straight 5.45 and now the phone 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.700
 call to tell people that only what 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.640
 they discharge two hours since the voltage 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:34.600
 what happens is higher than normal that was 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.060
 from 3.7 to 4 volts there we see how we have 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.790
 soldier 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.970
 and as we have soldier here then the 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.490
 end with this we will repair any 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.830
 blackberry that does not want to carry us with 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.920
 the normal method or by the tracks 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.900
