hello and welcome to my unboxing of the

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.860 
hello and welcome to my unboxing of the
zoo's<00:00:03.659> sabertooth<00:00:04.380> z77<00:00:05.250> mother<00:00:05.819> book<00:00:06.000> so

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
zoo's sabertooth z77 mother book so

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.830 
zoo's sabertooth z77 mother book so
let's<00:00:07.649> just<00:00:07.740> go<00:00:08.069> over<00:00:08.280> some<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.059> specs

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
let's just go over some of the specs

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.830 
let's just go over some of the specs
well<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.559> stuff<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.860> comes<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.840> in

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
well the stuff that comes in this in

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.049 
well the stuff that comes in this in
this<00:00:12.960> month<00:00:13.170> or<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.530> course<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.980> big<00:00:14.849> thing

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
this month or so of course the big thing

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.050 
this month or so of course the big thing
about<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.830> dispersed<00:00:16.830> answer<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.910> big

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
about the dispersed answer is it the big

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.179 
about the dispersed answer is it the big
thing<00:00:18.270> about<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.720> saber-tooth<00:00:19.650> motherboards

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
thing about the saber-tooth motherboards

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.620 
thing about the saber-tooth motherboards
is<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.539> has<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.350> thermal<00:00:23.250> arm<00:00:23.550> which<00:00:24.359> are

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
is that it has the thermal arm which are

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.140 
is that it has the thermal arm which are
basically<00:00:24.930> has<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.529> fans<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.670> shroud<00:00:27.119> that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
basically has to fans and a shroud that

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.370 
basically has to fans and a shroud that
goes<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> multiple<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.080> I'll<00:00:28.230> see

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
goes up the multiple which I'll see

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.910 
goes up the multiple which I'll see
later<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.859> directs<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> air<00:00:30.060> over<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.920> over

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
later that directs the air over the over

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
later that directs the air over the over
the<00:00:31.949> power<00:00:32.460> delivery<00:00:32.910> unit<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.270> CPU<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the power delivery unit to the CPU and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.440 
the power delivery unit to the CPU and
all<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> bits<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> get<00:00:34.559> hot<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.070> motherboard

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
all the bits to get hot on a motherboard

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.819 
all the bits to get hot on a motherboard
we<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> thermal<00:00:37.320> radar<00:00:37.500> which<00:00:37.680> is

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
we have the thermal radar which is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.530 
we have the thermal radar which is
basically<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:38.850> lecture<00:00:39.030> how<00:00:39.239> many<00:00:39.360> points

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
basically don't lecture how many points

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.010 
basically don't lecture how many points
it<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.469> shows<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:42.090> about<00:00:42.390> uh<00:00:42.719> no

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
it is but it shows you on about uh no

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.660 
it is but it shows you on about uh no
one<00:00:43.230> two<00:00:43.379> three<00:00:43.649> four<00:00:43.829> five<00:00:44.010> six<00:00:44.070> points<00:00:44.640> in

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
one two three four five six points in

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
one two three four five six points in
the<00:00:44.760> model<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> temperature<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:45.989> on

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the model on what the temperature is on

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.680 
the model on what the temperature is on
those<00:00:46.800> six<00:00:47.070> points<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> dust

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
those six points we have the dust

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.000 
those six points we have the dust
defender<00:00:49.050> which<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.320> covers<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.829> go<00:00:49.890> over

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
defender which is covers that go over

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910 
defender which is covers that go over
the<00:00:50.190> PCI<00:00:50.520> Express<00:00:50.850> ports<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.350> tough

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the PCI Express ports we have tough

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.060 
the PCI Express ports we have tough
components<00:00:53.550> which<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.879> basically<00:00:54.239> I'm

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
components which is basically I'm

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
certified by military arm which shone is

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160 
certified by military arm which shone is
cool<00:00:59.250> i<00:00:59.280> guess<00:00:59.370> i<00:00:59.699> don't<00:00:59.789> know<00:00:59.910> how<00:01:00.059> how<00:01:00.989> much

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
cool i guess i don't know how how much

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.939 
cool i guess i don't know how how much
how<00:01:01.770> much<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.129> true<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.239> know

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
how much how true that is but you know

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.270 
how much how true that is but you know
we<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.900> new<00:01:07.049> digi<00:01:07.470> powell<00:01:07.860> control

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
we have the the new digi powell control

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.530 
we have the the new digi powell control
so<00:01:09.409> digital<00:01:10.409> park<00:01:10.650> at<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:11.150> USB<00:01:12.150> bios<00:01:12.360> flash

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so digital park at all USB bios flash

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
so digital park at all USB bios flash
back<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.110> you're<00:01:13.290> obtaining<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.950> bios<00:01:14.400> and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
back so if you're obtaining a bios and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.330 
back so if you're obtaining a bios and
there's<00:01:15.420> um<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:16.110> power<00:01:16.650> failure<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.189> can

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
there's um a power failure you can

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700 
there's um a power failure you can
always<00:01:17.640> put<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.720> USB<00:01:18.990> stick<00:01:19.290> plug<00:01:19.439> into<00:01:19.619> the

back and without ram or anything like

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.190 
back and without ram or anything like
that<00:01:21.960> installed<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.100> um<00:01:24.049> reflash<00:01:25.049> your

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that installed you can um reflash your

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.359 
that installed you can um reflash your
bias<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.509> network<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.950> control

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
bias and there is network I control

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.819 
bias and there is network I control
which<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> real-time<00:01:30.170> network<00:01:31.170> bandwidth

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
which is real-time network bandwidth

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
which is real-time network bandwidth
control<00:01:32.360> haven't<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.600> looked<00:01:33.780> into<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
control haven't really looked into that

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.980 
control haven't really looked into that
but<00:01:34.409> yeah<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.350> see<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:38.270> UEFI<00:01:39.270> you

charge which means the charges stuff
like<00:01:45.659> iPads<00:01:46.049> quicker<00:01:46.439> than<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.040> all<00:01:47.130> they

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
like iPads quicker than what in all they

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.719 
like iPads quicker than what in all they
would<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:48.600> has<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:50.360> ESD<00:01:51.360> cards<00:01:52.350> no<00:01:52.860> guards<00:01:53.310> yes

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
would it has the ESD cards no guards yes

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.870 
believe it is and some mousy Pablo and
you<00:04:33.530> have<00:04:33.830> some<00:04:34.370> SATA<00:04:34.880> cables<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:36.880> believe

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
you have some SATA cables I believe

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.000 
you have some SATA cables I believe
these<00:04:38.510> ones<00:04:38.750> are<00:04:39.080> they<00:04:39.500> broke<00:04:39.650> out<00:04:39.770> of<00:04:39.830> right

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
these ones are they broke out of right

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.140 
these ones are they broke out of right
angle<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.400> get<00:04:40.580> two<00:04:40.700> of<00:04:40.730> each<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.030> get

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
angle so you get two of each you get

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.640 
angle so you get two of each you get
sadder<00:04:41.360> 3-pointers<00:04:42.050> headed<00:04:42.290> to<00:04:42.380> point<00:04:42.590> o

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
sadder 3-pointers headed to point o

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.920 
sadder 3-pointers headed to point o
cables<00:04:42.980> I<00:04:43.160> believe<00:04:43.610> that's<00:04:43.730> what<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:44.060> so

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
cables I believe that's what it is so

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.620 
cables I believe that's what it is so
long<00:04:45.200> now<00:04:45.680> let's<00:04:45.890> move<00:04:46.130> on<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.670> middle<00:04:47.480> boy

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
long now let's move on to the middle boy

00:04:47.630 --> 00:05:05.440 
long now let's move on to the middle boy
let's<00:04:47.810> get<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.020> Box<00:04:48.170> up<00:04:48.350> and<00:05:02.650> okay<00:05:04.300> pull<00:05:05.300> out

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
let's get the Box up and okay pull out

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.660 
let's get the Box up and okay pull out
of<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.660> answer<00:05:06.140> stake<00:05:06.410> let<00:05:06.890> me<00:05:07.010> just<00:05:07.190> ground

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
of the answer stake let me just ground

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:22.360 
of the answer stake let me just ground
myself<00:05:13.930> okay<00:05:15.760> so

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.010 

here<00:05:23.370> is<00:05:23.639> the<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.949> Azusa<00:05:26.280> z77<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.419> motherboard
