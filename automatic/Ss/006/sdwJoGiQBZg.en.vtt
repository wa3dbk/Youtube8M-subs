00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.440
 are able to sleep the fish some 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:09.740
 time the fish close their eyes as 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.860
 us and they stop flapping and throwing 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.230
 on the seabed the answer is no 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.600
 human beings good in general those 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.630
 vertebrate animals have a way 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.090
 concrete sleep because his 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.060
 brain receives many stimuli and its 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.220
 intelligence is much more complex for 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.590
 be able to replenish your brain so that 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.720
 rest is necessary to enter a 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.050
 special state that we know 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.050
 as the phases of the dream phases of the dream 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.870
 in which the brain is repaired to 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.510
 to be able to face the next day assimilate 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.610
 information and others nonetheless in 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.739
 the fish is very different 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.550
 most fish such as 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.370
 sharks do not sleep the eyes not the 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.700
 they can close because they do not have eyelids 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.350
 all they do is say no 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.249
 some moments that is when they are not 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.840
 hunting that move more slowly and 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.149
 slow down your metabolism 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.109
 but what is the dream known as 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:15.020
 such do not sleep if you know that there is some 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:18.319
 species out there loose I think that by 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.960
 example the parrotfish the parrotfish is capable 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:22.909
 to sleep or is capable of good not 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.100
 sleep like the human being but it is 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.909
 true that ceases its activity during 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.689
 part of the day however is not common 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.000
 The most common is that the fish 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.829
 rest while they are swimming nobody 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.239
 slow down slows down your metabolism 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.549
 and the explanation is no longer needed 

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:45.829
 As I said, it's that they do not receive 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.319
 varied stimuli always receive the 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.810
 same type of stimuli in the sea 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.840
 it is always the same there is a pattern of 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.270
 behavior and in the case of fish that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.329
 they do not have great intelligence good the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.579
 most fish because there are others that do 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.090
 because they do not manage to carry out the phases of 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.560
 dream that humans have 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.030
 interesting but true most of 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.030
 fish do not sleep
