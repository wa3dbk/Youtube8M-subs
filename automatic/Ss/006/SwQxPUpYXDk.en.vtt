00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.620 
competition and I'm looking at a 6 7 10
split<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> 4<00:01:07.260> 7<00:01:07.619> 10<00:01:07.799> split<00:01:08.150> they<00:01:09.150> don't<00:01:09.390> look

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
split or a 4 7 10 split they don't look

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.530 
split or a 4 7 10 split they don't look
so<00:01:09.770> impossible<00:01:10.770> because<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.610> I've<00:01:11.939> done<00:01:12.210> for

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so impossible because all I've done for

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.450 
so impossible because all I've done for
a<00:01:12.960> half<00:01:13.140> hour<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.560> each<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.890> my<00:01:14.010> practice

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
a half hour in each of my practice

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060 
a half hour in each of my practice
sessions<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.970> shoot<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> 10<00:01:16.229> pin<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.710> 7<00:01:16.920> pin

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
sessions is shoot at a 10 pin and 7 pin

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.609 
sessions is shoot at a 10 pin and 7 pin
only<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:18.030> only<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.540> fraction<00:01:18.869> difference

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
only and it's only a fraction difference

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
only and it's only a fraction difference
in<00:01:19.770> making<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.189> spare<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.270> makes<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
in making that spare now it makes the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.410 
in making that spare now it makes the
spare<00:01:21.960> look<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.770> actually<00:01:23.299> spare<00:01:24.299> it

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
spare look like I can actually spare it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.260 
spare look like I can actually spare it
in<00:01:25.080> competition<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.369> confidence<00:01:26.909> so

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
in competition and that confidence so

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.090 
in competition and that confidence so
many<00:01:27.540> times<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.530> difference<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.979> making

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
many times is the difference in making

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.730 
many times is the difference in making
it<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.579> not<00:01:29.610> making<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.049> seven<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it and not making it now then seven and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
it and not making it now then seven and
a<00:01:31.770> half<00:01:31.799> racks<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.640> record<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.240> shoot

and<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.080> doesn't<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:04.440> switch<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and that doesn't that switch to a

oh<00:02:13.380> that's<00:02:14.070> Lou<00:02:14.880> yeah<00:02:15.360> now<00:02:16.820> Tim<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:17.850> asking<00:02:18.330> me

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
oh that's Lou yeah now Tim is asking me

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.500 
oh that's Lou yeah now Tim is asking me
why<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.500> don't<00:02:19.620> switch<00:02:20.280> balls<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:21.480> a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
why is it that I don't switch balls to a

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.920 
why is it that I don't switch balls to a
spare<00:02:21.810> ball<00:02:21.990> when<00:02:22.200> I'm<00:02:22.350> shooting<00:02:22.560> spares<00:02:23.010> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
spare ball when I'm shooting spares and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.750 
spare ball when I'm shooting spares and
certainly<00:02:24.930> it's<00:02:25.110> because<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.710> can<00:02:26.310> get<00:02:26.550> my

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
certainly it's because I can get my

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.160 
certainly it's because I can get my
first<00:02:27.150> ball<00:02:27.360> no<00:02:27.660> matter<00:02:27.870> what<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.470> dull

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
first ball no matter what it is dull

different grip that I'm throwing on my
first<00:02:56.190> shot<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.970> I'd<00:02:57.120> hate<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.660> when<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.470> throw

first shot and I'd hate it when I throw

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.140 
first shot and I'd hate it when I throw
different<00:02:59.010> grips<00:02:59.540> in<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.410> same<00:03:01.590> frame<00:03:02.150> that

different grips in the same frame that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.870 
different grips in the same frame that
just<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:04.020> works<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.709> back<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.640> day

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
just it works on and back in in the day

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.060 
just it works on and back in in the day
when<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.240> didn't<00:03:06.600> have<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:07.380> know<00:03:07.410> thumb<00:03:07.769> slugs

you had a plastic ball in the end in the

outer a resin ball in your hand or our
blue<00:03:14.400> hammer<00:03:14.670> are<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.540> regular<00:03:15.840> urethane

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
blue hammer are just a regular urethane

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.530 
blue hammer are just a regular urethane
ball<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:17.130> difference<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.880> feel<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
ball the difference in the feel and the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.290 
ball the difference in the feel and the
texture<00:03:18.989> was<00:03:19.470> such<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:20.100> just<00:03:20.340> got<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.820> it

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
texture was such that it just got to it

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.060 
texture was such that it just got to it
was<00:03:21.360> miserable<00:03:21.750> trying<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.290> control<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.739> I

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
was miserable trying to control it I

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.880 
was miserable trying to control it I
have<00:03:23.400> tried<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> spare<00:03:24.150> ball<00:03:24.300> theory<00:03:24.709> but<00:03:25.709> I

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
have tried the spare ball theory but I

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.850 
have tried the spare ball theory but I
did<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.400> without<00:03:26.970> backing<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.959> ball<00:03:28.110> up<00:03:28.380> at<00:03:28.650> it

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
did so without backing the ball up at it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.160 
did so without backing the ball up at it
so<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.220> chopped<00:03:29.610> just<00:03:29.880> as<00:03:30.000> much<00:03:30.180> with<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.870> spare

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
so I chopped just as much with a spare

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.050 
so I chopped just as much with a spare
ball<00:03:31.350> as<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.980> did<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> regular<00:03:32.670> ball<00:03:32.820> I

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
ball as I did with a regular ball I

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.600 
ball as I did with a regular ball I
didn't<00:03:33.989> get<00:03:34.170> any<00:03:34.350> better<00:03:34.590> using<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.100> spare<00:03:35.400> ball

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
didn't get any better using a spare ball

bit facing the tenpin area but more

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.400 
bit facing the tenpin area but more
importantly<00:06:25.639> you're<00:06:26.240> wanting<00:06:26.750> to<00:06:26.900> place<00:06:27.169> the

ball left as to return right so

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.290 
ball left as to return right so
definitely<00:06:33.020> not<00:06:33.169> right<00:06:33.860> as<00:06:34.250> to<00:06:34.940> one<00:06:35.150> it

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
definitely not right as to one it

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:45.559 
definitely not right as to one it
returned<00:06:35.630> left

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.670 

all<00:06:46.569> right<00:06:46.749> now<00:06:46.960> that<00:06:46.990> was<00:06:47.259> pretty<00:06:47.499> good

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
all right now that was pretty good

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.679 
all right now that was pretty good
because<00:06:48.039> he<00:06:48.430> exaggerated<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.479> left

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:49.689 
because he exaggerated the left

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.529 
because he exaggerated the left
placement<00:06:50.309> which<00:06:51.309> now<00:06:51.729> got<00:06:52.330> that

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:52.539 
placement which now got that

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:54.929 
placement which now got that
figure-eight<00:06:52.960> and<00:06:53.379> it<00:06:54.099> was<00:06:54.249> so<00:06:54.430> much<00:06:54.460> in<00:06:54.789> fact

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:54.939 
figure-eight and it was so much in fact

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:56.969 
figure-eight and it was so much in fact
that<00:06:55.180> he<00:06:55.270> missed<00:06:55.479> right<00:06:55.749> missed<00:06:56.650> the<00:06:56.770> tenpin

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:56.979 
that he missed right missed the tenpin

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.689 
that he missed right missed the tenpin
altogether<00:06:57.580> but<00:06:58.139> one<00:06:59.139> of<00:06:59.289> Tim's<00:07:00.009> tendencies

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
altogether but one of Tim's tendencies

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.239 
altogether but one of Tim's tendencies
is<00:07:00.879> to<00:07:01.120> migrate<00:07:01.360> that<00:07:01.870> push<00:07:02.680> away<00:07:02.860> to<00:07:03.009> the

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:03.249 
is to migrate that push away to the

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:07.499 
is to migrate that push away to the
right<00:07:03.460> and<00:07:05.339> you<00:07:06.339> negated<00:07:06.849> that<00:07:06.879> to<00:07:07.180> the<00:07:07.300> point

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:07.509 
right and you negated that to the point

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.110 
right and you negated that to the point
even<00:07:07.779> to<00:07:08.499> fault<00:07:08.800> the<00:07:08.889> other<00:07:09.129> direction<00:07:09.490> which

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
even to fault the other direction which

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.999 
even to fault the other direction which
is<00:07:10.270> great<00:07:10.479> that<00:07:10.509> means<00:07:10.839> you<00:07:10.930> have<00:07:11.020> control<00:07:11.469> as

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:12.009 
is great that means you have control as

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.100 
is great that means you have control as
long<00:07:12.099> as<00:07:12.370> you<00:07:12.490> got<00:07:12.669> focus<00:07:13.360> on<00:07:13.569> it<00:07:13.749> you<00:07:14.020> have

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.110 
long as you got focus on it you have

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.269 
long as you got focus on it you have
control<00:07:14.620> over<00:07:14.650> it

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:15.279 
control over it

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.980 
control over it
some<00:07:15.669> people<00:07:15.939> can<00:07:16.120> focus<00:07:16.330> on<00:07:16.599> it<00:07:16.719> all<00:07:16.839> they

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
some people can focus on it all they

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.059 
some people can focus on it all they
want<00:07:17.020> they<00:07:17.349> just<00:07:17.529> don't<00:07:17.710> have<00:07:17.830> any<00:07:17.860> control

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:18.069
