00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.200
 hello welcome to this video in which 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.060
 I'm going to show you three ways in which 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.190
 to be able to do the French manicure 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.110
 I have one, we are pretty short 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.170
 but good of it because it serves to 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.119
 all kinds of nail lengths come to us 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.800
 in three ways because it seems to me that 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.160
 everyone will be able to use the way 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.619
 more imposes on him that the easiest was what 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.710
 that you like for the first way 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.949
 or simply what we do not need 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.169
 is a porcelain based enamel or a 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.700
 rosita well as we like I'm going to 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.370
 use one of these that is called pro 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.990
 white that besides that is supposed to 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.300
 whitening a little the nails is like a 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.010
 pink that I like a lot and for the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.000
 white I'm just going to use the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.310
 mercadona white simply for the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.980
 second way besides needing these 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.480
 two enamels that you have taught 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.310
 we are going to need it is normal and 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.490
 current is normal that we can 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.040
 use for stationery 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.460
 and for the third way we're going to 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.530
 need a brush in my case is a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.280
 of nails but it is not necessary we can 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.500
 use any brush that is 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.380
 crafts or anything that does not 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.690
 be only nails then let's 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.240
 start the first way would be the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 classic way is to say to pulse but with 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.200
 an upcoming trick 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 in this case I 'm just going to do one 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.890
 base because I do not like the base 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.290
 is very different from the natural I do not 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.940
 like you want very pink or very 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.100
 pressed because I think it makes a 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.450
 the nail is very artificial but that's not 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.410
 I would adapt it a bit to you 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.990
 tastes as you see I'm putting the 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.119
 base before the French hairline 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.880
 for the other two ways of doing 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.560
 different I will not put the base on 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.229
 of the white stripe that is secondly 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.729
 I will teach them as it is therefore 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.410
 convenient that you choose me a base that 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.930
 is very opaque or very dark because 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.180
 then the line the white line does not go to 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.890
 get very white may it take some 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.090
 porcelain tone although the truth is that 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.670
 me with everyone we tried 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.310
 had that problem good as I say 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.009
 the first freehand way is simply 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.569
 a little trick before applying them 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.540
 I'll just try to say so then what 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.390
 you see very normal is that what we do 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.709
 is to move the gaps well because I 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.760
 that I know counseling is that instead of 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.209
 move the brush 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.760
 this way we move the finger what 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.230
 Colombians in this way because I eat 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.000
 we have the hand supported the pulse goes to 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.030
 be much better than if we use this 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.440
 hand that we will already have in the air between 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.940
 he just dipped the brush 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.810
 we drain it we put it on the tip and 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.810
 we move the finger 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.660
 this way if you see the line I have left 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.250
 much better than doing it I put it on 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.200
 we are already confessing that by doing 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.870
 pulse with the other hand I get pretty 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.630
 wrong as you see the result is very 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.190
 well it 's the same way that I'm going to 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.710
 teach how I said you need 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.490
 do it a bit of the breast for 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.260
 example like this that I have here what 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.230
 what we are going to do is use is the mode 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.660
 of guides good guides are not usually 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.150
 very expensive but if for little it's worth 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.890
 we can save doing it at home or if not 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
 we have guides once we have agreed 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.870
 buy well then this would be another 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.070
 way simply put the zeal 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.170
 following the French line as 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.540
 We want to come by contract as you are 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.340
 doing me or else in straight if it is that 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.530
 we like the line above that you already know 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.200
 that can be straight or shaped like 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.790
 smile just what we have to 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.790
 to do is to take our white enamel 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.100
 and paint I collect without any care 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:51.080
 removing the tip and also painting 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.080
 also the zeal does not matter 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.550
 in this way 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.880
 and take advantage of it, we throw it away when 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.930
 whether it's dry or half dry 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.959
 we can perfectly do all the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.430
 hand and do it simply when 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.290
 we just made our mind has been 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.420
 retired the cachitos of zeal does not matter 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.890
 the national consti that all of the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.410
 all because we can drag paint 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.370
 look at the result result also 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.180
 it's fantastic as you see and now it would be 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.400
 when I take my normal base and I 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.199
 would apply above 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.199
 as if it were a glitter enamel 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.280
 in this way 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.660
 I for example do not use top coat on 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.980
 shine above but if you want that 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.660
 about the French manicure if you 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.270
 I advise you to do it because of some 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.340
 way it protects us a little bit I do not 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.350
 has done because I usually wear the same 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.480
 Nail color one or two days not only 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.280
 change one of the company nails me 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.050
 bother to throw this shine of 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.820
 above but if you want me to 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.980
 last this french manicure I advise you 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.540
 that you throw the shine on top of 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.660
 hardener enamel or when 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.270
 transparent that as you want and already 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.860
 you know in different ways so that 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.140
 dry faster so that they are 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.210
 worthy of long lasting good that 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.470
 you have or that you like it over 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.770
 In addition to everything I am doing 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.630
 you wanted a capita or whatever you wanted 66 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.820
 make a way as it is also very 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.880
 well it does not look good if it's worth a third 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.020
 way is a little 00 before backwards 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.970
 like the other way around, well, what am I going to 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.920
 do is realize it at the tip without 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.650
 no care I will not need your 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.140
 I will need nothing and I have at hand my 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.930
 brush and what I'm going to do just 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:45.460
 is to draw the line of the French 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:50.380
 from inside and tell me stain 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.080
 point without any care of them 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.090
 in this horrible way and now what 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.060
 I do is draw the girl with the brush 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:02.660
 removing 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.660
 the excess that I have left with the brush 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:11.500
 in this way there is someone to use with 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:15.100
 This nail polish remover for women 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.170
 a good brush, how do I do it? 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.970
 at the moment and my enamel is not 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.160
 to stay very fast because it is not 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.320
 necessary if you have a polish that dries 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.630
 very fast or take a long time to 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.190
 do it then then you could wet a 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.530
 always with before you remove the 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.050
 excess in a paper so that it does not stop 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.590
 let's say harass the brush of this 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.120
 way we do not fence around let's say 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.370
 nail polish remover that will spoil the 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.290
 line and as you see with this way the 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.170
 result is also very good for 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.220
 we would do the same to take our base and 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.220
 put it on top 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:57.750
 somehow in the third then I 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.830
 I'm going to do a test and I'm not going to put 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.830
 another base capita above 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.800
 also quite abundant I'm not 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.390
 putting an extra layer and as you can see 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.840
 see quite the difference between the two 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.840
 tones 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.150
 but the girl is killing me in color 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.620
 white he is spoiling the line of 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.330
 the French then as you see is a 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.030
 method that can be done against hours 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.380
 already have hours later and well then 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.900
 if you can observe are three ways 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.229
 different from which you can choose the 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.030
 that you better like what you give you best 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.680
 and nothing, I hope you liked it 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.070
 the video is very easy to make a 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.070
 French manicure
