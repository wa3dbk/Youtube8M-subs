00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
you need to do for join a private server

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.470 
you need to do for join a private server
so<00:00:49.579> when<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:50.239> install<00:00:50.870> what<00:00:51.739> for<00:00:52.100> graph<00:00:52.480> you

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
so when you install what for graph you

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.260 
so when you install what for graph you
need<00:00:53.660> to<00:00:53.899> find<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.590> private<00:00:55.190> server<00:00:55.489> saver

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
need to find a private server saver

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.440 
need to find a private server saver
example<00:00:58.690> just<00:00:59.690> take<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.200> go<00:01:00.380> go<00:01:01.390> now<00:01:02.390> you

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
example just take that and go go now you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.730 
example just take that and go go now you
have<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.870> bunch<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:04.360> private<00:01:05.360> server<00:01:05.719> and<00:01:06.590> we

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
have a bunch of private server and we

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.130 
have a bunch of private server and we
take<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:07.280> one<00:01:07.490> for<00:01:07.520> example

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.660 

so<00:01:13.440> first<00:01:14.440> thing<00:01:14.620> you<00:01:14.680> need<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.800> do<00:01:15.040> is<00:01:15.220> to

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
so first thing you need to do is to

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.980 
so first thing you need to do is to
register<00:01:16.120> make<00:01:16.990> an<00:01:17.110> account<00:01:17.440> and<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.450> your

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
register make an account and the your

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.960 
register make an account and the your
JDT<00:01:20.530> see<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.330> real<00:01:23.020> list<00:01:23.610> every<00:01:24.610> server

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
JDT see is to a real list every server

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.660 
JDT see is to a real list every server
of<00:01:25.300> his<00:01:25.540> home<00:01:25.810> realist<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.130> need<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.430> find

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
of his home realist so you need to find

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.040 
of his home realist so you need to find
server<00:01:28.479> relish<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.979> just<00:01:30.220> copy<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.750> energy<00:01:31.750> you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
server relish so just copy it energy you

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.980 
server relish so just copy it energy you
need<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.380> see<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.920> version<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.700> server<00:01:34.030> so

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
need to see the version of the server so

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.499 
need to see the version of the server so
this<00:01:35.110> one<00:01:35.350> says<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.710> created<00:01:36.400> three<00:01:36.790> dot<00:01:37.150> X

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
this one says that created three dot X

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.140 
this one says that created three dot X
so<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.500> can<00:01:38.680> be<00:01:38.830> tweeted<00:01:39.369> attribute<00:01:39.790> of<00:01:39.909> two

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
so you can be tweeted attribute of two

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.359 
so you can be tweeted attribute of two
or<00:01:40.420> three<00:01:40.659> three<00:01:40.930> two<00:01:40.960> three<00:01:41.080> it<00:01:41.950> doesn't

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
or three three two three it doesn't

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.270 
or three three two three it doesn't
really<00:01:42.460> matter<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:44.080> when<00:01:44.830> you're<00:01:44.979> installing

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
really matter so when you're installing

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.730 
really matter so when you're installing
work<00:01:45.670> for<00:01:45.910> class<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.420> need<00:01:46.660> to<00:01:46.960> see<00:01:47.500> if<00:01:47.619> you

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
work for class you need to see if you

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.910 
work for class you need to see if you
had<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.890> good<00:01:48.130> version<00:01:48.340> if<00:01:49.000> you<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.440> you

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
had a good version if you have it you

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.980 
had a good version if you have it you
just<00:01:51.130> need<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.580> go<00:01:52.240> in<00:01:52.420> your<00:01:52.570> watercraft
