00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
microphone on the way which is a desktop

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.180 
microphone on the way which is a desktop
microphone<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.470> should<00:02:43.709> sound<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.160> bit

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
microphone and it should sound a bit

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.699 
microphone and it should sound a bit
more<00:02:44.459> clearer<00:02:44.730> than<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.630> turtlebeach<00:02:46.500> I'm

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
more clearer than this turtlebeach I'm

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.699 
more clearer than this turtlebeach I'm
using<00:02:46.859> right<00:02:47.069> now<00:02:47.099> because<00:02:47.459> it's<00:02:48.500> made<00:02:49.500> for

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
using right now because it's made for

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.550 
using right now because it's made for
the<00:02:49.799> Xbox<00:02:50.190> but<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.730> suppose<00:02:51.239> it'll<00:02:52.139> do<00:02:52.319> for<00:02:52.500> now

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
the Xbox but I suppose it'll do for now

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.349 
the Xbox but I suppose it'll do for now
but<00:02:52.859> until<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.340> new<00:02:53.579> microphone<00:02:54.030> arrives

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
but until the new microphone arrives

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.220 
but until the new microphone arrives
you'll<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.139> do<00:02:55.260> with<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:56.010> quality<00:02:57.230> so

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
you'll have to do with this quality so

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.680 
you'll have to do with this quality so
see<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.829> next<00:02:58.859> video<00:02:59.250> guys<00:02:59.400> bye<00:03:00.680> bye
