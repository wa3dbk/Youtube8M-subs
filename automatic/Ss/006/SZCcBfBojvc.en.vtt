00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
with the beat to continue and there's a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.050 
with the beat to continue and there's a
letter<00:01:08.070> B<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.670> also<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.110> animal<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.189> I'm

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
checkpoint or start over and again like

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260 
checkpoint or start over and again like
I<00:01:22.110> said<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.830> app<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.400> pretty<00:01:23.729> cool<00:01:24.090> because

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
I said this app is pretty cool because

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.660 
I said this app is pretty cool because
it<00:01:24.720> will<00:01:24.840> keep<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> busy<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.830> actually<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it will keep you busy for a actually a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
it will keep you busy for a actually a
long<00:01:27.000> time<00:01:27.299> especially<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.960> your<00:01:28.110> get

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
long time especially if your get

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.359 
long time especially if your get
confused<00:01:29.280> easily<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.350> another<00:01:31.350> thing<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
confused easily and another thing is it

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.870 
confused easily and another thing is it
has<00:01:32.520> three<00:01:32.850> different<00:01:33.030> tests<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.890> mean<00:01:35.549> this

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
has three different tests so I mean this

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.429 
has three different tests so I mean this
