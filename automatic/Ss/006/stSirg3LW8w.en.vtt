00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.071
Ester Ledecká was a big hope for medals at 
 the European Youth Olympic Winter Festival 2011.

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.740
She has definitely lived up to the fans’ expectations.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.266
That is because she is the first Czech competitor 
 to win the gold medal in snowboarding.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:20.078
Ester, what does the medal you won today mean to you?

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:25.962
It means a brilliant success for me and it inspires me to 
 work even harder in training as well as in upcoming competitions.

00:00:26.062 --> 00:00:28.741
You also do the Alpine disciplines as well as Snowboarding.

00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:35.582
How does today’s victory influence your future decisions 
 about what discipline you will finally choose?

00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:40.605
I think it will not influence anything. I will 
 just choose according to what I like

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:44.800
and that is not according to success, but 
 what I feel I am better at.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.828
So what do you feel you are better at right now?

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:49.800
I feel equally comfortable in both disciplines.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.697
How did the race feel today?

00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:57.827
It was a beautiful slope; I really enjoyed 
 it so it was great overall. 

00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:02.378
Now that you have sewn up the Gold, could you share 
 with us whether you have any lucky charms or

00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:05.814
if you have any rituals before the race?

00:01:06.014 --> 00:01:12.687
Well I have breakfast in the morning and then for 
 example, I go for a short run, 

00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:16.310
but I don’t really do anything special.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.949
So we thought.

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:22.593
We know you come from a family of 
 artists so we would like to know

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:28.709
what inspired you to become involved in peak sports.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.983
Well, my family moved to the mountains and there was 
 not much to do, so I started to ski

00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:43.240
when I was a kid and then I also joined snowboarding because my 
 brother did it and I wanted to be as good as him.

00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:48.680
Thank you. Now, where would you like your 
 career to head in the future?

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:55.840
I have no idea right now. I live for 
 the moment and today has been great

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.240
so I will see how it goes in the future. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.620
How will you celebrate your victory and will you 
 give yourself some kind of holiday? 

00:02:03.043 --> 00:02:11.710
Well, I am not sure if I can find time to have holidays but today I 
 will have a drink with the other snowboarders.
