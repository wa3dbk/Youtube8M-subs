for ways to beat the system and run off
with<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.990> loot<00:00:32.020> and<00:00:32.529> here's<00:00:33.190> how<00:00:33.400> to<00:00:33.460> do<00:00:33.730> it

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
with the loot and here's how to do it

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.930 
with the loot and here's how to do it
with<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.300> funfair<00:00:34.510> graph<00:00:35.340> okay<00:00:36.340> let's<00:00:36.789> have<00:00:36.879> a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
with the funfair graph okay let's have a

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.360 
with the funfair graph okay let's have a
little<00:00:37.090> peek<00:00:37.360> inside<00:00:38.190> lurking<00:00:39.190> in<00:00:39.309> the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
little peek inside lurking in the

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.099 
little peek inside lurking in the
workings<00:00:39.789> of<00:00:39.910> all<00:00:40.059> these<00:00:40.300> machines<00:00:40.780> is<00:00:41.079> a

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
workings of all these machines is a

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.590 
workings of all these machines is a
little<00:00:41.500> yellow<00:00:41.800> box<00:00:42.010> like<00:00:42.340> this<00:00:42.609> one<00:00:42.670> filled

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
little yellow box like this one filled

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.410 
little yellow box like this one filled
with<00:00:43.809> cash<00:00:44.199> it<00:00:44.949> operates<00:00:45.309> with<00:00:45.699> two<00:00:45.879> settings

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
with cash it operates with two settings

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.990 
with cash it operates with two settings
it<00:00:47.109> tells<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.590> grabber<00:00:47.829> how<00:00:48.250> many<00:00:48.460> times<00:00:48.760> it

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
it tells the grabber how many times it

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.540 
it tells the grabber how many times it
should<00:00:49.030> pay<00:00:49.359> out<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.840> also<00:00:50.530> how<00:00:50.980> hard<00:00:51.309> it

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
should pay out and also how hard it

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.090 
should pay out and also how hard it
should<00:00:51.579> grip<00:00:52.000> at<00:00:52.149> all<00:00:52.359> if<00:00:53.320> you<00:00:53.440> want<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.739> win<00:00:53.949> at

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
should grip at all if you want to win at

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.770 
should grip at all if you want to win at
these<00:00:54.219> machines<00:00:54.670> you're<00:00:55.300> going<00:00:55.449> to<00:00:55.539> have<00:00:55.629> to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
these machines you're going to have to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.860 
these machines you're going to have to
beat<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.170> yellow<00:00:56.469> box<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.730> how<00:00:58.300> do<00:00:58.359> you<00:00:58.539> do<00:00:58.719> it

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
beat the yellow box so how do you do it

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.650 
beat the yellow box so how do you do it
well<00:00:59.800> firstly<00:01:00.280> like<00:01:00.640> all<00:01:00.850> good<00:01:01.059> scientists

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
well firstly like all good scientists

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.049 
well firstly like all good scientists
you<00:01:01.989> have<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.320> put<00:01:02.500> in<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.739> research<00:01:03.129> the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
you have to put in the research the

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.700 
you have to put in the research the
yellow<00:01:04.239> box<00:01:04.540> sets<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:04.930> machine<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.410> pay<00:01:05.590> out

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
yellow box sets the machine to pay out

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.980 
yellow box sets the machine to pay out
after<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.160> certain<00:01:06.400> number<00:01:06.550> of<00:01:06.790> plays<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:07.780> it's

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
after a certain number of plays so it's

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.400 
after a certain number of plays so it's
1<00:01:08.200> in<00:01:08.320> 5<00:01:08.590> or<00:01:08.890> 1<00:01:09.100> in<00:01:09.250> 10<00:01:09.490> or<00:01:09.700> whatever<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.990> have

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
1 in 5 or 1 in 10 or whatever you have

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.380 
1 in 5 or 1 in 10 or whatever you have
to<00:01:11.590> learn<00:01:11.800> and<00:01:12.190> watch<00:01:12.460> what<00:01:13.030> you're<00:01:13.180> looking

to learn and watch what you're looking

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.730 
to learn and watch what you're looking
for<00:01:13.600> is<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.810> whip

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
once you've seen one start counting just

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.060 
once you've seen one start counting just
watch<00:01:20.600> those<00:01:20.869> other<00:01:21.110> suckers<00:01:21.619> come<00:01:21.830> up<00:01:21.950> and

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
watch those other suckers come up and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.130
