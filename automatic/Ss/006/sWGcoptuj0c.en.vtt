 they are available as a single function 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.050
 or multifunctional in different 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.490
 speeds 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.230

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.750
 this way you not only save time but also 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.640

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.190
 Business use 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.930
 think of a maximum of ten 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.450
 users and a monthly print 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.120
 volume between 500 and 42 100 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.070
 pages lies in the pro x line we think 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.660
 currently four models of which 2 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.180
 single function printers and two 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.579
 multi-function printer in the line of 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.260
 we think single fashion pro x printers 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.059
 the pro x4 51 dw and the pro x5 51 dw 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.420
 the difference here is the speed of 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.119
 the printers the 451 plinth with up to 36 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.540
 pages per minute and the 551 with 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.070
 a maximum of 42 pages per minute if we 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.430
 looking at the multi function is finding 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.159
 we go to the pro x4 76 dw and the pro x5 and 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.860
 76 dw here too, the difference is the 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.250
 speed with the 476 maximum 36 pages 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.720
 per minute and for the 576 maximum 42 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.460
 pages per minute 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.540
 choosing your pro x printer is bad 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.100

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.810
 you choose whether your single function or one 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.159
 multifunctional in the world and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.350
 then you have the choice of two 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.689
 models the super fast variant that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.549
 prints up to 36 pages per minute or the 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.070

 the pro x printers is page wide and 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.310
 therefore the per head does not have to be 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.820
 move and so he can reach his high speed 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.380
