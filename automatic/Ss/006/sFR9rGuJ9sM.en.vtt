00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.730
 Herbert as before back from the Christmas break everyone except hall 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.359
 4a of the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg the first day of the fair is now raging around 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.419
 first the vacuum cleaner what was going on today on the day of the fair and which 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.910
 News here presented by Abba are the ones we show you in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.000
 this gentleman lot before special issue 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.590
 new stand and a lot of new products for the first time is Herpa in hall 4a of 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.770
 Toy Fair model train Hamlet and thus practically back to 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.000
 Arrived home 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.690
 Originally, Hertha had accessories much earlier 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.140
 produced for the model railway 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.170
 that shows the marketing department also at the side of the booth where small 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.410
 Landscapes sure to one or the other model railroaders that has to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.210
 heat 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.590
 further ahead thanks to the first highlights for him model collectors 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.020
 the product manager of Herpa Matthias Wolf Placid just barely the last 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.720
 template 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.880
 the battered yes certainly get our 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.980
 for the number of transporters 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.540
 after Warendorf role model 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.960
 a model with many features 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.329
 that means it's lowerable to open the headquarter 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.530
 Cargo securing is movable 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.800
 the pallet is to be taken out 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.940
 that means with the model if it is certainly very much fun and 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.650
 give many possibilities 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.650
 also to implement new components from Lara well 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.470
 percent 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.400
 Of course, we also have other highlights 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.060
 For the first time ever, Herpa 2 Abs Bauck has a loading crane 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.930
 with a new bunk at USA far forward place 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.240
 And also in the passenger car sector there is the Borgward Isabella or the Trabbi like 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.850
 Roof racks and thought themselves 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.939
 some nice news that we can show at the fair 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.650
 In 2009, of course, a few things will come in the truck sector 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.070
 Of course you can say that, of course, also Wandervogel 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.229
 Coming to the Neighbors Transporter 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.199
 Percent that we 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.039
 known as by crane in the fire department version with other similar 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.999
 Will bring modifications 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:21.249
 and so in the trailer train area now completely new bodies under certain circumstances 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.289
 give 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.289
 The system is expected to be quite a lot this year 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.609
 Also in the airplane area visitors are always interested 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:30.560
 stay standing 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.520
 even if the freshly emerged from the production pattern of the Green Leaf the 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.599
 in the rear area it would be still a piece where none at all 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.510
 but quite deliberately belongs to Zetsche von Köthen the product manager of Herpa 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.720
 Brinks because in the Arsenal, the inventor has not just a small one 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.369
 but a big edge at this point 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.640
 who is not an older brother of Heroes 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.169
 Again, we also gave great de 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.999
 Scale one to 500 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:58.379
 a very 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.219
 exceptionally designed airplane 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.159
 with a very unusual look 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.229
 very big highlight profiles Sammy have been waiting for is the Antonov 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.119
 Thoma 25 me 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:11.369
 Russian dream 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.369
 the currently largest aircraft percent of the world 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.219
 now and also in scale one to 500 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.389
 next to that we have scale 1 1 4 or too 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.809
 Some are here for the first time in Nuremberg at the fair 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.099
 to be published 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.159
 For example, for the first time, look for Poker 50 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.489
 from the valley Mascher warned 2 100 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.799
 or even 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.359
 Also Anton visually a very unusual flight for the Tupolev 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.289
 against dogs 54 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.529
 here at the fair presented colors of the Altena he sacrifices 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:45.429
 New are also true to style in the IT Kiel on the waterline 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:50.459
 like many new models in the field Magic the EPT it already from 5 Euro in the 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.339
 doppelpack 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.259
 because this disc is probably the one or the other today flat his nose 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.449
 This is probably one of the fair highlights ever on the press 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:58.639
 stood out from 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.009
 a phase scenes that always magnetics so they work 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.669
 Take a harsh car that has a magnet on it and then put it 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.349
 on the road and it drives as if by magic as it works exactly 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.379
 that show now he bounces on Doralt under 1 and so that not at all 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.010
 see is 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.090
 why hundreds were never planned 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.430
 and what if at least seven months 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.129
 Suspension railway principle 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.930
 we would not have to compete as new vehicles 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.139
 we have percent 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.569
 in Baden-württemberg BW on the vehicle 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.189
 the actual drive takes place through the railway embankment magnetic field in the roadway 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.960
 Listener presentations and specific arrangement on multiple levels tracks 

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.150
 created 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.559
 yes and the producers were corresponding migratory birds both vehicles 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.449
 that she falls the whole more vehicle 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.449
 just like here we will continue 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.500
 The individual states parts become the small model railway easy 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.640
 put together 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.510
 By the way, the cars and trucks for the roads can be bought directly from the 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.770
 Take a showcase 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.150
 still the road project is a first prototype maybe there is in 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150
 already in not too long time with her dealer 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.569
 as far as he has come and should have a special issue directly from the stand in her 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.580
 Nuremberg we suck is still over 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.970
 So to get all the information about the fair firstly in our magazine the 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.780
 Scale and Wings World and in the next Herper TV edition as always 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.850
 and as usual from owner miniature museum in Dietenhofen be together 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.849
 thanks for seeing Zeesen's hello 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:36.349
