00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.620 
just like non-stop like just oh how do
you<00:03:05.520> even<00:03:05.700> know<00:03:05.760> how<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> be<00:03:06.240> honest<00:03:06.420> with<00:03:06.540> you

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
you even know how to be honest with you

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.630 
you even know how to be honest with you
it's<00:03:06.750> hard<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.990> describe<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:08.070> type<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.370> feel

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
it's hard to describe this type of feel

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.850 
it's hard to describe this type of feel
but<00:03:08.990> definitely<00:03:09.990> something<00:03:10.350> different<00:03:10.500> I'm

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
but definitely something different I'm

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.830 
but definitely something different I'm
liking<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.640> approach<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.630> something

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
liking the the approach is something

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.290 
liking the the approach is something
darker<00:03:13.680> but<00:03:14.010> even<00:03:14.580> more<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:14.970> than<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
darker but even more so than the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.770 
darker but even more so than the
shinigami<00:03:15.750> I'm<00:03:16.050> lost<00:03:16.410> substitution<00:03:17.280> because

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
shinigami I'm lost substitution because

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.050 
shinigami I'm lost substitution because
that<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:19.080> dark<00:03:19.350> feel<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:20.850> like

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
that is dark feel but this is just like

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.770 
that is dark feel but this is just like
some<00:03:21.500> Nazi<00:03:22.500> chamber<00:03:23.100> type<00:03:23.340> creepy<00:03:24.270> so

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
some Nazi chamber type creepy so

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.240
