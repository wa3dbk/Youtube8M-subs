00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
whoa how to hatch triops but I've

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.439 
whoa how to hatch triops but I've
already<00:00:20.859> done<00:00:20.980> all<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.490> preparation<00:00:21.820> work<00:00:22.240> I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
already done all the preparation work I

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.300 
already done all the preparation work I
probably<00:00:22.660> should<00:00:22.900> have<00:00:22.929> filmed<00:00:23.199> it<00:00:23.470> but<00:00:23.769> no

cleaned the sand you can always check

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.529 
cleaned the sand you can always check
out<00:00:28.150> my<00:00:28.300> how<00:00:28.539> to<00:00:28.599> clean<00:00:29.019> sand<00:00:29.320> video<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:31.269> right

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.780 
out my how to clean sand video and right
now<00:00:31.689> I'm<00:00:31.900> just<00:00:32.110> letting<00:00:32.380> the<00:00:32.500> water<00:00:32.619> run<00:00:32.800> I've

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
now I'm just letting the water run I've

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.910 
now I'm just letting the water run I've
got<00:00:34.060> all<00:00:34.240> the<00:00:34.390> same<00:00:34.630> all<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.350> sand

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
got all the same all the sand

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.100 
got all the same all the sand
I<00:00:35.950> got<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.239> few<00:00:37.510> shells<00:00:37.809> this<00:00:38.770> rock<00:00:39.039> and<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
I got a few shells this rock and the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.970 
I got a few shells this rock and the
aquarium<00:00:41.469> heater<00:00:41.680> now<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:44.559> I<00:00:44.590> have<00:00:44.800> in<00:00:44.949> here

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
aquarium heater now what I have in here

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.939 
aquarium heater now what I have in here
that<00:00:45.129> won't<00:00:45.370> stay<00:00:45.730> is<00:00:46.629> that<00:00:46.930> large<00:00:47.230> thing<00:00:47.620> in

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
that won't stay is that large thing in

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.160 
that won't stay is that large thing in
the<00:00:48.070> back

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.740 

this<00:00:53.170> is<00:00:53.469> an<00:00:54.100> extremely<00:00:54.879> powerful<00:00:58.290> filter

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
this is an extremely powerful filter

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.150 
this is an extremely powerful filter
essentially<00:01:01.750> what<00:01:01.960> it's<00:01:02.110> doing<00:01:02.500> is<00:01:02.680> airing

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
essentially what it's doing is airing

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.130 
essentially what it's doing is airing
and<00:01:03.579> circulating<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.479> water<00:01:04.690> I<00:01:06.630> need<00:01:07.630> the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
and circulating the water I need the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.130 
and circulating the water I need the
water<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.800> be<00:01:08.979> extremely<00:01:09.970> high<00:01:10.390> in<00:01:10.570> oxygen

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
water to be extremely high in oxygen

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.800 
water to be extremely high in oxygen
because<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.920> needs<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.250> simulate<00:01:12.759> natural

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
because it needs to simulate natural

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.770 
because it needs to simulate natural
rainwater<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.740> in<00:01:15.729> order<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.000> do<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.360> I<00:01:16.420> have

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
rainwater so in order to do that I have

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.840 
rainwater so in order to do that I have
this<00:01:16.960> thing<00:01:17.170> making<00:01:17.619> bubbles<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.310> swirling

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
this thing making bubbles and swirling

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.520 
this thing making bubbles and swirling
the<00:01:18.940> water<00:01:19.119> around<00:01:19.300> and<00:01:19.750> mixing<00:01:20.020> up<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.259> sand

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
the water around and mixing up the sand

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.230 
the water around and mixing up the sand
and<00:01:20.830> uh<00:01:22.080> yeah<00:01:23.140> this<00:01:23.740> has<00:01:23.860> been<00:01:23.979> going<00:01:24.220> on<00:01:24.340> about

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
and uh yeah this has been going on about

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.200 
and uh yeah this has been going on about
an<00:01:25.390> hour<00:01:25.539> or<00:01:25.720> so<00:01:25.929> maybe<00:01:26.440> a<00:01:26.590> little<00:01:26.800> longer<00:01:27.210> but

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
an hour or so maybe a little longer but

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.540 
an hour or so maybe a little longer but
like<00:01:28.360> I<00:01:28.479> said<00:01:28.539> it<00:01:28.869> has<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.050> be<00:01:29.259> really<00:01:30.130> high<00:01:30.340> in

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
like I said it has to be really high in

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.150 
like I said it has to be really high in
oxygen<00:01:31.320> um<00:01:32.610> anyway<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.649> what<00:01:35.649> you<00:01:35.770> need<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:36.009> do

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
oxygen um anyway so what you need to do

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.700 
oxygen um anyway so what you need to do
is<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:40.450> have<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.630> get<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.080> water<00:01:41.350> full<00:01:41.590> of

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
is you have to get the water full of

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.919 
is you have to get the water full of
oxygen<00:01:42.009> uh<00:01:42.429> there<00:01:43.090> are<00:01:43.149> several<00:01:43.300> ways<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.630> do

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
oxygen uh there are several ways to do

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.649 
oxygen uh there are several ways to do
that<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:45.340> preferred<00:01:45.759> method<00:01:45.789> is<00:01:46.300> of<00:01:46.420> course

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
that my preferred method is of course

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.320 
that my preferred method is of course
the<00:01:46.899> power<00:01:47.110> head<00:01:47.380> back<00:01:47.590> here<00:01:47.860> but<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:49.179> can

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
the power head back here but you can

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.540 
the power head back here but you can
also<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.740> pour<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:52.300> water<00:01:52.509> into<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.409> and

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
also just pour the water into it and

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.819 
also just pour the water into it and
that'll<00:01:54.550> work<00:01:54.670> pretty<00:01:55.000> good<00:01:55.300> because<00:01:56.020> if<00:01:56.649> you

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
that'll work pretty good because if you

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.069 
that'll work pretty good because if you
pour<00:01:57.189> it<00:01:57.250> high<00:01:57.399> enough<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.970> collects<00:01:58.810> enough

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
pour it high enough it collects enough

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.280 
pour it high enough it collects enough
oxygen<00:01:59.560> as<00:01:59.680> it's<00:01:59.920> going<00:02:00.159> through<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.430> air<00:02:01.290> but

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
oxygen as it's going through the air but

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.530 
oxygen as it's going through the air but
you<00:02:02.500> can<00:02:02.680> another<00:02:03.159> thing<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.640> can<00:02:03.790> do<00:02:03.939> is<00:02:04.180> stir

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
you can another thing you can do is stir

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.719 
you can another thing you can do is stir
the<00:02:04.750> water<00:02:04.960> very<00:02:05.290> very<00:02:05.759> vigorously<00:02:07.259> um<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.950> do

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
the water very very vigorously um I do

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.170 
the water very very vigorously um I do
not<00:02:10.090> have<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.690> eggs<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:12.250> tank<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:12.670> had<00:02:12.940> I

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
not have the eggs in the tank I had I

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.479 
not have the eggs in the tank I had I
begin<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.110> hatching<00:02:14.440> process<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.220> small

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
begin the hatching process in a small

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.729 
begin the hatching process in a small
bottle<00:02:15.700> which<00:02:16.000> I'll<00:02:16.150> show<00:02:16.329> you<00:02:16.390> again<00:02:16.989> in<00:02:17.590> a

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
few moments okay now this is the bottle

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.030 
few moments okay now this is the bottle
of<00:02:23.230> water<00:02:23.440> or<00:02:23.799> the<00:02:24.489> bottle<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:25.000> use<00:02:25.930> it's<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:26.829> long

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
of water or the bottle I use it's a long

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.509 
of water or the bottle I use it's a long
tall<00:02:27.820> bottle<00:02:28.239> yes<00:02:29.019> it<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.620> smart<00:02:29.950> water<00:02:30.130> deal
