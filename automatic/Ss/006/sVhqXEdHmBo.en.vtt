00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.370
 we are with the norm 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.530
 the friendship the companionship as you know 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.269
 that when one receives criticism at home 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.109
 Sometimes you have guests who do not know each other 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 each 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.170
 you can pass without apple green tablecloth and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.689
 a decoration of flowers so color and goes 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.050
 friendship is fostered people are 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 communicates in the best way that's why it's 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.380
 very appropriate also for 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.200
 rooms for the boys for 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.899
 places that many friends come 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.030
 today is a very very uplifting color and very 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.030
 very very cheerful 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.820
 listen good let's start with the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.400
 shirt collar how a neck is sewn 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.440
 industrial fashion shirt first 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.740
 interplay of hitting we shot the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.780
 interlacing paste we use even this 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.810
 is a ruse and the same caprice that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.480
 get in the houses where they sell 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.030
 fabrics for brides make for costumes 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.510
 This is the ideal wedding 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.290
 that is well greased well gummed and 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.270
 smooth textured texture plan is 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.410
 then what is the most difficult seam 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.540
 to do in the neck period of 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.270
 shirt is the last one where we finished 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.490
 of the shirt collar then in the habit 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.740
 industrial what we do that is more 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.040
 difficult for the end we do it at 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.530
 then then look, we take a 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.350
 coat of the neck of the foot of the neck with 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.479
 we cook the interlace we join by 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.630
 below that is where the sea is going to be 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.729
 this final point we turn towards the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.619
 Right here I do not have a mark with the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.020
 iron fix hiding a little 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.360
 the interlining marcadito with the iron or 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.200
 well what can they do 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.030
 in the double stitching a wide stitching 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.910
 what is going to look like a 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.430
 double stitching interest 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.870
 at the end then then once 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.480
 we have prepared is this first 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.819
 capital 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.060
 let's sew what is the neck 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.549
 properly said and here I also do 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.769
 the machine is not working they go up 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.379
 the pre part a little oil then 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.450
 look, we sew, we come sewing, so 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.580
 the needle is usually made 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.700
 here and then start sewing on the other 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.760
 side I'm going to teach something like Cosan 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.370
 and go out with the machine and then give the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.220
 turn back and resume with the machine 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.220
 that way the neck will always 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.720
 better the tip and another little secret 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.790
 when they reach the tip of the stitch 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.819
 well chiquitita because then when 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.310
 me back that neck look here me 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.829
 I already have it ready, notice that when 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.319
 me back this neck if I have a lot 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.090
 stitch to stitch chiquitita here I can 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.310
 get it out well with the tip of the scissors and 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.220
 it's not going to break or it's not going to come out 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.720
 fringe let's say the tip is cut 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.209
 thus short notice so the two ends 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.180
 and if the tip is very pronounced I have 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.870
 which in turn refine the most 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.500
 vienna finalist and when I turn this 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.480
 neck has a right and a reverse the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.760
 right of which comes accompanied with the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.060
 interlining is to say I'm going to turn 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.790
 here, notice that in this case the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.549
 right is the one that comes with 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.290
 the interlining and if I took very well and 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.599
 it would be on the tip is not true with 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.269
 stitch well girl could push 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.700
 really with the scissors and get the right 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.260
 puntita in helped by a needle 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.700
 then once I have finished 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.189
 this look I already have the neck so 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.319
 I have dotted the right of the 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:02.230
 neck is the one that comes with the 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:06.180
 This is the right of the people 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.919
 then I will take what we had here 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.340
 where it comes with the interplay 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.400
 I'm going to locate the foot of the neck with the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.310
 entertainment 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.669
 and on the other side I'm going to locate the one 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.860
 comes loose is look a little thing 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.870

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:37.240
 I have to respect it then 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.689
 I'm going to come sewing and put together all the 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:45.080

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:49.099
 I have armed this I have this one of the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.929
 interlining that matches the one that has 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.579
 the interlining on the neck itself 

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:55.399
 saying 

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:57.439
 Look advise the tail is where 

00:04:55.399 --> 00:05:00.529
 I will be able to know the neck in the 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:05.209
 Garnish later once this finishes 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:08.349
 in these tops sac travel sack 

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:08.349
 also in this toe 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.400
 pulls out 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.420
 of water 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.370
 and then I have it ready in this 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.660
 moment notice that until the little game 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:31.480

 the last class still without manga 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.940
 to get this out we see it directly 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.590
 on the brown paper that is going to see 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.720
 best 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.300
 then I have my neck ready and 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.730
 the neck this is the part that is going to go 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.290
 for the front of the neck 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.220
 so I have to start 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.310
 get this little tail here 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.310
 I begin to know this tail here I 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.960
 I have been sewing and that is where I will 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.010
 said that the neck has to be a 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.350
 a little bit bigger than the 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.850
 Qwest in which the neckline then I do 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.040

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.460
 and it arrived once I have this is very 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.370
 simple directly a goal towards 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.560
 I turn over and look, I do not even have it 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.170
 cooked but look for the ending in 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.720
 so much has been avenged being another 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.240
 secretito the last stitching the upturn 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.190
 final I can start the middle and I give 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.550
 all the way back and I come back here to not 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.950
 have joints at the tips and you have left 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.840
 perspective on straights and it costs me and 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.730
