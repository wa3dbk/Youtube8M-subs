it<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.400> deep<00:01:20.549> down<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.820> mean<00:01:21.060> even

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it I think I think deep down I mean even

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.300 
it I think I think deep down I mean even
if<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.650> hate<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> Adam<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.220> Eve

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
thing but even if back then he was like

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.609

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
good god cover them up so you think it's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
good god cover them up so you think it's
fundamentally<00:01:32.400> then<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.970> aesthetically

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

fundamentally then that aesthetically
the<00:01:34.320> testicles<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.670> penis<00:01:36.090> isn't<00:01:36.390> as

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the testicles and the penis isn't as

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.289 
the testicles and the penis isn't as
good<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.439> could<00:01:37.680> be

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
good as it could be

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.109 
good as it could be
what<00:01:39.299> would<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> out<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:39.900> instead<00:01:41.119> well

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
what would you out there instead well

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.730 
what would you out there instead well
he's<00:01:42.479> designed<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.140> way<00:01:43.290> because<00:01:43.470> that's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
he's designed that way because that's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.020 
he's designed that way because that's
the<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.220> got<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.490> designed<00:01:44.820> it's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the way it's got to be designed it's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.139 
the way it's got to be designed it's
more<00:01:45.210> about<00:01:45.390> function<00:01:45.990> than<00:01:46.409> yeah<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
more about function than yeah and and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
more about function than yeah and and
that's<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> thing<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.470> with

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that's that's the thing in it with with

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
that's that's the thing in it with with
modern<00:01:50.220> technology<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> thing<00:01:51.960> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
modern technology you know the thing is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.420 
modern technology you know the thing is
the<00:01:52.079> testicles<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.920> outside<00:01:53.250> because

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the testicles have to be outside because

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.670 
the testicles have to be outside because
they<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> few<00:01:54.149> degrees<00:01:54.270> below<00:01:54.720> body

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
they have to be a few degrees below body

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.219 
they have to be a few degrees below body
temperature<00:01:56.270> yeah<00:01:57.299> otherwise<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.869> sertoli

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
temperature yeah otherwise the sertoli
