in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.150> wild<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:01.260> hope<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.800> captivity<00:02:02.190> it

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
in the wild we hope that in captivity it

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.840 
in the wild we hope that in captivity it
moves<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:04.130> quicker<00:02:05.130> than<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.520> since

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
moves a little quicker than that since

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.719 
moves a little quicker than that since
we're<00:02:06.060> raising<00:02:06.360> these<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:07.020> hatchlings<00:02:07.729> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
we're raising these up from hatchlings I
