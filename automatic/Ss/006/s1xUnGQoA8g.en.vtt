00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.260

 it is also indicated that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.100
 on the president collect from 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.290
 him wise advice considering 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.640
 his experience in the field of 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.670
 management of the state thing this is it has 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.480
 been very fraternal discussions but 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.600
 also these discussions focused on 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.480
 the march of the Central African state on the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.930
 security situation of uniterre 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.820
 stimulus strategies a game of 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.590
 the administration and the economy of this 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.780
 country is the sub-region of Africa 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.990
 entire central unit that is mobilized 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.110
 for the Central African court in front of 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.660
 the scene the cemac the community that 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.810
 has just granted 100 million 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.050
 from CFA francs to the trying all that 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.360
 is conducted search for peace there is 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.750
 no military issue to the conflict 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.250
 no one can win on taking the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.460
 not on each other by the weapons 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.100
 those who have always advocated this 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.970
 track his party the same way 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.890
 so it's clear that it's not there 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.659
 but that's not the solution and it's 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.850
 that we wish all our brothers 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.570
 since we are gathering around 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.880
 tables and then actually put the art 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.770
 the foundations of one of a peace that is 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.440
 strong and durable on the back 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.370
 Central African ali bongo ondimba knows of 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.470
 what he is talking about 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.440
 it is to him that the summit of the chiefs 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.900
 of state to throw enough kinshasa had 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.500
 entrusted the follow-up of the Central African dossier 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.570
 So it was the confirmation and the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.940
 recognition of the driving role played by 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.910
 years by Gabon with fire omar 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.110
 bongo ondimba since that's enough 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.050
 entrusted this mandate 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.170
 the Gabon multiplies initiatives and 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.180
 proximity actions our country is 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.300
 always present alongside the people 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.110
 Central African President Ali Bongo 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.080
 mans took over and for this purpose he 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.270
 also played an important role in 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.010
 level of the Central African Republic 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:41.580
 when you know it and when the diet 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.459
 who was in power more Central African 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.530
 collapsed with the departure of the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.360
 bozizÃ© president and several efforts 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.510
 have been deployed at this level I think 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.940
 already at this meeting which is the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.329
 first had the honor of sheltering here at 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.010
 libreville during this meeting 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.950
 the political actors of the republic 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.170
 Central African Republic were avoided in 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.660
 the test he is the president ali bongo 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.959
 waved a game of all its weight so that 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:23.370
 resolutions come out of this meeting 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.459
 and unfortunately afterwards it's a 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.010
 aspect discussed during these meetings 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.140
 could not be respected by one 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.560
 and others of the situation that has 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.010
 degenerate to the Central African rain but 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.980
 Gabon was not discouraged well at 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.380
 contrary the president always in his 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.860
 efforts to seek peace art + 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.600
 Central African Republic actively participated in 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.239
 to have the Gabonese troops in 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.560
 Central African Republic and echoes 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.440
 that come to us from the republic 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.870
 Central African Republic tell us what 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.050
 Japanese troops is not manifesting itself 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.600
 loyalty their professionalism and 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.950
 their sense of duty 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.340
 always in relation to its effects these 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.260
 efforts that are made by the first and 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.970
 we also had information 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.950
 according to which the first lady 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.810
 Gabonese also visited 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.720
 Central African Republic for 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.470
 already encourage the morale of 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.150
 soldiers of subscribers those who were 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.620
 deployed at Central African level 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.570
 remember she came in 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.150
 Central African Republic a difficult moment because 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.700
 that this is when the Caribbean 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.500
 baraka had just invaded the city of 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.520
 bangui but she took her courage to 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.520
 both hands and went to bangui for 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.040
 boost the morale of the soldiers and come in 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.180

 acting president of the republic 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.760
 Central African Republic to recognize grac 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.650
 role of Gabon in the search for 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.210
 solutions to his country 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.390
 the head of state reassures him that the 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:07.250
 Gabon will continue to play his score 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.250
 until found peace and beyond
