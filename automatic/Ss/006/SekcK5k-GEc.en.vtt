Be sure you keep the Sabbath day

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000

It does no good to bear a grudge

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Your duty to be a fair judge

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
chosen for another man

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Or you must offer up a ram

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Forbidden is a new tree's fruit

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Don't go after your neighbor's loot 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Your mother and father you shall revere

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Help another if you are able

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
No meat with blood at your table

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
God's sanctuary you shall venerate

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
With ghosts do not communicate

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In ways of magic do not prophesize

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Before your elders you must rise

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
On your skin, no tattoos

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And love the body Hashem gave you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Some may say above all else

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Love your neighbor as yourself
