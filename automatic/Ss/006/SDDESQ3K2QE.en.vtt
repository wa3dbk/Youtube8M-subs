 special one-year channel and 10,000 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.550
 enrolled then exactly one year ago 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.350
 on March 1st and was opening this 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.539
 new channel and throughout this year 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 I published approximately 70 videos 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.469
 about hardware clock 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.510
 In this video today I'll show you 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.460
 You a little about these videos I'm going 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 comment on the changes that have taken place 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320
 on the channel also shows some videos that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.690
 were wiped aside the old channel 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.570
 I had a channel before 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.510
 2011 where he published some boxes in 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.650
 some videos about hardware overclocking 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.210
 so I'm going to show you a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.110
 bit about those videos that are not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.810
 more in the air 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.030
 and we will comment on several others 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.280
 things that involve the working 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.670
 hardy the radio site and the fan page 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.530
 Beauty, come on then, just look. 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.509
 It's up to you guys and you're 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.530
 first video on the side of my old 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.210
 channel I recorded that 20 2012 was the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.479
 first boxing I had none 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.909
 experience with boxing record what my 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.430
 cell phone is holding a mother 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.299
 boxing with the other but I had 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.610
 that intention to pass 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.500
 little knowledge and show 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.360
 you the product will be something like that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.619
 really interested the rock 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.689
 fatal 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.610
 I even sent her a video that made a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.350
 certain success that was the 10 commandments 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.719
 of the resolver clock 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.550
 I'm sure many people who 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.179
 follow my channel already had 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.450
 watched this video 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.640
 Lucas, I will be 23 and this night. 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.769
 I'll make use of this video is 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.109
 in the air until today in the old channel if you 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.099
 search in youtube 10 commandments of the 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.769
 River do with what you will find 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.349
 this video there in the middle Lucas that operates I 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.780
 I'm 23 years old and I'm one more 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.769
 passionate about technology hardware 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.719
 with games 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.689
 Good people, I started this new channel. 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:37.540
 empire radio on March 1, 2014 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.579
 exactly one year ago my channel 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.859
 I had a problem with a monitor 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.290
 I entered so I have to leave. 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.780
 it neither the videos show all deleted 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.120
 except there the king of the clock and I 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.790
 still did not have equipment did everything 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.129
 so with a video recorder I recorded a lot 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.079
 thing with my cell phone still audio 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.139
 it was bad the image was bad like you 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.139
 you can see there in that channel people 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.959
 started to do more extensive testing 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.209
 more detailed and well-edited 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.639
 vegas is like the pci test case 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.829
 express that I put three screens in the 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.530
 same image is May 3 on the same screen 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.019
 moreover, besides that I started to do 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.120
 studies that hardly people 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.729
 I found on youtube how the study 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.659
 about vrm phase feed you have here 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:28.269
 in the channel being value refers to the phases 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:32.079
 intended for the attention of the 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.720
 memory and vt ipc interface 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.269
 express and embedded processor 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.970
 in some cases we can still have a 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:44.109
 fourth attention to the controller. 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.169
 integrated video I did studies about 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.569
 active power reactive power factor of 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.479
 power factor correction factor 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.000
 several things that involve a source of 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.919
 All these videos are 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.949
 Here you see the channel section 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.169
 It left because lucas because it is so 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:05.409
 source because there are only three 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:09.370
 votes for reactive power because the 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:13.419
 power of my source is 0.97 high 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.340
 it gets up to 0.99 and because you lucas 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:19.029
 power factor of your high power source 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.430
 because my source is active pfc and this is 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:23.320
 extremely important 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.350
 it was passing the time people 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.340
 I was monetizing the viruses of this channel I 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.710
 I started to buy the first 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.580
 equipment that was the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.030
 best camera recorder lighting 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.070
 chroma key lapel microphone and this 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.860
 everyone produced videos with more 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.710
 if you see the last boxing 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.350
 for example the gtx 980 I did and 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.020
 look at the first boxing I did to 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.780
 quality is absurdly different 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.180
 it does not even have a comparison then channel it 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.070
 It is growing it is improving am 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.380
 trying to improve the channel every time 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.530
 But for you, I have the goal of 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.630
 50 thousand to 100 thousand enrolled there and 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.760
 As the channel grew and I go 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.190
 have more conditions to invest in the 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.470
 best hardware equipment for 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.720
 do bench tests etc 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.550
 This has always been my goal for this. 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.010
 people who are important to you 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.070
 share the channel by sharing the 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.620
 video enjoying your favorite year is sending 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.840
 friends is because this helps the channel 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.090
 Growing this channel grows 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.040
 I can be more able to bring 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.590
 better equipment for you to do 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.170
 videos with much more quality to bring 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.760
 new things new products reviews 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.580
 reviews and etc 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.010
 Okay, so this is it, folks, I hope you 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.990
