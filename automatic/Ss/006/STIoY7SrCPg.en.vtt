necessarily the best way to train a team
it's<00:01:11.100> my<00:01:11.310> way<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.990> selecting<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.799> team<00:01:14.360> because

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it's my way and selecting a team because

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.230 
it's my way and selecting a team because
I<00:01:15.659> train<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> team<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> class<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> class

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
I train a team in a class I have a class

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.039 
I train a team in a class I have a class
called<00:01:18.509> egg<00:01:18.750> sales<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.290> marketing<00:01:19.759> and<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.090> my

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
called egg sales and marketing and so my

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.560 
called egg sales and marketing and so my
egg<00:01:22.290> sales<00:01:22.650> team<00:01:22.950> from<00:01:23.189> my<00:01:23.369> chapter<00:01:23.850> comes<00:01:24.330> out

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
egg sales team from my chapter comes out

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170 
egg sales team from my chapter comes out
of<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.689> class<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> different<00:01:27.060> team

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
of that class so it's a different team

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.020 
of that class so it's a different team
every<00:01:27.479> year<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.220> usually<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.729> enough

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

people that you can select from you

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.660 
people that you can select from you
