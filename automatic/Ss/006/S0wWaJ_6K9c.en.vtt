a strategic planning exercise and there

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.230 
a strategic planning exercise and there
is<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> lot<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.560> support<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.430> when<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.910> talk

is a lot of support for it when I talk

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.359 
is a lot of support for it when I talk
about<00:00:18.270> strategic<00:00:18.660> planning<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.380> think<00:00:20.070> about

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
about strategic planning I think about

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.450 
about strategic planning I think about
an<00:00:20.670> integrated<00:00:21.539> strategic<00:00:22.020> plan<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
an integrated strategic plan for a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.019 
an integrated strategic plan for a
single<00:00:24.029> entity<00:00:24.420> called<00:00:24.689> UC<00:00:25.650> San<00:00:25.890> Diego<00:00:26.460> which

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
single entity called UC San Diego which

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.210 
single entity called UC San Diego which
has<00:00:27.210> many<00:00:27.390> pillars<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.869> excellence<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.650> we

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
has many pillars of excellence and we

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.220 
has many pillars of excellence and we
want<00:00:29.429> all<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.670> them<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.300> viewed<00:00:30.779> under<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
want all of them to be viewed under the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.799 
want all of them to be viewed under the
single<00:00:31.590> umbrella<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.279> UC<00:00:32.759> San<00:00:32.940> Diego<00:00:33.390> one<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
single umbrella of UC San Diego one of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.650 
single umbrella of UC San Diego one of
the<00:00:33.930> important<00:00:34.430> outcomes<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:36.210> strategic

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
the important outcomes of a strategic

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.130 
the important outcomes of a strategic
plan<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.610> not<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.910> plan<00:00:39.120> itself<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
plan is not the plan itself but the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
plan is not the plan itself but the
process<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.280> leads<00:00:41.460> us<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> plan<00:00:42.149> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
process that leads us to the plan I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.200 
process that leads us to the plan I
think<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.899> need<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> recognize<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.610> are<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
think we need to recognize that we are a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.410 
think we need to recognize that we are a
very<00:00:46.170> high<00:00:46.500> activity<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.399> very<00:00:47.760> high<00:00:48.000> impact

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420

time we are also an educational
institution<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.710> should<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.190> assume<00:00:57.090> or

merit in going back to our roots which

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.740 
merit in going back to our roots which
is<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.860> were<00:01:11.010> established<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.880> an

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
is we were established as an

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.410 
is we were established as an
experimental<00:01:13.350> institution<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:15.119> about

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
experimental institution to think about

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
experimental institution to think about
the<00:01:15.600> future<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.990> education<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.710> research<00:01:17.009> so

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the future of education and research so

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.240 
the future of education and research so
we<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:17.880> still<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> phase<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:19.159> talking<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
we are still in the phase of talking to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850 
we are still in the phase of talking to
various<00:01:20.400> people<00:01:20.759> are<00:01:21.740> executive<00:01:22.740> vice

various people are executive vice
chancellor<00:01:23.189> Suresh<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.270> been

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
various constituencies going forward I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.780 
various constituencies going forward I
think<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:30.240> will<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.259> better<00:01:31.979> definition<00:01:32.310> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
think we will see a better definition of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.660 
think we will see a better definition of
this<00:01:32.880> process<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.040> context<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
this process and in the context of the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.090 
this process and in the context of the
process<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.290> talk<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> each<00:01:37.710> other<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
process we all talk to each other and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.340 
process we all talk to each other and
develop<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.549> shared<00:01:38.579> vision<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.200> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
develop a shared vision and I think that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.340 
develop a shared vision and I think that
is<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.890> significant<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
is really significant because as we the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.730 
is really significant because as we the
faculty<00:01:43.950> or<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.939> staff<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.750> independent

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
faculty or the staff as independent

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.920 
faculty or the staff as independent
entrepreneurs<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.640> about<00:01:47.939> how<00:01:48.689> we're

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
entrepreneurs think about how we're

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.539 
entrepreneurs think about how we're
going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> contribute<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.860> university

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
going to contribute to this university

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.850 
going to contribute to this university
to<00:01:50.670> make<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> better<00:01:51.210> place<00:01:51.710> having<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to make this a better place having a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.880 
to make this a better place having a
shared<00:01:53.250> understanding<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:54.240> goals<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.530> vision

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
shared understanding of goals and vision

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.789 
shared understanding of goals and vision
and<00:01:56.009> mission<00:01:56.600> makes<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.750> difference<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.350> how<00:01:58.409> we

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and mission makes a difference in how we

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.920 
and mission makes a difference in how we
operate<00:01:59.399> how<00:01:59.640> we<00:01:59.700> behave<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.420> what

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
operate how we behave and what

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.080 
operate how we behave and what
initiatives<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.560> take<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> think<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.909> time

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
initiatives we take so I think the time
