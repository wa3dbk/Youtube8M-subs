special 20 cover plate from the draw

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.340 
special 20 cover plate from the draw
sign<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.420> thought<00:01:32.630> it'd<00:01:32.750> be<00:01:32.780> kind<00:01:33.050> of<00:01:33.110> fun

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
sign so I thought it'd be kind of fun

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.000 
sign so I thought it'd be kind of fun
that<00:01:33.560> I'll<00:01:33.680> do<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:35.080> top<00:01:36.080> cover<00:01:36.350> plate<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:36.950> that

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
that I'll do the top cover plate so that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.260 
that I'll do the top cover plate so that
would<00:01:37.190> be<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.430> blow<00:01:37.610> cover<00:01:37.940> plate<00:01:38.240> and

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
would be the blow cover plate and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.310 
would be the blow cover plate and
compare<00:01:38.870> it<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.290> draw<00:01:39.550> so<00:01:40.960> this<00:01:41.960> gave<00:01:42.170> me

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
compare it to the draw so this gave me

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.700 
compare it to the draw so this gave me
time<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.890> let<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.750> pace<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.170> semi<00:01:45.410> chrome

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
time to let the pace the semi chrome

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.520 
time to let the pace the semi chrome
paste<00:01:48.430> dry<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.460> little<00:01:49.880> bit<00:01:50.260> yeah

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
paste dry a little bit yeah

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.460 
paste dry a little bit yeah
that's<00:01:51.710> enough<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.390> now<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.830> take<00:01:55.070> your

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
that's enough and so now you take your

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.440 
that's enough and so now you take your
cloth<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:58.000> just<00:01:59.000> begin<00:02:00.070> polishing<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.310> and

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.219 

you<00:02:05.450> can<00:02:05.660> see<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:07.670> residue<00:02:08.360> that's<00:02:08.660> building

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
you can see the residue that's building

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.840 
you can see the residue that's building
up<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.950> oxidation<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.890> metal<00:02:13.280> essentially

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
up the oxidation the metal essentially

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.229 
up the oxidation the metal essentially
what<00:02:14.000> you're<00:02:14.150> doing<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:15.830> fine<00:02:16.340> abrasive

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
what you're doing is it's fine abrasive

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:26.800 
what you're doing is it's fine abrasive

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
so you're taking this top layer off okay

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.130 
so you're taking this top layer off okay
I'm<00:02:27.110> just<00:02:27.290> going<00:02:27.470> in<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.739> circular<00:02:28.010> motion<00:02:29.140> back

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
I'm just going in a circular motion back

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.420 
I'm just going in a circular motion back
and<00:02:30.170> forth

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
and forth

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.610 
and forth
you<00:02:32.150> can't<00:02:32.390> think<00:02:32.630> in<00:02:32.690> terms<00:02:32.989> if<00:02:33.230> you're<00:02:33.380> doing

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
you can't think in terms if you're doing

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:42.100
