00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
a story I felt like getting braces and

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
a story I felt like getting braces and
middle<00:03:53.110> school<00:03:53.530> it's<00:03:54.280> really<00:03:54.790> good<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:56.130> drama

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
middle school it's really good and drama

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.680 
middle school it's really good and drama
is<00:03:57.430> just<00:03:58.860> fiction

is just fiction

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.750 
is just fiction
that's<00:04:01.690> all<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.200> guess<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:02.800> could<00:04:03.070> be<00:04:03.100> realistic

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
that's all I guess it could be realistic

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.270 
that's all I guess it could be realistic
fiction<00:04:03.910> but<00:04:04.890> that's<00:04:05.890> all<00:04:06.070> it's<00:04:06.459> good<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:07.000> so

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
fiction but that's all it's good to so

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.640
