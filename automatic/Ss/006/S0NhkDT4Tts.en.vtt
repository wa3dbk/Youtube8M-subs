what you can do with them some give you
a<00:00:29.810> few<00:00:30.020> examples<00:00:30.050> here<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.189> I'm<00:00:31.279> going<00:00:31.369> to<00:00:31.430> go

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
a few examples here and I'm going to go

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.729 
a few examples here and I'm going to go
into<00:00:31.730> a<00:00:31.880> sample<00:00:32.510> world<00:00:32.689> build<00:00:33.290> you<00:00:33.470> a<00:00:33.500> bud

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
into a sample world build you a bud

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.920 
into a sample world build you a bud
switch<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.340> let<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:35.120> see<00:00:35.300> how<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.540> works<00:00:35.750> in

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
switch and let you see how it works in

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.479 
switch and let you see how it works in
the<00:00:36.019> different<00:00:36.260> ways<00:00:36.379> you<00:00:36.410> can<00:00:36.559> trigger<00:00:36.860> it<00:00:37.010> so

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
the different ways you can trigger it so

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.820 
the different ways you can trigger it so
here<00:00:38.120> we<00:00:38.150> go<00:00:39.250> let's<00:00:40.250> go<00:00:40.550> through<00:00:40.910> here<00:00:41.239> and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
here we go let's go through here and

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.789 
here we go let's go through here and
first<00:00:43.180> this<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.839> first<00:00:45.199> area<00:00:45.620> where<00:00:45.769> I

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:45.799 
first this is the first area where I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.280 
first this is the first area where I
utilize<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.400> bud<00:00:46.549> switch<00:00:46.780> what's<00:00:47.780> down<00:00:47.960> here

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
utilize the bud switch what's down here

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.810 
utilize the bud switch what's down here
so<00:00:49.010> we're<00:00:49.129> going<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.309> break<00:00:49.460> through<00:00:49.699> this

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
so we're going to break through this

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.549 
so we're going to break through this
wall<00:00:49.879> back<00:00:50.089> here<00:00:52.030> right<00:00:53.030> here<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.600> we'll<00:00:54.379> come

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
wall back here right here and we'll come

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.039 
wall back here right here and we'll come
up<00:00:54.589> this<00:00:54.860> way<00:00:55.070> down<00:00:55.850> up<00:00:56.350> here<00:00:58.600> over<00:00:59.600> here<00:00:59.809> and

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
up this way down up here over here and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.079 
up this way down up here over here and
we're<00:01:00.260> done<00:01:00.379> okay<00:01:00.830> so<00:01:00.890> right<00:01:01.159> here<00:01:01.369> is<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.670> bud

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
we're done okay so right here is the bud

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.539 
we're done okay so right here is the bud
switch<00:01:02.239> this<00:01:02.900> right<00:01:03.140> here<00:01:03.409> is<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.070> bud<00:01:04.430> switch

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
switch this right here is the bud switch

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.240 
switch this right here is the bud switch
we're<00:01:04.879> standing<00:01:05.210> on<00:01:05.299> as<00:01:05.510> you<00:01:06.110> can<00:01:06.200> see<00:01:06.500> the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
we're standing on as you can see the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.330 
we're standing on as you can see the
piston<00:01:07.880> is<00:01:08.170> here<00:01:09.170> with<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.500> torch<00:01:09.830> there<00:01:10.130> and

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
piston is here with the torch there and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.030 
piston is here with the torch there and
you<00:01:10.490> also<00:01:10.640> have<00:01:10.790> to<00:01:10.970> have<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.680> repeater<00:01:12.680> over

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
you also have to have a repeater over

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.679 
you also have to have a repeater over
here<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.820> what's<00:01:14.000> going<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.210> happen<00:01:14.450> is<00:01:14.570> I

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
here and what's going to happen is I

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.420 
here and what's going to happen is I
have<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.049> to<00:01:15.170> where<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.470> signal<00:01:15.830> is<00:01:15.950> going<00:01:16.280> to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
have it to where the signal is going to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.190 
have it to where the signal is going to
go<00:01:16.580> into<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:17.060> command<00:01:17.450> block<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:17.840> then<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.080> goes

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
go into a command block and then it goes

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.350 
go into a command block and then it goes
over<00:01:18.440> here<00:01:18.800> into<00:01:19.370> an<00:01:19.460> RS<00:01:19.700> nor<00:01:19.910> latch<00:01:19.970> which

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
over here into an RS nor latch which

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.570 
over here into an RS nor latch which
holds<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.840> signal<00:01:21.260> which<00:01:21.710> causes<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:22.280> torch

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
holds the signal which causes that torch

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.630 
holds the signal which causes that torch
to<00:01:22.790> go<00:01:22.910> off<00:01:23.090> on<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.480> and<00:01:23.510> gate<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.620> this<00:01:25.340> is<00:01:25.490> why

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
to go off on the and gate so this is why

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.490 
to go off on the and gate so this is why
I'm<00:01:25.940> showing<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.330> guys<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.110> different

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
I'm showing you guys this the different

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.110 
I'm showing you guys this the different
what<00:01:27.680> about<00:01:28.010> switch<00:01:28.250> can<00:01:28.460> do<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:28.820> as<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.000> can

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
what about switch can do so as you can

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.410 
what about switch can do so as you can
see<00:01:29.360> here<00:01:29.480> I<00:01:29.510> have<00:01:29.690> this<00:01:30.050> one<00:01:30.320> set<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:31.430> when<00:01:32.030> the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
see here I have this one set to when the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.740 
see here I have this one set to when the
repeaters<00:01:32.990> light<00:01:33.470> up<00:01:33.680> or<00:01:33.890> turn<00:01:34.730> off<00:01:34.790> this

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
repeaters light up or turn off this

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.550 
repeaters light up or turn off this
piston<00:01:36.710> will<00:01:37.010> move<00:01:37.040> out<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.750> cause<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:39.020> charge

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
piston will move out and cause a charge

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.680 
piston will move out and cause a charge
rate<00:01:39.890> here<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.310> power<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:40.909> redstone<00:01:41.360> wire

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
rate here and power this redstone wire

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.540 
rate here and power this redstone wire
which<00:01:42.050> shuts<00:01:42.620> that<00:01:42.860> part<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.370> gate

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
which shuts that part of the and gate

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.370 
which shuts that part of the and gate
off<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.450> like<00:01:44.600> for<00:01:44.750> instance<00:01:44.870> let's<00:01:45.260> just

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
off so like for instance let's just

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.110 
off so like for instance let's just
break<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:45.800> repeater<00:01:46.159> right<00:01:46.400> here<00:01:46.580> as<00:01:46.730> you

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
break this repeater right here as you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.890 
break this repeater right here as you
can<00:01:47.180> see<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.480> moved<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:49.130> came<00:01:49.430> on<00:01:49.610> and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
can see it moved and that came on and

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.050 
can see it moved and that came on and
that<00:01:50.900> went<00:01:51.170> off<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:51.890> that's<00:01:52.490> how<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:52.820> works

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
that went off so that's how this works

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.610 
that went off so that's how this works
this<00:01:53.300> is<00:01:53.450> how<00:01:53.600> i'm<00:01:53.690> using<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:54.020> bud<00:01:54.200> switch<00:01:54.320> here

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
this is how i'm using a bud switch here

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.110 
this is how i'm using a bud switch here
this<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:54.890> one<00:01:55.070> example<00:01:55.190> so<00:01:55.790> we're<00:01:55.880> gonna<00:01:55.970> come

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
this is one example so we're gonna come

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.910 
this is one example so we're gonna come
up<00:01:56.240> out<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.690> here<00:01:57.040> through<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.159> floor<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.780> yep

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
up out of here through the floor and yep

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.200 
up out of here through the floor and yep
now<00:02:00.920> i'll<00:02:01.010> show<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.220> another<00:02:01.490> example<00:02:01.670> of<00:02:02.030> how

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
now i'll show you another example of how

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.770 
now i'll show you another example of how
it<00:02:02.330> works<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.220> main<00:02:04.520> area<00:02:05.150> in<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.570> center

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
it works so the main area in the center

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.279 
it works so the main area in the center
of<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.080> toy<00:02:06.350> factory<00:02:06.580> at<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.209> bottom<00:02:08.720> where

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
of the toy factory at the bottom where

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.869 
of the toy factory at the bottom where
you<00:02:09.590> have<00:02:09.709> basically<00:02:10.009> have<00:02:10.459> four<00:02:10.759> objectives

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
you have basically have four objectives

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.470 
you have basically have four objectives
and<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:12.470> four<00:02:12.680> objectives<00:02:12.799> are<00:02:13.360> turning<00:02:14.360> on

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and the four objectives are turning on

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.600 
and the four objectives are turning on
the<00:02:15.080> two<00:02:15.260> thermal<00:02:15.650> powers<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.250> then<00:02:16.370> turning

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
the two thermal powers and then turning

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.230 
the two thermal powers and then turning
on<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:17.690> two<00:02:17.900> coolant<00:02:18.379> systems<00:02:18.769> so<00:02:19.549> down<00:02:19.790> here

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
on the two coolant systems so down here

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.520 
on the two coolant systems so down here
what<00:02:20.450> i<00:02:20.480> have<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.080> can<00:02:21.170> see<00:02:21.350> there's

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
what i have it is you can see there's

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.610 
what i have it is you can see there's
tubes<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.550> water<00:02:22.790> will<00:02:23.030> go<00:02:23.209> down

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
tubes and so the water will go down

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.649 
tubes and so the water will go down
the<00:02:24.159> lava<00:02:24.400> will<00:02:24.640> go<00:02:24.760> down<00:02:24.909> and<00:02:25.209> each<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.629> of

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
the lava will go down and each one of

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.170 
the lava will go down and each one of
them<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.110> then<00:02:26.319> they'll<00:02:26.470> trigger<00:02:27.000> come<00:02:28.000> down

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
them and then they'll trigger come down

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.050 
them and then they'll trigger come down
here<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.629> we<00:02:29.620> see<00:02:29.890> we<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.129> a<00:02:30.159> beacon<00:02:30.459> here<00:02:30.879> and

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
here as we see we have a beacon here and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.479 
here as we see we have a beacon here and
underneath<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.080> beacon<00:02:32.470> our<00:02:32.680> Pistons<00:02:33.370> that

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
underneath the beacon our Pistons that

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.460 
underneath the beacon our Pistons that
push<00:02:33.730> up<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:33.909> diamonds<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.900> attached<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
push up the diamonds but attached to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.259 
push up the diamonds but attached to
these<00:02:35.590> our<00:02:35.920> bud<00:02:36.280> switches<00:02:36.700> now<00:02:36.970> there's

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
these our bud switches now there's

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.490 
these our bud switches now there's
probably<00:02:37.480> other<00:02:37.629> ways<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.959> do<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.110> but<00:02:38.260> this

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
probably other ways to do this but this

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.899 
probably other ways to do this but this
is<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.709> way<00:02:38.799> I<00:02:38.830> want<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.310> do<00:02:39.459> because<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.700> wanted

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
is the way I want to do because I wanted

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.550 
is the way I want to do because I wanted
to<00:02:39.970> make<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.239> look<00:02:40.360> cool<00:02:40.569> with<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.900> liquids

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
to make it look cool with the liquids

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.920 
to make it look cool with the liquids
going<00:02:41.890> down<00:02:42.069> so<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.970> liquids<00:02:43.299> pour<00:02:43.569> into<00:02:43.720> this

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
going down so the liquids pour into this

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.930 
going down so the liquids pour into this
pipe<00:02:44.140> here<00:02:44.470> touch<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:45.040> back<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.459> piston

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
pipe here touch the back of that piston

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.089 
pipe here touch the back of that piston
which<00:02:46.510> causes<00:02:46.959> this<00:02:47.079> bud<00:02:47.349> switch<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.860> switch

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
which causes this bud switch to switch

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.399 
which causes this bud switch to switch
on<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:49.239> current<00:02:49.569> comes<00:02:49.780> all<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.049> way<00:02:50.200> down

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
on the current comes all the way down

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.850 
on the current comes all the way down
here<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.920> locks<00:02:51.549> in<00:02:51.879> over<00:02:52.840> here<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:53.590> once<00:02:53.769> it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
here it locks in over here so once it

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.650 
here it locks in over here so once it
locks<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.250> over<00:02:54.430> here<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.790> goes<00:02:54.940> this<00:02:55.209> way<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
locks in over here it goes this way and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.490 
locks in over here it goes this way and
it<00:02:56.200> activates<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:58.090> command<00:02:58.450> block<00:02:58.660> at<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
it activates that command block at the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.580 
it activates that command block at the
same<00:02:59.739> time<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.400> comes<00:03:01.180> over<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:02.349> this

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
same time it comes over here like this

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.729 
same time it comes over here like this
and<00:03:02.940> brings<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.299> piston<00:03:04.750> up<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.560> causes

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
and brings that piston up so it causes

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.949 
and brings that piston up so it causes
this<00:03:06.069> piston<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.549> go<00:03:06.670> up<00:03:06.819> which<00:03:07.120> completes<00:03:07.840> a

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
this piston to go up which completes a

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.580 
this piston to go up which completes a
quarter<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.349> the<00:03:08.890> beacon<00:03:09.190> block<00:03:09.480> right<00:03:10.480> there

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
quarter of the beacon block right there

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.259 
quarter of the beacon block right there
so<00:03:11.590> that's<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.400> whole<00:03:12.549> purpose<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.030> so

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
so that's the whole purpose of this so

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.849 
so that's the whole purpose of this so
every<00:03:13.569> time<00:03:13.599> an<00:03:13.870> objective<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.349> complete<00:03:14.680> a

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
every time an objective is complete a

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.880 
every time an objective is complete a
quarter<00:03:15.579> of<00:03:15.609> the<00:03:15.970> beacon<00:03:16.959> block<00:03:17.200> goes<00:03:17.470> up<00:03:17.709> and

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
quarter of the beacon block goes up and

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.170 
quarter of the beacon block goes up and
then<00:03:18.099> when<00:03:18.280> everything<00:03:18.549> is<00:03:18.790> said<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.000> done

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
then when everything is said and done

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.110 
then when everything is said and done
the<00:03:19.510> beacon<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.319> created<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.310> that's<00:03:21.879> when

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
the beacon is created and that's when

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.759 
the beacon is created and that's when
the<00:03:22.150> mission<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.629> ended<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.409> way<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.560> have

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
the mission is ended and the way I have

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.259 
the mission is ended and the way I have
that<00:03:23.980> working<00:03:24.370> on<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.670> ending<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.180> the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
that working on the ending of the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.390 
that working on the ending of the
mission<00:03:25.569> is<00:03:25.750> this<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.859> ending<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.159> the<00:03:27.250> whole

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
mission is this the ending of the whole

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.509 
mission is this the ending of the whole
entire<00:03:27.579> quest<00:03:27.910> line<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:28.720> we<00:03:28.780> come<00:03:28.959> down<00:03:28.989> here

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
entire quest line so we come down here

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.640 
entire quest line so we come down here
we<00:03:30.519> have<00:03:30.639> to<00:03:30.730> find<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.030> special<00:03:31.239> one<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:32.349> one

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
we have to find the special one this one

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.530 
we have to find the special one this one
right<00:03:32.769> here<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:33.190> is<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.430> one<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.269> the

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.539 
the player makes it nighttime blah blah
blah<00:03:41.290> everything<00:03:41.950> as<00:03:42.069> you<00:03:42.190> can<00:03:42.310> see<00:03:42.430> the

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
blah everything as you can see the

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.610 
blah everything as you can see the
vertical<00:03:42.879> transistor<00:03:43.329> is<00:03:43.389> going<00:03:43.660> up<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.410> the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
vertical transistor is going up to the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.470 
vertical transistor is going up to the
fireworks<00:03:44.829> area<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.730> it's<00:03:46.030> causing<00:03:46.389> the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
fireworks area and it's causing the

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.970 
fireworks area and it's causing the
fireworks<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.109> pulse<00:03:47.349> and<00:03:47.620> shoot<00:03:47.859> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
fireworks to pulse and shoot the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.890 
fireworks to pulse and shoot the
fireworks<00:03:48.370> off<00:03:48.519> by<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.849> gates<00:03:49.090> okay<00:03:49.840> so

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
fireworks off by the gates okay so

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.360 
fireworks off by the gates okay so
enough<00:03:50.260> about<00:03:50.349> this<00:03:50.680> we'll<00:03:50.980> be<00:03:51.069> right<00:03:51.250> back

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
enough about this we'll be right back

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.280 
enough about this we'll be right back
alright<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:52.090> now<00:03:52.389> we're<00:03:52.599> back<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:53.049> we're

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
alright so now we're back and we're

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.740 
alright so now we're back and we're
inside<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.949> my<00:03:54.160> command<00:03:54.489> block<00:03:54.730> world<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:55.720> I

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
inside of my command block world so I

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.479 
inside of my command block world so I
have<00:03:55.900> three<00:03:56.139> examples<00:03:56.530> here<00:03:56.919> so<00:03:57.099> before<00:03:57.220> I

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
have three examples here so before I

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.979 
have three examples here so before I
show<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:57.790> these<00:03:57.970> three<00:03:58.239> examples<00:03:58.389> i'm<00:03:58.870> going

here right there we're going to put

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.369 
here right there we're going to put
three<00:04:10.660> blocks<00:04:10.900> across<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:13.120> like<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.510> then

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
three blocks across just like that then

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.009 
three blocks across just like that then
we're<00:04:14.470> going<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.650> come<00:04:14.769> here<00:04:15.190> like<00:04:15.340> this<00:04:16.019> like

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
we're going to come here like this like

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.979 
we're going to come here like this like
to<00:04:17.169> build<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.530> out<00:04:17.650> right<00:04:18.250> there<00:04:18.570> just<00:04:19.570> like<00:04:19.660> so

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
to build it out right there just like so

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.950 
to build it out right there just like so
put<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.829> redstone<00:04:21.039> torch<00:04:21.280> down<00:04:21.820> make<00:04:22.690> sure<00:04:22.720> you

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
put a redstone torch down make sure you

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.710 
put a redstone torch down make sure you
put<00:04:23.110> redstone<00:04:23.320> there<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.389> then<00:04:25.389> over<00:04:25.690> here

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
put redstone there and then over here

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.330 
put redstone there and then over here
this<00:04:26.139> is<00:04:26.320> where<00:04:26.440> it's<00:04:26.650> going<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.979> happen<00:04:27.099> this

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
this is where it's going to happen this

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.830 
this is where it's going to happen this
is<00:04:27.490> where<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.760> trigger<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.270> going<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.570> happen

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
is where the trigger is going to happen

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.659 
is where the trigger is going to happen
here<00:04:29.110> so<00:04:29.650> here<00:04:29.919> we<00:04:29.949> want<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.220> make<00:04:30.310> sure<00:04:30.340> let's

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
here so here we want to make sure let's

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.339 
here so here we want to make sure let's
break<00:04:30.849> that<00:04:30.880> out<00:04:31.090> i<00:04:31.389> actually<00:04:31.840> didn't<00:04:32.020> go<00:04:32.140> over

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
break that out i actually didn't go over

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.050 
break that out i actually didn't go over
as<00:04:32.409> may<00:04:32.560> blocks<00:04:32.830> as<00:04:33.010> i<00:04:33.099> wanted<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.520> but<00:04:33.729> oh<00:04:33.820> well

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
as may blocks as i wanted to but oh well

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.450 
as may blocks as i wanted to but oh well
okay<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.349> put<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.560> repeater<00:04:35.830> here<00:04:35.979> make

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
okay so you put a repeater here make

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.200 
okay so you put a repeater here make
sure<00:04:36.490> its<00:04:36.880> face

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
sure its face

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.600 
sure its face
sing<00:04:37.360> into<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.840> torch<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.380> then<00:04:39.130> we<00:04:39.370> want<00:04:39.520> to

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
sing into the torch and then we want to

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.370 
sing into the torch and then we want to
do<00:04:39.850> this<00:04:40.180> here<00:04:40.479> we're<00:04:40.630> going<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.810> dig<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.169> out

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
do this here we're going to dig this out

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.379 
do this here we're going to dig this out
here<00:04:41.710> we're<00:04:42.340> going<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.520> put<00:04:42.699> a<00:04:42.850> redstone<00:04:43.060> torch

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
here we're going to put a redstone torch

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.689 
here we're going to put a redstone torch
just<00:04:44.350> like<00:04:44.500> that<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:45.340> then<00:04:45.430> we're<00:04:45.550> going<00:04:45.639> to

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
just like that and then we're going to

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.589 
just like that and then we're going to
lead<00:04:45.990> redstone<00:04:47.069> right<00:04:48.069> there<00:04:48.280> now<00:04:48.880> if<00:04:49.180> this

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
lead redstone right there now if this

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.420 
lead redstone right there now if this
works<00:04:49.900> we<00:04:50.710> should<00:04:50.860> be<00:04:50.919> able<00:04:50.979> to<00:04:51.099> put<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.220> block

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
works we should be able to put a block

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.650 
works we should be able to put a block
down<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:51.940> it<00:04:52.930> works<00:04:53.639> there<00:04:54.639> it<00:04:54.819> goes<00:04:55.030> so

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
down and it works there it goes so

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.800 
down and it works there it goes so
anytime<00:04:56.289> this<00:04:57.160> changes<00:04:57.789> at<00:04:57.970> all<00:04:58.030> back<00:04:58.539> here

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
anytime this changes at all back here

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.140 
anytime this changes at all back here
this<00:04:58.990> is<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.169> block<00:04:59.800> updates<00:05:00.310> which<00:05:00.610> anytime

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
this is the block updates which anytime

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.469 
this is the block updates which anytime
this<00:05:01.300> changes<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:02.020> causes<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.860> charge<00:05:03.849> to<00:05:04.150> come

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
this changes it causes a charge to come

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.999 
this changes it causes a charge to come
through<00:05:04.690> here<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.020> it's<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:05.229> pulse<00:05:05.470> charge<00:05:05.710> so

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
through here and it's a pulse charge so

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.360 
through here and it's a pulse charge so
it<00:05:06.160> doesn't<00:05:06.520> stay<00:05:06.669> on<00:05:07.500> just<00:05:08.500> like<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:08.800> so<00:05:09.310> it

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
it doesn't stay on just like that so it

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.219 
it doesn't stay on just like that so it
goes<00:05:09.490> on<00:05:09.610> and<00:05:09.759> it<00:05:09.849> goes<00:05:10.000> off<00:05:10.180> now<00:05:10.810> here's<00:05:11.080> some

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
goes on and it goes off now here's some

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.570 
goes on and it goes off now here's some
different<00:05:11.530> examples<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.160> wanted<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.460> show

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
different examples and I wanted to show

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.850 
different examples and I wanted to show
you<00:05:12.610> guys<00:05:12.789> this<00:05:13.090> so<00:05:13.300> anywhere<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:14.050> put<00:05:14.800> a

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
you guys this so anywhere you put a

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.749 
you guys this so anywhere you put a
block<00:05:15.099> and<00:05:15.509> take<00:05:16.509> it<00:05:16.630> away<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:18.190> causes<00:05:18.580> a

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
block and take it away it causes a

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:24.480 
block and take it away it causes a
charge<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:22.830> just<00:05:23.830> want<00:05:23.949> to<00:05:24.009> show<00:05:24.160> you<00:05:24.250> so<00:05:24.400> we

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
charge I just want to show you so we

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.240 
charge I just want to show you so we
make<00:05:24.669> sure<00:05:25.259> so<00:05:26.259> you<00:05:26.349> can<00:05:26.500> see<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:26.770> all<00:05:26.979> working

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
make sure so you can see it all working

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.360 
make sure so you can see it all working
on<00:05:27.580> all<00:05:28.419> sides<00:05:28.720> of<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.050> besides<00:05:30.009> the<00:05:30.190> side

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
on all sides of it besides the side

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.610 
on all sides of it besides the side
that's<00:05:30.520> pushing<00:05:30.909> up<00:05:31.030> in<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.750> cloth<00:05:31.990> obviously

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
that's pushing up in the cloth obviously

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.200 
that's pushing up in the cloth obviously
then<00:05:33.099> over<00:05:33.340> here<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:33.759> is<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:33.909> same

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
then over here this is the same

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.200 
then over here this is the same
technique<00:05:34.630> I<00:05:34.780> used<00:05:35.139> with<00:05:36.000> inside<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.120> my

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
technique I used with inside of my

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.050 
technique I used with inside of my
Christmas<00:05:37.630> map<00:05:37.810> where<00:05:38.349> I<00:05:38.710> had<00:05:39.580> it<00:05:39.699> triggered

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
Christmas map where I had it triggered

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.270 
Christmas map where I had it triggered
by<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.630> repeaters<00:05:41.289> lighting<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:42.009> turning

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
by the repeaters lighting and turning

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.950 
by the repeaters lighting and turning
off<00:05:42.430> so<00:05:42.789> if<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.000> watch<00:05:43.150> this<00:05:43.449> you'll<00:05:43.509> see<00:05:43.870> the

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
off so if you watch this you'll see the

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.520 
off so if you watch this you'll see the
repeaters<00:05:45.330> put<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.389> little<00:05:46.479> bit<00:05:46.659> you<00:05:47.320> can<00:05:47.470> even

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
repeaters put a little bit you can even

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.939 
repeaters put a little bit you can even
do<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:47.830> like<00:05:47.919> this<00:05:48.720> anytime<00:05:49.720> it<00:05:50.050> changes<00:05:50.680> any

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
do it like this anytime it changes any

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.300 
do it like this anytime it changes any
time<00:05:51.280> this<00:05:51.460> block<00:05:51.729> is<00:05:51.909> changed<00:05:52.719> it<00:05:53.320> works<00:05:53.680> so

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
time this block is changed it works so

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.080 
time this block is changed it works so
like<00:05:54.639> this<00:05:55.740> goes<00:05:56.740> out<00:05:56.919> goes<00:05:57.370> in<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:57.820> we<00:05:57.909> hit<00:05:58.060> it

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
like this goes out goes in and we hit it

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
like this goes out goes in and we hit it
and<00:05:58.949> there<00:05:59.949> we<00:06:00.070> go<00:06:00.099> again<00:06:00.430> just<00:06:01.210> like<00:06:01.330> that<00:06:01.479> so

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
and there we go again just like that so

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.469 
and there we go again just like that so
now<00:06:02.320> I<00:06:02.650> want<00:06:03.460> to<00:06:03.520> show<00:06:03.669> you<00:06:03.729> guys<00:06:03.820> over<00:06:04.210> here

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
now I want to show you guys over here

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.469 
now I want to show you guys over here
this<00:06:04.990> is<00:06:05.199> how<00:06:05.320> we<00:06:05.380> did<00:06:05.680> why<00:06:06.009> did<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.610> inside<00:06:07.449> of

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
this is how we did why did the inside of

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.589 
this is how we did why did the inside of
the<00:06:07.630> Christmas<00:06:07.990> map<00:06:08.169> where<00:06:09.009> I<00:06:09.280> had<00:06:09.610> the<00:06:09.789> four

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
the Christmas map where I had the four

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.080 
the Christmas map where I had the four
tubes<00:06:11.139> that<00:06:11.469> triggered<00:06:11.889> with<00:06:12.280> liquids<00:06:12.699> so<00:06:12.940> if

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
tubes that triggered with liquids so if

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.040 
tubes that triggered with liquids so if
we<00:06:13.210> do<00:06:13.330> this<00:06:13.509> we<00:06:13.750> hit<00:06:14.380> this<00:06:14.560> here<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:16.120> it

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
we do this we hit this here and it

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.140 
we do this we hit this here and it
causes<00:06:17.259> that<00:06:17.500> to<00:06:17.620> go<00:06:17.740> on<00:06:17.889> so<00:06:18.580> now<00:06:18.759> here's<00:06:19.000> what

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
causes that to go on so now here's what

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.999 
causes that to go on so now here's what
I<00:06:19.210> did<00:06:19.270> with<00:06:19.479> this<00:06:19.599> I<00:06:19.780> put<00:06:19.990> an<00:06:20.080> RS<00:06:20.349> nor<00:06:20.560> latch<00:06:20.620> on

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
I did with this I put an RS nor latch on

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.620 
I did with this I put an RS nor latch on
this<00:06:21.219> to<00:06:21.370> catch<00:06:21.550> the<00:06:21.789> signal<00:06:22.150> and<00:06:22.330> keep<00:06:22.479> the

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
this to catch the signal and keep the

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.719 
this to catch the signal and keep the
signal<00:06:22.960> on<00:06:23.080> so<00:06:23.650> you<00:06:23.710> can<00:06:23.800> see<00:06:24.009> now<00:06:24.159> the<00:06:24.190> signals

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
signal on so you can see now the signals

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.959 
signal on so you can see now the signals
on<00:06:24.909> here<00:06:25.330> and<00:06:25.479> usually<00:06:26.380> you<00:06:26.469> can<00:06:26.650> put<00:06:26.860> a<00:06:27.009> let's

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
on here and usually you can put a let's

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.689 
on here and usually you can put a let's
say<00:06:28.060> it's<00:06:28.960> a<00:06:29.050> repeater<00:06:29.409> right<00:06:29.650> there<00:06:29.889> just<00:06:30.610> for

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
say it's a repeater right there just for

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.040 
say it's a repeater right there just for
the<00:06:30.789> heck<00:06:30.909> of<00:06:30.940> it<00:06:31.120> but<00:06:31.389> you're<00:06:31.900> going<00:06:31.990> to

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
the heck of it but you're going to

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.439 
the heck of it but you're going to
always<00:06:32.380> have<00:06:32.560> to<00:06:32.789> reset<00:06:33.789> this<00:06:34.000> so<00:06:34.360> you're

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
always have to reset this so you're

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.330 
always have to reset this so you're
going<00:06:34.539> to<00:06:34.599> cause<00:06:34.750> that<00:06:34.930> to<00:06:35.080> go<00:06:35.199> off<00:06:35.380> and<00:06:35.710> then

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
going to cause that to go off and then

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.980 
going to cause that to go off and then
let's<00:06:36.490> do<00:06:36.639> it<00:06:36.729> again<00:06:36.820> so<00:06:37.389> if<00:06:37.479> we<00:06:37.599> turn<00:06:37.840> the

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
let's do it again so if we turn the

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.629 
let's do it again so if we turn the
water<00:06:38.110> off<00:06:38.259> this<00:06:38.710> time<00:06:39.060> it'll<00:06:40.060> light<00:06:40.330> it<00:06:40.449> again

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
water off this time it'll light it again

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.310 
water off this time it'll light it again
and<00:06:42.639> there<00:06:42.909> goes<00:06:43.150> and<00:06:43.389> it<00:06:43.539> holds<00:06:43.690> that<00:06:43.900> signal

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
and there goes and it holds that signal

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.779 
and there goes and it holds that signal
right<00:06:44.889> there<00:06:45.070> but<00:06:45.219> you<00:06:45.279> can<00:06:45.370> always<00:06:45.490> make<00:06:45.760> sure

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:45.789 
right there but you can always make sure

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.079 
right there but you can always make sure
you<00:06:46.000> got<00:06:46.089> to<00:06:46.210> reset<00:06:46.479> it<00:06:46.539> too<00:06:47.250> so<00:06:48.250> yeah<00:06:48.370> so<00:06:48.940> there

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:49.089 
you got to reset it too so yeah so there

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:51.040 
you got to reset it too so yeah so there
you<00:06:49.120> go<00:06:49.240> that's<00:06:49.750> how<00:06:50.080> you<00:06:50.139> do<00:06:50.409> it<00:06:50.560> the

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
you go that's how you do it the

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.089 
you go that's how you do it the
how<00:06:51.229> you<00:06:51.289> build<00:06:51.710> a<00:06:52.009> bud<00:06:52.669> switch<00:06:52.849> and<00:06:53.979> these<00:06:54.979> are

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
how you build a bud switch and these are

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.339 
how you build a bud switch and these are
how<00:06:55.190> you<00:06:55.250> utilize<00:06:55.550> them<00:06:56.060> inside<00:06:56.599> of<00:06:56.840> a<00:06:56.960> custom

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
how you utilize them inside of a custom

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.320 
how you utilize them inside of a custom
map<00:06:57.530> now<00:06:57.800> there's<00:06:57.949> many<00:06:58.520> other<00:06:58.610> ways<00:06:58.970> to<00:06:59.180> do

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
map now there's many other ways to do

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.700 
map now there's many other ways to do
this<00:06:59.360> but<00:06:59.539> these<00:06:59.840> are<00:06:59.990> the<00:07:00.080> ways<00:07:00.169> that<00:07:00.379> i<00:07:00.440> found

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
this but these are the ways that i found

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.260 
this but these are the ways that i found
out<00:07:00.860> how<00:07:00.979> to<00:07:01.039> do<00:07:01.190> it<00:07:01.310> and<00:07:01.460> how<00:07:01.610> i<00:07:01.639> did<00:07:01.789> it<00:07:01.909> inside

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
out how to do it and how i did it inside

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.629 
out how to do it and how i did it inside
of<00:07:02.389> my<00:07:02.479> custom<00:07:02.870> map<00:07:03.050> so<00:07:03.680> i<00:07:04.039> hope<00:07:04.340> you<00:07:04.490> guys

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 
of my custom map so i hope you guys
