00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
in the first and I mentioned that being

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.380 
in the first and I mentioned that being
positive<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.340> aggressive<00:00:47.820> taking<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.270> game

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
positive and aggressive taking the game

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
positive and aggressive taking the game
to<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> opposition<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> middle<00:00:49.530> session

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to the opposition that middle session

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.880 
to the opposition that middle session
though<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.940> 70<00:00:51.360> runs<00:00:51.570> scored<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> seemed<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
though just 70 runs scored it seemed to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.709 
though just 70 runs scored it seemed to
me<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.219> through<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.940> session<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.539> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
me and through that session was that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.020 
me and through that session was that
because<00:00:54.870> they<00:00:55.170> fall<00:00:55.379> well<00:00:55.699> they<00:00:56.699> would<00:00:56.910> get

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
because they fall well they would get

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.900 
because they fall well they would get
stuck<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.629> think<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.770> definitely<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.579> wickets

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
stuck I think it's definitely as wickets

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.889 
stuck I think it's definitely as wickets
if<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> put<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> ball<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.629> right<00:01:00.690> here

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
if you put the ball in the right here

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.990 
if you put the ball in the right here
just<00:01:01.140> enough<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
just enough in there that you have to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.789 
just enough in there that you have to
respect<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.690> some<00:01:04.170> site<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.589> Jacob

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
respect that so some site you know Jacob

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.830 
respect that so some site you know Jacob
Warren<00:01:05.189> can't<00:01:05.700> Millsboro<00:01:05.939> well<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.450> start<00:01:06.659> the

Warren can't Millsboro well to start the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.410 
Warren can't Millsboro well to start the
session<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.740> came<00:01:07.950> hard<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.280> score<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
session and we came hard to score so you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.700 
session and we came hard to score so you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
know but in the first session when the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.530 
know but in the first session when the
balls<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.220> quite<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:11.970> ball

balls not quite there you know ball

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.600 
balls not quite there you know ball
quite<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:12.869> well<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.229> becomes<00:01:13.740> easier<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> score

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
quite as well it becomes easier to score

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.300 
quite as well it becomes easier to score
but<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.770> Jimmy<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
Ryan and broadly the first innings are

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.240 
Ryan and broadly the first innings are
really<00:01:19.110> bang<00:01:19.380> away<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.650> those<00:01:19.740> areas<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
really bang away in those areas and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.520 
really bang away in those areas and
we've<00:01:20.909> got<00:01:21.030> great<00:01:21.150> chance<00:01:21.479> 11<00:01:21.810> suits<00:01:22.080> but

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530

declaration yeah I think there's enough
time<00:03:18.370> enough<00:03:18.609> time<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.060> game<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.359> keep

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
time enough time in the game to keep

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.270 
time enough time in the game to keep
adding<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.019> I'm<00:03:20.200> sure<00:03:20.650> just<00:03:20.829> try<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.130> get<00:03:21.220> as

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
adding so I'm sure just try and get as

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.559 
adding so I'm sure just try and get as
many<00:03:21.400> as<00:03:21.489> we<00:03:21.549> can<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.910> then<00:03:22.000> put<00:03:22.239> them<00:03:22.329> under

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
many as we can and then put them under

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.210 
many as we can and then put them under
some<00:03:22.750> serious<00:03:23.380> pressure<00:03:23.620> well<00:03:23.950> putting<00:03:24.100> the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
some serious pressure well putting the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.440 
some serious pressure well putting the
ball<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.430> right<00:03:24.489> I<00:03:24.579> was<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.850> new<00:03:24.970> ball<00:03:25.150> if

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
ball in the right I was that new ball if

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.940 
ball in the right I was that new ball if
it<00:03:25.569> sits<00:03:25.720> around<00:03:25.870> like<00:03:26.139> it<00:03:26.319> like<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.590> did<00:03:26.799> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
it sits around like it like it did the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.949 
it sits around like it like it did the
internet<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.880> you'll<00:03:28.000> want<00:03:28.209> dry<00:03:28.510> weather<00:03:28.750> but

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
internet and you'll want dry weather but

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.360 
internet and you'll want dry weather but
perhaps<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.530> bit<00:03:29.560> more<00:03:29.769> cloud<00:03:29.980> cover<00:03:30.040> than

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
perhaps a bit more cloud cover than

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.920 
perhaps a bit more cloud cover than
there<00:03:30.609> has<00:03:30.730> been<00:03:30.760> today<00:03:31.150> yeah<00:03:31.660> I'm<00:03:31.750> not<00:03:31.870> sure

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
there has been today yeah I'm not sure

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.240 
there has been today yeah I'm not sure
it<00:03:32.109> makes<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.410> much<00:03:32.470> difference<00:03:32.650> but<00:03:33.100> it's

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
it makes that much difference but it's

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.570 
it makes that much difference but it's
all

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
all

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.100 
all
psychological<00:03:34.150> thing<00:03:34.330> that's<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.720> little<00:03:34.810> bit

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
psychological thing that's a little bit

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.570 
psychological thing that's a little bit
a<00:03:35.290> little<00:03:35.470> bit<00:03:35.590> great<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:35.950> know<00:03:36.070> as<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.250> battery

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
a little bit great you know as a battery

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.220 
a little bit great you know as a battery
always<00:03:37.120> seems<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.390> do<00:03:37.540> just<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:37.930> little<00:03:38.080> bit

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
always seems to do just that little bit

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.180 
always seems to do just that little bit
more<00:03:38.440> okay<00:03:39.370> great<00:03:39.640> well<00:03:39.820> played<00:03:40.030> today
