followed by another kill off in the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.679 
followed by another kill off in the

people can't he get any more and there's
one<00:01:32.610> more<00:01:32.670> coke<00:01:33.650> head<00:01:34.650> shot<00:01:34.890> too<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> he's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
one more coke head shot too so he's

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.999 
one more coke head shot too so he's
looking<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.750> some<00:01:36.840> more<00:01:36.960> people<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.470> that's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it I guess that's a no touch number

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.340 
it I guess that's a no touch number
three<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:41.060> lits<00:01:42.060> X<00:01:42.540> which<00:01:42.990> points<00:01:43.259> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
three we have lits X which points of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.219 
three we have lits X which points of
eyes<00:01:43.530> he<00:01:44.040> starts<00:01:44.340> off<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.720> c4<00:01:46.110> is

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
eyes he starts off with to c4 is

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.590 
eyes he starts off with to c4 is
followed<00:01:46.530> by<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.860> quick<00:01:47.700> scope<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.210> guess<00:01:48.450> you

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
followed by a quick scope I guess you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 
followed by a quick scope I guess you
can<00:01:48.810> call<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> three<00:01:50.130> kill<00:01:50.340> streak

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
can call it for the three kill streak

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.899 
can call it for the three kill streak
pause<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.930> gets<00:01:52.020> 0<00:01:52.610> trying<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> line<00:01:53.790> up

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
pause then it gets 0 trying to line up

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.310 
pause then it gets 0 trying to line up
the<00:01:54.030> triple<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:54.750> he<00:01:54.899> only<00:01:54.990> gets<00:01:55.200> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the triple here but he only gets a
