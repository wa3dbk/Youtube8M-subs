00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
good scratch pattern over about 90% of

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.700 
good scratch pattern over about 90% of
the<00:00:11.010> sold<00:00:11.599> there's<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.690> very<00:00:13.219> slight<00:00:14.960> areas<00:00:15.960> at

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
the sold there's a very slight areas at

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.510

bit<00:00:20.789> low<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.500> a<00:00:22.500> slight<00:00:22.890> bit<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.939> region

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
bit low and a slight bit in this region

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.429 
bit low and a slight bit in this region
well<00:00:26.310> that's<00:00:26.490> ninety<00:00:26.880> percent<00:00:27.029> flat<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.260> I'm

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
well that's ninety percent flat and I'm

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.370 
well that's ninety percent flat and I'm
very<00:00:28.560> happy<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.689> now<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.109> move

very happy with that so I now just move
through<00:00:31.560> some<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> grits<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.239> take

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
through some of the grits just to take

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
through some of the grits just to take
out<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> scratch<00:00:34.050> marks<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.649> leave<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
out the scratch marks and leave it a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.799 
out the scratch marks and leave it a
little<00:00:36.149> bit<00:00:36.390> polished<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:39.300> I'll<00:00:39.450> turn<00:00:39.660> my

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
now all our flattening and polishing is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.349 
now all our flattening and polishing is
completed<00:00:56.149> we<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> lovely<00:00:57.510> flat<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:59.359> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
completed we have a lovely flat so the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.990 
completed we have a lovely flat so the
sides<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.050> 90<00:01:01.379> degrees<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.579> they're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
sides are at 90 degrees and they're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.850 
sides are at 90 degrees and they're
nicely<00:01:03.210> polished<00:01:03.570> lovely<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.409> smooth<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.830> the

nicely polished lovely and smooth in the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.390 
nicely polished lovely and smooth in the
hand<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.510> did<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.720> run<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.950> papers

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
hand I did just run the the papers

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.310 
hand I did just run the the papers
around<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> edges<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.270> well<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.869> lovely

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
around the edges as well so it is lovely

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.539 
around the edges as well so it is lovely
and<00:01:10.409> smooth<00:01:10.650> there<00:01:10.830> aren't<00:01:11.040> any<00:01:11.159> sharp<00:01:11.430> edges

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
and smooth there aren't any sharp edges

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
and smooth there aren't any sharp edges
and<00:01:14.549> something<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.090> neglected<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.530> tell<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and something I neglected to to tell you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.060 
and something I neglected to to tell you
earlier<00:01:17.630> was<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.909> also<00:01:21.560> flattened<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
earlier was that I also flattened the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.850 
earlier was that I also flattened the
RAM<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> blade<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:28.020> good

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
RAM for the blade so that we get good

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.960 
RAM for the blade so that we get good
contact<00:01:29.540> right<00:01:30.540> along<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.200> end<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.530> blade

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.850 

now<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.150> did<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.720> by<00:01:38.600> disassembling

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.139 

when<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> take<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> cap<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.909> out

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
when you have to take the cap on out

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:54.960 
when you have to take the cap on out
completely<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:49.430> removing<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> blade

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.670 

and<00:01:55.970> I<00:01:56.150> polished<00:01:56.510> this<00:01:56.900> surface<00:01:57.410> here<00:01:57.680> on<00:01:59.680> the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
and I polished this surface here on the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.330 
and I polished this surface here on the
high<00:02:00.890> grits<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.880> wet<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:02.540> dry<00:02:02.660> paper<00:02:03.340> flat

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
high grits of wet and dry paper flat

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.150 
high grits of wet and dry paper flat
down<00:02:04.610> on<00:02:04.760> my<00:02:04.880> reference<00:02:05.330> surface<00:02:05.750> like<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.230> to

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
down on my reference surface like so to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.400 
down on my reference surface like so to
ensure<00:02:07.460> it's<00:02:07.610> nice<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.000> flat<00:02:08.210> and<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:09.200> just

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
ensure it's nice and flat and that just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.390 
ensure it's nice and flat and that just
gives<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.679> good<00:02:09.860> bed<00:02:10.100> for<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.729> iron<00:02:12.160> okay<00:02:13.160> well

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
gives a good bed for the iron okay well

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.040 
gives a good bed for the iron okay well
I'll<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:13.730> clean<00:02:14.120> them<00:02:14.240> all<00:02:14.390> off<00:02:14.570> now<00:02:14.990> with

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
I'll just clean them all off now with

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.610 
I'll just clean them all off now with
some<00:02:16.040> spirits<00:02:16.640> white<00:02:16.910> spirits<00:02:17.360> give<00:02:18.350> them<00:02:18.500> a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
some spirits white spirits give them a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.880 
some spirits white spirits give them a
quick<00:02:19.190> coating<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.850> camellia<00:02:20.360> oil<00:02:20.800> put<00:02:21.800> it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
quick coating of camellia oil put it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:36.699 
quick coating of camellia oil put it
back<00:02:22.040> together<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.580> we<00:02:23.209> can<00:02:23.450> try<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:23.990> out<00:02:35.709> well

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
back together and we can try it out well

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.670 
back together and we can try it out well
we<00:02:36.950> were<00:02:37.010> able<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.340> take<00:02:37.930> wafer<00:02:38.930> thin<00:02:39.200> end

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
we were able to take wafer thin end

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.770 
we were able to take wafer thin end
grain<00:02:40.430> shavings<00:02:44.140> for<00:02:45.140> cleaning<00:02:45.470> up<00:02:45.590> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
grain shavings for cleaning up the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.160 
grain shavings for cleaning up the
shoulders<00:02:47.780> on<00:02:47.900> Tenon's<00:02:52.720> we<00:02:53.720> want<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.959> clean<00:02:54.140> up

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
shoulders on Tenon's we want to clean up

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.810 
shoulders on Tenon's we want to clean up
the<00:02:54.410> cheeks<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.830> Tenon's<00:02:55.190> we<00:02:55.310> want<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.640> take

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
the cheeks of Tenon's we want to take

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:13.350 
the cheeks of Tenon's we want to take
Frost<00:02:56.360> grain<00:02:57.670> shavings<00:02:58.670> I<00:03:11.799> think<00:03:12.799> you'll<00:03:12.920> find

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
Frost grain shavings I think you'll find

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.430 
Frost grain shavings I think you'll find
that's<00:03:14.360> working<00:03:14.870> very<00:03:15.049> well<00:03:15.140> as<00:03:15.440> as<00:03:15.980> well<00:03:17.440> and

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
that's working very well as as well and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.470 
that's working very well as as well and
just<00:03:18.590> occasionally<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.459> suppose<00:03:19.820> we<00:03:20.060> may<00:03:20.239> want

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
just occasionally I suppose we may want

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:30.370 
just occasionally I suppose we may want
to<00:03:20.510> take<00:03:21.130> long<00:03:22.130> grain<00:03:22.400> shavings<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:30.170> they
