00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
get enough cheese I think in fact it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.300

looks like they put that nacho cheese

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.790 
looks like they put that nacho cheese
instead<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.730> putting<00:02:27.880> like<00:02:28.500> shredded<00:02:29.500> cheese

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800
