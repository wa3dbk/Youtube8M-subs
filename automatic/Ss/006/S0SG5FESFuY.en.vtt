00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.900
 [applause] 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:10.659
 [music] 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.659
 [applause] 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.319
 [music] 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 die die 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.140
 about such thoughts climb in the head 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.280
 when you wet the next accident 2g 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.280
 from the game manhunt 2 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.920
 the bloodiest game ever received 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.379
 such its continuation naturally we do not 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 could pass by so faint of heart 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.960
 please move away from the screens we dive 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.879
 in them 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.910
 sophisticated killings and blatant 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.910
 cruelty 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.989
 if you expect us in detail now 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.130
 tell you about the plot and characters of the game 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.980
 you will not wait 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.690
 why do you need it if you decide 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.620
 play this game then obviously not for it 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.960
 to enjoy creativity 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.559
 Script writers the only thing that should you 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.890
 to worry 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.890
 the murder here is a dismemberment severed 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.450
 Actually it was understood and the scriptwriters 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.130
 came up with a story that included 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.520
 would be in as many corpses as possible 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.680
 the way of the main character 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.750
 my little figure lived was doctor Daniel m 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.940
 he was involved in secret development 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 psychotropic drug and it happened 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.740
 that he himself was in the role of an experimental 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.479
 and thundered into a mental hospital but 6 years old to him 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.369
 had to wait until the occasional storm 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.160
 will cut off the defense system from the hospital and 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.600
 patients will not raise god further he 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.590
 the company is all sick leo sent 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.610
 to search for answers to questions 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.990
 periodically occur the device of these 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.990
 last limbo principle 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.569
 and also you don't hear a word about graphics 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.130
 blood fountains in the screen splat hands 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:59.179
 detached okay begin here about 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.460
 manhunt was created for and 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.289
 and playstation 2 count of which is morally 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.509
 outdated at the time of game development 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.140
 remember which picture was to win 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.209
 2007 Nintendo Sample I Walrus Not 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.280
 remember and and then now fine 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.440
 sees but now you know what 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.360
 enjoy the owners and definitely not 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.400
 image porting as usual 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.349
 happens has affected management 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.810
 remember how it was in the first manhunter 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.329
 you press one key you wait 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.489
 colorful kill now have to 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.950
 pull the mouse over here and there we pin 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.280
 left button shooting and does remind 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.900
 avi process is not so hard 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.599
 it's just not clear what it was all about 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.879
 complicate it elementary distracts from 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.890
 what is happening on the screen how to shave 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.930
 have time to consider everything well done not 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.930
 have time for a bunch of combinations for memory 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.579
 but even if you do it clearly because 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.060
 no breaks will occur 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.829
 look as exciting as they could and 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.940
 After all, these are the ones I remember first 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.250
 man hunt 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.299
 you surely remember how you had to 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.370
 sit in the shade 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.419
 as your heart rate increased when you 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.000
 sneak up on nothing 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:10.250
 the suspect victim disappeared 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.010
 breath when the cursor turns yellow 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.660
 then red here all this too 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.660
 no old emotions only 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.590
 there was really a need to lead before 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.990
 I really thought about myself 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.850
 the semblance of hunting and hang up the case 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.830
 detection can simply kill 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.370
 all hand to hand or shoot from 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.380
 shotgun 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.000
 the amount of fire has greatly increased 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.560
 in some places even with combat 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.900
 break through surrounded by enemies 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.900
 It turns out a kind of primitive gear call in 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.220
 it's better that we are all here to you 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.350
 tell before we tell you better we 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.070
 we show you the top ten most interesting 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.260
 executions 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.900
 if you read this spoiler turn off 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.270
 We immediately advise everyone else to review 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.270
 sigh in one you and get ready and 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.100
 so number 10 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.750
 yes poor luck not and we have a number 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.120
 nine penalty using a sledgehammer 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.470
 like chicken simple and tasteful 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.330
 go to number 8 now you know 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.070
 what happens when you ask for an autograph from 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:25.810
 that person and number seven will tell 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.810
 how else can you use nippers 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.880
 number six won the circular saw 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.620
 comment as they say overly poor 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.280
 the girl will not wait for her beloved 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.650
 daddy dinner but we go to the fifth 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.710
 place this caller 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.490
 from now on forever will be unavailable that's what 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.530
 it means not to dial the number 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.900
 well, in fourth place we have a penalty with 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.990
 shovel and we will torment you right away 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.580
 imagine the third place today is she 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.310
 dedicated to gordon freeman 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:05.830
 his cult mounts second place 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.030
 will tell you what is dangerous and public 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.030
 toilets in unfamiliar places 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.630
 Well, the first place was beaten by all my thoughts 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.350
 perceptions of cruelty and 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.350
 sophistication 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.949
 post compared to this penalty 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.720
 bedtime story 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.720
 here he is manhunt 2 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.590
 you can buy it only out of respect for 1 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.730
 part and developers from rockstar either and 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.770
 treasure and dismemberment and so we think 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.870
 the developers themselves and the publishers understand 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.700
 that release is outdated in every way and 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.290
 consider it as a serious project 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.290
 very, very difficult
