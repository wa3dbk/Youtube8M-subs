00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
it's a very high quality when you make

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.300 
it's a very high quality when you make
it<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.289> looks<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.069> other

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
it like this it looks just like other

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.300 
it like this it looks just like other
stickers<00:02:08.700> um<00:02:09.679> another<00:02:10.679> way<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.069> do<00:02:11.160> this

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
stickers um another way you can do this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.030 
stickers um another way you can do this
is<00:02:11.459> using<00:02:11.640> super<00:02:12.060> glue<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.780> tends<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.620> stick

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
is using super glue that tends to stick

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.970 
is using super glue that tends to stick
better<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.319> figure<00:02:16.440> out<00:02:16.590> whatever

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
better but you can figure out whatever

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.699 
better but you can figure out whatever
you<00:02:17.100> want<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.580> use<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.940> make<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> stick<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.709> then

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
you want to use to make a stick and then

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.319 
you want to use to make a stick and then
I'll<00:02:19.920> leave<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> comment<00:02:20.489> if<00:02:20.579> this<00:02:20.730> worked<00:02:21.060> for
