00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 what a fart band looking for an experience 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.320
 more complete with the wing gamepad 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.610
 I decided to take a look at the wonderful 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.230
 one or one 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.160
 maybe platinum games do it a lot 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.160
 better than others 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.070
 the wonderful one or one is a bolero 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.500
 hack and slash developed by platinum 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.910
 games and distributed by nintendo in 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.830
 where you control 100 brave people 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.560
 warriors which will deal with help 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.750
 yours since you are the member 101 of 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.550
 team stop a powerful race 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.100
 alien that tries to conquer the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.230
 planet earth the game plot sonar 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.869
 something cliché and the truth has no feet 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.270
 no head but it runs in your favor since 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.060
 the game itself is a great tribute joke 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.860
 to comics invasion movies 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.560
 series and caricatures of superiors both 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.990
 western as eastern part of the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.479
 charm of the game is that it really does not 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.040
 take anything seriously maybe we have to 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.170
 our disposition to 100 heroes to 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.630
 control but only a handful of this 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.860
 will be really important both in plot 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.170
 as in gameplay 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.850
 besides that they are so stereotypical that 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.130
 you can not help laughing in more than one 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.380
 occasion we have the leader who always 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.020
 try to do things well and you know 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.060
 all names occupations and up 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.759
 the titles of your allies and enemies 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.710
 the cool guy who is really annoying and 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.990
 he hides a grim past behind his 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.830
 arrogance the girl who is only 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.890
 Obsessed with 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.550
 with the villain that according to her is super 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.170
 hot among other things it is possible that 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.390
 some people take this as something 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.730
 offensive but I think it really is 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.820
 Part of the fun is like getting mad 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.320
 with the clones of pons out and good if 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.380
 we only really control like seven 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.610
 characters so that the others are 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.470
 simple to throw the heap and 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.960
 become the weapons with which 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.550
 will defend the earth mechanics 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.950
 main title is to use something 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.570
 called yunait morph making use of the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.310
 touch screen gamepad you can 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.280
 change your weapons inventory with 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.220
 simple strokes a circle to create a 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.500
 giant hand and give 14 to people a 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.959
 straight line to make a sword or a 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.220
 zig zag to create claws 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.350
 depending on how big you do this 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.510
 drawing on the screen and how many members 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.540
 have the weapon in question in your team 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.700
 will become bigger and more powerful there are other 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.350
 ways to select the weaponry as 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.600
 make figures with the right stick or 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.760
 choose those from a list that is displayed 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.010
 on the control screen but none 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.100
 of these I found comfortable and really 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.630
 I do not recommend them lost in nightmares 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.510
 us in basic actions like 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.070
 dodge defend yourself and even fly is 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.450
 this great variety of transformations 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.520
 what makes the game stay 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.160
 cool most of the experience 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.200
 of when football does not one will look like 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.000
 a simple playful game but he after 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.270
 its colorful exterior is black 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.500
 heart of the people of platinum games 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.410
 they love to make difficult games 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.300
 full of fights against giant children and 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.120
 even more giant heads that have their 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.650
 bitch on more than one occasion the combat 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.930
 It is frantic but at the same time full of 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.940
 strategy many enemies are weak 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.590
 against a type of weapon only so 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.360
 which will you have to think about and react to 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.820
 the different situations in which you 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.890
 you will be involved in the same way 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.390
 game has a learning curve 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.760
 quite elevated and there will be many moments 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.310
 where you really will not know what to do or to 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.620
 where to go since the title does not explain very 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.210
 ok some basic mechanics and sometimes 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.060
 nor do they bother to explain to you 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.710
 what is your next goal this comes 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.140
 as a result of camera handling 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.150
 very poor because of the magnitude of 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.100
 the fights and enemies and the amount of 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.230
 heroes that you can control the camera 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.850
 will generally be far away so that 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.310
 You can see all the chs 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.070
 unfortunately this makes you lose 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.930
 detail of many things and more than once 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.610
 they will hit you just because you do not 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.100
 you saw the enemy among all 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.990
 show although you can zoom in 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.450
 camera to focus more on your 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.660
 characters the action is so fast and 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.010
 piled up that will not distinguish much 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.720
 due to these drawbacks and the 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.610
 characteristic difficulty of platinum 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.400
 games I can tell you that this game 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.680
 it can become very frustrating I'm not going 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.720
 to lie more than once I had to 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.270
 stop because I was up to the egg 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.100
 of some fight luckily this 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.900
 Frustration is overcome by a game 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.270
 classic predictive and entertaining 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.920
 study so few moments later 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.600
 I went back to grab the control and I put 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.120
 play to try to beat the asshole 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.970
 that would not let me move even if that 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.530
 will lead to a few more deaths 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.960
 graphically from wonderful one or one 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.910
 It has a very peculiar aspect many 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.770
 things look like plastic and in general 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.040
 the tone of the scenarios is pretty 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.300
 simple although extremely colorful 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.980
 all this gives a feeling that the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.480
 game is really a model or a 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.280
 a child 's room which are playing 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.380
 with all his toys 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.930
 it's a very peculiar artistic style but 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.060
 quite nice to platinumgames them 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.830
 love to make noisy games and this is not 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.590
 It is disappointment because it is full of screams 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.510
 and explosions everywhere is one of those 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.300
 titles that are heard throughout the house 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.130
 regardless of the volume of the TV by 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.200
 its part the voice performances so well 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.510
 their work and they represent quite well 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.430
 the cliché that are acting 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.080
 interactions between these characters are 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.780
 really entertaining and they made me 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.240
 get more than one laugh maybe the only 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.710
 but what would you say is that these 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.230
 dialogues on some levels are 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.900
 too constant and between cut the 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.970
 experience in general music is not 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.290
 very memorable reminds me of all those 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.540
 film soundtracks of 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.400
 current superheroes which are going 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.140
 perfect with the moment and until you 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.960
 they add an extra to the scene but when 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.840
 Finish everything or remember them by luck 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.340
 has a couple of tunes that do stand out 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.260
 especially the main theme sung 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.510
 that goes back to my childhood and the 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.520
 Morning caricatures of when the full 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.860
 one or one is a game with quite a challenge 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.639
 fun mechanics and a high level of 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.440
 playability 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.360
 if you are one of those people that needs 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.280
 get 100% of things 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.379
 since it has many collectibles 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.539
 which range from information on 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:22.879
 the world and the enemies to the same 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.590
 wonderful team members in addition to 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.020
 count on the already characteristic system 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.000
 of platinum ranking which qualifies 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.069
 adaptation during battles and the 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.689
 level in general depending on which 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.340
 you have also gone, you will be granted a 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.740
 qualification the quality is pure 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:39.110
 platinum to the miserable prize of 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.150
 consolation if you're a person that 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.520
 like personal challenges here is 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.139
 where will you be addicted to this title 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.060
 is the first where I see that the gamepad 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.949
 It is ideal to play it, not because 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.409
 really be the only way but because 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.909
 it's the most comfortable way to do it and 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:53.180
 this makes it an excellent game for the 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:55.789
 wii 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.830
 still I feel that this game is not for 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.930
 worldwide since its high degree of 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.729
 difficulty and his peculiar style of art 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.129
 and plot will keep the majority away 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.689
 but if you like caracas the 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.370
 right and a little one wrote his 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:10.740
 mechanics this game is for you 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.740
 good band there they have it wonderful

 a pretty fun experience there 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.600
 a solid gameplay in addition to a campaign 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.790
 with many hours to get juice if you
