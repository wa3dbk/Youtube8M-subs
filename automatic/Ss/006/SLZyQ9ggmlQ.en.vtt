00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:03.749
 Well, here we have the mounted computer again 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.590
 for this the screws that we removed from here below 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.770
 we have installed also 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.219
 keyboard 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.660
 in such a way what 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.970
 has been completely assembled from new computer in fact some tests 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.909
 browsing net some tests of 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.909
 sound the keyboard and everything works perfectly 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.760
 so that 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.010
 in this way you see 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.960
 keep a must have at 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.140
 you have to be quite careful when mounting this 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.110
 They know how to do things by being very organized 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.880
 and having the necessary tools 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.970
 all power well me in my case 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.970
 these tools that used been on the one hand a screwdriver 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.090
 d 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 star watchmaker to remove the screws 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.150
 also used at certain times a small computer can 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.840
 lose a small minor palm data 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.620
 in that video 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.060
 ps solís cross and the mind 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.050
 pull apart 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.860
 the protego spread are 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.740
 stops connectors 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.150
 I had on the keyboard 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 and he and the metal plate under the keyboard 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460
 only for that is not 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 what used 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.990
 this to separate the plastic because obviously good 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.480
 this very delicate plastic and any 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.480
 pressure that is made or leverage that is made will result in crime all the 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480
 plastic s / aa nickar will break nothing 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.070
 a small box 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.210
 of a sd memory to tackle screws and trims this is very important 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.380
 try not to have in the have on the table 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.330
 nothing except what you are using that moment 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.590
 and with this 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.940
 because of not attending to the poor results a similar one that I have had 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.180
 I 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.100
 min 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.939
 me in my case what the first way I want to do is to put a screen 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:05.920
 tactile 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.069
 for now I will not insist on opening the computer smell underneath 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.079
 and extract it for the motherboard because right now I'm not interested 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.999
 at the moment when the energy and tequila 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.589
 the touchscreen 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.239
 If necessary, there would be a video 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.669
 for teaching 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.439
 with the mega screen of another video go a lot of ecuador are my 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:30.649
 my walking with this modín 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.009
 and see if I get it 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.609
 and given comments to all that encourage you ins 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.909
 to lose the fear to say now the computer is misused 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.149
 do it ever 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.689
 even if you are not going to do 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.349
 no type of motorcycle 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.819
 but at least I'll be ready for when the time comes 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.519
 and above all lose the fear that initial that we all usually have not for 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.899
 since I will mount the computer 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.549
 I hope I served you by living 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.849
 i will see you soon a greeting friends
