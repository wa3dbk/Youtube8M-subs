 beautiful animal to a wonder of the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.770
 nature a living fossil of what 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.770
 let's see let's see it 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.110
 there are animals that seem frozen 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.050
 in time they are somehow 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.879
 living fossils of their ancestors that 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.210
 they inhabited the earth millions of 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.730
 such is the case of capi the 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.530
 closest brother of the giraffe a 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.589
 weird mammal that has nothing to do 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.960
 with his long-necked relative and 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.729
 features spots this wonder 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.100
 of nature has a huge 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.770
 similar to the graphics that stepped on the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.170
 land in the Miocene inhabits the most 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.390
 thick of the Congo forest where its 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.259
 Natural camouflage does not help to hide 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.420
 of its predators 1 cap and adult measures 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.550
 one meter 80 centimeters high at 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.800
 cross 215 long weighs about 300 kilos and 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.990
 just like the giraffes has two 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.350
 horns on the head covered in hair 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.229
 because of its size it would be impossible for it to happen 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.509
 unnoticed in the jungle but years of 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.390
 evolution they provided to this 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.149
 species the reddish black hair in almost 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.140
 all the body because in the legs it counts 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.680
 with a coat 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.720
 with stripes similar to a zebra's 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.700
 huge ears allow you to have a great 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.280
 sense of hearing to be alert to 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.050
 the danger of a hunter when the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.360
 first explorers who came to the 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.619
 congo discovered to lock up and thought 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.570
 that it was a kind 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.330
 Unknown female relative of the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.420
 horse reason why he was baptized 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.550
 as stones excursion but when it 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.860
 noticed that he had two fingers on his paws 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.640
 they realized that it was a 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.820
 art or tactile or feeds on ferns 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.830
 leaves fruits and branches that thanks to their 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.230
 Long tongue can easily reach 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.440
 above other species such as 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.239
 antelopes and the capi is in 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.670
 danger of extinction due to 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.459
 destruction of their habitat and the house 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.769
 to get your exotic skin species 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.480
 as capi are a living sample of 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.519
 the fauna that reigned on earth makes 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.840
 millions of years 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.450
 we should think that in our hands 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.610
 is your future otherwise 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.590
 will become a memory more than 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.060
 those beings that became extinct by 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.270
 our cause 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.310
 tvn looked garcÃ­a estrada 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.500
 animals that I really sometimes 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.150
 I do not even know which one is the one in the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.010
 next week the kangaroo jolie wants 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.450
 so we'll see how she goes this 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.450
