00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
going across but the bars can be short

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.530 
going across but the bars can be short
enough<00:04:12.350> because<00:04:13.350> like<00:04:13.950> there's<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.540> thing

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
enough because like there's a thing

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.800 
enough because like there's a thing
inside<00:04:15.900> where<00:04:16.289> I<00:04:16.320> can<00:04:16.829> shrink<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:18.239> get

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
inside where I can shrink and and get

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.860 
inside where I can shrink and and get
bigger<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.349> yeah<00:04:19.680> that's<00:04:19.919> what<00:04:20.039> she<00:04:20.190> said<00:04:20.870> um

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
bigger and yeah that's what she said um

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:31.700 
bigger and yeah that's what she said um
and<00:04:22.440> these<00:04:23.400> are<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.789> stands<00:04:26.000> see<00:04:30.560> stand<00:04:31.560> down

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
and these are the stands see stand down

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.159 
and these are the stands see stand down
with<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.039> bottom<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.300> other<00:04:33.510> one<00:04:33.660> is

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
with the bottom and the other one is

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.779 
with the bottom and the other one is
exactly<00:04:34.770> this<00:04:34.950> I'm<00:04:35.099> actually<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.490> little<00:04:35.639> bit

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
exactly this I'm actually a little bit

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.370 
exactly this I'm actually a little bit
easier<00:04:36.090> just<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.330> get<00:04:36.510> this<00:04:36.690> one<00:04:36.930> because<00:04:37.200> the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
easier just to get this one because the

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.850 
easier just to get this one because the
walls<00:04:37.620> blank<00:04:38.750> um<00:04:40.729> they<00:04:41.729> have<00:04:42.000> 3<00:04:42.870> sections

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
walls blank um they have 3 sections

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.370 
walls blank um they have 3 sections
where<00:04:44.639> you<00:04:44.669> thin<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.810> could<00:04:45.930> bring<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.229> down

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
where you thin you could bring it down

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.290 
where you thin you could bring it down
lower<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.889> stuff<00:04:48.650> also<00:04:49.650> at<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.160> top<00:04:50.490> if<00:04:51.030> you

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
lower and stuff also at the top if you

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.390 
lower and stuff also at the top if you
can<00:04:51.450> get<00:04:51.599> that<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.870> really<00:04:52.620> short<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:57.289> unhooks

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
can get that a really short it unhooks

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.820 
can get that a really short it unhooks
