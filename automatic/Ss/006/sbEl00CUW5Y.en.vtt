hi<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.620> Manny<00:00:01.860> dela<00:00:02.070> Cruz<00:00:02.310> I<00:00:02.490> have<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:03.049> 96<00:00:04.049> Saab

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
hi I'm Manny dela Cruz I have a 96 Saab

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.760 
hi I'm Manny dela Cruz I have a 96 Saab
and<00:00:05.330> I<00:00:06.330> think<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.870> fuel<00:00:07.049> pumps<00:00:07.290> gone<00:00:07.440> out<00:00:07.620> on

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
and I think the fuel pumps gone out on

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.000 
and I think the fuel pumps gone out on
it<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.750> the<00:00:09.750> way<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.050> know<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.740> I

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
it and the way that I know this is I

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.990 
it and the way that I know this is I
tried<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.700> start<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.910> car<00:00:12.150> wouldn't<00:00:12.870> start<00:00:12.929> I

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
tried to start the car wouldn't start I

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.990 
tried to start the car wouldn't start I
tested<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.660> relay<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.619> tested<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> fuse<00:00:17.640> I

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
tested the relay and I tested the fuse I

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.660 
tested the relay and I tested the fuse I
did<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.840> by<00:00:19.020> opening<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> fuse<00:00:19.980> box<00:00:20.189> near

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
did that by opening up the fuse box near

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.250 
did that by opening up the fuse box near
the<00:00:20.699> kick<00:00:20.910> panel<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.330> left<00:00:21.539> hand<00:00:21.720> side<00:00:21.960> and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
the kick panel on the left hand side and

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.189 
the kick panel on the left hand side and
then<00:00:22.980> using<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.490> voltmeter<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.449> test<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
then using a voltmeter to test the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.540 
then using a voltmeter to test the
voltage<00:00:25.320> when<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:25.830> turning<00:00:26.010> over<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.340> car

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
voltage when I was turning over the car

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.490 
voltage when I was turning over the car
you<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> car<00:00:28.349> is

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you have to do this when the car is

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.870 
you have to do this when the car is
turning<00:00:28.740> over<00:00:28.949> because<00:00:29.340> that's<00:00:29.550> when<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
turning over because that's when a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.999 
turning over because that's when a
signal<00:00:30.300> gets<00:00:30.420> sent<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.720> fuel<00:00:30.990> pump<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
signal gets sent to the fuel pump if you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.860 
signal gets sent to the fuel pump if you
have<00:00:32.160> voltage<00:00:32.489> there<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.329> means<00:00:33.510> both<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
have voltage there that means both the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
have voltage there that means both the
fuse<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.530> relay<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:34.980> working<00:00:35.399> correctly

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
fuse in the relay are working correctly

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.389 
fuse in the relay are working correctly
so<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.630> next<00:00:36.809> step<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.590> replace<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
so the next step is then to replace the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.790 
so the next step is then to replace the
fuel<00:00:38.610> pump<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.989> don't<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.850> drop<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> fuel

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
fuel pump I don't want to drop the fuel

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
fuel pump I don't want to drop the fuel
tank<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.430> sounds<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.180> giant<00:00:45.539> pain<00:00:45.719> in

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
tank that sounds like a giant pain in

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.299 
tank that sounds like a giant pain in
the<00:00:45.899> butt<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.140> there's<00:00:46.469> an<00:00:46.649> access<00:00:47.039> port

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the butt and there's an access port

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.619 
the butt and there's an access port
underneath<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> rear<00:00:49.079> seat<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.710> Saab

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
underneath the rear seat of the Saab

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.569 
underneath the rear seat of the Saab
again<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> Saab<00:00:52.230> 900<00:00:53.010> turbo<00:00:53.960> se<00:00:55.579> 1996

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
again this is a Saab 900 turbo se 1996

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.319 
again this is a Saab 900 turbo se 1996
and<00:00:57.320> rather<00:00:58.320> than<00:00:58.890> drop<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> tank<00:00:59.789> which<00:01:00.149> is

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and rather than drop the tank which is

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.110 
and rather than drop the tank which is
full<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.570> gas<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:01.109> now<00:01:01.250> I've<00:01:02.250> opened<00:01:02.670> up<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
full of gas right now I've opened up the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
full of gas right now I've opened up the
rear<00:01:03.270> seat<00:01:03.589> lifted<00:01:04.589> them<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.010> there's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
rear seat lifted them up and there's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.460 
rear seat lifted them up and there's
actually<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> flap<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.659> carpet<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.320> can

there what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.830 
there what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:10.710> widen<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.820> access<00:01:12.210> port<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.750> get

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to widen that access port so I can get

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
to widen that access port so I can get
the<00:01:12.930> fuel<00:01:13.140> pump<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.530> without<00:01:14.150> dropping<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
of the Saab 900 and I folded the seats

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
of the Saab 900 and I folded the seats
up<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.729> could<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.990> reveals

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
up you could see that and that reveals

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.810 
up you could see that and that reveals
the<00:01:37.530> carpet<00:01:37.950> underneath<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.400> seats<00:01:38.670> now

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the carpet underneath the seats now

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.060 
the carpet underneath the seats now
directly<00:01:39.150> under<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.570> panel<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
directly under this panel here is the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.399 
directly under this panel here is the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
can see there's some wires poking out

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.270 
can see there's some wires poking out
and<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> pulled<00:01:48.450> them<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.710> the

it anyways the fuel pump itself is not
directly<00:02:08.429> underneath<00:02:08.850> here<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:11.069> fuel<00:02:11.280> pump

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
directly underneath here the fuel pump

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.400 
directly underneath here the fuel pump
is<00:02:11.490> actually<00:02:11.640> right<00:02:11.940> over<00:02:11.970> here<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.230> what

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.290 
you know anyways it's a very brittle
I<00:04:22.230> used<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:25.530> utility<00:04:26.490> knife<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.880> score<00:04:27.120> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
I used a utility knife to score the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.820 
I used a utility knife to score the
edges<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.780> then<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:27.930> used<00:04:28.140> a<00:04:28.260> chisel<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.740> a

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
edges and then I used a chisel and a

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.320 
edges and then I used a chisel and a
hammer<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.340> chip<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.610> away<00:04:29.790> it<00:04:29.940> took<00:04:30.090> about

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
hammer to chip it away it took about

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.880 
hammer to chip it away it took about
five<00:04:30.600> minutes<00:04:30.960> it's<00:04:31.110> not<00:04:31.169> that<00:04:31.410> big<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.740> deal

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
five minutes it's not that big of a deal

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.830 
five minutes it's not that big of a deal
but<00:04:32.730> you'll<00:04:32.940> need<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.180> do<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.480> to<00:04:33.630> clear<00:04:33.810> a

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
but you'll need to do that to clear a

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.050 
but you'll need to do that to clear a
path<00:04:34.080> for<00:04:34.350> your<00:04:34.440> nibbler<00:04:34.860> because<00:04:35.850> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
path for your nibbler because the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.460 
path for your nibbler because the
nibbler<00:04:36.330> will<00:04:36.450> gum<00:04:36.630> up<00:04:36.810> if<00:04:37.020> it's<00:04:37.169> trying<00:04:37.410> to

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
nibbler will gum up if it's trying to

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.380 
nibbler will gum up if it's trying to
cut<00:04:37.590> through<00:04:37.740> toilet<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:38.220> I'm<00:04:38.970> at<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> point

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
cut through toilet so I'm at the point

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.420 
cut through toilet so I'm at the point
now<00:04:39.540> or<00:04:39.720> I'm<00:04:39.780> gonna<00:04:39.870> start<00:04:40.860> nibbling<00:04:41.130> let's

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
now or I'm gonna start nibbling let's

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.390 
now or I'm gonna start nibbling let's
see<00:04:41.580> if<00:04:41.640> this<00:04:42.380> see<00:04:43.380> this<00:04:43.500> works<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:46.160> guess<00:04:47.160> it

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
see if this see this works I guess it

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.710 
see if this see this works I guess it
goes<00:04:47.520> without<00:04:47.700> saying<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.390> shouldn't

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
goes without saying that you shouldn't

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.030 
goes without saying that you shouldn't
be<00:04:48.870> using<00:04:49.140> a<00:04:49.200> tool<00:04:49.380> like<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:51.360> grinder<00:04:52.230> because

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
be using a tool like a grinder because

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:27.060 
be using a tool like a grinder because
that<00:04:53.490> throws<00:04:53.700> sparks<00:04:53.940> everywhere

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.320 

all<00:05:28.070> right<00:05:28.250> as<00:05:28.400> you<00:05:28.460> can<00:05:28.820> see<00:05:29.030> I<00:05:29.840> have<00:05:31.330> removed

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
all right as you can see I have removed

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.840 
all right as you can see I have removed
the<00:05:32.660> piece<00:05:32.930> of<00:05:33.080> steel<00:05:33.260> that<00:05:33.800> separates<00:05:34.340> they

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
the piece of steel that separates they

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.340 
the piece of steel that separates they
can<00:05:34.970> later<00:05:35.090> write<00:05:35.270> in<00:05:35.480> it<00:05:35.600> they're<00:05:35.810> actually

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
can later write in it they're actually

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.240 
can later write in it they're actually
like<00:05:36.530> that<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:37.640> separates<00:05:38.800> this<00:05:39.800> floor<00:05:40.040> pan

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
like that that separates this floor pan

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.570 
like that that separates this floor pan
from<00:05:40.640> to<00:05:41.540> the<00:05:41.780> top<00:05:41.990> of<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.170> fuel<00:05:42.320> pump<00:05:42.500> and<00:05:42.830> the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
from to the top of the fuel pump and the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.270 
from to the top of the fuel pump and the
next<00:05:43.760> step<00:05:43.940> is<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.450> remove<00:05:44.600> the<00:05:44.720> fuel<00:05:45.020> pump<00:05:45.280> got

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
next step is to remove the fuel pump got

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.710 
next step is to remove the fuel pump got
to<00:05:46.370> figure<00:05:46.520> out<00:05:46.610> how<00:05:46.670> to<00:05:46.760> do<00:05:46.880> that<00:05:47.030> there<00:05:47.480> was<00:05:47.660> a

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
to figure out how to do that there was a

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.750 
to figure out how to do that there was a
weird<00:05:47.840> plastic<00:05:48.260> cover<00:05:48.470> very<00:05:49.010> thin<00:05:49.370> almost

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
weird plastic cover very thin almost

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.990 
weird plastic cover very thin almost
disposable<00:05:50.360> I<00:05:50.830> destroyed<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:52.160> don't

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
disposable I destroyed it I don't

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.150 
disposable I destroyed it I don't
consider<00:05:53.270> it<00:05:53.390> important<00:05:53.840> that<00:05:54.880> reveals<00:05:55.880> the

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
consider it important that reveals the

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.090 
consider it important that reveals the
the<00:05:58.160> end<00:05:58.310> of<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.580> fuel<00:05:59.120> pump<00:05:59.330> assembly<00:05:59.420> and<00:06:00.100> I

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
the end of the fuel pump assembly and I

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.200 
the end of the fuel pump assembly and I
got<00:06:01.280> to<00:06:01.370> figure<00:06:01.490> out<00:06:01.670> how<00:06:01.790> to<00:06:01.820> spin<00:06:02.060> that

got to figure out how to spin that

got to figure out how to spin that
sucker
