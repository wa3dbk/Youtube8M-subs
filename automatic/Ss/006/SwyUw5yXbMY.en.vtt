little bit dark but that's what they

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.500 
little bit dark but that's what they
mesh<00:02:25.530> me<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.760> would<00:02:26.849> be<00:02:26.970> good<00:02:27.120> for<00:02:27.150> summer

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
think about how it applies our how

00:02:37.170 --> 00:03:01.100 
think about how it applies our how
foundation<00:02:37.739> applies<00:02:38.069> over

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.780 

all<00:03:02.110> right<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:02.770> put<00:03:02.980> my<00:03:03.100> foundation<00:03:03.280> on

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
all right so I just put my foundation on

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.809 
all right so I just put my foundation on
over<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:07.620> primer<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.280> went<00:03:09.490> on<00:03:09.550> just

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
over that primer and it went on just

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.020 
over that primer and it went on just
fine<00:03:10.090> um<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.230> although<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.520> tinted

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
fine um and although this is a tinted

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.809 
fine um and although this is a tinted
primer<00:03:13.300> I<00:03:13.540> didn't<00:03:13.959> feel<00:03:14.200> like<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:15.640> know<00:03:15.670> I

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
primer I didn't feel like it you know I

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.559 
primer I didn't feel like it you know I
gave<00:03:16.209> any<00:03:16.480> kind<00:03:17.050> of<00:03:17.170> extra<00:03:17.680> coverage<00:03:17.920> like

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
gave any kind of extra coverage like

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.030 
gave any kind of extra coverage like
color<00:03:19.569> wise<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.350> don't<00:03:20.500> think<00:03:20.739> it's<00:03:20.830> like

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
color wise so I don't think it's like

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.740 
color wise so I don't think it's like
you<00:03:21.580> know<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.790> have<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.120> it's<00:03:22.450> not<00:03:22.510> gonna

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
you know you have to it's not gonna

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.160 
you know you have to it's not gonna
match<00:03:23.080> your<00:03:23.110> shade<00:03:23.590> or<00:03:23.770> anything<00:03:24.010> like<00:03:24.310> that

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
match your shade or anything like that

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.229 
match your shade or anything like that
but<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.560> do<00:03:26.620> feel<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.340> reduced<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.790> look

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
but I do feel like it reduced the look

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.130 
but I do feel like it reduced the look
of<00:03:28.420> my<00:03:28.600> pores

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
of my pores

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.120 
of my pores

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.470 
um not drastically not like I can't see
them<00:03:33.250> anymore<00:03:33.400> but<00:03:33.730> they<00:03:33.820> aren't<00:03:33.940> they<00:03:34.420> do

by dr. Brandt um as far as primers go um

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.670 
by dr. Brandt um as far as primers go um
it<00:03:50.860> did<00:03:51.190> make<00:03:51.580> my<00:03:51.910> it's<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.600> pore<00:03:52.870> refiner<00:03:53.319> so<00:03:53.650> I

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
it did make my it's a pore refiner so I

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.050 
it did make my it's a pore refiner so I
feel<00:03:53.920> like<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.160> did<00:03:54.310> make<00:03:54.459> my<00:03:54.580> pores<00:03:54.880> look

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
feel like it did make my pores look

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.410 
feel like it did make my pores look
smaller<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.840> did<00:03:56.170> kind<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.410> fill<00:03:56.620> them<00:03:56.800> in<00:03:57.420> but

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
smaller it did kind of fill them in but

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.030 
smaller it did kind of fill them in but
it<00:03:58.600> did<00:03:58.780> not<00:03:58.930> make<00:03:59.080> them<00:03:59.230> disappear<00:03:59.470> so<00:03:59.890> it's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
it did not make them disappear so it's

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.120 
it did not make them disappear so it's
not<00:04:00.130> like<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.340> miracle<00:04:01.150> primer<00:04:02.019> by<00:04:02.680> any<00:04:02.920> means

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
not like a miracle primer by any means

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.520 
not like a miracle primer by any means
but<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.549> does<00:04:03.730> make<00:04:03.940> them<00:04:04.150> appear<00:04:04.480> smaller<00:04:04.870> so

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
but it does make them appear smaller so

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.509 
but it does make them appear smaller so
I<00:04:05.560> like<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.400> um<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.980> will<00:04:08.980> put<00:04:09.280> its<00:04:09.430> a

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
I like that um I will put its a

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.670 
I like that um I will put its a
mattifying<00:04:09.850> primer<00:04:10.299> to<00:04:10.660> which<00:04:10.989> I'm<00:04:11.260> excited

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
mattifying primer to which I'm excited

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.400 
mattifying primer to which I'm excited
about<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.220> will<00:04:12.519> probably<00:04:12.840> either<00:04:13.840> check<00:04:14.230> it

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
about so I will probably either check it

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.370 
about so I will probably either check it
and<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.250> few<00:04:15.910> hours<00:04:15.940> or<00:04:16.720> I'll<00:04:16.900> put<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.200> down

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
and a few hours or I'll put it down

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.259 
and a few hours or I'll put it down
below<00:04:17.590> like<00:04:17.979> how<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.430> wore<00:04:18.700> through<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.120> day

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269

anyways I will fill you guys in on what
I<00:04:30.430> think<00:04:30.610> as<00:04:31.060> far<00:04:31.090> as<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:32.560> being<00:04:32.860> like<00:04:33.220> a

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
I think as far as it being like a

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.850 
I think as far as it being like a
mattifying<00:04:33.700> primer<00:04:34.120> but<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.080> did<00:04:35.320> like<00:04:35.530> and

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
mattifying primer but I did like and

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.230 
mattifying primer but I did like and
then<00:04:35.950> it's<00:04:36.100> a

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
then it's a

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.110 
then it's a
it<00:04:38.110> did<00:04:38.320> go<00:04:38.470> on<00:04:38.710> easily<00:04:39.130> my<00:04:39.280> foundation<00:04:39.790> of<00:04:39.910> not

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
it did go on easily my foundation of not

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.140 
it did go on easily my foundation of not
easily<00:04:40.449> over<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:41.800> overall<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.759> think<00:04:42.820> it's<00:04:43.060> a

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
easily over it so overall I think it's a

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.330 
easily over it so overall I think it's a
good<00:04:43.270> proper<00:04:43.630> at<00:04:44.530> this<00:04:44.740> point<00:04:45.009> I<00:04:45.100> don't<00:04:45.160> think

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
good proper at this point I don't think

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.310 
good proper at this point I don't think
it's<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:45.669> mirror<00:04:46.120> little<00:04:46.509> primer<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:47.169> I<00:04:47.199> do

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
it's a mirror little primer but I do

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.560 
it's a mirror little primer but I do
think<00:04:47.710> it's<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.919> good<00:04:48.100> primer<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:48.820> that's<00:04:49.419> my

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570
