00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.029
 good find in venezuela state 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.910
 lara in today's we're going to talk about 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.880
 the salt on the carpets is in 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.939
 the muscle fiber and in turn has the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.129
 fine healing filaments and their function 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.030
 main is muscle contraction and 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.030
 muscle relaxation 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.250
 As my partner already explained to me that 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.160
 many like now let's see a 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.530
 illustration for 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.539
 the parts that make up the arcs 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.000
 we can see by doing another 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.000
 illustration the parts make up 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.510
 here in this drawing we can see that 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.730
 this part corresponds to the filaments 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.700
 thick 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.400
 what we observe here corresponds to the 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.920
 fine filaments in the same way 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.659
 they are discotheques on both sides of the fence 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.780
 less 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.719
 you can also visualize what is the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.370
 line m that corresponds to this part that 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:25.430
 I'm indicating 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.340
 if we make a creation 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.659
 both income pines sold that would have 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.549
 as a result in the following 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.900
 this corresponds to what the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.060
 filaments 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.910
 This corresponds to the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.120
 fine treatments and we expanded the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.440
 line m we would be that the line m 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.440
 it corresponds that he is here 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.070
 ok now let's talk about what is the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.470
 band to the band in the central portion 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.810
 Transgenders that remember all the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.810
 length of wright filaments 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.099
 now to continue we have what 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.649
 the band and the band and as you can see 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.220
 in one of which is towards the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.170
 ends and contains the remaining portion 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.870
 of what was fine filaments but 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.319
 not the thick ones and it's clearer and with 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.319
 higher density 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.500
 Now let's look at the band 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.260
 which is in the center of the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.040
 band and that contains only the filaments 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.040
 thick 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.220
 now we have the lines on the line m 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.640
 in the bcp protein that supports both the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.400
 thick filaments in the middle of each 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.019
 low as we can see here or 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.709
 an expanded form in our 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.709
 particular 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.170
 and knowing already that it must be like I do not know 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.050
 find 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.180
 the myofibrils and is the matrix it 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.349
 they find the filaments so if the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.480
 Thin filaments Thick filaments 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.489
 the thick filaments when calcium 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.770
 the reticle is high plastic and 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.680
 comes to these strands joins with the 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.530
 troponin which creates a change with 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.319
 training in it by making it 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.319
 move trocona troponin complexes 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.019
 myosin from the binding sites of the 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.870
 neighbors who are to bother the 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.810
 actin molecule this is going to be your 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.520
 once the contraction occurs 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.620
 muscular 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.690
 exactly when calcium binds to the 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:48.320
 troponin and well this is the explanation 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.120
 about how it happens in the contraction 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.640
 muscle and on the anatomical structure 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.720
 of being eating 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.980
 well this is all this is a material 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.640
 in the process of evaluating the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.140
 college 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.160
 felipe of the animal physiology course 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.160
 thanks for your
