00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.379
 Halli hello and welcome to this 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.480
 video today we would like the times 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.670
 airports look at the yes with the 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.710
 new ipods and iphones 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.050
 come out and are completely from apple 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.490
 designed apple claims that the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.320
 sound quality of this headphones 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.750
 much better than the event 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.119
 and maybe even in just over 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.349
 At least â‚¬ 100 can outdo what 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.790
 the sound is concerned 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.469
 I want to tell you in this video 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.899
 experience with it and also 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.399
 maybe to say if it really is 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.980
 this apple is justified 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.170
 to buy airports as your own headphones 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.550
 a thing that immediately positive 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.290
 it is noticeable that apple finally wants 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.550
 This little carrying box has introduced 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.920
 they were only available on the more expensive ones so far 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.050
 79 euro in ear headphones from apple 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.370
 now he has it by default and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.440
 you can travel on the headphones 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.910
 formerly just nice wind up too 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.620
 this time it is so the remote one 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.120
 extra space had that was at the expensive 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.430
 in ear headphones by apple so far not 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.140
 so the sonic peculiarity of this 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.420
 Apple headphones it is now that held 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.040
 are installed a loudspeaker now 3 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.600
 that means once a headphone 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.880
 loudspeaker broken in yours 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.680
 ear bells go further back 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.320
 because not directly in your goes in and 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.030
 one and they are there for the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.920
 reduce volume loss 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.750
 that means you generally have better ones 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.979
 better of course you have the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.200
 remote this a little bit bigger 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.180
 has also become a hidden 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.040
 microphone the functions are the same 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.229
 Now the microphone is essential 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.909
 better than the previous microphone and 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.470
 thus protected against sweat, too 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.670
 The telekom in front of the apple of her process 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.590
 got really good 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.750
 that means apple has tried on all 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.159
 types of this apple i pods adapt 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.479
 in my opinion that is also the 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.220
 really well done 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.439
 It does not fall out during sports and it 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.900
 just feels more comfortable than that 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.240
 Earlier apple headphones in the ear 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.100
 in the case of reviews, it is 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.450
 relatively difficult to show like that 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.610
 sound quality of the parts really 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.229
 That's why we think it's easy 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.490
 I would not like you anyway 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.159
 say buy through this earphone as 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.540
 single headphones white are quite 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.950
 headphones are better but if you are 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.110
 it now for free with the iphone or 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.640
 ipod gets them in any case the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.500
 Basses are really much better than 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.280
 so far and the whole does not sound 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.989
 more so tinny 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.819
 So it's a big update from the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.439
 previous apple headphones apple 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.780
 headphones gladly uses for that it is 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.340
 Of course, in terms of investment as well 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.410
 The microphone is also always pretty nice 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.730
 and I definitely like the headphones 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.960
 Then, as always, thank you to for 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.550

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.990

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.310
