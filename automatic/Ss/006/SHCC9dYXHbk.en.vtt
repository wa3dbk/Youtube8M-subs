00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
360 RTS games we were able to add

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.120 
360 RTS games we were able to add
something<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.870> was<00:02:41.960> really<00:02:42.350> amazing<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
something that was really amazing the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.980 
something that was really amazing the
team<00:02:43.340> came<00:02:43.550> up<00:02:43.640> with<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:43.790> great<00:02:44.210> idea<00:02:44.240> for<00:02:44.930> a

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
team came up with this great idea for a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.750 
team came up with this great idea for a
command<00:02:45.440> stick<00:02:45.680> interface<00:02:46.100> which<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.730> a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
command stick interface which is a

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.520 
command stick interface which is a
radial<00:02:47.270> interface<00:02:47.660> right<00:02:48.050> around<00:02:48.290> that

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
radial interface right around that

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.710 
radial interface right around that
reticule<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.459> builds<00:02:49.940> upon<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.300> idea<00:02:50.600> that

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
reticule so it builds upon the idea that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.880 
reticule so it builds upon the idea that
you're<00:02:50.870> looking<00:02:51.290> at<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.470> world<00:02:51.680> you're

you're looking at the world you're

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
focused on that unit and now when you

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.090 
focused on that unit and now when you
bring<00:02:54.020> up<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.200> command<00:02:54.530> stick<00:02:54.800> you're<00:02:54.950> able

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
bring up the command stick you're able

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.190 
bring up the command stick you're able
to<00:02:55.130> quickly<00:02:55.370> see<00:02:55.910> what<00:02:56.510> all<00:02:56.630> your<00:02:56.810> commands
