at the stats on the card that the thing

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.949 
at the stats on the card that the thing
that<00:03:02.310> intrigued<00:03:02.670> me<00:03:03.090> about<00:03:03.240> this<00:03:03.540> card<00:03:03.810> and

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.390 
that intrigued me about this card and
the<00:03:04.020> thing<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.410> really<00:03:04.620> really<00:03:04.980> wanted<00:03:05.280> to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the thing that I really really wanted to

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.449 
the thing that I really really wanted to
test<00:03:05.670> were<00:03:06.270> his<00:03:06.540> throw<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.410> run<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.980> his

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
test were his throw on the run and his

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.310 
test were his throw on the run and his
getting<00:03:08.970> outside<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.510> pocket<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.050> making

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
getting outside of the pocket and making

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.800 
getting outside of the pocket and making
plays<00:03:10.850> unfortunately<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:11.880> found<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.540> that

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
plays unfortunately I found that that

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.920 
plays unfortunately I found that that
was<00:03:13.080> not<00:03:13.410> very<00:03:13.680> good<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.220> was<00:03:14.490> very<00:03:14.930> troubling

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
was not very good it was very troubling

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.770 
was not very good it was very troubling
or<00:03:16.170> very<00:03:16.380> hard<00:03:16.740> very<00:03:16.890> difficult<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:18.240> get<00:03:18.540> him

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
or very hard very difficult to get him

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.949 
or very hard very difficult to get him
to<00:03:18.990> move<00:03:19.170> around<00:03:19.410> he<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.580> too<00:03:20.850> slow<00:03:21.600> I

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
to move around he is just too slow I

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.470 
to move around he is just too slow I
know<00:03:22.680> Ben<00:03:23.130> Roethlisberger<00:03:24.030> isn't<00:03:24.390> the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
know Ben Roethlisberger isn't the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.180 
know Ben Roethlisberger isn't the
fastest<00:03:24.989> person<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.500> real<00:03:25.650> life<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:25.920> I<00:03:26.130> feel

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
fastest person in real life but I feel

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.250 
fastest person in real life but I feel
like<00:03:26.430> he<00:03:26.790> makes<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.150> lot<00:03:27.330> more<00:03:27.360> plays<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:28.080> his

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
like he makes a lot more plays with his

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.680 
like he makes a lot more plays with his
legs<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.830> real<00:03:29.400> life<00:03:29.640> than<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.940> was<00:03:30.090> able<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.510> do

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
legs in real life than I was able to do

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.680 
legs in real life than I was able to do
in<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:30.989> game<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.650> felt<00:03:32.130> like<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:33.209> game

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
in this game it just felt like the game

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.680 
in this game it just felt like the game
was<00:03:34.230> frozen<00:03:34.709> or<00:03:35.190> glitching<00:03:35.970> or<00:03:36.269> lagging

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
was frozen or glitching or lagging

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.560 
was frozen or glitching or lagging
anytime<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.800> tried<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.280> make<00:03:38.310> any<00:03:38.730> lateral

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
anytime I tried to make any lateral

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.229 
anytime I tried to make any lateral
movements<00:03:40.470> with<00:03:40.709> him<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.610> was<00:03:41.790> never<00:03:42.000> able

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
movements with him and I was never able

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.000 
movements with him and I was never able
to<00:03:42.420> fully<00:03:42.750> test<00:03:43.050> out<00:03:43.320> his<00:03:43.350> throw<00:03:43.769> on<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.980> run

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
to fully test out his throw on the run

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.250 
to fully test out his throw on the run
this<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.519> probably<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.000> only<00:03:45.360> example<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.110> I

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
this is probably the only example that I

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.680 
this is probably the only example that I
really<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.800> for<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.310> but<00:03:47.790> as<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:47.970> said<00:03:48.180> he

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
really have for you but as I said he

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.720 
really have for you but as I said he
moves<00:03:48.959> at<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> snails<00:03:49.380> pace<00:03:49.799> it's<00:03:50.250> just<00:03:50.519> pretty

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
moves at a snails pace it's just pretty

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.880 
moves at a snails pace it's just pretty
difficult<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.840> things<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.440> did<00:03:52.680> like

just things 30 40 50 yards down the
field<00:04:23.760> there<00:04:24.510> were<00:04:24.630> really<00:04:24.930> bad<00:04:25.470> times<00:04:25.979> where

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
field there were really bad times where

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.550 
field there were really bad times where
he<00:04:26.400> was<00:04:26.580> horribly<00:04:27.120> inaccurate<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.350> ball

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
he was horribly inaccurate and the ball

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.710 
he was horribly inaccurate and the ball
didn't<00:04:29.010> seem<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.430> project<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.510> way<00:04:30.690> I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
didn't seem to project the way I

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.450 
didn't seem to project the way I
expected<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.590> with<00:04:31.860> somebody<00:04:32.220> in<00:04:32.370> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
expected it to with somebody in the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.399 
expected it to with somebody in the
upper<00:04:32.760> 90<00:04:33.120> throwing<00:04:33.599> power<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:34.080> with

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
upper 90 throwing power you with

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.049 
upper 90 throwing power you with
that<00:04:34.649> you'd<00:04:34.800> be<00:04:34.949> able<00:04:34.979> to<00:04:35.159> loft<00:04:35.429> the<00:04:35.610> ball<00:04:35.639> down

00:04:36.049 --> 00:04:36.059 
that you'd be able to loft the ball down

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:37.939 
that you'd be able to loft the ball down
the<00:04:36.239> field<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:37.050> like<00:04:37.349> I<00:04:37.469> said<00:04:37.529> there<00:04:37.889> were

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
the field and like I said there were

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.919 
the field and like I said there were
just<00:04:38.129> some<00:04:38.369> cases<00:04:38.879> where<00:04:39.059> I<00:04:39.089> did<00:04:39.389> not<00:04:39.599> find

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:39.929 
just some cases where I did not find

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:42.439 
just some cases where I did not find
that<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.409> be<00:04:40.559> true<00:04:40.589> so<00:04:41.159> if<00:04:41.339> you're<00:04:41.759> a<00:04:41.849> long<00:04:42.089> ball

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
that to be true so if you're a long ball

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.939 
that to be true so if you're a long ball
person<00:04:42.989> if<00:04:43.110> you're<00:04:43.229> trying<00:04:43.439> to<00:04:43.589> throw<00:04:43.830> the

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:45.779 
deep ball trying to throw streaks you

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:47.449 
deep ball trying to throw streaks you
just<00:04:46.080> want<00:04:46.289> to<00:04:46.349> be<00:04:46.499> a<00:04:46.529> little<00:04:46.800> aware<00:04:47.159> of<00:04:47.189> that

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:47.459 
just want to be a little aware of that

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:48.859 
just want to be a little aware of that
especially<00:04:48.089> if<00:04:48.179> you're<00:04:48.330> throwing<00:04:48.539> into

00:04:48.859 --> 00:04:48.869 
especially if you're throwing into

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:50.059 
especially if you're throwing into
double<00:04:49.169> coverage<00:04:49.199> where<00:04:49.709> there<00:04:49.860> might<00:04:50.009> be

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
double coverage where there might be

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.769 
double coverage where there might be
some<00:04:50.399> safety<00:04:50.639> help<00:04:50.999> because<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.419> just<00:04:51.509> felt

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:51.779 
some safety help because it just felt

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:53.959 
some safety help because it just felt
like<00:04:51.839> the<00:04:51.959> ball<00:04:52.289> hung<00:04:52.979> up<00:04:53.129> in<00:04:53.279> the<00:04:53.429> air<00:04:53.639> and

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
like the ball hung up in the air and

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.389 
like the ball hung up in the air and
didn't<00:04:54.539> really<00:04:54.659> have<00:04:54.989> any<00:04:55.229> type<00:04:55.559> of<00:04:55.589> distance

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:56.399 
didn't really have any type of distance

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.820 
didn't really have any type of distance
on<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.639> and<00:04:56.969> that<00:04:57.419> was<00:04:57.629> really<00:04:57.869> frustrating<00:04:58.649> so

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
on it and that was really frustrating so

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.919
