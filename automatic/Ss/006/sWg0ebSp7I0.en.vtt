00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
rinsed these raw organic almonds and I'm

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.410 
rinsed these raw organic almonds and I'm
going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> add<00:00:40.490> about<00:00:41.490> a<00:00:41.610> teaspoon<00:00:41.880> of

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
going to add about a teaspoon of

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.080 
going to add about a teaspoon of
Himalayan<00:00:42.600> sea<00:00:43.260> salt<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.340> soak<00:00:44.820> them

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
Himalayan sea salt and then soak them

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.440 
Himalayan sea salt and then soak them
for<00:00:45.330> eight<00:00:45.570> hours<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.080> filtered<00:00:47.040> water<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
for eight hours in filtered water this

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.350 
for eight hours in filtered water this
is<00:00:48.870> about<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> two-day<00:00:51.260> process<00:00:52.970> but<00:00:53.970> well

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
is about a two-day process but well

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.960 
is about a two-day process but well
worth<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.120> my<00:00:57.150> two<00:00:57.450> big<00:00:57.960> bowls<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
worth it so here are my two big bowls of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.110 
worth it so here are my two big bowls of
almonds<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.120> these<00:01:01.050> are<00:01:01.290> going<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.560> soak

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
almonds and these are going to soak

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.999 
almonds and these are going to soak
overnight<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.510> eight<00:01:03.690> hours<00:01:03.930> benefit<00:01:04.829> of<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
overnight for eight hours benefit of the

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.050 
overnight for eight hours benefit of the
salt<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.609> the<00:01:06.179> water<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:07.109> to<00:01:07.590> help<00:01:08.060> germinate

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
salt and the water is to help germinate

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.020 
salt and the water is to help germinate
the<00:01:09.210> seed<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.409> both<00:01:10.590> work<00:01:10.920> together<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the seed and they both work together to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.499 
the seed and they both work together to
deactivate<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:13.619> enzyme<00:01:14.219> inhibitors<00:01:15.119> that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
deactivate the enzyme inhibitors that

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.919 
deactivate the enzyme inhibitors that
are<00:01:15.899> found<00:01:16.289> in<00:01:16.679> almond<00:01:17.609> good<00:01:17.909> morning<00:01:18.329> so<00:01:18.600> it's

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 
are found in almond good morning so it's

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.249 
are found in almond good morning so it's
been<00:01:19.289> just<00:01:19.320> over<00:01:20.009> eight<00:01:20.189> hours<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:21.259> our

to our bodies and when nuts and seeds
are<00:01:42.509> sprouted<00:01:43.139> they<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:44.039> better<00:01:45.229> toasted<00:01:46.229> or

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
are sprouted they are better toasted or

digestive as opposed to them being in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.950 
digestive as opposed to them being in
the<00:01:50.369> raw<00:01:50.639> state<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.539> of<00:01:51.569> them<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the raw state because of them a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.969 
the raw state because of them a
different

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
different

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.630 
different
here's<00:01:54.979> just<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.310> quick<00:01:55.490> look<00:01:56.590> at<00:01:57.590> what<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.189> raw

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
here's just a quick look at what a raw

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.359 
here's just a quick look at what a raw
almond<00:01:59.540> looks<00:01:59.720> like<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.590> can<00:02:00.740> still<00:02:01.040> see<00:02:01.220> it's

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
almond looks like you can still see it's

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.670 
almond looks like you can still see it's
nice<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.549> plump<00:02:02.270> those<00:02:02.780> almonds<00:02:03.200> were<00:02:03.380> from

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
nice and plump those almonds were from

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.460 
nice and plump those almonds were from
you<00:02:04.460> paya<00:02:04.729> naturals<00:02:05.390> which<00:02:05.899> is<00:02:06.049> where<00:02:06.200> we<00:02:06.320> also

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
you paya naturals which is where we also

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.100 
you paya naturals which is where we also
got<00:02:07.220> our<00:02:07.430> dehydrator<00:02:08.420> foam<00:02:08.660> which<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:08.989> where

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
got our dehydrator foam which is where

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.479 
got our dehydrator foam which is where
they're<00:02:09.229> gonna<00:02:09.289> be<00:02:09.410> dehydrated<00:02:10.099> living

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
they're gonna be dehydrated living

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.210 
they're gonna be dehydrated living
enzymes<00:02:10.640> are<00:02:11.269> both<00:02:12.220> pH<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.519> heat<00:02:14.390> sensitive

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
enzymes are both pH and heat sensitive

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.610 
enzymes are both pH and heat sensitive
so<00:02:16.690> anything<00:02:17.690> over<00:02:17.810> 118<00:02:18.640> will<00:02:19.640> actually<00:02:20.620> kill

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
so anything over 118 will actually kill

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.259 
so anything over 118 will actually kill
them<00:02:21.800> destroy<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> enzymes<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.970> enzymes

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
them destroy the enzymes for the enzymes

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.530 
them destroy the enzymes for the enzymes
that<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.230> our<00:02:24.980> dehydrator<00:02:25.640> set<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.269> below

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
that so our dehydrator set just below

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.949 
that so our dehydrator set just below
118<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.500> these<00:02:28.370> are<00:02:28.519> going<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.790> dehydrate<00:02:28.970> for

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
118 and these are going to dehydrate for

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:37.390 
118 and these are going to dehydrate for
anywhere<00:02:30.680> between<00:02:30.890> 6<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.880> 12<00:02:32.480> hours<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:37.280> when

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
anywhere between 6 to 12 hours so when

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400 
anywhere between 6 to 12 hours so when
all<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.670> trays<00:02:37.910> are<00:02:38.120> done

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.580 

off<00:02:41.040> them<00:02:41.520> in<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:42.030> our<00:02:42.090> dehydrator<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.320> we'll

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
off them in to our dehydrator and we'll

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.059 
off them in to our dehydrator and we'll
see<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.010> six<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.790> twelve<00:02:45.060> hours

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069

mentioned now I'll show you how to do it

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.360 
mentioned now I'll show you how to do it
in<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.620> food<00:04:45.770> processor

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
in the food processor

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.409 
in the food processor
oh<00:04:46.520> yes<00:04:47.270> food<00:04:47.630> processor<00:04:48.789> this<00:04:49.789> is<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.090> bit<00:04:50.270> of<00:04:50.360> a

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
oh yes food processor this is a bit of a

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.189 
oh yes food processor this is a bit of a
longer<00:04:50.659> process<00:04:52.539> it<00:04:53.539> takes<00:04:53.659> about<00:04:53.840> ten

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
longer process it takes about ten

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.820 
longer process it takes about ten
minutes<00:04:54.229> but<00:04:55.219> don't<00:04:55.400> get<00:04:55.490> discouraged<00:04:55.610> and

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
minutes but don't get discouraged and

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.719 
minutes but don't get discouraged and
basically<00:04:57.830> you're<00:04:58.010> just<00:04:58.039> letting<00:04:58.639> the

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
basically you're just letting the

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.529 
basically you're just letting the
almonds<00:05:00.190> form<00:05:01.190> or<00:05:01.669> bring<00:05:01.940> out<00:05:02.029> their<00:05:02.150> natural

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
almonds form or bring out their natural

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:15.190 
almonds form or bring out their natural
oils<00:05:02.659> so<00:05:03.409> in

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.960 

we're<00:05:16.200> five<00:05:16.560> minutes<00:05:16.590> in<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.640> can<00:05:17.790> see

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
we're five minutes in and you can see

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.290 
we're five minutes in and you can see
all<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.390> natural<00:05:18.750> oil<00:05:19.910> starting<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:21.090> come

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
all the natural oil starting to come

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.910 
all the natural oil starting to come
through<00:05:22.640> still<00:05:23.640> not<00:05:23.850> there<00:05:24.090> yet<00:05:24.530> ten<00:05:25.530> minutes

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
through still not there yet ten minutes

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.570 
through still not there yet ten minutes
and<00:05:26.570> we<00:05:27.570> are<00:05:27.720> almost<00:05:27.990> there<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.890> mean<00:05:29.460> each

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
and we are almost there I mean each

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.550 
and we are almost there I mean each
blender<00:05:30.060> is<00:05:30.270> gonna<00:05:30.480> be<00:05:30.630> different<00:05:30.840> but<00:05:31.320> I

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
blender is gonna be different but I

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.600 
blender is gonna be different but I
think<00:05:32.430> I'd<00:05:32.760> like<00:05:32.910> it<00:05:32.940> just<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.300> little<00:05:33.390> smoother

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
think I'd like it just a little smoother

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.580 
think I'd like it just a little smoother
what<00:05:35.610> do<00:05:35.670> you<00:05:35.760> think<00:05:35.970> sure<00:05:39.320> what<00:05:40.320> do<00:05:40.380> you<00:05:40.470> boys

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
think oh and I will add so we're at 12

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.270 
think oh and I will add so we're at 12
minutes<00:05:55.020> now<00:05:55.290> and<00:05:55.650> I<00:05:55.710> think<00:05:55.920> I'm<00:05:56.010> just<00:05:56.160> gonna

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
minutes now and I think I'm just gonna

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.730 
minutes now and I think I'm just gonna
stop<00:05:56.640> here<00:05:57.050> again<00:05:58.050> you<00:05:58.140> can<00:05:58.260> adjust<00:05:58.560> it<00:05:58.710> to

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
stop here again you can adjust it to

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.130 
stop here again you can adjust it to
your<00:05:59.390> to<00:06:00.390> your<00:06:00.510> palate<00:06:02.570> if<00:06:03.570> you'd<00:06:03.750> like<00:06:03.900> it's

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
your to your palate if you'd like it's

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.060 
your to your palate if you'd like it's
smoother<00:06:04.620> then<00:06:05.370> just<00:06:05.700> keep<00:06:05.970> blending<00:06:06.770> but<00:06:07.770> it

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
smoother then just keep blending but it

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.920 
smoother then just keep blending but it
is<00:06:08.190> getting<00:06:08.460> warm<00:06:08.820> so<00:06:08.940> I<00:06:09.240> want<00:06:09.540> to<00:06:09.630> stop
