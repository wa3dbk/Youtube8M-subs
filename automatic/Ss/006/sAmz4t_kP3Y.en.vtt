00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.480
 a little lost time I hope it is not 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:37.260
 too late and I bring you a recipe 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.079
 from a paste that is very light 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.600
 that low in calories but tastes like 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.739
 I had so many, so I hope that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 they share that they like and they are not 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.300
 forget that also where is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.429

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:59.249
 a little bit more of me also there are the 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:01.969
 month leave we hope to see more often 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.969
 we see 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.430
 we started with the ingredients of this 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.759
 pasta and we're going to need a cup of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.710
 This pasta is integral that we are going to 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.960
 put to boil while we perform 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.560
 our sauce for the sauce we need 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:28.380
 chicken or beef broth white wine 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.289
 spinach basil mushrooms 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 we also need ricotta cheese or 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.740
 curd 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.829
 Onion or this one called health 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.530
 and we started chopping our onion to 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.040
 our finite room 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.439
 very finite and that we are going to put 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.230
 sautÃ© with a few teaspoons of oil 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.510
 olive 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.510
 together with the mushrooms 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.530
 here we are going to add white wine 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.960
 it has to be dry let's let it 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.170
 reduce and we will also add in 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.260
 this time the pepper and the salt to 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.260
 taste 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.560
 all 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:42.190
 since we see that our wine was reduced 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.740
 let's add the basil in pieces to 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.970
 I like it that way but good 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.160
 and we also add our broth 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.160
 chicken or beef 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.160
 Y 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.849
 we also add our ricotta cheese 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.850
 without fat or if they do not find it can be 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:19.460
 cottage cheese we mix very very well 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:23.030
 to incorporate the cheese in our 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.030
 salsita that we already had 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.840
 and now and finally we add the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.840
 spinach 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.270
 we're also going to need a breast of 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.440
 chicken around 100 grams the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.670
 we are going to cut into cubes and we're going 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:59.700
 to fry in a teaspoon of oil 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.769
 olive we're going 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.120
 salpimentar our chick and we're going to 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.120
 let cook 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.549
 ah 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.610
 Y 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.610
 to me 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:47.090
 once ready we are going to add it to 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.060
 our ready mix 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.370
 and we are going to incorporate the chick with 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.320
 our card and that we are going to add 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.030
 the pasta that we had previously 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.060
 caught 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.770
 and all that we are going to mix very very 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.260
 well and we 're going to leave it about two or three 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.110
 minutes again on the fire so that it 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.160
 incorporate all those flavors and ready 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.870
 so our pasta is light and 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.300
 very much tasted the truth that if 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.030
 I recommend them do not forget to give 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.570
