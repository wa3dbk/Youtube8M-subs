actually<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> same<00:01:31.380> ECU<00:01:31.860> connector<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
actually have the same ECU connector and

actually have the same ECU connector and
a<00:01:32.579> very<00:01:32.909> very<00:01:33.180> similar<00:01:33.450> ECU<00:01:34.049> pinout<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.070> if

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
a very very similar ECU pinout so if

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.429 
a very very similar ECU pinout so if
you've<00:01:35.729> got<00:01:35.820> an<00:01:35.939> S<00:01:36.060> 50<00:01:36.420> if<00:01:36.750> you're<00:01:37.020> converting

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you've got an S 50 if you're converting

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.030 
you've got an S 50 if you're converting

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
really simple pin swap you can just

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.139 
really simple pin swap you can just
email<00:01:42.869> support<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.829> haltech<00:01:44.399> will<00:01:44.880> tell<00:01:45.090> you
