six the previous time on lane four like

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.419 
six the previous time on lane four like
not<00:01:50.379> only<00:01:50.500> did<00:01:50.649> he<00:01:50.739> force<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.069> shot<00:01:51.250> but<00:01:51.369> he

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
not only did he force the shot but he

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.589 
not only did he force the shot but he
was<00:01:51.549> like<00:01:51.700> he<00:01:51.849> had<00:01:51.879> made<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.149> move<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.509> he

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
was like he had made a move and he

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.119 
was like he had made a move and he
wasn't<00:01:52.750> confident<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.439> right<00:01:53.590> move<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:53.979> so

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:54.129 
wasn't confident the right move and so

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:55.469 
wasn't confident the right move and so
he<00:01:54.219> was<00:01:54.340> kind<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.759> tentative<00:01:55.390> release

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
he was kind of a tentative release

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.089 
he was kind of a tentative release
instead<00:01:56.259> of<00:01:56.349> going<00:01:56.530> through<00:01:56.679> it<00:01:56.829> like<00:01:56.950> that

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
instead of going through it like that

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
Rick Ward can still get to 245 so it's

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.090 
Rick Ward can still get to 245 so it's
not<00:03:19.950> over<00:03:21.200> one<00:03:22.200> more<00:03:22.350> strike<00:03:22.650> would<00:03:22.800> lock<00:03:22.950> it
