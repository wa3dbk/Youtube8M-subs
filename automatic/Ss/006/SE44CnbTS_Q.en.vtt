00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.719 
doing this because my low point isn't
far<00:01:37.030> off<00:01:37.060> where<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.599> ball<00:01:37.810> is<00:01:37.990> anyway

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
far off where that ball is anyway

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.770 
far off where that ball is anyway
so<00:01:39.729> I<00:01:39.759> catch<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.149> ball<00:01:40.240> slightly<00:01:40.420> clean

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
so I catch the ball slightly clean

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.870 
so I catch the ball slightly clean
because<00:01:41.649> I<00:01:41.679> have<00:01:41.979> started<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.459> bottom<00:01:42.729> out

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
because I have started to bottom out

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.550 
because I have started to bottom out
almost<00:01:43.209> come<00:01:43.360> up<00:01:43.509> at<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.750> point<00:01:43.990> but<00:01:44.440> it's

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
almost come up at that point but it's

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.589 
almost come up at that point but it's
not<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.920> much<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.429> a<00:01:45.640> race<00:01:45.940> for<00:01:46.240> me<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.450> get

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
not that much of a race for me to get

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.419 
not that much of a race for me to get
across<00:01:46.780> down<00:01:47.020> no<00:01:47.319> skull<00:01:47.709> firs<00:01:47.890> who<00:01:48.009> struggle

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
across down no skull firs who struggle

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.190 
across down no skull firs who struggle
with<00:01:48.459> hitting<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.239> ground<00:01:49.390> first<00:01:49.750> put<00:01:50.140> the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
with hitting the ground first put the

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.300 
with hitting the ground first put the
ball<00:01:50.319> up<00:01:50.440> there<00:01:50.530> first<00:01:50.800> got<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.039> shops<00:01:51.220> they

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
ball up there first got the shops they

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.949 
ball up there first got the shops they
just<00:01:51.489> can't<00:01:51.670> hit<00:01:51.849> it<00:01:51.880> they<00:01:52.450> think<00:01:52.690> they<00:01:52.780> can't

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
just can't hit it they think they can't

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:54.089

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
get their head around it but you keep

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:55.620 
get their head around it but you keep
asking<00:01:54.550> to<00:01:54.580> chase<00:01:54.910> that<00:01:55.060> ball<00:01:55.209> and<00:01:55.330> they<00:01:55.390> get

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630
