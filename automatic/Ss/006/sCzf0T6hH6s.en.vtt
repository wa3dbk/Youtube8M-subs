 above 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.390
 sport that goes above but they 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.239
 have worked at training the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.430
 Strasbourg's perrin is there the share

 against 3 jeans slim soap that loses 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.390
 stupidly this ball hits her at ground level 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.900
 has more trouble with the onslaught of taxes 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.309
 time is behind a tiny and that 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.600
 returns to lakes belhameur abdelhak 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.940
 but the berle between the surface has not 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.420
 given the sea the fault to a new 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.670
 grid head even lhermitte who looks 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.750
 his watch and it's half time here at 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.750
 stadium of colmar 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.520
 and messi it will center of August sheaves 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.310
 in the morning at the blue salon last months 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.680
 march and maybe not finished that beautiful and 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.240
 it is the parade of mensah is a duel 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.550
 between them to the iam we pay attention 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.550
 maybe at its center in withdrawal is the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.410
 withdrawal around the surface was going 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.360
 maybe there this center kidnapped the little 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.220
 city ​​at the far post he still has to 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.470
 and always 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.000
 it misses out on geely bio gauthier 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.970
 pinaud right side around the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.510
 surface gauthier pinaud file above 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.130
 of goal goals of gauthier pinaud 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.640
 gauthier pinaud who comes to reduce the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.880
 Mark 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.110
 and if in stadium of colmar if you him 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.120
 my coaching role I think it's 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.830
 a match or at least people it's 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.630
 it seems to me people have feasted 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.070
 tonight I would have preferred to reward 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.480
 all Strasbourg fans who 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.940
 have been following us for so long 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.230
 with so much who make the sacrifice 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.310
 with the outputs in cfa2 and we know 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.120
 phase some do not leave in 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.489
 holidays to do all this 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.100
 they only wanted for them 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.410
 do something today but 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.150
 which at home want the team since 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.220
 a long time except we are in trouble 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.680
 but I especially in deficit of success 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.080
 tonight is good because we take 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.780
 three points after a derby this is 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.640
 always take off now I think that 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.210
 first of all you have witnessed a good 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.710
 football match 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.750
 I think that was holding back instead of 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.880
 to find out what is going to be 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.710
 the top on the other no no one is of 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.110
 far not partner but we are not on 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.060
 is not opponents here I think that 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.890
 the idea is to remember that it was a 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.140
 nice football game I hope to match 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.000
 back we will be in situations a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.290
 a little more cool preferable and two 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.400
 teams so we can again 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.400
 make a nice football match
