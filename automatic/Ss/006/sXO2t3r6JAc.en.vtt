00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:15.239
 keistad viewers today in the test one of the nicest cars to drive themselves 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.179
 or to belong in the past 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.110
 would have there 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.110
 indicate the Mercedes S 65 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.859
 yes much better than this, although it is not the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.460
 all all all 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.090
 the most expensive the most luxurious 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120
 with the exhibition 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.060
 the 612 hp twelve cylinders 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.260
 just sit back in the back 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 he is therefore not punishable 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.740
 the warm kind of course a bmw 7 audi a8 l lexus that of course recently 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.740
 but have always been boss above boss after this is really there 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.340
 no car they take everywhere 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.070
 respect wonder that this Christmas season is the declarant and certainly with the in fact 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.930
 is over 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.350
 pity is that you are sector of this car a 20 year is more to tell about 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.470
 the respect that you get in this car yes the sector up the forerunner 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.580
 People who are on the side turn you look inside and how are you dealing with 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.710
 Buying 1000 minutes to ride the right foot is a bit like that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.700
 to hold back precisely at this not everyone tipped out as a young twenties 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.280
 that the swiss wheel spin 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 it shows that tasty 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.420
 it did these March 2007 outfits, it has already walked 75,000 miles 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.290
 is really insane 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.360
 is there already a little expensive than a ton still buys gray car he laughs at himself 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.970
 well he is in all and 6 and 6 2 turnovers within a year 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.409
 yes I think without the pieces she will leave the rebels and then they would 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.579
 it totally 35,000 euros last year has put the senses the oldest in 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.970
 can drive both directions nicely to win 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.190
 acquainted with 60,000 animals to replace that is also a bit of soil 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.420
 in addition, they have cost 75,000 euros this racing class in normal version and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.929
 a 23rd edition 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:15.329
 I actually have yes 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.419
 a bit against that were agreement with the thick fenders and a bit bigger max 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.659
 With this to implementation it seems that should be consistent with all of those 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.439
 situation that thick twenty institutions so that nice on whipped up you and others 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.179
 black weird but nicely blinded 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:33.799
 also that thick black color 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.879
 it is a chinese car with a basically everything together 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.200
 I think that's wrong though 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.639
 it is also true again what I find a k 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.779
 almost a third fewer subjects 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:46.779
 are so neat in the Netherlands 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:01.249
 especially families and even just behind the wheel of the fen in short that I created 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:05.379
 have three from the cl 65 amg one but this is still a bit different he is 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.989
 just a little nicer 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.269
 yes and why because this is a son yes this is a more luxurious than this I think exists 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.219
 not in 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.089
 yes those flags that are really great 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:20.309
 that actually again it's all stubborn band located on a map version 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:25.949
 and as far as I know this is the only owner who has a red cross 65 how 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.389
 as long as this record has been ordered and yes really everything and everyone is after you 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.389
 staring there would be a birthday 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:36.989
 my 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.989
 to 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:42.709
 9 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.289
 for the new digits than zero to a hundred come here four seconds 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:51.589
 even five kilometers per hour well the top is limited 26 weighs a kilo 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:52.319
 total 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.519
 3 thousands of second convoy 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.579
 every number is just 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.699
 there are less this is just literally 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.699
 because of its smoothness, yes, yes, it is also the flagship 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.689
 the car is actually there they gay parade 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 oh what does it matter 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.400
 earlier this year a regional system that is not standard is the kick-off built in 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.190
 And what actually happened to be many cameras that were continuous for the rear 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.039
 register everything one in four hours so it makes us say they had it 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.800
 then full and then the world starts round 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.880
 If you are like nobody ever a little bit I hope that someone has a collision then 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.879
 deventer zwolle had happened 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 so 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.439
 singer has 65 amg 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.569
 the tastiest of nes reason why they are the tastiest because me 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:05.279
 just this 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.969
 nice the a nice find it a nice day 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:09.460
 and that cost halves 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.280
 So a lot of money is still three tonnes costs the standard on Dutch 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.699
 license plate you want all the options as on this are certainly three 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:17.409
 and half 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.940
 but this is a belgian license plate sets a game of bpm 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.150
 what to 50,000 euros 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.620
 they already open the books 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.389
 the car lands twice the day that this car was a bit mats of it 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.230
 everything was and of course that is 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.530
 but with those flags and tinted windows in this color I actually have one 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.949
 and dreamed crazy 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.819
 you may not really like it all in a row, why it is just that 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.319
 it's nice though 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.710
 I enjoy myself a lot bit by bit 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.349
 see you next year
