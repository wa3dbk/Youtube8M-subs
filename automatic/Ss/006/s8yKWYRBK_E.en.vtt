when you pass a certain threshold you
can<00:01:07.680> use<00:01:07.830> points<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.490> things<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
like if you've got like six hundred

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.720 
like if you've got like six hundred
points<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.710> buy<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.070> honor<00:01:14.340> dollars

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
points and you buy like honor dollars

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.340 
points and you buy like honor dollars
worth<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.970> stuff<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.480> there's<00:01:15.690> something

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
worth of stuff and there's something

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.280 
worth of stuff and there's something
that's<00:01:16.500> 20<00:01:16.950> points<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.370> could<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:18.229> when<00:01:19.229> we

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that's 20 points you could get when we

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.929 
that's 20 points you could get when we
do<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> math<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:20.490> thirty<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
do the math here like you get thirty of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.310 
do the math here like you get thirty of
them<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> wanted<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.750> there's<00:01:21.899> no<00:01:22.020> limit

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
them if you wanted to there's no limit

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.679 
them if you wanted to there's no limit
on<00:01:22.439> how<00:01:22.619> many<00:01:22.680> rewards<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:24.030> once<00:01:24.600> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
on how many rewards you can get once you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.389 
on how many rewards you can get once you
cross<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.140> minimum<00:01:25.500> threshold<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.220> have

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
cross that minimum threshold if you have

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.069 
cross that minimum threshold if you have
the<00:01:26.520> points<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> pretty<00:01:27.899> neat

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
the points for it so it's a pretty neat

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.780 
the points for it so it's a pretty neat
program<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.619> without<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.460> into<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.729> too

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
program and without going into it too

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.330 
program and without going into it too
much<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.630> let<00:01:30.810> me<00:01:30.899> get<00:01:31.079> with<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.159> most

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
much and let me get with one of my most

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.030 
much and let me get with one of my most
recent<00:01:32.520> purchases<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.119> got<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:34.040> Megatron

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
recent purchases I got to this Megatron

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.630 
recent purchases I got to this Megatron
for<00:01:35.250> free<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.509> any<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.350> bad<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.280> think

use of this mold which makes sense since

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.010 
use of this mold which makes sense since
that<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.159> was<00:01:44.280> designed<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.180> but

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that so it was designed to be but

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.410 
that so it was designed to be but
there's<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> nice<00:01:47.130> G<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.520> Megatron<00:01:47.789> homage<00:01:48.180> it's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
there's a nice G to Megatron homage it's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
there's a nice G to Megatron homage it's
not<00:01:48.600> bad<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.939> sword<00:01:51.180> does<00:01:51.450> come<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.560> still

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
not bad the sword does come if it still

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.260 
not bad the sword does come if it still
as<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> little<00:01:53.700> bit<00:01:53.939> what's<00:01:54.119> not

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
as you can see a little bit what's not

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
effort you take here and you want to

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.110 
effort you take here and you want to
push<00:04:42.730> it<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.270> pops<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.660> head<00:04:43.810> up<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:46.000> it

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
push it so it pops the head up and it

hands<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:45.779> not<00:05:45.930> be<00:05:46.110> quite<00:05:46.259> so<00:05:46.560> tight<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:47.099> not

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
hands to not be quite so tight and not

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.540 
hands to not be quite so tight and not
risk<00:05:48.680> snapping<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.770> hands<00:05:50.009> popping<00:05:50.460> the

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
risk snapping the hands popping the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.230 
risk snapping the hands popping the
sword<00:05:50.819> in<00:05:50.969> so<00:05:51.120> that's<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.419> bonus<00:05:51.539> I<00:05:51.840> guess<00:05:52.020> but

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
sword in so that's a bonus I guess but

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.149 
sword in so that's a bonus I guess but
all<00:05:54.240> in<00:05:54.360> all<00:05:54.479> like<00:05:54.659> I<00:05:54.960> have<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.710> close<00:05:55.889> this<00:05:55.979> up

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
all in all like I have to close this up

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.010 
all in all like I have to close this up
hold<00:05:56.550> it<00:05:56.669> and<00:05:56.819> pull<00:05:56.969> up<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.120> side<00:05:57.449> so<00:05:57.719> it's<00:05:57.870> not

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
hold it and pull up the side so it's not

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.700 
hold it and pull up the side so it's not
visible<00:05:58.560> sticking<00:05:58.919> up<00:05:59.009> out<00:05:59.099> of<00:05:59.129> the<00:05:59.250> top<00:05:59.430> and

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
visible sticking up out of the top and

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.990 
visible sticking up out of the top and
like<00:06:01.710> I<00:06:01.740> said<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:02.099> head<00:06:02.279> sculpt<00:06:02.639> here<00:06:02.819> is

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
like I said the head sculpt here is

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.080 
like I said the head sculpt here is
actually<00:06:03.330> not<00:06:03.449> bad<00:06:03.629> for<00:06:03.900> a<00:06:03.930> g2<00:06:04.259> Megatron<00:06:04.770> I

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
actually not bad for a g2 Megatron I

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.379 
actually not bad for a g2 Megatron I
kind<00:06:06.090> of<00:06:06.210> dig<00:06:06.330> it<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:07.729> rest<00:06:08.729> of<00:06:08.849> it<00:06:08.939> like<00:06:09.330> I

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
kind of dig it the rest of it like I

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:10.730 
kind of dig it the rest of it like I
said<00:06:09.449> he's<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.719> green<00:06:09.930> and<00:06:10.080> purple<00:06:10.349> tank<00:06:10.529> like

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
said he's a green and purple tank like

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.920 
said he's a green and purple tank like
he<00:06:10.860> was<00:06:10.979> in<00:06:11.129> g2<00:06:11.490> that's<00:06:12.270> great

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
he was in g2 that's great

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.619 
he was in g2 that's great
but<00:06:13.680> I<00:06:14.159> just<00:06:14.669> don't<00:06:14.849> know<00:06:14.909> if<00:06:14.969> it<00:06:15.120> works<00:06:15.360> here

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:15.629 
but I just don't know if it works here

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:18.230 
but I just don't know if it works here
as<00:06:15.779> a<00:06:15.810> robot<00:06:16.580> which<00:06:17.580> is<00:06:17.610> why<00:06:17.819> I<00:06:17.879> haven't<00:06:18.150> picked

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
as a robot which is why I haven't picked

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.260 
as a robot which is why I haven't picked
it<00:06:18.360> up<00:06:18.449> before<00:06:18.750> now<00:06:19.190> it's<00:06:20.190> bait<00:06:20.430> like<00:06:20.580> it's

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
it up before now it's bait like it's

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.939 
it up before now it's bait like it's
very<00:06:21.479> clearly<00:06:21.719> bludgeon<00:06:22.169> I<00:06:22.319> feel<00:06:22.529> like<00:06:22.770> it's

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
very clearly bludgeon I feel like it's

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.240 
very clearly bludgeon I feel like it's
very<00:06:23.029> like<00:06:24.029> the<00:06:24.180> skeletal<00:06:24.690> limbs<00:06:25.500> worked<00:06:25.979> very

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
very like the skeletal limbs worked very

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.769 
very like the skeletal limbs worked very
well<00:06:26.310> for<00:06:26.460> bludgeon<00:06:27.029> who's<00:06:27.150> supposed<00:06:27.539> to<00:06:27.629> be<00:06:27.690> a

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
well for bludgeon who's supposed to be a

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.079 
well for bludgeon who's supposed to be a
skeleton<00:06:28.259> for<00:06:28.740> Megatron<00:06:29.219> they're<00:06:29.430> not<00:06:29.639> great

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
skeleton for Megatron they're not great

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:35.089 
skeleton for Megatron they're not great
I<00:06:33.139> feel<00:06:34.139> like<00:06:34.289> it<00:06:34.379> was<00:06:34.469> like<00:06:34.650> hey<00:06:34.830> we<00:06:34.979> have<00:06:35.069> a

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:35.099 
I feel like it was like hey we have a

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.189 
I feel like it was like hey we have a
tank<00:06:35.370> let's<00:06:35.639> make<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:35.819> a<00:06:35.969> Megatron<00:06:36.389> and<00:06:36.659> that

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
tank let's make it a Megatron and that

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.719 
tank let's make it a Megatron and that
would<00:06:37.710> screw<00:06:37.830> in<00:06:37.949> a<00:06:37.979> new<00:06:38.069> head<00:06:38.250> and<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:38.639> was

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
would screw in a new head and that was

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.070 
would screw in a new head and that was
really<00:06:39.000> all<00:06:39.150> the<00:06:39.300> thought<00:06:39.479> that<00:06:39.509> put<00:06:39.779> into<00:06:39.900> it

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
really all the thought that put into it

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.939 
really all the thought that put into it
cuz<00:06:40.229> as<00:06:40.560> uh<00:06:41.490> as<00:06:41.789> a<00:06:42.569> tank<00:06:42.870> it<00:06:43.050> looks<00:06:43.199> fine<00:06:43.439> as<00:06:43.889> a

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:43.949 
cuz as uh as a tank it looks fine as a

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:45.890 
cuz as uh as a tank it looks fine as a
robot<00:06:44.370> I'm<00:06:44.639> really<00:06:45.000> not<00:06:45.150> impressed<00:06:45.629> with<00:06:45.779> it

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
robot I'm really not impressed with it

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.939 
robot I'm really not impressed with it
like<00:06:45.990> I<00:06:46.080> said<00:06:46.139> if<00:06:46.289> I<00:06:46.349> hadn't<00:06:46.589> gotten<00:06:46.710> it<00:06:46.800> for

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
like I said if I hadn't gotten it for

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.860 
like I said if I hadn't gotten it for
free<00:06:47.159> I<00:06:47.419> probably<00:06:48.419> wouldn't<00:06:48.689> have<00:06:48.750> picked

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
free I probably wouldn't have picked

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.450 
free I probably wouldn't have picked
this<00:06:49.139> up<00:06:49.289> but<00:06:49.680> I<00:06:49.710> didn't<00:06:49.889> get<00:06:49.949> it<00:06:50.069> for<00:06:50.159> free<00:06:50.279> and

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
this up but I didn't get it for free and

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.230 
this up but I didn't get it for free and
that's<00:06:50.610> kind<00:06:50.789> of<00:06:50.849> cool<00:06:52.849> so<00:06:53.849> yeah<00:06:53.969> there's<00:06:54.180> the

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
that's kind of cool so yeah there's the

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.059 
that's kind of cool so yeah there's the
benefit<00:06:54.509> of<00:06:54.599> source<00:06:54.810> points<00:06:55.110> I<00:06:55.409> figured<00:06:55.919> if<00:06:56.009> I

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:56.069 
benefit of source points I figured if I

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:57.110 
benefit of source points I figured if I
had<00:06:56.189> the<00:06:56.279> points<00:06:56.580> I've<00:06:56.669> been<00:06:56.789> building<00:06:56.939> them

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
had the points I've been building them

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.459 
had the points I've been building them
up<00:06:57.210> for<00:06:57.360> a<00:06:57.419> while<00:06:57.599> and<00:06:57.779> I<00:06:57.839> had<00:06:57.960> enough<00:06:58.199> and<00:06:58.409> I

00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:58.469 
up for a while and I had enough and I

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:01.939 
up for a while and I had enough and I
create<00:06:58.710> I<00:06:58.740> check<00:06:58.979> him<00:06:59.129> out<00:06:59.210> so<00:07:00.710> he's<00:07:01.710> he's<00:07:01.919> not

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949 
create I check him out so he's he's not

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.129 
create I check him out so he's he's not
completely<00:07:02.460> horrible<00:07:02.879> but<00:07:03.150> I<00:07:03.180> said<00:07:03.930> there<00:07:04.080> are

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
completely horrible but I said there are

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:05.839 
completely horrible but I said there are
so<00:07:04.319> many<00:07:04.409> better<00:07:04.710> versions<00:07:05.129> of<00:07:05.219> this<00:07:05.370> mold<00:07:05.610> get

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:05.849 
so many better versions of this mold get

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:07.969 
so many better versions of this mold get
bludgeon<00:07:06.270> if<00:07:06.779> we<00:07:06.930> can't<00:07:07.169> find<00:07:07.349> him<00:07:07.560> get<00:07:07.740> bombs

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
bludgeon if we can't find him get bombs

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.490 
bludgeon if we can't find him get bombs
I<00:07:08.129> draw<00:07:08.370> on<00:07:08.430> both<00:07:09.029> of<00:07:09.419> them<00:07:09.569> I<00:07:09.689> think<00:07:09.900> make<00:07:10.319> much

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
I draw on both of them I think make much

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.050 
I draw on both of them I think make much
more<00:07:10.740> effective<00:07:11.219> and<00:07:11.370> better<00:07:11.610> use<00:07:11.819> of<00:07:11.849> the

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
more effective and better use of the

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.550 
more effective and better use of the
mold<00:07:12.270> then<00:07:13.229> has<00:07:13.500> been<00:07:13.770> Megatron<00:07:14.250> does<00:07:15.440> but<00:07:16.440> if

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
mold then has been Megatron does but if

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.570 
mold then has been Megatron does but if
you<00:07:16.620> got<00:07:16.740> the<00:07:16.830> source<00:07:17.009> points<00:07:17.279> like<00:07:17.370> I<00:07:17.430> said

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
you got the source points like I said

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.649 
you got the source points like I said
you<00:07:17.639> can<00:07:17.759> get<00:07:17.849> them<00:07:17.940> for<00:07:18.029> free<00:07:18.089> at<00:07:18.270> TF<00:07:18.479> source

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:18.659 
you can get them for free at TF source

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:19.640 
you can get them for free at TF source
you've<00:07:18.810> got<00:07:18.990> enough

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650 
you've got enough

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.090 
you've got enough
and<00:07:20.100> I<00:07:20.790> can't<00:07:21.240> I<00:07:21.330> can't<00:07:21.540> fault<00:07:21.780> him<00:07:21.900> for<00:07:21.930> that<00:07:22.100> I

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.100 
and I can't I can't fault him for that I

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.540 
and I can't I can't fault him for that I
would<00:07:23.550> not<00:07:23.640> have<00:07:23.730> paid<00:07:23.880> full<00:07:24.120> price<00:07:24.150> for<00:07:24.360> him

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
would not have paid full price for him

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.200 
would not have paid full price for him
yeah<00:07:26.550> there<00:07:26.730> is

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
yeah there is

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.350 
yeah there is
generations<00:07:27.780> of<00:07:27.810> Megatron<00:07:29.030> GD<00:07:30.030> out<00:07:30.150> of<00:07:30.270> the

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
generations of Megatron GD out of the
