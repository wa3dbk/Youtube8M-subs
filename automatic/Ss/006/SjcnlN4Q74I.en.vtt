00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
here's a bobby pin this is the end part

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.130 
here's a bobby pin this is the end part
and<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> open<00:00:26.250> part<00:00:27.019> well<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.080> do

let's take the end part and slide it
into<00:00:34.969> under<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> braid<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:38.280> there's<00:00:39.020> them<00:00:41.540> and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
into under the braid so there's them and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.529 
into under the braid so there's them and
then<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.950> take<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> hair<00:00:45.260> like<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> long<00:00:46.620> way
