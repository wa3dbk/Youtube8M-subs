00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 or here is rush tuday voiceover chronicle about 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.040
 the strongest desire is not only mine he and 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.410
 all Ukrainian people to Russian 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.480
 removed from our land but not still on 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.450
 Ukraine, Russian troops are still 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.890
 located on the Ukrainian territory 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.050
 President of Russia has not complied with any alloy 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.670
 one of the agreements is not 1 low 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.769
 agreements not 2 Russian aggression 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.890
 had an extremely negative impact on 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.349
 Ukraine and my main goal to return my 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.070
 country to force the Russian troops 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.079
 retreat 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.309
 restore territorial integrity 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:43.350
 and independence of Ukraine is it possible 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.030
 yes if we act together with 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.719
 our western partners are 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.719
 our common task 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.620
 if any components of Minsk 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.590
 agreements in the evaluation of which you are not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.059
 go with the president of Ukraine as far as 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.800
 I remember you said that Minsk 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.820
 agreements create a boundary within 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:09.000
 of Ukraine 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:11.369
 and you are very against it, we had 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 only two possible options are bad 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.720
 very bad very bad option at all 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.820
 do not negotiate do not conclude with 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.950
 neither the first nor the second low agreement 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.430
 bad vollette with the chancellor 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 Merkel and President Holland and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.250
 President Poroshenko try to find 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.290
 way out of this situation today 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.049
 the day is quite obvious not only to us 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.270
 on everything free measure that Putin is like 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.240
 always cheated and beat everyone 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.420
 not only Ukraine and the president but also 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.560
 the chancellor of germany and the president of france and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.439
 have in general 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.540
 because the main point of this agreement 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.149
 grind and was not executed answer 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.220
 that this is not a prerequisite about 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.220
 the most important element of this contract 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.470
 you are shinkansen speaking we will destroy 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.440
 thought color Poroshenko izvestven informing 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.150
 speak in a united front and I support 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.950
 all his efforts towards peace 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.110
 because the world is so important to 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.770
 of the Ukrainian people and so necessary not 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.770
 only Ukraine but also with the free world 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.950
 since president putin represent 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.200
 the threat to all western civilization is all 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.810
 who respects civil rights and freedoms 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.220
 for everyone who really knows what 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.920
 is democracy 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.100
 so you will try our best 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.590
 keep peace and stability and make 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.959
 Putin to comply with the Minsk Agreement 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.959
 but it's not just the Minsk agreement
