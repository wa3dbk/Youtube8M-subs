00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.820
 what the people my name is for 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.920
 usually welcome to a new one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.029
 video in the middle of the night is seven o'clock 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.680
 in the morning I do not have the whole night 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.449
 I just wanted to sleep 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.410
 finally come to the first deadline and see 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.310
 What happens at the moment I have that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.039
 last game 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.890
 I had a 2.8 kg that would be one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.059
 Dream if I had there 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.110
 actually deals are death 22 text 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.780
 No idea if it is now 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.800
 that is, I do not think 20 taxman 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.660
 favorite game mode is until now 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.280
 conclusion confirmed and I can you 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.079
 say inside the lobby 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.820
 the frugal launched this 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.989
 pretty much what is bad then 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.370
 I would say simply nook 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 and I just wanted to take advantage of and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.199
 just record that makes it so 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.910
 long straight and I have to say how 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.129
 I'm trying to spend most of my time 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.329
 invest the game I can do that 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.800
 means I am actually permanent 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.600
 if I can so if I can not 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.159
 do not go edit videos 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.110
 that's the thing out of youtuber i can 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.790
 just do not gamble any more often 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.100
 everyone else, mostly because I'm simple 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.540
 not so have the time but if 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.010
 i can go back all the time or i can 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.060
 funny I love the game 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.700
 I have to say it is up to now 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 my favorite cod though sometimes 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.600
 I have to live where I have to say 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.909
 hate the game extremely but it is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.520
 pretty cool it is just like that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.000
 so horny that I'm yes I'm with the bl 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.740
 I will still be a 1 1 class guide 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.479
 make my favorite class like that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.829
 what my favorite class is what 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.850
 benefits she has and so on and so forth 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.560
 go on and let's go I've got 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.670
 I will pack them if I have one 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 I'm pretty shit 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.159
 if i'm pretty good solo and so 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.810
 his recordings for kaka also have to be 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.310
 I really bock on one on one 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.939
 something for live stream that was a 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.880
 dream for me 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:01.659
 clearly that will love so much 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.939
 I'm sure you are up or up 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.929
 bottom committee , unfortunately, I do not have 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.880
 getting two against one is always 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.340
 I say it's pretty dangerous 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.959
 where are the six good people? 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.170
 slowly in the lobby I would have the 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:21.160
 because so far my god and the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.680
 Spanish or what posted on my god 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.780
 Now I even grab my god 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.010
 I have at the beginning but I have so you have 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.299
 dominated and always when I am too 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.079
 a receptive states not recognized 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:38.140
 hello once 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:39.370
 why take a sip that is because 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.250
 but here I have to believe him 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.890
 stuck with his mind burke so im 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.230
 everyday collect not forget that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.290
 Something I have a page 3 seriously 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.959
 my god is pretty bad just that 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.920
 it must be even better needs 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.630
 otherwise I can not upload that 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.670
 a little fun live comes naturally 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.310
 I think you can do it 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.269
 Also , I do not upload my red ones 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.669
 Of course you have to do that 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.900
 upload is correct with red wine that must 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:10.380
 you plan the rest but otherwise you have to 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:13.460
 do not do it because is worth dying 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.740
 thank you from incl 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:21.250
 conclusion confirms master's degree 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:28.150
 I thank you, we want behind us 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:31.400
 are merely indicates oh my god 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.720
 myspace that is very nice because of that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.750
 I wanted to record it 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.010
 because they are really not that good and 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.010
 I can dominate right here 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.070
 Unfortunately I can not call that 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.770
 too loud could no longer be tired just 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.480
 and to be loud 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.310
 I do not know how we know it because 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.100
 I do not know what do I get 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.720
 sniper sole of suspicion what that 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.030
 i believe i can control i believe 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:02.140
 I do not want to use it though 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.140
 but to get points of course 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.190
 pity then says the drone then 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.750
 I activate this here no idea where 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.750
 can be easily hither 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.350
 So you see they are really not that good 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.520
 That's why I wanted to record there 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.310
 even if it was quite late 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.480
 actually only play solo 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.940
 I am not included either 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.130
 but a little regret I know 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.940
 do not activate it for me 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:36.770
 I can not get that 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.660
 love it so it happens that thats me yes 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.350
 my tone of this war I still had 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.910
 Nobody ever meets it 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:50.480
 oh my god no these rugs 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.920
 nobody hello i can not anyone and 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.830
 I want you with a shot 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.370
 god is the op age the strongest 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.510
 Kiss the game 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.720
 oh my god , that's bad something 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.860
 I am so sorry for bad I have 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:11.940
 even nobody met that he was bad 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.840
 damn you come up i have 18 4 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.880
 now is again a bit 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.870
 got better even though the night is 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.600
 You have to say quite well here 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.889
 somehow it is very good if always 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.180
 in stock start if I at all 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:29.400
 right place not to start me 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.680
 do not thank a Danube like 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.919
 I'm fine with a normal zone 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.060
 I'm definitely satisfied 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.169
 So you can see with the opponents I can 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.789
 a bit of play that makes its 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.340
 if you are really bad 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.479
 on the other hand , he agrees with one topic 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:47.639
 and I win permanently I win 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.920
 have confirmed each individual financial statement 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.530
 the opponents 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.280
 then I heard and can be here 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.200
 very well 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.430
 that mean I compose other good ones 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.840
 player then killed me everyone 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.840
 single knows i am still alive 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.850
 that's so funny is existence 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:19.560
 displayed and the map bit 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:21.840

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.750
 see room as his opponent already 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.070
 again 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.770
 I think it's really good luck 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.790
 this technology is god like it's coming 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.790
 a little better this time though 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:50.940
 not only bad with this fucking thing 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:56.250

 actually okay here in Constance 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.550
 where the germs are of course always 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.600
 already one 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.130
 I do not just want to do kills 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.680
 but do something for the team 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.270
 so that the team also has something of it 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.740
 Well that was less it became me 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.120
 I just wanted to show you that's pretty 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.860
 The game can be pretty simple 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.360
 if you are with the right people 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.320
 Of course, the pro gamer comes into play 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.729
 you can not do something like that 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.320
 but come on people when do you have 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:45.180
 So please correct problems in the team 

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.940
 usually not that is actually the 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.410
 opposing average so actually 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.600
 really cool was pretty fun 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.070
 and yes i hope i like that when 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.840
 you liked it up there 

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.220

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.669
 come live as well as twelve hours 

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.780
