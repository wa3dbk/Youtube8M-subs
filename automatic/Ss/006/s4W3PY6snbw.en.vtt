00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.100
 Y 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.330
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.790
 made with a copy of the Japanese demo 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.710
 of domain binary and I come to bring you some 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.710
 impressions so let's start 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.760
 At first glance we find the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.040
 typical third-person shooter that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.900
 baby of gears of war like most 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.030
 what goes on the market but there are some 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.550
 data that can make us change 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.400
 seem or at least position ourselves 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.860
 most optimistic way the first one is that 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.500
 the game is run by nagoya the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.309
 thinking head to be am4 and the current 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.660
 producer of the yakuza saga and the second 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.760
 robotics and Japanese ambience something 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.080
 that I personally adore and that he sold me 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.080
 bank guys among others 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.800
 the story at first seems pretty 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.120
 typical we handle the marshall that is 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.280
 member of an elite body that must 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.810
 patrol the streets of Tokyo by sweeping 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.990
 all the robberies he finds in his way 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.240
 and so on until you reach the person in charge of 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.860
 all this revolution all pretty 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.260
 typical that has been seen in many games 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.170
 movies but the most interesting thing apart 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.000
 that the script within the typical 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.680
 it seems to be quite well developed 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.450
 and careful especially seeing some 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.370
 scenes that sega has filtered is the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.680
 game system called consequence 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.660
 system through voice commands in the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.729
 if we have micro or otherwise with 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.500
 commands that are made with the command itself 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.750
 we can interact with colleagues 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.729
 cayéndoles squad good or evil 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 quotes and that this has an impact at the time 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.080
 to ask for favors such as coverages and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.520
 others in the demo because not had 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.350
 opportunity to develop this very well 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.330
 since I and Japanese do not stop reading 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.250
 katakana but in several games and go 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.930
 alternating decisions and apparently in 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.300
 some times the thrown comments 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.490
 derogatory towards my de facto patrol 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.500
 it is represented with a down arrow 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.150
 up and have happened in me when 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.739
 it was badly damaged so it seems that it is 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.010
 quite interesting and that will give a lot 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.010
 game 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.450
 in terms of graphic appearance and handling 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.580
 we can not complain the truth use the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.320
 same yakuza engine and although we 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.050
 they put textures neither in polygonal load 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.880
 his designs help him to enter the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.070
 eyes or at least not look like a 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.050
 shabby product of b series and when you 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.730
 put at the controls the feeling is that of 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.160
 be with a word stew with a plus 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.180
 agility makes you feel quite comfortable 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.180
 from the first moment 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.080
 one of the details that we will 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.000
 thank you is that he gets with system 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.150
 can be used wonderfully thanks to 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.740
 will be doubled in Spanish and that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.360
 that you do not look at a partner when you 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.250
 is talking about you shoot him and get off 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.450
 your affinity with him seems very 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.490
 original and I hope it's okay 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.230
 implemented and in terms of his script 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.000
 all intelligence matters 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.160
 artificial and robotic humans 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.710
 who they are unaware of their origin 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.740
 here they are called hold on children to me 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.870
 flipa so binary domain has me 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.430
 convinced by you of or at least I have 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.190
 passed very well with all the destruction 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.200
 all the enemies those final boxes and 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.610
 I hope to you for the video you 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.530
 I have aroused a little curiosity 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.080
 because it is not a game that is very well 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.150
 very publicized I trust nagó yes and 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.020
 his team so for my part at least 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.320
 they have me pending we see ourselves combine and 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.460
 domain if it comes out in mid-February or 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.080
 March 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.950
 well there we will be with some video 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.950
 see you later
