guideline

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.479 

start<00:01:02.140> breaking<00:01:02.559> up<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.680> shape<00:01:03.039> and<00:01:03.280> create

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
start breaking up the shape and create

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.330 
start breaking up the shape and create
the<00:01:03.760> lines<00:01:04.000> for<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.330> feathers<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:05.340> white

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
the lines for the feathers a white

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.760 
the lines for the feathers a white
eyeliner<00:01:06.580> will<00:01:07.090> serve<00:01:07.360> as<00:01:07.630> your<00:01:07.659> outline<00:01:08.140> so

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
eyeliner will serve as your outline so

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.350 
eyeliner will serve as your outline so
when<00:01:08.950> you<00:01:09.040> trace<00:01:09.340> with<00:01:09.549> your<00:01:09.700> black<00:01:09.909> eyeliner

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
when you trace with your black eyeliner

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.539 
when you trace with your black eyeliner
over<00:01:10.570> it<00:01:10.900> will<00:01:11.350> be<00:01:11.380> much<00:01:11.770> easier<00:01:11.799> and<00:01:12.340> you'll

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
over it will be much easier and you'll

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:20.940 
over it will be much easier and you'll
have<00:01:12.729> less<00:01:13.000> mistakes

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.359 

I<00:01:37.140> recommend<00:01:38.140> blocking<00:01:38.350> in<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.860> shape<00:01:39.100> first

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369
