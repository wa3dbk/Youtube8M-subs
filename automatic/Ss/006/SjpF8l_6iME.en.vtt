00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.189
 as for vincent this fall a national team executive are training on 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.860
 a track of a new kind it was prepared with snow from 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.539
 last winter 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.129
 it's not nothing I think it's called snow is an honest man 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.250
 a foot in the mastery well 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.710
 it's really a weapon without really getting back concerned with passionate 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.679
 you know the snow during the summer 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.839
 this is the experiment conducted by the institute for the study of snow and 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.230
 avalanches this is called the semo farmington a method that comes from 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.310
 Finland 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.890
 back in April of this year 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.960
 the challenge of the German researchers of the Swiss big blocks of artificial snow 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040
 to melt in the heat of summer 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.740
 a part covered with wax 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.740
 the other with this company was created 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.210
 he reflects the sun's rays 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.970
 this method does not give excellent results on glaciers or blocks 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.490
 snow are kept from year to year for this it is enough to 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.640
 cover with this special canvas 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.200
 the scene these chords of his plan notch in the very active is whether 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.290
 is possible or not weakness but the snow during the summer at this altitude 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.360
 2500 meters long 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.510
 after which it is a question of comparing two methods of conservation 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.240
 but it remains the fabric every six years novÃ¨s the texas thermometer 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.010
 weather conditions will be carefully your gesture has been analyzed 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.780
 throughout the summer 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.380
 it is a recital net loss to oksana nazarova measured in meteorites 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.229
 we have golden sunbeams with his army begin to talk to each other 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.640
 behavior having plateaued the surface temperature offered by 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.469
 the humidity does a little air temperature is even more 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.469
 sharp the strength of character and the direction of the wind at the stern 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.660
 in mid-altitude resorts white laurent became a good 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.800
 precious impossible to use the snow cannons if the temperature is 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.840
 greater than -2 degrees 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.500
 natural or artificial snow conservation would better 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.230
 start the ski season here at davos promised himself run on this 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.160
 experience selling stage because we hope to keep the graveyard 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.630
 snow during the summer dassault our goal is to offer a track of 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.419
 cross-country skiing 20km this other man 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.559
 I pay me I think the rosewood shavings for best result in 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:18.179
 career but it might surprise for my ideas to the second it's a 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.289
 player 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.359
 the music is a failure the occasion of the sun 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.810
 all summer researchers follow the melting of the snow block 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.319
 the result riding anti-zelaya snow heat 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.289
 under the tarpaulin, however, there is almost nothing left 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.809
 at this altitude it was not the sun's rays that melted the 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.089
 snow but the heat 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.699
 the block isolated under the wood chips and carefully measured saab as 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.029
 south corner 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:49.710
 but that would be because it's still a surprise 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.860
 is that the status quo is at the gross margin of 20 to 25% one of the favorites to 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.759
 80 the 63 year old man 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.540
 it really did me good but to no avail 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.179
 the net is pretty amazing no 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.709
 thanks to what is well worth 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.799
 the result the best that expected 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.159
 it is not a car of the snow has melted 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.719
 remains to measure its quality and again the results are excellent 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.749
 direction the lab to channel the results 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:26.559
 key to software that calculates the mass of snow needed to create 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.759
 a ski slope the following year 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:33.299
 in Damascus there were only a few years left the 2007 vintages at 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.329
 beautiful sports middle is still open 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.480
 500 meters deep 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.179
 instagram 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.559
 today lack of snow internally the national teams are planned 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:43.679
 by the end of May 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.529
 thanks to this method the spurs could benefit from snow 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.009
 100% recycled
