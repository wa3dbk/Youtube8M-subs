00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.250
 up to 20 can say because I see 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.290
 I feel the picture is speed 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.540
 if not higher, you are definitely not less than 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.910
 me and very often when you talk 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.060
 people from russia have speed nothing 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.189
 worse internet is now enough 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.800
 cheap is developing more and more 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.170
 so if at first it is a cape they will do it 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.510
 will work in the United States there I do not know first 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.430
 two years later they will open it for everything 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.500
 peace and in two years again all 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.180
 more and more people have a good 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.400
 internet fast internet internet 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.830
 which they might like to use in 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.559
 such purposes therefore apple on all know 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.269
 how u looks at everything forward and not 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.629
 Odessa, what else will do 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.909
 and after two years, catch up well, catch up with them 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.920
 everyone else I think the internet is like 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.330
 once all that we will see on 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.720
 Today's stage everything will be in 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.970
 a cloud 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.250
 I would try to take away like a boy 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.470
 can more control from your home and 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.940
 put it at home because it's 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.500
 allows me to do many things in between 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.210
 now everyone just wants to go to 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.320
 clouds absolutely transfer to 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.240
 cloud service how are you to this 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.399
 treat basically heels like you 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.490
 treat practical it is convenient for yourself 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.880
 is it or not that trash with such with such 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.710
 things like let's say 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.960
 1st of when you aiklaud yes that is 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.159
 it is very convenient because you need 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.189
 worry about it at cha crashed 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.560
 phone you get yourself a new password entered in 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.840
 do you have a phone back like 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.630
 downloaded to you on your device and in 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 other things 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.780
 I want to keep my photos 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.759
 or let's say there are some things 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.619
 which I prefer them to have 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.270
 me here and internet speed on 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.060
 today many things in the cloud 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.249
 just does not allow if we say 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.539
 picture food you can sit you this 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.829
 no matter how much you interfere with something 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.039
 photos from someone's 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:08.259
 another on the computer if the photos 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.660
 you can make a video much harder and 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.490
 so there are clouds but there will be 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.380
 appear because the cloud will be very 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.480
 important for people who have some 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.880
 content on your computer some 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.520
 things that they want to keep 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.630
 have a backup does not matter how well you are not at home 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.190
 at home in case you have a fire there 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.800
 I know something happened at your house 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.730
 bk ways i have most things i 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.310
 I think even the next row 5 will be exactly 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.840
 people to be at home that is the most 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.360
 big problem right now is the warehouse 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.860
 mistrust and in the us now very much 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.320
 distrust of both companies and 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.010
 to the state that they are made yours 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.050
 information 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.510
 the first is distrust 2 is it still 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.310
 internet speed it all takes more 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.630
 too much time if backups 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.450
 happened like this 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.970
 there could be more people about 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.740
 distrust about spying on information 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.200
 and I've never understood it 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.090
 the desire of people to protect themselves somehow 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.580
 constantly news yes what's the angle behind 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.890
 you are watching apple he is watching you 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.960
 somehow still connected floated gas 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.560
 I had to hide any special 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.390
 there is nothing 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.420
 I really don't see any 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.790
 discomfort this yes I agree that is 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.930
 if before that we had some 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.790
 let's say we expected something from what 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.790
 number of commissions and do not smell like 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.250
 hold in Russian say I like well 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.760
 I mean, I don't understand you personally 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.680
 yeah, you know how much you have little 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.250
 people know how it is your personal yes 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.150
 your personal life range is shorter so 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.950
 confidentiality at home some words that 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.710
 sought yes that is privacy and 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.470
 give it to you you thought that's what 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.990
 you do at home but that is yours 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.150
 this is all your information nobody could 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.070
 know now is not so unfortunate 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.770
 now, too, must get used to it and 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.750
 just to know that what you put in a 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.970
 Internet is now as it were on 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.830
 it's not your responsibility to you 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.390
 lay out some kind of horror internet which 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.070
 then you will try to take back 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.040
 and you certainly do not and can 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.590
 so you know like any other thing with 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.209
 which we slowly and began to live to 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.640
 credit cards that allow 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.250
 companies know what you like about you 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.140
 what habits do you buy like 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.910
 we have when we drive we pay for 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.380
 the road has sensors that pay 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.270
 the road that is anyone could know 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.460
 but not everybody in company you can 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.650
 know where you were when you went there 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.440
 do with time it will know everything 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.600
 more and more and people 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.370
 get used to it more and more and 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.350
 our children they will not have such 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.880
 question what is this company about me 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.700
 how do you say know this then 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.440
 whether it will not like normal simple 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.270
 life and will not understand what is all about them 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.190
 known and they will just be more intelligent 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.840
 about what they lay out let's say there 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.960
 or how they behave when they don't know 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.940
 what they are being watched on about what 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.040
 the state is watching you this is different 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.140
 a little bit of history i think that here can 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.550
 we should be like a little bit 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.290
 cautious about the company 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.790
 it was always like this happened with 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.990
 what kind of pitching happened to everything 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.030
 the rest is something that ideals are somewhere 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.830
 use this heart is busy than they 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.600
 did you do about privacy 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.830
 information u change immediately remember 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.080
 such a very funny case 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.090
 again this is from old work when 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.010
 pumped see device set up 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.930
 we get pumped over devices 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.630
 apple it was done all with one 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.170
 account example you take a new one 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.970
 iphone 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.800
 open if your account 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.720
 which many programs and not his 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.600
 and there company account for our 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.130
 companies that will give this service and 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.380
 very often young such specialists 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.470
 who pumped people and the floor forgot 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.360
 disable sync with salary such 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.750
 the situation you've been pumping there for a month 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.669
 that the device is 100 different people and all 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.919
 they have a tick synchronized 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.340
 in the clouds photos contacts and calendar 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.230
 and 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.080
 and literally two months to you 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.520
 resorted customers just shocked there in 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.190
 furious bastard where are my strangers 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.750
 photos of naked aunts in iphone what is it 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.740
 for new contacts my wife is now 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.270
 kill me very funny that's why 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.610
 There have been many cases on the article of believers 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.560
 when people are interested in gas carcass i 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.240
 heard there is cloud such a handy thing 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.890
 pancakes year berries very afraid of it 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.480
 but use their codes as came from 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.910
 photos to the right place where they are 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.590
 will use it and there were 10 on 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.660
 case that people here because of conflicts from 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.060
 these here for account lost their 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.590
 personal data is very much so pitiable 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.810
 experience so we did again advertising 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.000
 now not in Ukraine can be in a dream 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.970
 It is not so Ukraine in the local market 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.100
 not very much in demand 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.030
 It is very convenient to report on popular 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.720
 and the most important thing 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.970
 and as if further I think again I think 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.979
 that this is a matter of time when people just 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.940
 understand more how these things work and 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:47.570
 how is better 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.920
 how would we how to protect against such 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.350
 things that are not afraid that they can 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.180
 happen the most important thing is eat it 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.560
 more that you might appear somewhere 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.180
 somewhere you just don't want to 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.460
 put in monkeys 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.130
 you know that is the most important thing 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.230
 rule that you think 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.000
 will help you in the future to listen tell 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.370
 such a question a bunch of bunch switch 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.750
 on another topic about your youtube 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.010
 the benefits of how much you already see this 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.910
 activity how do you do it 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.910
