00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.770
 shows you the green 85 people have arrived 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:09.629
 because this does not work for the camera and 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.389
 already as we look at the plans and the 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.010
 course some pieces have solution 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.699
 others have no solution and what we are going 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.999
 to do is check this if you are sending 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.910
 the pulses already we look like the taking of 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:26.519
 reading voltages to know if a 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.159
 phone is changing this voltage 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.589
 correct and to the correct line then 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:34.140
 we see this track totally deteriorated 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:37.080
 but that track these points here a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.150
 test point although here is added 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.150
 having this 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.670
 the processor is sending the pulse there 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.010
 we see 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.839
 with the my and before I'm going accounts and 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.260
 the line is sending pulse but this 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.170
 line if you do not have this any any 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.359
 pulse here is like that and it is also before 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.159
 it was also deteriorate where is a 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.559
 pizza that are there this what I 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.009
 I want to show you there reach to see the 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.470
 track that is apparently good but 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.960
 look what happens when really the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.320
 we perform under there we see it how it 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.270
 deteriorated or deteriorated and we see that 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.300
 That's where the flaw is, it's lost the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.250
 line that leaves here from the camera not 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.130
 is having continuity with the point 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.259
 which is sending the processor 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.149
 we can also check this without 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.579
 need of the sea before the sun or with the 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.829
 course and with the blueprints we learned the 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.380
 behavior of voltages and how 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.659
 They should be here then too 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.729
 we can determine in this case it's more 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.560
 easy I do not have to feed the uar nor 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.990
 nothing but one I know what the clue is 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.140
 that is sending us pulsations from 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.939
 I'm going to drag the processor 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.679
 I'm going to try to grab that little dot that 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.140
 we reach to see is the last point of 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.780
 reference that I have because that point 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.509
 then it reaches a resistance of 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.140
 4.7 k and you also have to have a 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.750
 voltage 1.8 this volts 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.360
 so if he did not get it back he would have 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.310
 this option to go find it from here 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.890
 a bridge of this line until the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.600
 resistance that is in the plane that you 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.390
 we sent the course 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.290
 so let's see if we can save 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.290
 this physics 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.140
 well we have already scratched the track and here 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.130
 where that resistance makes contact 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.450
 4.7 k 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.790
 and when I play inside 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.850
 reaches to touch the inner track because 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.140
 shows continuity 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.140
 I worked in coconut 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.470
 there we see how it sounds when 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.569
 I play down there but not yet 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.209
 has continuity to the point here where 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.580
 it must be then I can do two things 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.280
 a try to continue I answered against 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.060
 the track that is still there 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.090
 who still 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.780
 and we hear it as continuity and the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.760
 another then it would be from this point here 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.930
 here that is close to the headquarters of 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.270
 power from this resistance to the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.190
 point that leads edge to solve is 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.410
 the problem to the point here that you see 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.410
 from the camera's track 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.840
 and there we see then the welded track 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.880
 to the line that leaves the camera the 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.490
 line that you see here this is the only paint 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.060
 that bad and we see it then weld 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.000
 here also to the resistance of 4.7 k 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.700
 that comes that carries a voltage to 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.180
 power the camera here and the camera 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.180
 it should work 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.590
 and here in mante the telephone already 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.409
 running normal camera after 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.640
 that we made the bridge there we see the 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.680
 cable 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.569
 as it has been good long service that 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.900
 you have as a professional in telephony 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.900
 mobile
