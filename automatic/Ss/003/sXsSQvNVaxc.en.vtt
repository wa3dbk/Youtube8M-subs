00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
anyways because gonna cover most of it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.030 
anyways because gonna cover most of it
up<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.630> using<00:01:36.630> ash<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> gray<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.680> kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> go

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
up I using ash and gray to kind of go

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.240 
up I using ash and gray to kind of go
over<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.880> hairy<00:01:42.479> bits<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> did<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
over the this the hairy bits so I did a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.780 
over the this the hairy bits so I did a
bit<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.640> gray<00:01:45.649> thinking<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.829> he<00:01:47.159> actually

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
bit more gray thinking that he actually

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.069 
bit more gray thinking that he actually
you<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.479> mixed<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:48.899> those

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you know what I think I mixed up those

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.819 
you know what I think I mixed up those
colors<00:01:49.380> that's<00:01:49.619> why<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.670> ashen

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
colors that's why we go to ashen

patina<00:03:51.329> finish<00:03:51.570> and<00:03:52.190> just<00:03:53.190> try<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.850> avoid<00:03:54.209> all

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
patina finish and just try to avoid all

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.420 
patina finish and just try to avoid all
the<00:03:54.690> recesses<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.590> idea<00:03:55.860> is<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.070> the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
the recesses so the idea is that the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.960 
the recesses so the idea is that the
patina<00:03:56.760> kind<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.950> builds<00:03:58.950> up<00:03:59.100> where<00:03:59.700> there's

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
patina kind of builds up where there's

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.650 
patina kind of builds up where there's
no<00:04:00.150> nothing<00:04:01.140> being<00:04:01.320> touched<00:04:01.670> so<00:04:02.670> in<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.239> the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
no nothing being touched so in the the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.170 
no nothing being touched so in the the
recesses<00:04:04.110> that'll<00:04:04.950> get<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.130> oxide<00:04:05.880> color

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
recesses that'll get that oxide color

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.600 
recesses that'll get that oxide color
and<00:04:06.630> now<00:04:07.079> with<00:04:07.320> rune<00:04:07.769> Fang<00:04:07.980> steel<00:04:08.250> I'm<00:04:08.430> just

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
and now with rune Fang steel I'm just

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.190 
and now with rune Fang steel I'm just
going<00:04:08.820> over<00:04:09.060> all<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.450> metal<00:04:09.780> bits<00:04:09.989> and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
going over all of the metal bits and

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.630 
going over all of the metal bits and
just<00:04:10.230> trying<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.530> pick<00:04:10.709> out<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.010> edges<00:04:11.430> there

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
just trying to pick out the edges there

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.819 
just trying to pick out the edges there
again<00:04:12.329> just<00:04:12.360> where<00:04:12.780> things<00:04:13.200> would<00:04:13.380> be<00:04:13.500> rubbed

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
again just where things would be rubbed

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.530 
again just where things would be rubbed
off<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:15.680> leaving<00:04:16.680> all<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.950> rusty<00:04:17.340> bits<00:04:17.540> on

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
off and leaving all the rusty bits on

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.409 
off and leaving all the rusty bits on
the<00:04:18.780> other<00:04:18.930> parts<00:04:20.930> because<00:04:21.930> love<00:04:22.140> flesh<00:04:22.500> for

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
the other parts because love flesh for

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.250 
the other parts because love flesh for
next<00:04:24.419> highlight<00:04:24.570> on<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.080> skin

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
next highlight on the skin

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.870 
next highlight on the skin
so<00:04:26.500> just<00:04:26.680> trying<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.890> get<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.220> edges<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:27.640> are

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
so just trying to get the edges that are

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.630 
so just trying to get the edges that are
things<00:04:28.180> now<00:04:28.420> and<00:04:28.920> some<00:04:29.920> of<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.070> detail<00:04:30.400> on

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
things now and some of the detail on

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.750 
things now and some of the detail on
that<00:04:31.120> tail<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:33.070> probably<00:04:33.460> gonna<00:04:33.580> be<00:04:33.670> the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
that tail is probably gonna be the

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.930 
that tail is probably gonna be the
majority<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.240> it<00:04:37.560> in<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:39.520> whole<00:04:39.670> technique

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
majority of it in this whole technique

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.430 
majority of it in this whole technique
here<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.480> could<00:04:40.630> use<00:04:40.780> a<00:04:40.810> similar<00:04:41.170> sort<00:04:41.350> of

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
here you could use a similar sort of

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.780 
here you could use a similar sort of
thing<00:04:41.500> for<00:04:41.740> your<00:04:41.830> clan<00:04:42.040> rats<00:04:42.310> it's<00:04:42.580> pretty

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
thing for your clan rats it's pretty

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.820 
thing for your clan rats it's pretty
fast<00:04:43.090> maybe<00:04:43.840> take<00:04:44.080> out<00:04:44.200> some<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.620> extra

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
fast maybe take out some of the extra

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.070 
fast maybe take out some of the extra
steps<00:04:45.250> like<00:04:45.580> obviously<00:04:46.360> warps<00:04:46.690> don't<00:04:46.900> glow

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
steps like obviously warps don't glow

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.780 
steps like obviously warps don't glow
and<00:04:47.350> that's<00:04:47.560> unless<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:47.980> guys<00:04:48.100> have<00:04:48.160> warp

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
and that's unless you guys have warp

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.290 
and that's unless you guys have warp
stones<00:04:49.060> all<00:04:49.270> over<00:04:49.300> them<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:50.940> find<00:04:51.940> that<00:04:52.120> the

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
stones all over them I find that the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.330 
stones all over them I find that the
green<00:04:52.810> is<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.050> nice<00:04:53.470> complement<00:04:54.010> for<00:04:54.220> your

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
green is a nice complement for your

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.640 
green is a nice complement for your
characters<00:04:54.820> but<00:04:55.120> not<00:04:55.480> necessary<00:04:56.020> on<00:04:56.170> most<00:04:56.530> of

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
characters but not necessary on most of

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
characters but not necessary on most of
your<00:04:56.710> your<00:04:57.430> regular<00:04:57.820> guys<00:04:59.370> so<00:05:00.370> I'm<00:05:00.460> trying<00:05:00.640> to

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
your your regular guys so I'm trying to

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.830 
your your regular guys so I'm trying to
make<00:05:00.760> this<00:05:00.880> look<00:05:01.060> like<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.270> bit<00:05:01.420> of<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.570> globe

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
make this look like a bit of a globe

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.110 
make this look like a bit of a globe
here<00:05:02.260> with<00:05:02.770> some<00:05:02.950> different<00:05:03.310> patterns<00:05:03.880> on<00:05:04.060> it

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
here with some different patterns on it

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.850 
here with some different patterns on it
and<00:05:04.480> that'll<00:05:04.690> come<00:05:04.780> out<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.990> bit<00:05:05.320> more<00:05:05.530> on<00:05:05.800> my

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
and that'll come out a bit more on my

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.850 
and that'll come out a bit more on my
next<00:05:06.400> highlights<00:05:09.960> ok<00:05:10.960> moot<00:05:11.200> green<00:05:11.500> now<00:05:11.680> for

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
next highlights ok moot green now for

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.410 
next highlights ok moot green now for
the<00:05:11.950> next<00:05:12.100> highlight<00:05:12.340> on<00:05:12.730> the<00:05:12.940> warp<00:05:13.180> stone

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
the next highlight on the warp stone

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.200 
the next highlight on the warp stone
stuff<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:14.310> yeah<00:05:15.310> just<00:05:15.550> trying<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.790> get<00:05:15.910> some

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
stuff and yeah just trying to get some

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.730 
stuff and yeah just trying to get some
nice<00:05:16.840> variation<00:05:17.350> in<00:05:17.920> there<00:05:19.590> using<00:05:20.590> those

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
nice variation in there using those

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.040 
nice variation in there using those
tubes<00:05:21.300> seems<00:05:22.300> like<00:05:22.450> there's<00:05:22.600> a<00:05:22.630> piece<00:05:22.720> of<00:05:22.840> warp

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
tubes seems like there's a piece of warp

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.360 
tubes seems like there's a piece of warp
stone<00:05:23.260> on<00:05:23.410> his<00:05:23.530> back<00:05:23.680> there<00:05:23.890> so<00:05:24.040> just<00:05:24.160> trying

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
stone on his back there so just trying

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.520 
stone on his back there so just trying
to<00:05:24.430> pick<00:05:24.580> out<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:25.000> sharp<00:05:25.720> edges<00:05:25.930> on<00:05:26.200> it<00:05:26.350> I

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
to pick out the sharp edges on it I

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.630 
to pick out the sharp edges on it I
don't<00:05:27.220> really<00:05:27.520> do<00:05:27.700> any<00:05:27.880> any<00:05:29.640> zenith

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
don't really do any any zenith

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.910 
don't really do any any zenith

this<00:05:33.130> on<00:05:33.490> this<00:05:33.820> model<00:05:34.030> you<00:05:35.020> can<00:05:35.470> see<00:05:35.620> some<00:05:35.950> of

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
this on this model you can see some of

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.070 
this on this model you can see some of
my<00:05:36.220> other<00:05:36.400> scape<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.300> stuff<00:05:37.510> I've<00:05:37.720> tried<00:05:37.990> to

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
my other scape and stuff I've tried to

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.110 
my other scape and stuff I've tried to
do<00:05:38.230> that<00:05:38.410> and<00:05:38.890> it<00:05:39.040> turns<00:05:39.220> out<00:05:39.430> nicely<00:05:39.790> this

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
do that and it turns out nicely this

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.730 
do that and it turns out nicely this
this<00:05:40.390> model<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.750> didn't<00:05:41.020> think<00:05:41.110> really<00:05:41.440> needed

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
this model I didn't think really needed

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.920 
this model I didn't think really needed
it<00:05:41.940> I'm<00:05:42.940> just<00:05:43.120> wanted<00:05:43.360> to<00:05:43.420> paint<00:05:43.570> it<00:05:43.660> up<00:05:43.750> nice

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
it I'm just wanted to paint it up nice

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.610 
it I'm just wanted to paint it up nice
and<00:05:43.960> quick<00:05:44.200> adding<00:05:45.070> some<00:05:45.310> white<00:05:45.790> scar<00:05:46.210> here<00:05:46.620> so

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
and quick adding some white scar here so

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.670 
and quick adding some white scar here so
some<00:05:47.800> of<00:05:47.920> those<00:05:48.040> edges<00:05:48.550> and<00:05:49.050> then<00:05:50.050> finals

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
some of those edges and then finals

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.800 
some of those edges and then finals
finally<00:05:50.950> some<00:05:51.130> new<00:05:51.340> shabti<00:05:51.730> bone<00:05:51.940> highlights

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810
