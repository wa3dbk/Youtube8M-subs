file and buff then you're going to want

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.069 
file and buff then you're going to want
to<00:00:54.040> take<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.670> nails<00:00:54.850> out<00:00:54.970> of<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.150> package<00:00:55.570> um

doesn't<00:01:57.590> quite<00:01:57.770> match<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.070> curve<00:01:58.759> of<00:01:59.090> the

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
doesn't quite match the curve of the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.530 
doesn't quite match the curve of the
press<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.490> try<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.820> push<00:02:02.060> down<00:02:02.090> really

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
press on so I try to push down really

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.139 
press on so I try to push down really
hard<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.680> do<00:02:03.740> that<00:02:04.119> for<00:02:05.119> at<00:02:05.900> least<00:02:06.520> 60<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.880> 90

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
hard and I do that for at least 60 to 90

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.760 
hard and I do that for at least 60 to 90
seconds<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:08.840> i'm<00:02:08.990> going<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.200> set<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> minute

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
seconds so i'm going to set a minute

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.800 
seconds so i'm going to set a minute
timer<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.310> hold<00:02:10.790> on<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.120> this<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.510> make<00:02:11.660> sure

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
timer and hold on to this to make sure

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.220 
timer and hold on to this to make sure
that<00:02:11.990> we<00:02:12.080> get<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.440> really<00:02:13.040> nice<00:02:13.280> um<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:14.900> bond

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
that we get a really nice um like bond

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.630 
that we get a really nice um like bond
all<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.800> way<00:02:15.890> around<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.160> edge<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.490> nail

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
all the way around the edge of the nail

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.640 
all the way around the edge of the nail
because<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.450> will<00:02:17.540> really<00:02:17.750> keep<00:02:18.050> water<00:02:18.560> from

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
because that will really keep water from

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.770 
because that will really keep water from
getting<00:02:18.920> under<00:02:19.280> there<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.700> loosening<00:02:20.570> it

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
getting under there and loosening it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.509 
getting under there and loosening it
before<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.470> want<00:02:21.709> them<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.890> come<00:02:22.040> on

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:34.800 

ok<00:02:27.519> so<00:02:27.879> that<00:02:28.030> was<00:02:28.060> 90<00:02:28.629> seconds<00:02:29.430> all<00:02:30.430> right<00:02:33.810> okay

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
ok so that was 90 seconds all right okay

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.350

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
little while for the glue to start

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.369 
little while for the glue to start
coming<00:02:43.750> out<00:02:43.840> but<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.079> want<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.230> make<00:02:44.319> sure

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
coming out but you want to make sure

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:51.420 
coming out but you want to make sure
that<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.739> nail<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.189> really<00:02:45.700> covered<00:02:50.430> it's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
that the nail is really covered it's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.250 
that the nail is really covered it's
like<00:02:51.879> I<00:02:52.000> said<00:02:52.030> before<00:02:52.269> it's<00:02:52.569> really<00:02:52.870> important

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
like I said before it's really important

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.339 
like I said before it's really important
to<00:02:53.290> get<00:02:53.439> along<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:54.010> edge<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:55.720> keep<00:02:55.959> water<00:02:56.200> from

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
to get along the edge to keep water from

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.800 
to get along the edge to keep water from
getting<00:02:56.590> underneath<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.430> loosening<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
getting underneath it and loosening the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.050 
getting underneath it and loosening the
bond<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.730> there<00:03:00.879> we<00:03:00.970> go<00:03:01.030> oh<00:03:02.670> yeah<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:03.819> didn't

tried<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.769> nails<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.760> should<00:03:07.620> hold<00:03:08.620> them

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
tried the nails you should hold them

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.369 
tried the nails you should hold them
onto<00:03:09.099> your<00:03:09.190> finger<00:03:09.489> before<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:10.870> go<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.170> glue

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
onto your finger before you go and glue

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.869 
onto your finger before you go and glue
them<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:11.799> that<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:12.010> know<00:03:12.220> it's<00:03:12.459> like<00:03:12.579> you<00:03:12.730> need

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
them so that you know it's like you need

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.789 
them so that you know it's like you need
to<00:03:12.939> file<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.540> bit<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.930> match<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.439> shape<00:03:14.590> of

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
to file it a bit to match the shape of

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.920 
to file it a bit to match the shape of
your<00:03:14.829> nail<00:03:15.639> um<00:03:16.739> but<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.799> think<00:03:18.040> usually<00:03:18.549> they
