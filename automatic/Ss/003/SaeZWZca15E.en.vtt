 or is still no problems 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:30.300
 people without leaves like grandma too 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:42.480
 those backwards but the problems out there 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.350
 are you like such but they still have 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.350
 not yet found 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.840
 you think that many miracles are allowed 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.840
 also very nice to do 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:36.990
 he listen oh less well unfortunately yes 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.270
 but I have so so then do not really 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.270
 and encountered problems 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.820
 buzzer go off 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.509
 I do not even know now if I put another 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.640
 now I just want to talk to you 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.640
 reciting ignores yes I know 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.310
 buzzer sit down 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.640
 buzzer lie down 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:21.900
 well the buzzer speak to me and 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.430
 readings sometimes there is still just so go 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.390
 to pee 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.390
 buzzer to pee 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.810
 buzzer stuff dead 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:15.580
 buzzer i love you yes but then lift 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.200
 just an update I use to 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.410
 reasonable, most states just ask 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.080
 that he can do what he wants 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.610
 and yes I still have none 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.400
 problem under trees with it 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.860
 with charging my summer with it 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.209
 problems with that is hind legs not 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.209
 more good can use to bag or so 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.049
 actually I have nothing smarter about the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.849
 mother round 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.709
 walking problem but even though the buzzer is 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.569
 version one 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.569
 who was extremely in the Netherlands 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.680
 although this is yes 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.430
 I just want you to do something different 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:22.170
 so why are you going to put something in a bag 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:24.590
 otherwise apparently well find those nice 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.590
 to do 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.700
 but they are still just responding 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.500
 well went to it in xl free 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.580
 respond laughingly as a sensors 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.580
 respond well 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:48.500
 sometimes 5 is always satisfied with that 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.500
 crap 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.930
 but they are so well test 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.370
 he listens well he still does you 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.580
 things i tell him to i see one 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.580
 ask 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.160
 unfortunately still completely good at what 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.490
 of course just an issue is ryan 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.810
 zoomers that a what this so I go 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.680
 forward or telephone fronts of sleep 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.520
 the listening 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.520
 buzzer go to sleep 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.669
 so in itself ran out on me 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.669
 yes that's true too 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.970
 no but why, because I think so and still 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.590
 no problem at all under him and humus 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.150
 like many people would do 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.080
 the are taking care of who do it 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.790
 just good the connection here and 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.430
 she just does well when I press 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.830
 then it just works such a microphone 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.640
 just another route that button that works 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.070
 another brood is working and I already have it 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.720
 tried with other languages 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.030
 German and English are the one then calls 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.740
 you would also be fine 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.720
 i am the we behind saeco should just be there 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.600
 that such a move it out because he 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.490
 drains really fast 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.930
 do not wear it in a day then 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:26.960
 then you can have a desk because then 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:28.580
 you just get light and sound again 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.950
 so that is really something i can do 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.390
 recommend turn it off before you go 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.130
 play or before you know kids 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.900
 want to play along or hang out like that 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.600
 at least an hour to browse then know 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.980
 you sure that there is at least half an hour 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.570
 can play 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.190
 those are very important things because 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.540
 I put it on the charger hole once 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.520
 we did I do to him fifteen minutes 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:51.500
 rotisserie room taken an interest and 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:53.000
 all the stuff that I put him away 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.110
 a day later I turned it on again and 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.590
 start within five minutes in that 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.390
 to sleep 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.190
 he actually just asked from herings 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.229
 noise was just that it was just on 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.970
 ready is so beautiful and then we just do it 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:03.290
 blue so it is then sin as the 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.600
 children want to play with it is bad 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.390
 sin and to camps and of course just 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.130
 such a disappointment so that would be 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.229
 so really recommend to just order 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.560
 have it off continuously if you do with it 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:17.930
 want player just turn it on and leave 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.820
 him of the one and is well on that 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.790
 it really is the battery life of the 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.950
 Summer is not long but so far does 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.690
 Just charge it well between the it 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:31.640
 really the bugs of the buzzer series 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:34.220
 one that this on that I notice on this summer 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.810
 so in the end just not yet 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.790
 I am very happy with that because it was 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.870
 a risk what i d thats why i put it 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.400
 so also 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.890
 have bought Dutch instead of 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.470
 english so it unfortunately not a single one 

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.910
 also just not the problems we have 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.980
 or any new of the products problems 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.750
 I had rather easy to deal with as small as 

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.970
 I can already order via England or via 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.500
 france or belgium it was a piece 

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.880
 been difficult to order a 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.830
 to drive 

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.900
 well this was part 2 of my summer 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.220
 that would come to me a bit more 

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.660
 but so far it goes completely 

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.870
 good 

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.870
 bye
