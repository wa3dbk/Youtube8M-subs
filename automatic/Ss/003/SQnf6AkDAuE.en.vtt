00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.400
 Yes 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:11.570
 The beginning of that 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.570
 How to cut out of this is a pretty important story 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.860
 It will digitally organize the unnecessary tile of early 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.900
 The order is ok 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.160
 The story of the previous also Tadashi but is the first-kun because however you have to some extent clear 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.529
 When you leave the simple 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:35.350
 5 kinds are divided into 44 categories. 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:39.530
 First of all the group of role group 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:43.430
 It is a group of 1919 and 28 blue groups 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.120
 Well isolated pie this is it is the phrase waste Potsun 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.430
 Roughly organized 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.190
 A lot of people 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.340
 I think 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.340
 so 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:02.030
 I think you already know all about the 19 losses and the 28 range 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.129
 19 losses has a double-sided 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.480
 It is impossible to make 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.720
 But 8 good stories 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.340
 Arp stuck to arp 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.759
 Nyanso's family 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:22.750
 Qi layer so-so and stick together or to the You're part 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:29.200
 Those of the isolated of 28 than isolation of 19 in that this is there is a possibility that I say form is born 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:33.009
 Also this is there is another matter of course but because usability is good for combinatorial 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.000
 Well, that's fine with that kind of thing 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:40.880
 Is related to It is shaped tiles am 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.950
 Again if digitally processing field proposal 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:51.020
 Process from the office 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.020
 If the kana not it good order go over the hand towards the OTA-style I think why 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.680
 Quite also it can take because I think it fast reach even that it is empirically well you can see everyone 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.580
 There is a certain thing called mahjong 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.260
 When we got an early reach 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.530
 Better role tiles lily also of OTA-style 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.630
 Ron 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 It is to be hydro-over bake that say RBI to lower when it is difficult to Karon is 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:24.330
 Higher payment higher 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:27.520
 Because there is a possibility that the price may be high, it is said that some safety guard candidates can be kept at hand after all 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.050
 Is that going to organize with little consideration of the 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.810
 Because it is the second 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.280
 First of all, you are this group 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.750
 It is isolated tiles and processes the group first and foremost 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.220
 Next , organize the isolated chopsticks for the Ota style block 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.720
 Organize 19 losses 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.590
 28 If you go hand over the rest 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.590
 Basic 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.510
 That's what I said earlier 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.590
 Basic form and a little different case it 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.060
 Time of the break up Haipai 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.170
 Yes , when it's time to fall apart 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:11.060
 It's a sense of crisis, so I won't have it, so I won't bring it with me. 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:17.440
 It may not be possible to put it up as a story or an exceptional rare case that may not be able to go up 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.440
 As for thinking about something, let's change the balance of this area a little 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.310
 Organize 19 or 28 which are isolated first 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.050
 so 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:35.540
 5 I think it would be better to prepare a safety pie so that it may take a reach 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:37.720
 Say the time being it the song is I mean protect or rather lose and I want to put the center of gravity a little defense 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.990
 It is better to put a sharp 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:49.940
 I think that there are few points to be scored. If so, the way of organizing the beginning is an isolated group . 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:52.670
 I expected to say that there is extended to organize the isolation of organizing to 28 the 19 ward of 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.140
 I'm sorry 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:01.819
 Role 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:07.720
 How is the way of the digital processing of the family where the Oda style and the second cup arranging order become late 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.720
 As for being raised as wise as 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.450
 For songs that you want to go up or you have to go up 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:21.570
 Yes about the song that seems to be up 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.840
 Please try the arrangement method of Ota style 19 and 28 police 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.840
 so 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.810
 First of all not 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.570
 To give an example and explain 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:45.720
 Turn off the file no longer in scope candidate is it made Yes This need not enter the not enter 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:47.420
 This procedure is very important though is referred to as Bae Jun say the order to go 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.210
 As a 10 bar 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:56.249
 I 'll cut off my job, I 'll take a blow on my head, I'll take the most off 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.490
 I'm going to this process the pin angle eight party isolation 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:01.200
 I'm going really 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.729
 At first put in order from the daytime to go about 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.210
 Cut the bottom 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.100
 Because it is the first to park this basic 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.050
 Basic firmly 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.129
 By do first master 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.129
 Not likely to rise 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.630
 Do you think this has come 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.480
 Sometimes came a hand like that what's I 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.720
 We organize from 19 isolation 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:36.960
 Next I 'm organizing 2 children 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:40.980
 Then a little slow turn I'd go Imaa doing this to win Yakupai this is going out 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:46.129
 I think it will be because some flies will be safer over time 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:52.999
 Be safe to safely 32 I enemy 3 people 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:59.509
 Prepare for the attack while keeping the Yes and also the body is falling apart classy as its preparation 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:06:00.590
 Oiteii off the following only occasionally to organize from the isolation of 19 do not develop from the two cups 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:05.360
 then 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:07.760
 Another this happens When not good even Pommel Horse usual Anbai in the kana Let's change the Seriously opponent 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.820
 I say I say I quit 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:17.550
 Even if you control 128 trees in your hand 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:21.000
 And this four times better for safety pies 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:28.819
 I think I this is my say 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.819
 It will be a way of digital processing to organize unnecessary chopsticks
