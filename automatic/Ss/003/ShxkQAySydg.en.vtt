I've<00:00:12.059> run<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.420> beans<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:18.470> by<00:00:19.580> planting

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I've run of beans in here by planting

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.099 
I've run of beans in here by planting
the<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.180> runner<00:00:21.359> bean<00:00:21.570> seeds<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.080> germinate

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the the runner bean seeds to germinate

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.040 
the the runner bean seeds to germinate
in<00:00:22.949> tissue<00:00:23.460> paper<00:00:23.609> inside<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:24.600> planting

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
in tissue paper inside and then planting

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.019 
in tissue paper inside and then planting
outside<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.070> they're<00:00:26.250> approximately<00:00:26.490> six

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
outside and they're approximately six

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.480 
outside and they're approximately six
inches<00:00:27.210> tall<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.439> then<00:00:28.590> round<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> base<00:00:29.160> are

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
inches tall and then round the base are

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.009 
inches tall and then round the base are
then<00:00:29.760> plant<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.900> approximately

is<00:02:40.110> plant<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.130> three<00:02:41.340> plants<00:02:41.610> combined<00:02:42.150> have

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
is plant the three plants combined have

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.260 
is plant the three plants combined have
all<00:02:42.570> knotted<00:02:42.960> together<00:02:43.110> quite<00:02:43.560> nicely<00:02:44.270> you

all knotted together quite nicely you
can<00:02:45.420> see<00:02:45.630> for<00:02:45.870> my<00:02:45.990> trees<00:02:46.650> blowing<00:02:46.890> around<00:02:47.100> it's

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
can see for my trees blowing around it's

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.310 
can see for my trees blowing around it's
in<00:02:48.450> an<00:02:48.810> area<00:02:48.990> with<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.290> fairly<00:02:49.530> high<00:02:49.770> wind<00:02:51.320> so

they've<00:02:53.310> not<00:02:53.520> needed<00:02:53.850> any<00:02:54.630> kind<00:02:54.900> of

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
they've not needed any kind of

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.660 
they've not needed any kind of
additional<00:02:55.410> support<00:02:55.560> all<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.280> plants

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
additional support all of the plants

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.790 
additional support all of the plants
that<00:02:56.700> are<00:02:56.850> wrapped<00:02:57.180> around<00:02:57.330> each<00:02:57.690> other<00:02:57.930> which
