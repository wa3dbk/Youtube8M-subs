00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.690
 we give twice to the home button two 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.320

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.920

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.940

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.850

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.370

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.270
 we go to the chair and again and 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.790
 As you can see, the daily bonus has not been given 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.390

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.069
 Well, we collect them 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.950

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.150
 you see 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:37.070

 I'm going to pick it up, the currency is worth 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.410
 boring 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.530

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:11.259

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.990
 Well let's play for 1 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:30.300
 Well now it does not matter if you make points or 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.270
 not because they will give you the same 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.870
 well then let them base and when 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.870
