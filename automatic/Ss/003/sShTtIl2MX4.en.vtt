00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 the one that is the same big immense 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.580
 Havoc mike and requested a new video 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.589
 this time I'm going to introduce you to 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.570
 new god the new goddess in this case 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.460
 it's about cali and really it's not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.139
 a new goddess no but as you see then 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 the truth was very changed 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.130
 It has an authentic past 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.410
 liked it a lot and besides, as you can see it is 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.390
 quite big new the previous 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.519
 So it seemed quite vulnerable 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.650
 is undoubtedly much more 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.000
 We are going to read it and its passive 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.529
 because it seems that it will be also 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.779
 quite interesting is the one that most 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.369
 He drew attention good attacks 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.140
 basic are also quite curious not 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.880
 they have a cult still quite elevated 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.540
 but well let's see the passion is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.989
 llama market for del says that an enemy 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.910
 random is marked to the good as the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 cali death mark so to speak 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.020
 Carl Icahn combines a power of penetration 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.230
 physical against that god and if he does not kill it 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.480
 he continues to heal by 80 percent in his 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.719
 maximum life and carries 25 percent 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.309
 of a bonus goal if he dies as he returns 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.830
 to reappear the god as you see now if 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.810
 I kill blood because I would take all those 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.180
 benefits the truth 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.920
 passed a passive that is very very 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.530
 interesting and I think it's going to give 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.539
 very much game here in smile let's go to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.070
 see Well how about we will not see the 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.509
 first attack is called anime strike and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.920
 tells us that Cali was launched towards 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.590
 forward hurting the enemies in 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.369
 the area and healing itself for a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.080
 percentage of the enemy's health that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.539
 have been more damaged let's throw ourselves 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.220
 here oops we have removed it good 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.929
 hurt we are going to try to prove 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.689
 other skill not the 2 is called like 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:40.740
 tells us that each throws a few 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.319
 swords that attack the location and 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.330
 each one hurts and causes a bleed 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.520
 that is to say the objective is losing life 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.590
 for a limited time and call wins 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.159
 after physical life stile is to say robbery 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.840
 of life to the enemies affected by 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.509
 this life and the third if the mind itself 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.670
 tells us that Cali throws his incense into the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.069
 I make it explode and the enemies 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.229
 they are studied while ali wins 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.390
 a physics bonus to power so 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.220
 let's see we use here on 1 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.039
 let's also use the 2 here you have it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.109
 and finally the 3 so as you see then 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.470
 the truth quite effective all 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.720
 attacks 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.400
 they have allowed us to practically kill 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.050
 these chicken enemies to kill this 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.750
 poseidÃ³n and as you see I have been restored 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.310
 practically all of life an authentic 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.350
 last and good, it is because of the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.600
 passive in case some ask it as 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.040
 you see is also pretty cool the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.100
 second skills of knives 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.290
 because well, the three of them come together 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.330
 the same site we are not going to try it now 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.250
 again do not worry but before 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.650
 let's read what the last one 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.570
 they are called extraction tells us that 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.440
 Cali becomes a force 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.100
 unstoppable destruction creating an aura 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.720
 of good an area where it hurts and 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.820
 during this time you can stay 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.160
 one of life but can not die very very 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.140
 interesting and it's also immune to 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.820
 a lot of effect not very 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.590
 interesting as I tell you what not 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.720
 can die because we're going to be able to use it 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.030
 Well simply when we have little 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.320
 life or let's see that we are going to die and what of the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.880
 basic attack I'm seeing that I 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.990
 I was wrong when I said that I had a lot 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.660
 lung because you are seeing what 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.910
 bust we're not going to try here to do 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.040
 a handsome attack we use the 1 we use the 2 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.410
 As you can see, the score is very cool 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.930
 we are going to remove it with the bleeding 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.630
 we duplicate the robbery here we're also going to 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.790
 apply the 3 we study and we're going to 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.490
 become the 4 as you see the last 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.800
 is very similar to the previous one but in 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.020
 this occasion does not attack the lime and 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.480
 directly but what happens is that 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.820
 well then enemies swollen in 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.290
 the aura are taking damage but you 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.090
 You can also use your attacks 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.190
 basic so he's very very curious and 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.470
 I think she is a goddess who can give 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.750
 A lot of game did not in fact already gave it but 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.090
 As I said in previous videos 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.270
 is left a little behind or this or 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.830
 I thought that was good but I think 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.330
 that this robot is going to come very very 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.430
 well what has impacted me the most 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.560
 The first has been as I have already 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.180
 said before its appearance is not much more 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.860
 large much more threatening but the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.990
 truth is that the skills do not 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.060
 nothing short and good they are 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.610
 simple skills but that contribute 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.220
 a lot of play as I tell you this is the 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.560
 jump that was announced and good 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.290
 so let's continue playing a little 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.390
 more we use here this but it will not do 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.160
 they are going to take it away from us and as you see 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.050
 now he has marked us to the can as 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.180
 goal so let's try it 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.430
 flat without further delay we do this 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.520
 pretty good to skill 3 and we're going 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.830
 already to throw us here for the goal 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.830
 here it is worth dying and as you can see it has 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.419
 changed the score and now we have 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.669
 another objective that in this case is to live 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.919
 You see how they burst bone I already tell you 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.479
 think that he was going to get so much but 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.699
 really your basic attacks are very 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.370
 effective because they can be launched 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.039
 every very little time we are not going to try 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.710
 if we do something here 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.970
 We are going to die well, because nothing has 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.710
 been everything I hope you liked it 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.099
 You are from his also maite to another 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.099
 area
