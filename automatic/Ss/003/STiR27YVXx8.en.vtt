00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.349
 hello fitness friends i'm back with 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.990
 the next exercise from my pusch day 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.450
 this is the fourth exercise and the first 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.720
 Exercise for the shoulders 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.539
 one of my favorite exercise with 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.609
 press dumbbell switch 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.760
 you can see that here take the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.859
 Stand up and always weigh them 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.019
 not over the head and hands all over 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.690
 are straight or or almost completely 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.739
 stretched out the elbows and again 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.079
 his way down the first set 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.390
 a little bit simple that is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.460
 wanted so because I want four more 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.320
 sentences or 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.570
 three more sets of the same weight 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.469
 and with the same number of repetitions 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.559
 create 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.020
 now here is the second sentence the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.180
 execution is clean therefore the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.160
 a little light weight so I can 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.989
 performing well and playing like that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.130
 Just do the shoulder the best 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.720
 it burns properly and as I said one 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.110
 my favorite exercises for the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.110
 shoulder 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.850
 I'm stuck with this exercise 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.270
 made ten repetitions too 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270
 create 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.530
 and if I did that, I could 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.259
 court by five kilos 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.690
 but then I will certainly one 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.990
 lower repetition number only 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.240
 create and so I try 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.619
 and to work from book to book 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.470
 that is already the third sentence it will be 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.149
 you can just harder on it 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.909
 see 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.200
 That's right in the last two sentences 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.340
 This will only thus do you manage 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.039
 easy to increase 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.310
 I want the first inserts so in the 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.840
 see art as a warm-up 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.030
 so now we have the last one here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.190
 sentence again same repetition then 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.310
 pay the same weight but of course 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:16.110
 through the muscle creation and if 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.319
 you liked the video you could 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.690
 the exercise is done before 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.940
 the breast left click around in the corner 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.269
 right above you see the next exercise 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.570
 a very good exercise for the shoulder 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.100
 for the wide shoulder 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.799
 Here you can see exactly what again 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.560
 actually the goal of this training 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.359
 In the last sentence, Systems is among the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.799
 You just have to repeat that last time 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.830
 to get everything out 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.270
 that's just the repetition 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.170
 have to do stronger next time 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.170
 what goes
