00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
always been a fun circuit for me you

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.930 
always been a fun circuit for me you
know<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.920> do<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> lot<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.280> testing<00:00:11.700> here<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
know we do a lot of testing here in the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.620 
know we do a lot of testing here in the
winter<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> very<00:00:13.410> high<00:00:13.590> speed<00:00:13.650> circuit

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
winter it's a very high speed circuit

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.150 
winter it's a very high speed circuit
aerodynamics<00:00:15.630> very<00:00:15.839> important<00:00:16.260> we<00:00:16.770> rocked<00:00:16.980> up

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
aerodynamics very important we rocked up

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.609 
aerodynamics very important we rocked up
here<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> new<00:00:17.670> aerodynamic<00:00:17.789> package

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
here with a new aerodynamic package

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.260 
here with a new aerodynamic package
which<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.740> an<00:00:19.830> improvement<00:00:19.939> not<00:00:20.939> sure<00:00:21.119> it's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
which is an improvement not sure it's

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.700 
which is an improvement not sure it's
quite<00:00:21.330> as<00:00:21.600> big<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:21.869> what<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.080> expected<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
quite as big as what we expected and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.300 
quite as big as what we expected and
what<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:23.039> hoped<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:24.410> but<00:00:25.410> hopefully<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.130> can

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
what we hoped for but hopefully we can

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.700 
what we hoped for but hopefully we can
look<00:00:27.150> at<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> reasons<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.320> get<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
look at the reasons for then and get the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.999 
look at the reasons for then and get the
best<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.429> future<00:00:30.029> races<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.890> lot<00:00:31.890> of

best out of it at future races a lot of
people<00:00:32.130> had<00:00:32.309> new<00:00:32.460> packages<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> Ferrari

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
people had new packages and the Ferrari

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.430 
people had new packages and the Ferrari
was<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> car<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.200> made<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> big

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
was that the car has really made a big

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.000 
was that the car has really made a big
leap<00:00:37.890> forward<00:00:38.780> everyone<00:00:39.780> else<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
leap forward everyone else really you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.350 
leap forward everyone else really you
know<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.640> difficult<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> big

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
know it's difficult to see a big

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.040 
know it's difficult to see a big

I struggled with the car a little bit
with<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.969> balance<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.800> couldn't<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:50.070> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
also changed my driving style a little

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
also changed my driving style a little
bit<00:01:27.780> had<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> bit<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.770> aggressive<00:01:28.890> with

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
bit had to be a bit more aggressive with

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.760 
bit had to be a bit more aggressive with
the<00:01:29.490> car<00:01:29.700> sort<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.360> muscle<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.409> know<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the car sort of muscle you know I was a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.330 
the car sort of muscle you know I was a
bit<00:01:32.369> aggressive<00:01:33.060> through<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> corners<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
bit aggressive through the corners and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.550 
bit aggressive through the corners and
not<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.579> entry<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.150> an<00:01:36.329> exit<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
not just on entry but also an exit you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.420 
not just on entry but also an exit you
see<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> lot<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> sideways<00:01:39.500> action<00:01:40.500> shots<00:01:41.100> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
see a lot of sideways action shots and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.859 
see a lot of sideways action shots and
then<00:01:41.579> we'll<00:01:41.880> swim<00:01:42.119> which<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.360> quite<00:01:42.509> unusual

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
then we'll swim which is quite unusual

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.980 
then we'll swim which is quite unusual
for<00:01:43.290> me<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> way<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.430> had<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.990> q1

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
for me but it's the way it had to be q1

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.109 
for me but it's the way it had to be q1

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
quick but you know our pace compared to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.819
