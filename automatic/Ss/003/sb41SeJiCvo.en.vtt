complicated cellulitis with necrosis and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.649 
complicated cellulitis with necrosis and
that's<00:01:19.680> what<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.460> easy<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659

cost of rapidly progressive sale I so it

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.249 
cost of rapidly progressive sale I so it
looks<00:04:14.040> just<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:14.340> strep<00:04:15.259> indistinguishable

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
looks just like strep indistinguishable

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.979 
looks just like strep indistinguishable
but<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.280> get<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.579> history<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.239> an<00:04:18.449> animal<00:04:18.840> and

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
but you get to history of an animal and

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.810 
but you get to history of an animal and
you<00:04:19.079> end<00:04:19.229> up<00:04:19.289> treating<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:20.099> little<00:04:20.699> bit

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
you end up treating it a little bit

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.310 
you end up treating it a little bit
differently<00:04:21.239> with<00:04:21.329> penicillins<00:04:22.109> and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
differently with penicillins and

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.560
