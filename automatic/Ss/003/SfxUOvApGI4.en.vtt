00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
here to the third phase of this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.190 
here to the third phase of this
development<00:01:10.130> where<00:01:11.090> they<00:01:11.240> actually<00:01:11.570> haven't

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
development where they actually haven't

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.440 
development where they actually haven't
even<00:01:12.290> started<00:01:13.250> building<00:01:13.729> any<00:01:13.880> houses<00:01:14.329> or

even started building any houses or

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.040 
even started building any houses or
anything<00:01:14.780> yet<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.820> what<00:01:16.820> we've<00:01:17.390> got<00:01:17.840> is

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
anything yet and what we've got is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.480 
anything yet and what we've got is
they're<00:01:18.229> basically<00:01:18.830> at<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.100> point<00:01:19.340> where

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
they're basically at the point where

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.330 
they're basically at the point where
they're<00:01:19.610> just<00:01:19.790> laying<00:01:20.030> pipes<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.870> and<00:01:21.340> paving

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
they're just laying pipes and and paving

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.520 
they're just laying pipes and and paving
roads<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.060> those<00:01:23.240> types<00:01:23.510> of<00:01:23.659> things<00:01:23.720> but

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
roads and those types of things but

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.160 
roads and those types of things but
there<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.950> an<00:01:25.729> old<00:01:26.000> app<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.420> house<00:01:26.600> site<00:01:26.900> up<00:01:27.049> on

there is a an old app a house site up on

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.080 
there is a an old app a house site up on
top<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.590> hill<00:01:27.620> up<00:01:28.010> here<00:01:28.190> and<00:01:28.790> you'll

top of the hill up here and you'll

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.690 
top of the hill up here and you'll
actually<00:01:29.299> be<00:01:29.479> able<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:30.190> kind<00:01:31.190> of<00:01:31.250> see<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.580> lay

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
actually be able to kind of see the lay

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.890 
actually be able to kind of see the lay
of<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.850> land<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.180> little<00:01:32.390> bit<00:01:32.479> as<00:01:32.600> we<00:01:32.720> go<00:01:32.750> in<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
of the land a little bit as we go in the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.740 
of the land a little bit as we go in the
house<00:01:35.900> site<00:01:36.260> set<00:01:36.530> up<00:01:36.560> on<00:01:36.799> top<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.159> hill<00:01:37.220> and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
house site set up on top of the hill and

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.780 
house site set up on top of the hill and
I've<00:01:38.750> been<00:01:39.290> here<00:01:39.500> one<00:01:39.680> other<00:01:39.860> time<00:01:40.070> before<00:01:40.460> and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
I've been here one other time before and

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.080 
I've been here one other time before and
I<00:01:41.060> know<00:01:41.119> just<00:01:41.479> from<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.810> visit<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:43.090> this

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
I know just from that visit that this

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.380 
I know just from that visit that this
home<00:01:44.720> site<00:01:45.049> is<00:01:45.320> not<00:01:45.890> Civil<00:01:46.460> War<00:01:46.670> period<00:01:46.970> it's

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
home site is not Civil War period it's

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.670 
home site is not Civil War period it's
probably<00:01:47.869> more<00:01:48.200> late<00:01:48.770> 1800s<00:01:50.110> but<00:01:51.110> certainly

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
probably more late 1800s but certainly

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.590 
probably more late 1800s but certainly
it's<00:01:52.250> important<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:52.820> keep<00:01:53.000> in<00:01:53.150> mind<00:01:53.390> that

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
it's important to keep in mind that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.450 
it's important to keep in mind that
every<00:01:54.020> relic<00:01:54.439> doesn't<00:01:54.740> have<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.010> be<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.159> civil

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
every relic doesn't have to be a civil

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.750 
every relic doesn't have to be a civil
war<00:01:55.760> relic<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.330> time<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:57.500> can<00:01:57.650> save<00:01:57.950> any<00:01:58.310> history

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
war relic a time we can save any history

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.880 
war relic a time we can save any history
from<00:01:58.939> whatever<00:01:59.180> time<00:01:59.540> period<00:01:59.570> it<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.260> it's

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
from whatever time period it is it's

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.620 
from whatever time period it is it's
certainly<00:02:01.400> an<00:02:01.610> important<00:02:02.090> thing<00:02:02.240> for<00:02:02.270> us<00:02:02.600> to

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
certainly an important thing for us to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.620 
certainly an important thing for us to
do<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.830> we're<00:02:03.979> going<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.189> ride<00:02:04.939> up<00:02:05.150> here<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.510> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
do so we're going to ride up here to the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.609 
do so we're going to ride up here to the
top<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.080> hill<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:07.119> find<00:02:08.119> us<00:02:08.470> somewhere<00:02:09.470> to

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
top of the hill and find us somewhere to

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.350 
top of the hill and find us somewhere to
park<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:11.830> also<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.860> had<00:02:13.489> actually<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:13.879> found<00:02:14.150> a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
park and also I had actually I found a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.210 
park and also I had actually I found a
couple<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:15.080> air<00:02:15.260> heads<00:02:15.530> up<00:02:15.709> on<00:02:15.830> top<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.129> this

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
couple of air heads up on top of this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.280 
couple of air heads up on top of this
hill<00:02:16.430> as<00:02:16.580> well<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:17.840> kind<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.170> an

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
hill as well so it's kind of an

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.649 
hill as well so it's kind of an
interesting<00:02:18.470> little<00:02:18.799> site<00:02:19.129> and<00:02:19.430> we'll<00:02:19.659> see

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
interesting little site and we'll see

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.449 
interesting little site and we'll see
what<00:02:20.870> kind<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.079> sit<00:02:21.319> history<00:02:21.919> we<00:02:22.099> can<00:02:22.219> save

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
what kind of sit history we can save

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.399 
what kind of sit history we can save
today

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.539 

well<00:02:27.409> we<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.650> see<00:02:27.799> right<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:28.129> a<00:02:28.190> little<00:02:28.370> bit

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
well we can see right here a little bit

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.119 
well we can see right here a little bit
of<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.170> layout<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.349> land<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.739> actual<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
of the layout of the land the actual the

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.369 
of the layout of the land the actual the
home<00:02:31.280> side<00:02:31.549> of<00:02:31.670> beliefs<00:02:31.940> at<00:02:32.180> probably<00:02:33.170> right

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
home side of beliefs at probably right

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.660 
home side of beliefs at probably right
about<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.739> middle<00:02:33.799> of<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.099> road<00:02:34.370> I

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
about in the middle of the road I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.369 
about in the middle of the road I
remember<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:37.090> some<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.239> before<00:02:38.989> they<00:02:39.230> put

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
remember the some of the before they put

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.650 
remember the some of the before they put
the<00:02:39.470> road<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:39.920> can<00:02:40.069> kind<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.400> see<00:02:41.390> some<00:02:41.629> of

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
the road in you can kind of see some of

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.930 
the road in you can kind of see some of
the<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.769> wood<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.190> lay<00:02:43.370> out<00:02:43.489> that<00:02:43.519> kind<00:02:43.760> of

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
the the wood and lay out that kind of

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.960 
the the wood and lay out that kind of
stuff<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:45.650> can<00:02:45.739> see<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.190> we're<00:02:46.459> way<00:02:46.700> up

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
stuff but you can see that we're way up

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.110 
stuff but you can see that we're way up
on<00:02:47.120> top<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:47.390> big<00:02:47.629> hill<00:02:47.870> here<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.650> how<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.519> it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
on top this big hill here and how it it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.319 
on top this big hill here and how it it
drops<00:02:50.420> down<00:02:50.569> as<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:50.959> go<00:02:51.079> around<00:02:52.150> all<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.299> way

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
drops down as you go around all the way

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.830 
drops down as you go around all the way
around<00:02:53.390> us<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.280> just<00:02:55.280> kind<00:02:55.579> of<00:02:55.640> bit<00:02:55.819> in<00:02:55.970> in<00:02:56.750> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
around us and just kind of bit in in the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.660 
around us and just kind of bit in in the
swing<00:02:57.079> of<00:02:57.140> things<00:02:57.200> here<00:02:57.560> for<00:02:57.709> about<00:02:57.829> two

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
swing of things here for about two

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.819 
swing of things here for about two
minutes<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.209> they<00:02:59.780> got<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> good<00:03:00.170> target<00:03:00.379> here

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
minutes and they got a good target here

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.339 
minutes and they got a good target here
you<00:03:01.819> can<00:03:01.970> see<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.329> right<00:03:02.599> laying<00:03:03.109> right<00:03:03.319> here

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
you can see it's right laying right here

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.890 
you can see it's right laying right here
and<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:04.310> ground<00:03:04.579> couldn't<00:03:05.480> pick<00:03:05.569> it<00:03:05.660> up<00:03:05.750> for

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
and the ground couldn't pick it up for

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.309 
and the ground couldn't pick it up for
you<00:03:06.069> it's<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.099> nice<00:03:07.280> nice<00:03:08.060> brass<00:03:08.390> thimble

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
you it's a nice nice brass thimble

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.130 
you it's a nice nice brass thimble
they're<00:03:10.690> pretty<00:03:11.690> cool<00:03:11.870> little<00:03:11.989> fun<00:03:13.989> well<00:03:14.989> it

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
they're pretty cool little fun well it

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.670 
they're pretty cool little fun well it
looks<00:03:15.319> like<00:03:15.379> we<00:03:15.590> got<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:16.959> first<00:03:17.959> coin<00:03:18.349> of<00:03:18.650> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
looks like we got the first coin of the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.300 
looks like we got the first coin of the
site<00:03:19.010> I'm<00:03:19.310> just<00:03:20.150> barely<00:03:21.069> uncovered<00:03:22.069> it<00:03:22.160> right

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
site I'm just barely uncovered it right

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.089 
site I'm just barely uncovered it right
here<00:03:22.609> it<00:03:22.790> looks<00:03:23.150> like<00:03:23.269> it's<00:03:23.540> going<00:03:23.629> to<00:03:23.720> be<00:03:24.099> you

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
here it looks like it's going to be you

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.949 
here it looks like it's going to be you
may<00:03:25.250> be<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.430> penny<00:03:25.760> or<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.120> copper<00:03:26.599> or<00:03:26.720> something

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
may be a penny or a copper or something

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.890 
may be a penny or a copper or something
like<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:28.959> there's<00:03:30.069> well<00:03:31.069> there's<00:03:31.900> distinct

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
like that there's well there's distinct

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.180 
like that there's well there's distinct
outline<00:03:33.049> of<00:03:33.260> Lincoln's<00:03:33.709> head<00:03:33.919> so<00:03:34.540> my<00:03:35.540> guess<00:03:36.190> is

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
outline of Lincoln's head so my guess is

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.809 
outline of Lincoln's head so my guess is
it's<00:03:38.030> probably<00:03:38.389> going<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.930> be<00:03:39.019> a<00:03:39.790> wheat<00:03:40.790> penny

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
it's probably going to be a wheat penny

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.610 
it's probably going to be a wheat penny
of<00:03:41.269> some<00:03:41.510> kind<00:03:41.750> yeah<00:03:42.079> it's<00:03:42.230> definitely<00:03:42.440> a

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
of some kind yeah it's definitely a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.059 
of some kind yeah it's definitely a
wheat<00:03:42.769> penny<00:03:46.989> well<00:03:47.989> like<00:03:48.230> everywhere<00:03:48.650> else<00:03:48.709> in

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
wheat penny well like everywhere else in

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.750 
wheat penny well like everywhere else in
this<00:03:49.190> country<00:03:49.609> we<00:03:50.769> have<00:03:51.769> not<00:03:52.220> had<00:03:52.370> very<00:03:52.400> much

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
this country we have not had very much

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.000 
this country we have not had very much
rain<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.359> I<00:03:53.630> mean<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:53.959> probably<00:03:54.440> say<00:03:54.739> we've<00:03:54.889> had

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
rain and I mean I probably say we've had

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.539 
rain and I mean I probably say we've had
one<00:03:55.190> good<00:03:55.310> rain<00:03:55.549> all<00:03:55.730> summer<00:03:55.760> long<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:57.549> this

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
one good rain all summer long and this

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.879 
one good rain all summer long and this
ground<00:03:58.910> is<00:03:59.150> about<00:03:59.450> as<00:03:59.599> hard<00:04:00.079> as<00:04:00.200> concrete<00:04:00.380> but

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
ground is about as hard as concrete but

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.670 
ground is about as hard as concrete but
as<00:04:00.980> hard<00:04:01.099> as<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.280> asphalt<00:04:01.519> is<00:04:01.940> right<00:04:02.150> there

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
as hard as that asphalt is right there

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.379 
as hard as that asphalt is right there
so<00:04:03.680> I've<00:04:03.859> been<00:04:03.980> chipping<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.760> digging<00:04:05.299> on

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
so I've been chipping and digging on

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.000 
so I've been chipping and digging on
this<00:04:05.540> hole<00:04:05.750> right<00:04:05.900> here<00:04:05.959> for<00:04:06.349> about<00:04:06.560> about

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
this hole right here for about about

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.550 
this hole right here for about about
five<00:04:07.730> or<00:04:07.879> ten<00:04:08.030> minutes<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.480> finally<00:04:09.349> got<00:04:09.470> the

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
five or ten minutes and finally got the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.809 
five or ten minutes and finally got the
target<00:04:09.889> out<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.099> the<00:04:10.160> ground<00:04:10.280> will<00:04:10.489> show<00:04:10.669> it<00:04:10.790> to

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
target out of the ground will show it to

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.470 
target out of the ground will show it to
you<00:04:10.970> real<00:04:11.180> quick<00:04:12.609> we<00:04:13.609> ended<00:04:13.849> up<00:04:13.940> with<00:04:14.150> was<00:04:14.450> a

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
nice little about a half of the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.640 
nice little about a half of the
harmonica<00:04:16.700> read<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:18.669> it's<00:04:19.669> nice<00:04:19.849> little<00:04:20.150> relic

and just flip the flip to target out of
the<00:04:40.540> hole<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.500> can<00:04:41.650> see<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.010> eye<00:04:42.490> can<00:04:42.850> see

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
the hole and I can see the eye can see

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.300 
the hole and I can see the eye can see
it<00:04:43.120> actually<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.690> dirt<00:04:43.870> and<00:04:44.140> I<00:04:44.950> wanted<00:04:45.250> to

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
it actually in the dirt and I wanted to

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.540 
it actually in the dirt and I wanted to
show<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:45.630> what<00:04:46.630> what<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:47.080> have<00:04:47.290> here<00:04:47.550> don't

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
show you what what I have here don't

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.860 
show you what what I have here don't
know<00:04:48.610> exactly<00:04:48.970> what<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:49.540> we'll<00:04:49.690> take<00:04:49.840> a

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
know exactly what it is but we'll take a

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.650 
know exactly what it is but we'll take a
look<00:04:50.050> at<00:04:50.170> it<00:04:50.320> together<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:51.300> I'd<00:04:52.300> say<00:04:52.510> it<00:04:52.630> looks

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
look at it together and I'd say it looks

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.500 
look at it together and I'd say it looks
like<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:54.010> edge<00:04:54.160> of<00:04:54.340> a<00:04:54.430> coin<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:54.970> we'll<00:04:55.150> we'll

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
like the edge of a coin so we'll we'll

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.930 
like the edge of a coin so we'll we'll
find<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:55.840> out<00:04:55.960> here<00:04:56.290> just<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.530> sec<00:04:56.790> let's<00:04:57.790> take

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
find that out here just a sec let's take

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.590 
find that out here just a sec let's take
a<00:04:58.000> look<00:04:58.270> at<00:04:58.360> what<00:04:58.480> we<00:04:58.600> got<00:04:58.780> here<00:05:00.180> you<00:05:01.180> see<00:05:01.510> it

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
a look at what we got here you see it

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.220 
a look at what we got here you see it
right<00:05:01.810> there<00:05:01.840> in<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.290> side<00:05:02.620> of<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:04.230> dirt

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
right there in the side of the dirt

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.670 
right there in the side of the dirt
there<00:05:06.030> like<00:05:07.030> some<00:05:07.300> kind<00:05:07.570> of<00:05:07.600> a<00:05:07.690> copper<00:05:07.960> or<00:05:08.410> such

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
there like some kind of a copper or such

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:19.430 
there like some kind of a copper or such
so<00:05:09.300> go<00:05:10.300> ahead<00:05:10.360> and<00:05:11.460> break<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:12.610> out<00:05:12.730> of<00:05:12.880> here

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.320 

alright<00:05:20.440> so<00:05:20.710> we<00:05:20.830> got<00:05:20.860> us<00:05:21.160> in<00:05:21.310> nineteen<00:05:21.760> I<00:05:22.180> mean

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
alright so we got us in nineteen I mean

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.420 
alright so we got us in nineteen I mean
a<00:05:22.360> two<00:05:22.630> thousand<00:05:23.110> and<00:05:26.100> now<00:05:27.100> you<00:05:27.130> know<00:05:27.310> what

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
a two thousand and now you know what

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.120 
a two thousand and now you know what
year<00:05:27.700> it<00:05:27.990> is<00:05:28.990> but<00:05:29.440> it<00:05:29.530> basically<00:05:29.680> it's<00:05:30.100> a

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
year it is but it basically it's a

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.760 
year it is but it basically it's a
modern<00:05:30.310> quarter<00:05:30.870> once<00:05:31.870> at<00:05:32.080> least<00:05:32.110> that<00:05:32.560> last

to the late eighteen hundred turn of the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.720 
to the late eighteen hundred turn of the
century<00:05:42.580> I<00:05:43.470> you<00:05:44.470> might<00:05:44.860> at<00:05:44.950> least<00:05:44.980> hope<00:05:45.430> for<00:05:45.700> a

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
century I you might at least hope for a

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.270 
century I you might at least hope for a
V<00:05:46.300> nickel<00:05:46.720> or<00:05:46.930> some<00:05:47.260> kind<00:05:47.470> of<00:05:47.530> old<00:05:47.710> copper<00:05:48.130> like

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.020 
V nickel or some kind of old copper like
that<00:05:48.550> but<00:05:49.020> how<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.190> state<00:05:51.190> quarter<00:05:51.520> it<00:05:51.760> actually

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
that but how a state quarter it actually

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.760

here I guess one of the construction

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.710 
here I guess one of the construction
workers<00:05:56.640> dropped<00:05:57.640> that<00:05:57.850> one<00:05:58.090> but<00:05:58.330> we<00:05:58.450> did<00:05:58.600> make

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720
