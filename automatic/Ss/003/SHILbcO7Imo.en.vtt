this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.559> an<00:00:13.679> interesting<00:00:13.950> sort<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.700> hybrid

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
this is an interesting sort of hybrid

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.019 
this is an interesting sort of hybrid
looking<00:00:15.780> aircraft<00:00:16.410> as<00:00:16.770> some<00:00:17.160> styling<00:00:17.760> cues

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.750 
looking aircraft as some styling cues
that<00:00:18.300> would<00:00:18.539> remind<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> v-22<00:00:20.130> Osprey

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
that would remind you of the v-22 Osprey

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.390 
that would remind you of the v-22 Osprey
but<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.020> title<00:00:22.380> suggests<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:23.340> is

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
but like the title suggests this is

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.230 
but like the title suggests this is

main fixed pitch rotor blades they are
independently<00:00:30.840> driven<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.349> then<00:00:31.470> you've<00:00:31.650> got

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
independently driven and then you've got

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.030 
independently driven and then you've got
a<00:00:31.890> couple<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.279> flaps<00:00:32.700> under<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.510> this

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
a couple of flaps under here with this

a couple of flaps under here with this
semi-transparent<00:00:35.040> material<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.760> make<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.940> so

semi-transparent material to make it so

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.580 
semi-transparent material to make it so
you<00:00:36.180> don't<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:36.840> much<00:00:37.140> when<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.500> in

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you don't see it very much when it's in

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.560 
you don't see it very much when it's in
the<00:00:37.680> air<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:38.040> tough<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.790> explain<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.360> words

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the air it's tough to explain in words

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.630 
the air it's tough to explain in words
how<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.170> thing<00:00:40.379> why<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.010> I'll<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.399> leave

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
how this thing why so I'll just leave

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.760 
how this thing why so I'll just leave
the<00:00:41.879> words<00:00:42.090> aside<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.110> show<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.500> how<00:00:43.710> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the words aside and show you how it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
the words aside and show you how it
flies<00:00:43.980> right<00:00:44.399> after<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.760> show<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
flies right after I show you the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.959 
flies right after I show you the
controller<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.500> you've<00:00:47.010> got<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.430> throttle

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
controller so you've got your throttle

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.060 
controller so you've got your throttle
control<00:00:48.329> over<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> left<00:00:49.440> hand<00:00:49.710> stick

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
control over here on the left hand stick

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.040 
control over here on the left hand stick
and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> right<00:00:50.820> hand<00:00:51.000> stick<00:00:51.329> well

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and then on the right hand stick well

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.529 
and then on the right hand stick well
this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.530> usual<00:00:53.309> you've<00:00:53.699> got<00:00:53.940> three

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this is not usual you've got three

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
this is not usual you've got three
different<00:00:54.989> main<00:00:55.289> positions<00:00:55.949> front<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> back

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
different main positions front to back

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.209 
different main positions front to back
where<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> gets<00:00:57.719> stuck<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.590> there<00:00:58.770> you

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
where it kind of gets stuck in there you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.650 
where it kind of gets stuck in there you
can<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.399> left<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> right<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.239> fine<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
can go left to right just fine and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
can go left to right just fine and
there's<00:01:00.809> also<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.260> extra<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:01.920> forward

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
there's also one extra little forward

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.609 
there's also one extra little forward
position<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.660> little<00:01:03.930> higher<00:01:04.199> than<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
position just a little higher than the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.460 
position just a little higher than the
upper<00:01:04.920> position<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.909> all<00:01:06.119> very<00:01:06.540> unusual<00:01:07.229> but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
upper position it's all very unusual but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.990 
upper position it's all very unusual but
again<00:01:07.860> I'll<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.280> show<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.520> how<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.760> works

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
again I'll just show you how it works

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.630 
again I'll just show you how it works
there<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.479> two<00:01:09.869> trims<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:10.920> left<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
there are two trims here one for left to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
there are two trims here one for left to
right<00:01:11.850> turning<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.380> left

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
right turning and one for actually left

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280 
right turning and one for actually left
to<00:01:14.070> right<00:01:14.310> banking<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.840> there<00:01:16.080> are<00:01:16.200> these

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to right banking then there are these

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.749 
to right banking then there are these
four<00:01:16.650> buttons<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> middle<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.700> those

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
four buttons in the middle and those

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.859 
four buttons in the middle and those
just<00:01:18.000> give<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.299> access<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.689> some

just give you access to some

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.289 
just give you access to some
pre-programmed<00:01:19.860> flight<00:01:20.250> maneuvers<00:01:20.880> they

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
pre-programmed flight maneuvers they

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.330 
pre-programmed flight maneuvers they
really<00:01:21.570> aren't<00:01:21.750> separate<00:01:22.170> controls<00:01:22.650> no

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
really aren't separate controls no

the flight of the Air Hogs heli twister
it<00:01:35.310> only<00:01:35.460> took<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:35.939> trimming<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.630> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it only took a little trimming to get it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.499 
it only took a little trimming to get it
stable<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:39.350> ah-ah-ah-ah<00:01:41.119> that's<00:01:42.119> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
stable and then ah-ah-ah-ah that's just

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.429 
stable and then ah-ah-ah-ah that's just
not<00:01:42.750> fair<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:44.009> too<00:01:44.399> cool<00:01:45.229> honestly

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
not fair that is too cool honestly

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.950 
not fair that is too cool honestly
technically<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.759> gimmick<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.689> real

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
technically it's a gimmick the real

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.350 
technically it's a gimmick the real
functional<00:01:49.710> part<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> craft<00:01:50.790> doesn't

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
functional part of the craft doesn't

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.179 
functional part of the craft doesn't
actually<00:01:51.540> turn<00:01:52.140> upside<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.009> see

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
actually turn upside down you can see

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
actually turn upside down you can see
that<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.640> rotor<00:01:54.360> blades<00:01:54.750> are<00:01:55.079> staying

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
that the rotor blades are staying

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.920 
that the rotor blades are staying
oriented<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> same<00:01:56.579> way<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.540> basically

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
oriented in the same way it's basically

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.590 
oriented in the same way it's basically
that<00:01:58.170> mostly<00:01:58.799> empty<00:01:59.090> fuselage<00:02:00.090> that's<00:02:00.420> just

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
that mostly empty fuselage that's just

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.929 
that mostly empty fuselage that's just
being<00:02:00.780> rotated<00:02:01.049> around<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.310> still<00:02:02.610> looks

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
being rotated around but it still looks

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.209 
being rotated around but it still looks
great<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> fact<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.770> kids

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
great and I know for a fact that kids

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.760 
great and I know for a fact that kids
will<00:02:05.460> love<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.790> trick<00:02:06.420> heck<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.259> had<00:02:07.409> several

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
will love that trick heck I had several

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.100 
will love that trick heck I had several
adults<00:02:08.369> watching<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:09.060> test<00:02:09.360> flight<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.869> all

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
adults watching this test flight and all

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.860 
adults watching this test flight and all
of<00:02:10.259> them<00:02:10.379> are<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.770> cheering

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
of them are just cheering

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.690 
of them are just cheering
is<00:02:12.049> pretty<00:02:12.319> unique<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:12.980> won't<00:02:13.190> find<00:02:13.400> many

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
is pretty unique you won't find many

throughout<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:24.110> flying<00:02:24.470> footage<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.190> was

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
throughout this flying footage I was

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.180 
throughout this flying footage I was
pushing<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.970> four<00:02:26.629> different<00:02:26.900> special<00:02:27.890> trick

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
pushing the four different special trick

pushing the four different special trick
function<00:02:28.670> buttons<00:02:29.060> in<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:29.420> center<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
function buttons in the center of the

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.930 
function buttons in the center of the
controller<00:02:30.379> like<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.010> mentioned<00:02:31.310> before<00:02:31.370> they

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
controller like I mentioned before they

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.729 
controller like I mentioned before they
aren't<00:02:32.180> really<00:02:32.480> different<00:02:32.959> controls<00:02:33.440> they

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
aren't really different controls they

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.160 
aren't really different controls they
just<00:02:33.950> kind<00:02:34.129> of<00:02:34.190> add<00:02:34.400> some<00:02:34.730> spice<00:02:35.150> some<00:02:35.480> variety

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
just kind of add some spice some variety

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.440 
just kind of add some spice some variety
to<00:02:36.530> what<00:02:36.980> your<00:02:37.190> flight<00:02:37.459> looks<00:02:37.760> like<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.360> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
to what your flight looks like but the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.030 
to what your flight looks like but the
main<00:02:38.599> things<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:38.959> you're<00:02:39.200> actually<00:02:39.379> able<00:02:39.799> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
main things that you're actually able to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.069 
main things that you're actually able to
control<00:02:40.370> are<00:02:40.640> spinning<00:02:41.299> as<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.599> see<00:02:41.810> here

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
control are spinning as you see here

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.619 
control are spinning as you see here
which<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.500> just<00:02:42.530> full<00:02:43.250> speed<00:02:43.610> turning<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.480> the

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
which is just full speed turning to the

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.599 
which is just full speed turning to the
left<00:02:45.200> or<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.650> right<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:46.010> can<00:02:46.069> also<00:02:46.190> do<00:02:46.519> it

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
left or to the right you can also do it

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.550 
left or to the right you can also do it
a<00:02:46.700> little<00:02:46.819> bit<00:02:46.970> more<00:02:47.239> slowly<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:48.290> can<00:02:48.410> also

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
a little bit more slowly you can also

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.640 
a little bit more slowly you can also
move<00:02:49.280> forward<00:02:49.760> very<00:02:50.299> slowly<00:02:50.660> that's<00:02:51.260> actually

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
move forward very slowly that's actually

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.619 
move forward very slowly that's actually
forward<00:02:52.010> motion<00:02:52.370> right<00:02:52.519> there<00:02:52.579> when<00:02:53.450> you're

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
forward motion right there when you're

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.809 
forward motion right there when you're
in<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:54.049> normal<00:02:54.500> orientation<00:02:55.430> with<00:02:55.640> the

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
in the normal orientation with the

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.849 
in the normal orientation with the
fuselage<00:02:56.390> horizontal<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.319> then<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:57.829> course

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
fuselage horizontal and then of course

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.250 
fuselage horizontal and then of course
you<00:02:58.159> have<00:02:58.310> your<00:02:58.340> up-and-down<00:02:59.079> controls

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
you have your up-and-down controls

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.099 
you have your up-and-down controls
now<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:00.890> craft<00:03:01.190> does<00:03:01.579> not<00:03:01.790> have<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.510> gyro

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
now this craft does not have a gyro

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.979 
now this craft does not have a gyro
system<00:03:03.769> for<00:03:04.129> yaw<00:03:04.489> or<00:03:04.790> for<00:03:05.150> turning<00:03:05.569> but

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
system for yaw or for turning but

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.360 
system for yaw or for turning but
thankfully<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:06.500> doesn't<00:03:06.680> seem<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.099> really

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
thankfully it doesn't seem to really

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.580 
thankfully it doesn't seem to really
need<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:07.819> it's<00:03:08.000> pretty<00:03:08.359> stable<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.079> it's<00:03:09.260> left

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
need it it's pretty stable and it's left

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.470 
need it it's pretty stable and it's left
to<00:03:09.709> right<00:03:09.980> turning<00:03:10.280> it<00:03:10.430> does<00:03:10.579> tend<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:10.940> drift

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
to right turning it does tend to drift

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.270 
to right turning it does tend to drift
around<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.290> its<00:03:12.470> turns<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:13.010> little<00:03:13.159> bit

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
around in its turns a little bit

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.089 
around in its turns a little bit
sometimes<00:03:13.940> doing<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.599> little<00:03:15.290> bit<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.859> turn

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
sometimes doing a little bit of a turn

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.099 
sometimes doing a little bit of a turn
that<00:03:16.370> you're<00:03:16.519> not<00:03:16.669> really<00:03:16.880> asking<00:03:17.120> for<00:03:17.389> but

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
that you're not really asking for but

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.780 
that you're not really asking for but
it's<00:03:18.260> very<00:03:18.470> controllable<00:03:19.069> it<00:03:19.370> doesn't<00:03:19.639> feel

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
it's very controllable it doesn't feel

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.670 
it's very controllable it doesn't feel
like<00:03:19.849> it's<00:03:20.180> getting<00:03:20.389> away<00:03:20.660> from<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.169> it

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
like it's getting away from you it

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.309 
like it's getting away from you it
actually<00:03:21.889> does<00:03:22.340> have<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.609> gyro<00:03:23.180> on<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.720> pitch

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
actually does have a gyro on the pitch

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.430 
actually does have a gyro on the pitch
axis<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:25.400> tilting<00:03:26.030> forward<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.840> back<00:03:27.109> and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
axis the tilting forward to back and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.379 
axis the tilting forward to back and
that<00:03:27.799> keeps<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.129> from<00:03:28.190> moving<00:03:28.549> forward<00:03:28.849> too

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
that keeps it from moving forward too

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.659 
that keeps it from moving forward too
fast<00:03:29.720> or<00:03:30.049> from<00:03:30.349> moving<00:03:30.560> forward<00:03:30.859> or<00:03:31.190> backward

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
fast or from moving forward or backward

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
initial footage where I tried to fly it

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.589 
initial footage where I tried to fly it
in<00:03:53.419> a<00:03:53.540> small<00:03:53.989> room<00:03:54.379> simply<00:03:54.980> put<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.519> tried<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.239> I

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
in a small room simply put I tried and I

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.470 
in a small room simply put I tried and I
failed<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.650> heli<00:03:57.829> twister<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.489> very<00:03:58.940> very

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
failed the heli twister is very very

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.229 
failed the heli twister is very very
sensitive<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.440> motion<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.519> air<00:04:01.790> so<00:04:02.209> you

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
sensitive to motion of the air so you

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.599 
sensitive to motion of the air so you
definitely<00:04:02.989> cannot<00:04:03.470> fly<00:04:03.769> it<00:04:03.829> outdoors<00:04:04.129> if

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
definitely cannot fly it outdoors if

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.580 
definitely cannot fly it outdoors if
there's<00:04:04.819> any<00:04:05.060> breeze<00:04:05.449> whatsoever<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.440> also

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
there's any breeze whatsoever it's also

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.979 
there's any breeze whatsoever it's also
infrared<00:04:07.310> control<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.239> does<00:04:08.389> not<00:04:08.510> do<00:04:08.750> well

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
infrared control so it does not do well

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.659 
infrared control so it does not do well
in<00:04:09.019> sunlight<00:04:09.680> but<00:04:10.129> the<00:04:10.250> reason<00:04:10.519> that<00:04:10.609> I

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
in sunlight but the reason that I

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.879 
in sunlight but the reason that I
couldn't<00:04:10.970> fly<00:04:11.239> it<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.660> small<00:04:12.109> room<00:04:12.440> is<00:04:12.680> that

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
couldn't fly it in a small room is that

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.729 
couldn't fly it in a small room is that
it<00:04:13.129> was<00:04:13.280> making<00:04:13.730> its<00:04:13.940> own<00:04:14.150> wind<00:04:14.720> with<00:04:15.440> two

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
it was making its own wind with two

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.490 
it was making its own wind with two
large<00:04:16.449> counter-rotating<00:04:17.449> main<00:04:17.690> rotors<00:04:18.139> it

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
large counter-rotating main rotors it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.140 
large counter-rotating main rotors it
was<00:04:18.650> just<00:04:18.889> too<00:04:19.070> much<00:04:19.250> turbulence<00:04:19.639> for<00:04:20.030> the

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
was just too much turbulence for the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.909 
was just too much turbulence for the
thing<00:04:20.329> to<00:04:20.450> handle<00:04:20.780> I<00:04:20.930> recommend<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.650> fly

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
thing to handle I recommend that you fly

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.770 
thing to handle I recommend that you fly
the<00:04:21.979> heli<00:04:22.250> twister<00:04:22.760> in<00:04:22.969> an<00:04:23.090> area<00:04:23.390> that's<00:04:23.599> at

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
the heli twister in an area that's at

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.689 
the heli twister in an area that's at
least<00:04:23.810> 12<00:04:24.530> by<00:04:24.800> 12

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
least 12 by 12

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.340 
least 12 by 12
with<00:04:25.940> at<00:04:26.060> least<00:04:26.240> five<00:04:26.510> or<00:04:26.720> six<00:04:26.960> feet<00:04:27.199> of

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
with at least five or six feet of

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.469 
with at least five or six feet of
vertical<00:04:27.650> space<00:04:28.040> that's<00:04:28.490> completely<00:04:28.940> clear

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
vertical space that's completely clear

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.780 
vertical space that's completely clear
and<00:04:29.720> free<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.199> obstacles<00:04:30.350> if<00:04:31.130> you've<00:04:31.370> got<00:04:31.610> the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
and free of obstacles if you've got the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.040 
and free of obstacles if you've got the
space<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.270> think<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.660> this<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:33.020> a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
space I think that this is a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.800 
space I think that this is a
well-designed<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.400> very<00:04:34.669> enjoyable<00:04:34.940> product

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
well-designed and very enjoyable product

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.210 
well-designed and very enjoyable product
and<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.320> price<00:04:36.530> makes<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:36.949> a<00:04:37.040> pretty

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
and the price makes it a pretty

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.550 
and the price makes it a pretty
respectable<00:04:37.850> value<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.870> wraps<00:04:39.110> things<00:04:39.229> up

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
respectable value that wraps things up

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.200 
respectable value that wraps things up
