headsets<00:00:56.680> so<00:00:57.340> there's<00:00:57.730> kind<00:00:58.180> of<00:00:58.210> a<00:00:58.300> newer

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
headsets so there's kind of a newer

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.150 
headsets so there's kind of a newer
technology<00:00:58.750> out<00:00:59.170> now<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.380> lot<00:00:59.530> of<00:00:59.740> people<00:01:00.100> are

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
technology out now a lot of people are

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.200 
technology out now a lot of people are
releasing<00:01:00.430> these<00:01:00.640> stereo<00:01:00.910> Bluetooth

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
releasing these stereo Bluetooth

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.970

other class 1 Bluetooth devices are much

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.660 
other class 1 Bluetooth devices are much
bigger<00:02:02.200> because<00:02:02.560> of<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:02.920> higher<00:02:03.069> power<00:02:03.340> radio

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
bigger because of the higher power radio

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.929 
bigger because of the higher power radio

Salil<00:02:38.230> folder<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.340> open<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.700> program

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
Salil folder and you open the program

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.479 
Salil folder and you open the program
once<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.079> open<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.379> program<00:02:41.620> you'll<00:02:42.189> notice

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
once you open the program you'll notice

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.099 
once you open the program you'll notice
a<00:02:42.609> big<00:02:42.640> orange<00:02:43.090> ball<00:02:43.450> in<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.689> middle<00:02:43.930> and

a big orange ball in the middle and

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.410 
a big orange ball in the middle and
you'll<00:02:44.680> notice<00:02:44.980> like<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.129> little<00:02:45.430> orbit<00:02:46.180> ring

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
you'll notice like a little orbit ring

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.780 
you'll notice like a little orbit ring
that<00:02:46.780> goes<00:02:46.989> around<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.500> orange<00:02:47.650> ball<00:02:47.859> once

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
that goes around the orange ball once

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.280 
that goes around the orange ball once
you<00:02:48.909> click<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.269> orange<00:02:49.480> ball<00:02:49.659> you'll<00:02:50.019> start

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
you click the orange ball you'll start

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.110 
you click the orange ball you'll start
noticing<00:02:50.650> devices<00:02:51.280> appear<00:02:51.670> around<00:02:51.819> your

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
noticing devices appear around your

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.180 
noticing devices appear around your
orbit<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.780> then<00:02:53.349> what<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.739> do<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.040> you

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
orbit and then what you can do is you

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.000 
orbit and then what you can do is you
can<00:02:54.370> actually<00:02:54.579> go<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.659> specific<00:02:56.500> device<00:02:56.739> for

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
can actually go to a specific device for

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.649 
can actually go to a specific device for
example<00:02:57.099> like<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.549> headset<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.269> can

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
example like a headset you can

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.690 
example like a headset you can
right-click<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.349> and<00:02:59.379> you<00:02:59.950> can<00:03:00.159> click<00:03:00.310> pair

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
right-click it and you can click pair

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.030 
right-click it and you can click pair
and<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.629> I'll<00:03:01.720> prompt<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.260> for<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.560> security

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
and then I'll prompt you for a security

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.250 
and then I'll prompt you for a security
code<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.400> there<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.700> security<00:03:04.030> code<00:03:04.389> usually

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
code if there is a security code usually

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.569 
code if there is a security code usually
it's<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> four-digit<00:03:06.040> code

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
it's a four-digit code

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.879 
it's a four-digit code
most<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> time<00:03:07.209> devices<00:03:07.810> use<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.439> default<00:03:08.769> of

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
most the time devices use the default of

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.220 
most the time devices use the default of
zero<00:03:09.159> zero<00:03:09.459> zero<00:03:09.549> zero<00:03:09.849> so<00:03:10.840> in<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.019> case

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
zero zero zero zero so in this case

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.960 
zero zero zero zero so in this case
we're<00:03:11.379> gonna<00:03:11.500> put<00:03:11.650> zero<00:03:11.889> zero<00:03:12.159> zero<00:03:12.189> zero<00:03:12.519> in

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
we're gonna put zero zero zero zero in

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.460 
we're gonna put zero zero zero zero in
and<00:03:13.209> we're<00:03:13.870> going<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.079> connect<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.319> the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
and we're going to connect to the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.170 
and we're going to connect to the
Bluetooth<00:03:14.829> headset<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.519> now<00:03:15.790> we<00:03:15.849> can

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
Bluetooth headset and now we can

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.660 
Bluetooth headset and now we can
actually<00:03:16.329> stream<00:03:16.720> audio<00:03:17.260> from<00:03:17.680> our<00:03:18.250> computer

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
actually stream audio from our computer

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.449 
actually stream audio from our computer
to<00:03:18.849> our<00:03:18.879> Bluetooth<00:03:19.450> stereo<00:03:19.870> headset<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.739> you

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
to our Bluetooth stereo headset and you

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.490 
to our Bluetooth stereo headset and you
can<00:03:21.609> actually<00:03:21.790> add<00:03:22.060> more<00:03:22.420> than<00:03:22.900> one<00:03:23.019> device<00:03:23.170> if

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
can actually add more than one device if

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.929 
can actually add more than one device if
needed<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.129> if<00:03:24.370> you<00:03:24.430> need<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.639> pair<00:03:24.760> another

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
needed so if you need to pair another

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.729 
needed so if you need to pair another
device<00:03:25.269> just<00:03:25.870> right-click<00:03:26.290> on<00:03:26.379> that<00:03:26.530> device

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
device just right-click on that device

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.680 
device just right-click on that device
and<00:03:27.069> click<00:03:27.129> pair<00:03:27.400> device<00:03:27.669> and<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.150> repeat<00:03:28.599> the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
and click pair device and and repeat the

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.470 
and click pair device and and repeat the
steps<00:03:28.870> again<00:03:29.199> so<00:03:29.919> it's<00:03:30.040> very<00:03:30.160> easy<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:31.269> use

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
steps again so it's very easy to use

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.629 
steps again so it's very easy to use
very<00:03:31.629> intuitive<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.129> top<00:03:33.340> here<00:03:33.609> you

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
very intuitive and on the top here you

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.789 
very intuitive and on the top here you
also<00:03:33.940> have<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.810> list<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.169> services<00:03:35.379> it

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
also have the list of services it

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.259 
also have the list of services it
provides<00:03:35.829> for<00:03:36.340> each<00:03:36.400> device<00:03:36.730> just<00:03:37.000> makes<00:03:37.150> it
