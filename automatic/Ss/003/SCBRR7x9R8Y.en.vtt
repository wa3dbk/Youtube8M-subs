and help form from our coils like I said

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.980 
and help form from our coils like I said
it<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.920> important<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:09.030> make<00:01:09.270> sure<00:01:09.299> that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it is so important to make sure that

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
it is so important to make sure that
your<00:01:10.380> hair<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.799> wet<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:11.760> important

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
your hair is wet and it's also important

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.550 
your hair is wet and it's also important
that<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:12.659> use<00:01:12.869> enough<00:01:13.110> product

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that you would use enough product

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.750 
that you would use enough product
because<00:01:13.740> sometimes<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.189> don't<00:01:14.280> use<00:01:14.580> enough

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
because sometimes we don't use enough

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.700 
because sometimes we don't use enough
product<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:16.020> sometimes<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.409> use<00:01:16.560> too

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
product but then sometimes we use too

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.920 
product but then sometimes we use too
much<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.189> find<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.790> balance<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.659> that

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
much so just find that balance so that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.810 
much so just find that balance so that
you're<00:01:19.229> using<00:01:19.439> enough<00:01:19.770> product<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.400> clump

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you're using enough product to clump

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
you're using enough product to clump
your<00:01:21.060> coils<00:01:21.390> together<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.590> use<00:01:22.710> my

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
your coils together I like to use my

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.190 
your coils together I like to use my
fingers<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.640> process<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.750> there<00:01:25.080> are

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
fingers for this process but there are

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.630 
fingers for this process but there are
other<00:01:25.380> tools<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.040> use<00:01:26.280> i'll<00:01:26.460> show

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you a little bit later because my hair

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.649

is<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.250> short<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> sides<00:01:29.970> i<00:01:30.240> don't

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
is so short on the sides i don't

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.840 
is so short on the sides i don't
necessarily<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.650> use<00:01:31.950> anything<00:01:32.250> else<00:01:32.579> i

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
necessarily have to use anything else i

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.510

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
so i have to take a little bit more time

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
so i have to take a little bit more time
in<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.799> section<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:45.090> sometimes

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
in that section and because sometimes

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.899 
in that section and because sometimes
i'm<00:01:45.780> impatient<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:47.159> takes<00:01:47.610> too<00:01:47.880> long

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
i'm impatient that just takes too long

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
i'm impatient that just takes too long
for<00:01:48.119> me<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.049> see<00:01:49.259> me<00:01:49.439> starting<00:01:49.860> from
