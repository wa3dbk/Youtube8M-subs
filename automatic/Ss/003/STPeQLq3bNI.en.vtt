00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.160 
laughter yet he actually is at a stand
point<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.120> where<00:04:30.210> he<00:04:30.300> hasn't<00:04:30.600> chose<00:04:30.750> which<00:04:31.020> is

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
point to where he hasn't chose which is

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.680 
point to where he hasn't chose which is
the<00:04:31.290> dominant<00:04:31.770> side<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:32.100> ants<00:04:32.310> or<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:33.240> human

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
the dominant side the ants or the human

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.330 
the dominant side the ants or the human
and<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:34.230> is<00:04:34.410> interesting<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.040> way<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.160> get

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
and that is interesting the way you get

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.620 
and that is interesting the way you get
to<00:04:35.370> see<00:04:35.580> like<00:04:35.730> these<00:04:35.820> shadows<00:04:36.240> of<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.450> ant

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
to see like these shadows of the ant

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.300 
to see like these shadows of the ant
above<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.050> king<00:04:37.230> even<00:04:37.530> got<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.800> human<00:04:38.010> side

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
above the king even got the human side

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.100 
above the king even got the human side
it<00:04:38.670> was<00:04:38.820> really<00:04:39.180> cool<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.510> way<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.630> artistic

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
it was really cool the way the artistic

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.840 
it was really cool the way the artistic
style<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.740> was<00:04:40.890> done<00:04:41.070> with<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.280> music<00:04:41.670> and

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
style that was done with the music and

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.040 
style that was done with the music and
all<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.450> felt<00:04:42.690> like<00:04:42.780> that<00:04:42.900> was<00:04:42.960> really

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
all that I felt like that was really

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.840 
all that I felt like that was really
emphasized<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.860> what<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.220> really<00:04:44.430> going<00:04:44.520> on

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
emphasized of what is really going on

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.370 
emphasized of what is really going on
with<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.030> king<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.570> king<00:04:45.780> could<00:04:45.900> still<00:04:46.170> grow

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
with the king the king could still grow

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.020 
with the king the king could still grow
