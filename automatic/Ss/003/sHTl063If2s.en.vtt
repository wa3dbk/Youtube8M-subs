00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.670 
even the plastic in here is recyclable
so<00:02:23.240> move<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.690> out<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.020> way<00:02:25.060> pop<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.680> so

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
so move that out of the way pop this so

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.890 
so move that out of the way pop this so
as<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:27.830> can<00:02:27.950> see<00:02:28.010> this<00:02:28.370> device<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.970> extremely

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
as you can see this device is extremely

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.250 
as you can see this device is extremely
tiny<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:30.800> comparison<00:02:31.360> here's<00:02:32.360> an<00:02:32.540> iPhone<00:02:32.930> 4s

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
tiny in comparison here's an iPhone 4s

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.890 
tiny in comparison here's an iPhone 4s
specifically<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> shattered<00:02:34.819> one<00:02:35.030> here's<00:02:35.720> the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
specifically a shattered one here's the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.750 
specifically a shattered one here's the
difference<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.380> size<00:02:36.620> they<00:02:37.280> have<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.550> same

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
difference in size they have the same

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.940 
difference in size they have the same
exact<00:02:38.180> screen<00:02:38.569> size<00:02:38.900> apparently<00:02:39.500> even<00:02:39.709> though

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
exact screen size apparently even though

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.260 
exact screen size apparently even though
it<00:02:40.069> looks<00:02:40.220> like<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.490> iPhone<00:02:40.819> has<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.000> bigger

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
it looks like the iPhone has a bigger

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.140 
it looks like the iPhone has a bigger
screen<00:02:42.160> they<00:02:43.160> both<00:02:43.400> have<00:02:43.580> three<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> half

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
screen they both have three and a half

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.820 
screen they both have three and a half
inch<00:02:44.360> screens<00:02:44.689> but<00:02:45.170> as<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.349> can<00:02:45.439> see<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
inch screens but as you can see the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.210 
inch screens but as you can see the
iPhone<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.519> much<00:02:46.939> bigger<00:02:48.010> so

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
iPhone is much bigger so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.850 
iPhone is much bigger so
the<00:02:49.340> device<00:02:49.610> out<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.940> way<00:02:50.090> for<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.300> minutes

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
the device out of the way for a minutes

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.260 
the device out of the way for a minutes
or<00:02:51.860> Meath<00:02:52.040> here<00:02:52.310> we've<00:02:52.460> got<00:02:52.670> an<00:02:52.790> activation

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
or Meath here we've got an activation

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.600 
or Meath here we've got an activation
and<00:02:53.750> service<00:02:54.530> guide<00:02:54.740> that<00:02:54.950> comes<00:02:55.160> with<00:02:55.430> this

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
and service guide that comes with this

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.810 
and service guide that comes with this
then<00:02:55.880> we<00:02:57.130> also<00:02:58.130> get<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.490> back<00:02:58.700> which<00:02:59.030> is<00:03:00.820> not

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
then we also get it back which is not

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.190 
then we also get it back which is not
the<00:03:01.970> best<00:03:02.120> material<00:03:02.300> in<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.750> world<00:03:02.900> but<00:03:03.050> it's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
the best material in the world but it's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.500 
the best material in the world but it's
not<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.500> worst<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.250> actually<00:03:04.520> feels<00:03:04.730> nice<00:03:05.480> and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
not the worst it actually feels nice and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.290 
not the worst it actually feels nice and
and<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.020> has<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.170> nice<00:03:06.410> grippy<00:03:06.890> texture<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.520> it

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
and it has a nice grippy texture and it

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.050 
and it has a nice grippy texture and it
actually<00:03:08.480> feels<00:03:08.810> really<00:03:09.170> nice<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.790> in<00:03:11.030> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
actually feels really nice and in the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:25.030 
actually feels really nice and in the
bottom<00:03:11.830> we<00:03:12.830> have<00:03:12.890> our<00:03:13.040> battery<00:03:22.810> on<00:03:23.810> not<00:03:24.800> one<00:03:25.010> of

bottom we have our battery on not one of

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.810 
bottom we have our battery on not one of
these<00:03:25.360> no<00:03:26.770> oh<00:03:27.770> I<00:03:27.950> thought<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.310> would<00:03:28.400> open<00:03:28.550> at

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
these no oh I thought it would open at

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.760 
these no oh I thought it would open at
the<00:03:28.910> top<00:03:29.090> that's<00:03:29.390> annoying<00:03:29.660> whatever<00:03:30.350> we'll

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
the top that's annoying whatever we'll

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.300 
the top that's annoying whatever we'll
get<00:03:30.890> our<00:03:30.980> package<00:03:31.370> openers<00:03:31.790> out<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:36.160> all<00:03:37.160> the

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
whatever and how many more a prize is it

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:53.020 
whatever and how many more a prize is it
oh<00:03:51.610> there<00:03:52.610> it<00:03:52.760> is

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
oh there it is

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.870 
oh there it is
so<00:03:53.920> 1709<00:03:54.920> powers<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.489> bit<00:03:55.670> of<00:03:55.700> an

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
so 1709 powers so a bit of an

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.820 
so 1709 powers so a bit of an
improvement<00:03:56.239> over<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:57.140> original<00:03:57.170> battery

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
improvement over the original battery

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.720 
improvement over the original battery
which<00:03:58.190> was<00:03:58.400> much<00:03:59.330> much<00:03:59.690> smaller<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:01.489> on<00:04:01.610> this

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
which was much much smaller so on this

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.580 
which was much much smaller so on this
choice<00:04:01.820> we<00:04:02.090> do<00:04:02.209> get<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:02.390> micro<00:04:02.720> SD<00:04:03.019> card<00:04:03.290> slot

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
choice we do get a micro SD card slot

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.690 
choice we do get a micro SD card slot
which<00:04:03.709> is<00:04:03.860> quite<00:04:04.070> nice<00:04:04.220> if<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:04.459> want<00:04:04.640> to

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
which is quite nice if you want to

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.240 
which is quite nice if you want to
increase<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.180> storage<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:06.709> seems<00:04:06.980> to

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
increase the storage and it seems to

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.580 
increase the storage and it seems to
have<00:04:07.430> dual<00:04:08.209> speakers<00:04:08.810> on<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.170> bottom<00:04:09.290> which

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
have dual speakers on the bottom which

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.920 
have dual speakers on the bottom which
is<00:04:09.620> actually<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.100> nice<00:04:10.310> little<00:04:10.610> feature<00:04:10.820> but<00:04:11.690> I

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
is actually a nice little feature but I

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.060 
is actually a nice little feature but I
don't<00:04:12.170> know<00:04:12.260> if<00:04:12.320> those<00:04:12.470> are<00:04:12.650> speakers<00:04:12.830> they

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
don't know if those are speakers they

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.470 
don't know if those are speakers they
might<00:04:13.250> just<00:04:13.370> be<00:04:13.489> drivers<00:04:13.910> because<00:04:14.060> I<00:04:14.180> noticed

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
might just be drivers because I noticed

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.900 
might just be drivers because I noticed
that<00:04:14.630> there's<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.900> 3<00:04:15.200> port<00:04:16.100> speaker<00:04:16.580> thing<00:04:16.790> at

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
that there's a 3 port speaker thing at

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.420 
that there's a 3 port speaker thing at
the<00:04:17.000> top<00:04:18.400> let's<00:04:19.400> get<00:04:19.580> our<00:04:19.700> battery<00:04:20.060> in<00:04:21.430> I'm

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
the top let's get our battery in I'm

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:34.370 
the top let's get our battery in I'm
gonna<00:04:28.150> click<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.180> back<00:04:29.479> on

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.370 

and<00:04:35.270> pee<00:04:36.270> off<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.480> screen<00:04:36.840> predictors<00:04:37.230> we

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
and pee off the screen predictors we

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:47.000 
and pee off the screen predictors we
turn<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:39.830> LG<00:04:45.140> so<00:04:46.140> obviously<00:04:46.590> we're<00:04:46.770> running

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
turn it on LG so obviously we're running

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.470 
turn it on LG so obviously we're running
a<00:04:47.070> newer<00:04:47.220> version<00:04:47.490> of<00:04:47.730> Android<00:04:48.060> than<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.300> old

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
a newer version of Android than the old

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.180 
a newer version of Android than the old
Gingerbread<00:04:49.260> so<00:04:49.440> let's<00:04:49.590> take<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.770> hardware

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
Gingerbread so let's take a hardware

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.310 
Gingerbread so let's take a hardware
tour<00:04:50.430> on<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:51.150> top<00:04:51.390> of<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.750> screen<00:04:51.990> we<00:04:52.170> have<00:04:52.200> a

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
tour on the top of the screen we have a

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.950 
tour on the top of the screen we have a
verizon<00:04:52.920> logo<00:04:53.280> not<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.240> prettiest<00:04:54.600> thing<00:04:54.690> to

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
verizon logo not the prettiest thing to

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.930

a microphone on the very top we have a

a microphone on the very top we have a
3.5<00:05:14.430> millimeter<00:05:15.270> headphone<00:05:15.300> jack<00:05:15.690> on<00:05:16.320> this

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
3.5 millimeter headphone jack on this

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.380 
3.5 millimeter headphone jack on this
side<00:05:17.190> we<00:05:17.310> have<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.430> power<00:05:17.640> lock<00:05:17.970> button<00:05:18.270> which

side we have a power lock button which

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.690 
side we have a power lock button which
is<00:05:18.510> odd<00:05:18.690> for<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.960> phone<00:05:19.140> of<00:05:19.290> this<00:05:19.410> size<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.340> on

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
is odd for a phone of this size and on

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.400 
is odd for a phone of this size and on
this<00:05:20.910> side<00:05:21.150> we<00:05:21.360> just<00:05:21.390> have<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.780> volume<00:05:22.170> rocker

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
this side we just have a volume rocker

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.770 
this side we just have a volume rocker
on<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:23.280> back<00:05:23.460> we<00:05:23.640> have<00:05:23.670> the<00:05:23.850> nice<00:05:24.060> really<00:05:24.600> nice

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
on the back we have the nice really nice

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.260 
on the back we have the nice really nice
actually<00:05:25.020> textured<00:05:25.680> back<00:05:25.890> with<00:05:26.730> the<00:05:26.970> three

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
actually textured back with the three

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.360 
actually textured back with the three
megapixel<00:05:27.810> camera<00:05:28.170> three<00:05:28.740> port<00:05:28.980> speakers

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
megapixel camera three port speakers

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.260 
megapixel camera three port speakers
Verizon<00:05:29.940> logo<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.570> LG<00:05:31.230> logos<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:33.000> first

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
Verizon logo and LG logos so first

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.880 
Verizon logo and LG logos so first
second<00:05:33.690> I<00:05:33.780> thought<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.200> the<00:05:34.320> home<00:05:34.500> button

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
second I thought that the home button

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.670 
second I thought that the home button
was<00:05:35.070> actually<00:05:35.520> one<00:05:35.670> of<00:05:35.700> the<00:05:36.560> ones<00:05:37.560> that

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
was actually one of the ones that

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.890 
was actually one of the ones that
changes<00:05:38.250> color<00:05:38.490> like<00:05:38.760> on<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.030> f3<00:05:39.570> but<00:05:39.780> it's

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
changes color like on the f3 but it's

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.870 
changes color like on the f3 but it's
not<00:05:40.230> this<00:05:40.710> seems<00:05:40.920> to<00:05:41.070> be<00:05:41.160> like<00:05:41.520> a<00:05:41.550> little

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
not this seems to be like a little

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.450 
not this seems to be like a little
brother<00:05:42.060> to<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.390> f3<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:44.130> screen

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
brother to the f3 and the screen

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.070 
brother to the f3 and the screen
actually<00:05:44.670> looks<00:05:45.030> much<00:05:45.360> better<00:05:45.600> than<00:05:45.750> it<00:05:45.960> did

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
actually looks much better than it did

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.260 
actually looks much better than it did
on<00:05:46.140> the<00:05:46.260> old<00:05:46.380> one<00:05:46.680> as<00:05:46.800> you<00:05:46.920> can<00:05:46.950> see<00:05:47.340> not<00:05:48.000> as

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
on the old one as you can see not as

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.670 
on the old one as you can see not as
many<00:05:48.450> pixels<00:05:48.720> are<00:05:49.020> seen<00:05:49.230> on<00:05:49.380> this<00:05:49.590> it's<00:05:50.370> h<00:05:50.640> vga

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
many pixels are seen on this it's h vga

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.860 
many pixels are seen on this it's h vga
so<00:05:52.680> that's<00:05:52.860> 320<00:05:53.490> by<00:05:53.640> 480<00:05:53.940> so<00:05:54.360> it<00:05:54.450> is<00:05:54.570> a<00:05:54.600> bit

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
so that's 320 by 480 so it is a bit

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.810 
so that's 320 by 480 so it is a bit
better<00:05:54.990> it's<00:05:55.680> still<00:05:55.980> not<00:05:56.100> the<00:05:56.280> best<00:05:56.430> thing<00:05:56.700> in

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
better it's still not the best thing in

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.020 
better it's still not the best thing in
the<00:05:56.880> world<00:05:56.910> so<00:05:58.370> one<00:05:59.370> minute<00:05:59.550> I<00:06:01.340> would<00:06:02.340> say<00:06:02.640> it

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
the world so one minute I would say it

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.300 
the world so one minute I would say it
actually<00:06:03.180> feels<00:06:03.720> really<00:06:03.840> nice<00:06:04.260> in<00:06:04.500> the<00:06:04.590> end<00:06:04.680> it

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
actually feels really nice in the end it

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.060 
actually feels really nice in the end it
has<00:06:05.340> a<00:06:05.580> very<00:06:05.880> nice<00:06:06.090> texture<00:06:06.660> to<00:06:06.690> it<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.230> it's

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
has a very nice texture to it and it's

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.070 
has a very nice texture to it and it's
actually<00:06:08.280> pretty<00:06:08.610> nice<00:06:08.910> and<00:06:09.210> as<00:06:09.690> you<00:06:09.810> can<00:06:09.900> see

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
actually pretty nice and as you can see

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.530 
actually pretty nice and as you can see
when<00:06:10.230> you<00:06:10.350> lock<00:06:10.590> it<00:06:10.830> and<00:06:11.010> unlock<00:06:11.370> it<00:06:11.430> it<00:06:12.270> does

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
when you lock it and unlock it it does

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.140 
when you lock it and unlock it it does
