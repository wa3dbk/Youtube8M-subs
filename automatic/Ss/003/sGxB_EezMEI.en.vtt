page that will make you boil it up the
right<00:02:30.890> way<00:02:31.010> when<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.340> which<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:32.060> right<00:02:32.570> way

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
right way when it which the right way

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.230 
right way when it which the right way
being<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.170> hair<00:02:33.440> stop<00:02:33.740> up<00:02:33.950> right<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:34.790> it

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
being the hair stop up right so it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.270 
being the hair stop up right so it
should<00:02:35.450> encourage<00:02:35.870> well<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.500> theory<00:02:36.770> I've<00:02:37.100> had

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
should encourage well in theory I've had

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.370 
should encourage well in theory I've had
it<00:02:37.370> fall<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.910> side<00:02:38.150> but<00:02:38.570> it's<00:02:38.930> still<00:02:39.170> it's

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
it fall to the side but it's still it's

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.110
