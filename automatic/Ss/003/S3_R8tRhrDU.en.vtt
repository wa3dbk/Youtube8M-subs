interesting<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> data<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.460> can

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
interesting with the data so they can

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
interesting with the data so they can
actually<00:00:35.730> sell<00:00:36.120> their<00:00:36.719> shirts<00:00:36.989> and

actually sell their shirts and
everything<00:00:37.460> because<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> data<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.910> actually

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
everything because the data is actually

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.490 
everything because the data is actually
useful<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.660> that's<00:00:39.870> interesting

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
useful and that's interesting

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.660 
useful and that's interesting
consolidation<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.219> market<00:00:41.520> that's

consolidation of the market that's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.369 
consolidation of the market that's
actually<00:00:41.910> quite<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> bit<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.329> change<00:00:43.110> when<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
actually quite a bit of change when you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.869 
actually quite a bit of change when you
think<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:43.950> two<00:00:44.100> apps<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.610> what

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
think about it for two apps but what

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.729 
think about it for two apps but what
gives<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> confidence<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.170> having

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
gives you the confidence that having

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
gives you the confidence that having
that<00:00:46.860> data<00:00:47.129> will<00:00:47.430> translate<00:00:48.000> into<00:00:48.480> buying

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that data will translate into buying

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.350 
that data will translate into buying
selling<00:00:49.649> shirts<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.190> shoes<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.180> just

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
selling shirts and shoes like it just

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.819 
selling shirts and shoes like it just
seems<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> whole<00:00:51.899> lot<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> money<00:00:52.289> for

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
seems like a whole lot of money for

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
seems like a whole lot of money for
absolute<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.399> make<00:00:53.579> any<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.329> money<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
absolute don't make any it's a money I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
absolute don't make any it's a money I
think<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.879> into<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> game

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
think it's they want to go into the game

what
none<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:54.880> fitness<00:02:55.330> was<00:02:55.480> doing<00:02:55.750> they<00:02:56.140> could

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
none of fitness was doing they could

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.390 
none of fitness was doing they could
have<00:02:56.410> done<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.709> yellow<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.100> don't<00:02:57.340> know

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
have done that yellow I don't know

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.860 
have done that yellow I don't know
whether<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.760> would<00:02:57.850> have<00:02:57.970> fit<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.300> price<00:02:58.510> it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
whether it would have fit that price it

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.870 
whether it would have fit that price it
seems<00:02:59.140> pretty<00:02:59.290> steep<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.680> me<00:02:59.770> so<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.370> do<00:03:00.640> think

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
seems pretty steep to me so you do think

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.570 
seems pretty steep to me so you do think
the<00:03:00.970> price<00:03:01.180> was<00:03:01.360> high<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:03.040> service<00:03:03.280> market

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
the price was high it's a service market

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.509 
the price was high it's a service market
I<00:03:03.820> think<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.780> as<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.959> yes<00:03:08.190> where<00:03:09.190> do<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.370> want

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
I think that as a yes where do you want

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.190 
I think that as a yes where do you want
to<00:03:09.550> see<00:03:09.700> Fitbit<00:03:10.060> strategy<00:03:10.510> going<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:11.019> make

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
to see Fitbit strategy going to make

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.960 
to see Fitbit strategy going to make
these<00:03:11.410> kind<00:03:11.709> of<00:03:11.769> acquisitions<00:03:12.400> or<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.880> be

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
these kind of acquisitions or to be

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.000 
these kind of acquisitions or to be
bought<00:03:13.150> at<00:03:13.269> itself<00:03:13.570> or<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.959> possible<00:03:14.260> IPO<00:03:14.680> what

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
bought at itself or a possible IPO what

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.670 
bought at itself or a possible IPO what
is<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.250> best<00:03:15.630> route<00:03:16.630> for<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:17.019> so<00:03:17.260> it's<00:03:17.440> trying

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
is the best route for it so it's trying

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.430

2008<00:05:19.940> when<00:05:20.210> they<00:05:20.330> had<00:05:20.480> this<00:05:20.660> really<00:05:21.110> big<00:05:21.290> bug<00:05:21.530> a

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
2008 when they had this really big bug a

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.590 
2008 when they had this really big bug a
block<00:05:21.860> of<00:05:21.980> plastic<00:05:22.190> which<00:05:22.520> was<00:05:22.700> a<00:05:22.940> connected

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
block of plastic which was a connected

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.890 
block of plastic which was a connected
pedometer<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:25.370> me<00:05:25.580> pedometer<00:05:26.390> put<00:05:26.720> him<00:05:26.810> in

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
pedometer and to me pedometer put him in

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:36.600 
pedometer and to me pedometer put him in
her<00:05:26.960> yeah<00:05:31.630> I'm<00:05:32.630> saying<00:05:32.840> pedometer<00:05:33.440> photometer

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.560 

and<00:05:37.610> so<00:05:38.590> investing<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.800> on<00:05:39.890> the<00:05:39.980> basis<00:05:40.280> of

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
and so investing that on the basis of

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.970 
and so investing that on the basis of
the<00:05:41.570> thesis<00:05:41.960> which<00:05:42.140> was<00:05:42.170> we<00:05:42.530> can<00:05:42.710> build

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
the thesis which was we can build

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.340 
the thesis which was we can build
hardware<00:05:43.490> companies<00:05:43.880> on<00:05:44.540> the<00:05:44.990> capital

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
hardware companies on the capital

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.840 
hardware companies on the capital
efficient<00:05:45.680> basis<00:05:46.040> because<00:05:46.400> that<00:05:46.610> was<00:05:46.730> the

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
efficient basis because that was the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.150 
efficient basis because that was the
whole<00:05:47.000> thing<00:05:47.030> with<00:05:47.720> web<00:05:47.900> -<00:05:48.110> oh<00:05:48.140> you<00:05:48.680> can<00:05:48.860> build

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
whole thing with web - oh you can build

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.490 
whole thing with web - oh you can build
the<00:05:49.640> next<00:05:49.880> generation<00:05:50.300> of<00:05:50.420> market<00:05:50.930> leaders<00:05:51.200> on

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
the very capita efficient basis if good

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.690 
the very capita efficient basis if good
things<00:05:53.570> happen<00:05:54.290> to<00:05:54.440> good<00:05:54.470> companies<00:05:55.100> why<00:05:55.640> do

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
things happen to good companies why do

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.270 
things happen to good companies why do
we<00:05:55.940> look<00:05:56.150> at<00:05:56.240> companies<00:05:56.660> like<00:05:56.690> uber<00:05:56.990> who<00:05:57.890> can't

we look at companies like uber who can't

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.660 
we look at companies like uber who can't
get<00:05:58.460> out<00:05:58.520> of<00:05:58.790> their<00:05:58.940> own<00:05:58.970> way<00:05:59.570> it's<00:06:00.050> clearly

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
get out of their own way it's clearly

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.030 
get out of their own way it's clearly
I'm<00:06:01.670> going<00:06:02.090> to<00:06:02.210> say<00:06:02.360> I<00:06:02.540> believe<00:06:02.660> it<00:06:03.410> is<00:06:03.710> clearly

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
I'm going to say I believe it is clearly

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.700 
I'm going to say I believe it is clearly
a<00:06:04.160> good<00:06:04.610> idea<00:06:05.000> and<00:06:05.240> in<00:06:05.570> terms<00:06:05.840> of<00:06:05.990> the<00:06:06.200> customer

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
a good idea and in terms of the customer

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.880 
a good idea and in terms of the customer
usage<00:06:07.040> it's<00:06:07.430> really<00:06:08.000> well<00:06:08.120> executed<00:06:08.410> yet<00:06:09.410> the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
usage it's really well executed yet the

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.040 
usage it's really well executed yet the
world<00:06:10.130> really<00:06:10.580> seems<00:06:11.000> like<00:06:11.180> they're<00:06:11.390> out<00:06:11.600> to

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
world really seems like they're out to

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.560 
world really seems like they're out to
get<00:06:12.200> over<00:06:12.560> if<00:06:12.710> it's<00:06:12.860> not<00:06:13.040> the<00:06:13.310> media<00:06:14.120> it's<00:06:14.420> the

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
get over if it's not the media it's the

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.120 
get over if it's not the media it's the
regulators<00:06:15.080> if<00:06:15.290> it's<00:06:15.410> not<00:06:15.500> the<00:06:15.620> regulators

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
regulators if it's not the regulators

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.200 
regulators if it's not the regulators
it's<00:06:16.340> the<00:06:16.430> Taxi<00:06:16.790> and<00:06:16.820> Limousine<00:06:16.910> Commission

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
it's the Taxi and Limousine Commission

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.120 
it's the Taxi and Limousine Commission
so<00:06:17.930> there's<00:06:18.110> an<00:06:18.260> example<00:06:18.350> of<00:06:18.680> a<00:06:18.770> company

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130

kind of interesting to see how lyft is

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.869 
kind of interesting to see how lyft is
actually<00:06:36.660> the<00:06:37.129> competitor<00:06:38.129> is<00:06:38.490> actually

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:38.879 
actually the competitor is actually

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.450 
actually the competitor is actually
really<00:06:39.120> well<00:06:39.360> beloved<00:06:39.750> by<00:06:40.680> their<00:06:41.009> consumers

really well beloved by their consumers

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.369 
really well beloved by their consumers
and<00:06:41.490> and<00:06:44.150> this<00:06:45.150> is<00:06:45.270> just<00:06:45.449> about<00:06:45.599> the<00:06:45.780> ethos<00:06:46.169> of

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:46.379 
and and this is just about the ethos of

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.240 
and and this is just about the ethos of
the<00:06:46.440> management

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
the management

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.070 
the management
I<00:06:47.280> think<00:06:47.610> it's<00:06:47.729> an<00:06:47.849> approach<00:06:48.240> where<00:06:48.750> they've

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
I think it's an approach where they've

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.869 
I think it's an approach where they've
been<00:06:49.110> more<00:06:49.470> aggressive<00:06:49.740> and<00:06:50.250> they<00:06:50.669> have<00:06:50.849> a

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
been more aggressive and they have a

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.520 
been more aggressive and they have a
winner-takes-all<00:06:51.750> sort<00:06:52.199> of<00:06:52.259> approach

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
winner-takes-all sort of approach

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.499 
winner-takes-all sort of approach
