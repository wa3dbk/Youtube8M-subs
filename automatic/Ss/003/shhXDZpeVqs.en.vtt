it's a actually much much much brighter
than<00:06:01.730> the<00:06:07.310> said<00:06:08.310> 61<00:06:08.880> T<00:06:09.120> display<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:13.580> gnome<00:06:14.580> day

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
than the said 61 T display the gnome day

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:21.080 
than the said 61 T display the gnome day
the<00:06:15.150> difference<00:06:16.340> and<00:06:19.610> for<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:20.669> first<00:06:20.910> time

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
the difference and for the first time

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.190 
the difference and for the first time
since<00:06:21.450> the<00:06:22.220> 61<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:24.360> display<00:06:24.930> is<00:06:24.990> actually

since the 61 the display is actually
centered<00:06:28.790> personally<00:06:29.790> I<00:06:29.820> think<00:06:29.970> that<00:06:30.389> it's

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
centered personally I think that it's

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.700 
centered personally I think that it's
the<00:06:31.310> best<00:06:32.310> rounded<00:06:33.240> think<00:06:33.930> that<00:06:34.139> since<00:06:34.470> those

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
the best rounded think that since those

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.740 
the best rounded think that since those
