00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:16.410
 and a parking lot we went to another parking lot as 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.060
 you want modified parking too 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 close I would say good that really 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.109
 we are here in a race which 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420
 I have to climb up the mails bank 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.750
 through a totally giant ramp 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.369
 because I noticed that they win and for that you have to 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.830
 go up to carry the mail go for this 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.329
 kind of giant ramp the truth is 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.010
 that I think a career would be impossible 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.309
 similar if I remember correctly but good 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:51.590
 let's see if we can get to 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:51.590
 the first because the person follows people 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.670
 we keep getting to the dots first 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.030
 which is right here is divided 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.980
 as in the first zone obviously and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.660
 after the apple area and the area 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.450
 obviously not obviously be the area 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.470
 where saying that someone who has a 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.600
 control agent to control the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.860
 movement of hips to be able to climb 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.960
 the walls 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.340
 I believe that all this what you are 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.870
 seeing the same thing here you do in life 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 real with your bike and also its walls 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.980
 I believe that hips our hips 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.880
 they have a special movement if you 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.120
 I think they have some kind of 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 special substance which makes 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.310
 deactivates the gravity of the universe 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.790
 so then we can go up 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.790
 anywhere 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.270
 down the street or see him against the wall 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.450
 but a lot ago and see how the three 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.450
 Couples 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.780
 dollars data do it for which I 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.780
 I imagine that he will have to put some crazy 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.640
 you have to jump 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.440
 a totally static plan happens 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.730
 in plasma 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.010
 Well, nothing we go first is 21 points 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.069
 control 12 so nothing because I think that 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.940
 we see ourselves pass the race before and 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.970
 also that there will not be more 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.489
 nothing difficult is that it is already simply 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.510
 around here on the road quietly 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.440
 that's how they stay because it's high because 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.230
 I want for that faster I'll never have 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.280
 because he because when he goes faster or 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.970
 when we were doing a 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.740
 true singer but 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.740
 come on let's go come on let's go 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.360
 to
