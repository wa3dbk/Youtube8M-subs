in<00:00:05.109> this<00:00:06.109> tutorial<00:00:06.319> we're<00:00:06.859> gonna<00:00:06.979> go<00:00:07.129> over<00:00:07.429> the

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
in this tutorial we're gonna go over the

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.820 
in this tutorial we're gonna go over the
group<00:00:07.790> polish<00:00:08.450> blur<00:00:08.750> and<00:00:08.990> project<00:00:09.440> settings

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
group polish blur and project settings

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.999 
group polish blur and project settings
used<00:00:10.400> inside<00:00:10.820> of<00:00:10.879> dynamesh<00:00:11.410> with<00:00:12.410> animation

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
used inside of dynamesh with animation

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.549 
used inside of dynamesh with animation
let's<00:00:13.280> look<00:00:13.429> at<00:00:13.549> groups<00:00:13.759> first

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
let's look at groups first

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.679 
let's look at groups first
now<00:00:15.559> what<00:00:16.009> this<00:00:16.129> typically<00:00:16.550> does<00:00:16.730> is<00:00:17.029> it

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
now what this typically does is it

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.749 
now what this typically does is it
allows<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.259> to<00:00:18.619> protect<00:00:18.980> your<00:00:19.310> groups<00:00:19.579> from

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
allows you to protect your groups from

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.750 
allows you to protect your groups from
ever<00:00:20.000> being<00:00:20.210> merged<00:00:20.539> together<00:00:20.779> when<00:00:21.740> read<00:00:22.310> ina

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
ever being merged together when read ina

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.990 
ever being merged together when read ina
meshing<00:00:23.210> your<00:00:23.869> desculpe<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.609> let's<00:00:25.789> create

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
meshing your desculpe so let's create

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.799 
meshing your desculpe so let's create
two<00:00:26.119> separate<00:00:26.420> groups<00:00:28.990> and<00:00:30.250> apply<00:00:31.250> dynamesh

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
two separate groups and apply dynamesh

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.049 
two separate groups and apply dynamesh
now<00:00:32.809> typically<00:00:33.320> again<00:00:33.710> this<00:00:33.949> would<00:00:34.220> merge<00:00:34.850> the

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
now typically again this would merge the

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.399 
now typically again this would merge the
two<00:00:35.180> together<00:00:35.330> however<00:00:37.479> with<00:00:38.479> groups<00:00:38.780> on<00:00:39.019> it

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.409 
two together however with groups on it

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.829 
two together however with groups on it
respects<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.280> fact<00:00:40.460> that<00:00:40.699> you<00:00:41.390> don't<00:00:41.659> want

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
respects the fact that you don't want

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.509 
respects the fact that you don't want
them<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.140> be<00:00:42.260> merged<00:00:42.530> together<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.250> they<00:00:43.489> don't

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
them to be merged together so they don't

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.850 
them to be merged together so they don't
in<00:00:44.330> fact<00:00:44.360> you<00:00:44.720> can<00:00:44.839> even<00:00:44.930> sculpt<00:00:45.379> directly<00:00:45.739> on

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
in fact you can even sculpt directly on

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.420 
in fact you can even sculpt directly on
top<00:00:46.040> of<00:00:46.070> these<00:00:46.629> just<00:00:47.629> get<00:00:47.839> rid<00:00:47.930> of<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:48.080> mask

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.750 

turn<00:00:52.430> this<00:00:52.580> off<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.030> can<00:00:53.119> see<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.760> read

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
turn this off so you can see and read

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.880 
turn this off so you can see and read
ina<00:00:55.939> mesh<00:00:56.350> as<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:57.500> can<00:00:57.589> see<00:00:57.739> they<00:00:57.860> actually

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
ina mesh as you can see they actually

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.829 
ina mesh as you can see they actually
look<00:00:58.460> like<00:00:58.760> one<00:00:59.089> solid<00:00:59.420> mass<00:00:59.890> but<00:01:01.839> because

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
look like one solid mass but because

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.899 
look like one solid mass but because
groups<00:01:03.140> is<00:01:03.350> still<00:01:03.619> on<00:01:03.799> it<00:01:04.699> respects<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.530> and

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
groups is still on it respects that and

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.749 
groups is still on it respects that and
treats<00:01:07.909> them<00:01:08.090> as<00:01:08.240> two<00:01:08.360> separate<00:01:08.750> objects

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
treats them as two separate objects

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.380 
treats them as two separate objects
now<00:01:10.759> of<00:01:10.939> course<00:01:12.039> without<00:01:13.039> groups<00:01:13.460> on<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:14.090> can

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
now of course without groups on you can

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.749 
now of course without groups on you can
merge<00:01:14.960> them<00:01:15.229> together<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.649> they<00:01:16.250> become<00:01:16.520> one

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
merge them together and they become one

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.120 
merge them together and they become one
mass<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:17.810> if<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.170> want<00:01:18.409> to<00:01:18.560> protect<00:01:19.009> your

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
mass so if you want to protect your

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.160 
mass so if you want to protect your
groups<00:01:19.460> then<00:01:19.789> that's<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.299> way<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.450> do<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:20.840> make

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
groups then that's the way to do it make

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.169 
groups then that's the way to do it make
sure<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:21.560> groups<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.100> selected<00:01:25.179> also

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
sure that groups is selected also

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.989 
sure that groups is selected also
something<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:26.780> be<00:01:26.869> aware<00:01:27.049> of<00:01:27.229> is<00:01:27.560> that<00:01:27.619> if<00:01:28.369> you

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
something to be aware of is that if you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.200 
something to be aware of is that if you
have<00:01:29.210> separate<00:01:29.859> poly<00:01:30.859> groups<00:01:31.219> like<00:01:31.789> different

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
have separate poly groups like different

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.849 
have separate poly groups like different
faces<00:01:32.630> on<00:01:32.840> your<00:01:33.259> on<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.090> single<00:01:35.090> object<00:01:35.859> that

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
faces on your on a single object that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.249 
faces on your on a single object that
are<00:01:37.009> different<00:01:37.369> groups<00:01:37.899> like<00:01:38.899> this<00:01:39.079> right

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
are different groups like this right

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.399 
are different groups like this right
here<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.999> you<00:01:40.999> have<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.359> group<00:01:41.659> option<00:01:42.170> on

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
here and you have the group option on

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.980 
here and you have the group option on
when<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.460> read<00:01:43.670> dynamesh<00:01:44.149> it's<00:01:44.509> actually

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
when you read dynamesh it's actually

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.950 
when you read dynamesh it's actually
going<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.289> split<00:01:45.590> them<00:01:46.749> it's<00:01:47.749> going<00:01:47.869> to

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
going to split them it's going to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.010 
going to split them it's going to
separate<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.439> two<00:01:48.469> and<00:01:48.859> fill<00:01:49.249> faces<00:01:49.789> so<00:01:50.780> this

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
separate the two and fill faces so this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.270 
separate the two and fill faces so this
may<00:01:51.200> of<00:01:51.350> course<00:01:51.380> be<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.829> effect<00:01:52.130> you're

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
may of course be the effect you're

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.190 
may of course be the effect you're
aiming<00:01:52.579> for<00:01:52.609> but<00:01:53.270> just<00:01:53.600> in<00:01:53.749> case<00:01:53.929> it's<00:01:54.139> not

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
aiming for but just in case it's not

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.690 
aiming for but just in case it's not
this<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.740> definitely<00:01:55.159> something<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:55.490> be<00:01:55.609> aware

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
this is definitely something to be aware

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.419 
this is definitely something to be aware
of<00:01:55.880> as<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:57.079> can<00:01:57.200> see<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.560> actually<00:01:57.710> separated

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
of as you can see it actually separated

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.580 
of as you can see it actually separated
the<00:01:58.520> faces<00:01:58.969> and<00:01:59.179> filled<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.780> holes<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.259> made

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
the faces and filled the holes and made

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.760 
the faces and filled the holes and made
them<00:02:00.770> two<00:02:00.920> separate<00:02:01.280> objects<00:02:01.689> so<00:02:02.770> just

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
them two separate objects so just

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.809 
them two separate objects so just
something<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.039> be<00:02:04.159> aware<00:02:04.189> of<00:02:06.340> now<00:02:07.340> let's<00:02:07.700> have

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
something to be aware of now let's have

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.809 
something to be aware of now let's have
a<00:02:07.909> look<00:02:07.999> at<00:02:08.149> blur<00:02:08.420> unlike<00:02:09.319> group<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.920> polish

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
a look at blur unlike group and polish

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.280 
a look at blur unlike group and polish
and<00:02:10.940> project<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.450> actually<00:02:11.720> has<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> slider

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
and project it actually has a slider

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.710 
and project it actually has a slider
it's<00:02:13.010> initially<00:02:13.460> set<00:02:13.700> at<00:02:13.730> two<00:02:14.090> but<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.480> course

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
it's initially set at two but of course

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.570 
it's initially set at two but of course
you<00:02:14.870> can<00:02:15.050> move<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.620> up<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:15.860> 100<00:02:16.160> if<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.340> wanted

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
you can move it up to 100 if you wanted

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.410 
you can move it up to 100 if you wanted
to

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.370 
to
and<00:02:17.510> what<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.810> does<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.200> pretty

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and what it does is pretty

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.470 
and what it does is pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:19.550> higher<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.090> set<00:02:20.300> of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
self-explanatory the higher the set of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.280 
self-explanatory the higher the set of
the<00:02:20.599> setting<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:22.160> more<00:02:22.400> detail<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.880> ignores

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the setting the more detail it ignores

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.440 
the setting the more detail it ignores
so<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.920> not<00:02:25.310> all<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.610> bad<00:02:26.120> if<00:02:26.330> you're

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
so it's not all that bad if you're

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.780 
so it's not all that bad if you're
trying<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.959> create<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:27.920> general<00:02:28.340> form

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
trying to create a just a general form

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.640 
trying to create a just a general form
for<00:02:29.540> your<00:02:29.599> bass<00:02:29.780> mashing<00:02:30.230> you're<00:02:30.319> not<00:02:30.440> really

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
for your bass mashing you're not really

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.240 
for your bass mashing you're not really
getting<00:02:30.800> into<00:02:31.040> too<00:02:31.190> much<00:02:31.310> detail<00:02:31.760> but<00:02:32.180> can<00:02:32.959> be

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
getting into too much detail but can be

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.729 
getting into too much detail but can be
really<00:02:34.250> useless<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.569> high<00:02:35.750> end<00:02:35.780> when<00:02:36.620> you

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
really useless on the high end when you

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.900 
really useless on the high end when you
want<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:36.920> retain<00:02:37.220> as<00:02:37.340> much<00:02:37.370> detail<00:02:37.819> as

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
want to retain as much detail as

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.900 
want to retain as much detail as
possible<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.600> fact<00:02:39.400> let's<00:02:40.400> say<00:02:40.610> for<00:02:40.819> instance

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
possible in fact let's say for instance

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.180 
possible in fact let's say for instance
you're<00:02:41.510> dynamesh<00:02:42.200> when<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.530> swipe<00:02:42.830> it's

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
you're dynamesh when you swipe it's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.780 
you're dynamesh when you swipe it's
deleting<00:02:44.000> too<00:02:44.180> much<00:02:44.420> detail<00:02:45.100> then<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.640> can

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
deleting too much detail then you can

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.970 
deleting too much detail then you can
turn<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.060> project<00:02:47.599> and<00:02:47.900> what<00:02:48.319> that<00:02:48.470> does<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:48.890> it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
turn on project and what that does is it

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.360 
turn on project and what that does is it
retains<00:02:49.340> as<00:02:49.550> much<00:02:49.730> detail<00:02:50.060> as<00:02:50.209> possible<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:52.160> as

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
retains as much detail as possible so as

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.250 
retains as much detail as possible so as
you<00:02:52.489> can<00:02:52.610> see<00:02:52.819> it's<00:02:52.970> actually<00:02:53.150> looking<00:02:53.780> for

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
you can see it's actually looking for

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.229 
you can see it's actually looking for
even<00:02:54.530> more<00:02:54.680> detail<00:02:55.220> than<00:02:55.489> was<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.030> mesh

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
even more detail than was on the mesh

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.600 
even more detail than was on the mesh
this<00:02:57.019> is<00:02:57.200> what<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.440> was<00:02:57.560> before<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:58.250> applied

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
this is what it was before I applied

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.650 
this is what it was before I applied
dynamesh<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:01.580> is<00:03:01.730> after<00:03:02.060> again<00:03:02.390> it's<00:03:02.569> a

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
dynamesh and this is after again it's a

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.750 
dynamesh and this is after again it's a
very<00:03:02.900> subtle<00:03:03.230> but<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.860> tries<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.190> look<00:03:04.370> for<00:03:04.670> as

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
very subtle but it tries to look for as

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.920 
very subtle but it tries to look for as
much<00:03:05.090> detail<00:03:05.540> as<00:03:05.569> it<00:03:05.930> can<00:03:06.049> find<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:07.930> finally

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
much detail as it can find and finally

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.740 
much detail as it can find and finally
there's<00:03:09.350> polish<00:03:09.799> now<00:03:10.519> what<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:10.970> does<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.480> it

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
there's polish now what this does is it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.990 
there's polish now what this does is it
goes<00:03:11.870> across<00:03:12.110> your<00:03:12.230> mash<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.920> looks<00:03:13.280> for<00:03:13.610> any

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
goes across your mash and looks for any

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.259 
goes across your mash and looks for any
edges<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.140> kind<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.130> brings<00:03:16.370> them<00:03:16.580> out<00:03:16.670> think

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
edges and kind of brings them out think

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.390 
edges and kind of brings them out think
of<00:03:17.360> like<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.780> beveled<00:03:18.200> effect<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.769> your<00:03:19.069> on<00:03:19.310> your

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
of like a beveled effect on your on your

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.319 
of like a beveled effect on your on your
mash<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.660> it's<00:03:20.900> really<00:03:21.110> good<00:03:21.260> for<00:03:21.910> stone<00:03:22.910> or

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
mash so it's really good for stone or

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.220 
mash so it's really good for stone or
metal<00:03:23.810> think<00:03:24.560> like<00:03:24.680> Iron<00:03:25.010> Man<00:03:25.190> type<00:03:25.579> armor<00:03:26.230> it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
metal think like Iron Man type armor it

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.840 
metal think like Iron Man type armor it
just<00:03:27.440> retains<00:03:27.799> your<00:03:27.920> your<00:03:28.430> edges<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.760> little

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
just retains your your edges a little

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.440 
just retains your your edges a little
bit<00:03:29.180> better<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:31.310> actually<00:03:31.519> unlike<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.299> other

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
bit better and actually unlike the other

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.690 
bit better and actually unlike the other
settings<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.829> have<00:03:33.859> for<00:03:34.160> dynamesh<00:03:34.489> this

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
settings that you have for dynamesh this

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.020 
settings that you have for dynamesh this
one<00:03:34.850> actually<00:03:35.030> has<00:03:36.459> even<00:03:37.459> more<00:03:37.640> slider

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
one actually has even more slider

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.699 
one actually has even more slider
options<00:03:38.570> available<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.230> if<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.500> want<00:03:39.650> to

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
options available to you if you want to

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.440 
options available to you if you want to
get<00:03:39.829> really<00:03:40.070> really<00:03:40.310> specific<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.030> protect

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
get really really specific and protect

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.199 
get really really specific and protect
or<00:03:42.880> divide<00:03:43.880> your<00:03:44.090> mesh<00:03:44.239> accordingly<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:46.209> like

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
or divide your mesh accordingly so like

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.050 
or divide your mesh accordingly so like
say<00:03:48.079> for<00:03:48.140> instance<00:03:48.260> your<00:03:49.010> mesh<00:03:49.220> is<00:03:49.400> too<00:03:50.180> thick

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
say for instance your mesh is too thick

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.310 
say for instance your mesh is too thick
not<00:03:53.060> getting<00:03:53.239> enough<00:03:53.390> detail<00:03:53.720> then<00:03:54.109> you<00:03:54.200> have

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
not getting enough detail then you have

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.930 
not getting enough detail then you have
even<00:03:54.350> more<00:03:54.739> detail<00:03:57.519> you've<00:03:58.519> got<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.730> lot<00:03:58.910> of

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
even more detail you've got a lot of

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.430 
even more detail you've got a lot of
options<00:03:59.390> available<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.810> you<00:04:00.019> with<00:04:00.140> this<00:04:00.290> one

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
options available to you with this one

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.590 
options available to you with this one
and<00:04:01.010> again<00:04:01.310> they're<00:04:01.459> applied<00:04:01.790> whenever<00:04:02.060> you

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
and again they're applied whenever you

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.729 
and again they're applied whenever you
use<00:04:02.840> polish<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:04.160> these<00:04:04.730> two<00:04:04.970> are<00:04:05.209> related<00:04:05.739> so

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
use polish so these two are related so

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.860 
use polish so these two are related so
be<00:04:06.980> careful<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.370> that<00:04:07.430> now<00:04:08.120> if<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:08.450> don't<00:04:08.720> want

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
be careful of that now if you don't want

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.390 
be careful of that now if you don't want
to<00:04:08.930> read<00:04:09.049> apologize<00:04:09.470> your<00:04:09.650> mesh<00:04:09.799> but<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.130> do

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
to read apologize your mesh but you do

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.250 
to read apologize your mesh but you do
want<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.760> apply<00:04:11.150> these<00:04:11.209> settings<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:12.049> can

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
want to apply these settings you can

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.559 
want to apply these settings you can
just<00:04:12.500> alter<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.400> settings<00:04:13.579> temporarily<00:04:14.239> and

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
just alter the settings temporarily and

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.690 
just alter the settings temporarily and
click<00:04:15.109> clay<00:04:15.380> polish<00:04:15.829> and<00:04:16.100> it'll<00:04:16.340> apply<00:04:16.579> it

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
click clay polish and it'll apply it

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.509 
click clay polish and it'll apply it
without<00:04:17.019> reading<00:04:18.019> your<00:04:18.260> geometry<00:04:18.530> using

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
without reading your geometry using

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.909 
without reading your geometry using
dynamesh<00:04:20.229> so<00:04:21.229> you<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.650> have<00:04:21.680> options<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:24.590> I

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919
