00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.380
 and well here we have the asus de fonsÃ­n 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.629
 with an intel atom 2 gigs processor 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.360
 has of course android 4.3 says that 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.850
 the company that will improve it to 4.4 or 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.950
 important kitkat 5 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.890
 1280 x 720 pixels is not the 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.180
 highest resolution of the market but 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.940
 finally it works fine and here what 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.640
 important or maybe the characteristic 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.339
 main is how good this firm offers 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.649
 Good construction products good 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:45.149
 This particular quality has a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.399
 8 megapixel rear camera with a 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.039
 pixel system master what good 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.109
 stabilizes and the image also has 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.749
 Other features such as gorilla glass 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.699
 has to strike all three to endure 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:59.850
 there the abuse that you can give him 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.690
 phone that modifies the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.620
 Android we throw the stock here are the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 most important characteristics of 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.780
 configuration where good they are here 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.130
 they are more or less the same as the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 phone 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.450
 change is different from the android stock 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.840
 has a front camera of 2 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.280
 megapixel battery 2000 110,000 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:30.049
 jumper is nothing that takes away the speech is 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 the color red and black and white and purple 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.229
 145 grams is not so much weight you feel 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.119
 very very light 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.039
 I think it 's 5 inches a size for me 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.350
 already great but good really will be 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.860
 people who like 5 inches and you're 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.319
 knowing here this is the asus cm x 5 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.670
 not yet for sale in many countries 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.709
 from Latin America 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.610
 certainly in Mexico there is no family 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:56.860
 complete this is the case 100 with 4 with 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.530
 4 inch screen 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:05.740
 let's see if they turn on they are 4 inches 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.509
 then this is the issue, but 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:15.030
 you saw it 5 inches and in asus then 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.030
 I say there are not many sciences 6 inches 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.560
 5 inches 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.989
 4 inches the size of course 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.250
 it matters that you are looking for them 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.519
 I think that among these three I better 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.060
 the five has a relation to the size 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:38.110
 or weight ease of use with just one 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.980
 reasonable but good hand in the cellar and 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.980
 Many options 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.580
 unfair samsung just presented his 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.610
 new version of the galaxy phone now 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.420
 is the s5 here we have it in hand by 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.420
 course for you
