the things that I tend to do with my
stuff<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> use<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.910> wheels<00:00:54.180> where

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
stuff is I like to use the wheels where

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.290 
stuff is I like to use the wheels where
the<00:00:55.829> threads<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> everything<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.940> built<00:00:57.210> like

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the threads and everything is built like

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.569 
the threads and everything is built like
right<00:00:57.750> into<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.219> into<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
right into the you know right into the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.369 
right into the you know right into the
thing<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.510> I'm<00:01:00.660> using<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> pinch

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
thing now this one I'm using the pinch

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.969 
thing now this one I'm using the pinch
hit<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.550> when<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> use<00:01:03.629> them<00:01:03.899> those<00:01:04.619> type<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
hit but when you use them those type of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.500 
hit but when you use them those type of
grinding<00:01:05.430> wheels<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.820> cost<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.390> bit

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
grinding wheels they cost a little bit

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
grinding wheels they cost a little bit
more<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.080> they're<00:01:07.229> easier<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.680> faster<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
more but they're easier and faster to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.399 
more but they're easier and faster to
change<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.600> use<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> right<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.350> be

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
change if you use the right will be

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
change if you use the right will be
grinder<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.760> almost<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.360> you're<00:01:12.570> not

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
grinder it's almost like you're not

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.969 
grinder it's almost like you're not
gaining<00:01:13.619> anything<00:01:14.100> by<00:01:14.490> doing<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.710> but<00:01:16.710> when

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
gaining anything by doing that but when

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.410 
gaining anything by doing that but when
I<00:01:17.009> use<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> ones<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.759> don't<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I use the ones that don't we have the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.770 
I use the ones that don't we have the
little<00:01:18.630> tool<00:01:19.610> included<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.180> ok<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> can

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
little tool included it's like ok I can

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.960 
little tool included it's like ok I can
always<00:01:22.049> find<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.439> wrench<00:01:22.650> easier<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.790> can

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
always find a wrench easier then I can

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.960 
always find a wrench easier then I can
find<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.360> specialized<00:01:24.840> tool<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.850> but<00:01:26.850> with

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970

capacity<00:01:58.170> battery<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.189> same

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
capacity battery is actually the same

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.289 
capacity battery is actually the same

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
but of course those knockouts are just

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.279 
but of course those knockouts are just
garbage<00:02:05.369> batteries<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.990> wouldn't

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
garbage batteries they really wouldn't

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.779 
garbage batteries they really wouldn't
do<00:02:07.409> anything<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.009> wear<00:02:08.160> every<00:02:08.340> night<00:02:08.519> heads

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
do anything to wear every night heads

do anything to wear every night heads
above<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.209> worst<00:02:09.509> ones<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.929> business

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
above the worst ones in the business

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
above the worst ones in the business
which<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.099> one<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> reasons<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.819> went

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
which is one of the reasons that went

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.220 
which is one of the reasons that went
over<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.299> lithium-ion<00:02:13.640> full-fledge<00:02:15.230> where

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
over to lithium-ion full-fledge where

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.750 
over to lithium-ion full-fledge where
other<00:02:16.379> people<00:02:16.739> kind<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.010> hesitated<00:02:17.640> on

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
other people kind of hesitated on

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.819 
other people kind of hesitated on
lithium-ion<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.840> because<00:02:19.110> their<00:02:19.319> lithium-ion

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
lithium-ion is because their lithium-ion

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.250 
lithium-ion is because their lithium-ion
batteries<00:02:20.340> are<00:02:20.459> pretty<00:02:20.640> good<00:02:20.989> but<00:02:21.989> this

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
batteries are pretty good but this

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.229 
batteries are pretty good but this
rotates<00:02:22.890> now<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.549> just<00:02:23.700> something<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.180> did

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
rotates now this is just something I did

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.589 
rotates now this is just something I did
so<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.660> could<00:02:24.750> hang<00:02:25.079> it<00:02:25.110> okay<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:27.060> that's<00:02:27.420> just

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
so I could hang it okay but that's just

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.390 
so I could hang it okay but that's just
something<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> did<00:02:28.079> so<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.440> hang<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.739> but<00:02:29.250> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
something I did so I can hang it but the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.330 
something I did so I can hang it but the
fourth<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.329> can<00:02:30.599> rotate<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:32.010> if<00:02:32.190> you're

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
fourth on this can rotate so if you're

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.059 
fourth on this can rotate so if you're
trying<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> get<00:02:32.790> into<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> tight<00:02:33.569> area<00:02:34.079> you<00:02:34.890> can

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
trying to get into a tight area you can

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.949 
trying to get into a tight area you can
kind<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.370> reposition<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.720> work<00:02:36.930> with

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
kind of reposition that and work with

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.960 
kind of reposition that and work with
that<00:02:37.230> because<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.500> can<00:02:37.620> realize<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.579> not<00:02:38.940> a

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
that because you can realize it's not a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.410 
that because you can realize it's not a
tiny<00:02:39.360> tool<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.560> tool<00:02:40.769> head<00:02:41.129> here<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.760> noticed

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
tiny tool the tool head here I noticed

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.770 
tiny tool the tool head here I noticed
that<00:02:42.780> very<00:02:43.700> similar<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.970> Milwaukee<00:02:45.420> now

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
that very similar to the Milwaukee now

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.600 
that very similar to the Milwaukee now
there's<00:02:46.019> rumors<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.500> some<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.250> parts

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
there's rumors that some of the parts

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.970 
there's rumors that some of the parts
made<00:02:47.879> by<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.060> same<00:02:48.299> company<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:49.019> from<00:02:49.769> what<00:02:49.950> I

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
made by the same company but from what I

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.059 
made by the same company but from what I
can<00:02:50.069> tell<00:02:50.250> stuff<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:50.940> not<00:02:51.299> interchangeable

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
can tell stuff is not interchangeable

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.430 
can tell stuff is not interchangeable
now<00:02:53.069> on<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.639> the<00:02:53.760> P<00:02:53.970> 422<00:02:54.780> which<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.109> a<00:02:55.139> newer

they<00:03:03.750> had<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> composite<00:03:04.620> molded<00:03:05.010> handle<00:03:05.489> here

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
they had a composite molded handle here

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.309 
they had a composite molded handle here
where<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.060> kind<00:03:06.329> of<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.480> rubber<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.139> hard

where it's kind of the rubber and a hard
plastic<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.940> they<00:03:09.510> went<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.870> little<00:03:09.989> more

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
plastic but they went a little more

plastic but they went a little more
deluxe<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.889> into<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> model<00:03:11.639> where<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.840> know

deluxe on into a model where you know

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.470 
deluxe on into a model where you know
they<00:03:13.290> put<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.920> little<00:03:14.099> stippling<00:03:14.880> in<00:03:15.090> here

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
they put the little stippling in here

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.849 
they put the little stippling in here
they<00:03:15.810> went<00:03:16.019> with<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.169> little<00:03:16.319> bit<00:03:16.560> different

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
they went with a little bit different

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.819 
they went with a little bit different
trigger<00:03:17.250> design<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:18.120> works<00:03:18.870> about<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.410> same

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
trigger design it works about the same

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.990 
trigger design it works about the same
way<00:03:20.069> as<00:03:20.419> far<00:03:21.419> as<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:22.560> could<00:03:22.859> tell<00:03:23.160> with<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
way as far as I could tell with the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.259 
way as far as I could tell with the
mechanics<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.900> castings<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:26.459> gear<00:03:26.730> head<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
mechanics the castings the gear head the

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.509 
mechanics the castings the gear head the
motor<00:03:27.540> all<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.049> stuff<00:03:28.380> that's<00:03:28.739> all<00:03:29.010> pretty

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
motor all that stuff that's all pretty

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.809 
motor all that stuff that's all pretty
much<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.940> same<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:31.079> locking<00:03:31.799> mechanism<00:03:32.639> for

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
much the same the locking mechanism for

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.030 
much the same the locking mechanism for
the<00:03:32.910> guard<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.599> slightly<00:03:34.049> different<00:03:34.560> but<00:03:34.799> from

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
the guard is slightly different but from

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.150 
the guard is slightly different but from
what<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.190> could<00:03:35.340> tell<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:36.870> really<00:03:37.290> looks<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.919> me

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
what I could tell it really looks to me

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.120 
what I could tell it really looks to me
like<00:03:38.190> they're<00:03:38.609> interchangeable

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
like they're interchangeable

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.770 
like they're interchangeable
now<00:03:41.130> rotation<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.709> from<00:03:43.709> left<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.669> right<00:03:45.090> left

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
now rotation is from left to right left

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.039 
now rotation is from left to right left
to<00:03:45.900> right<00:03:46.549> maybe<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.669> put<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.239> in<00:03:48.450> upside<00:03:48.780> down

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
to right maybe I put this in upside down

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.479 
to right maybe I put this in upside down
but<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.349> seemed<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:49.829> have<00:03:50.010> been<00:03:50.130> set<00:03:50.459> up

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
but it seemed like this have been set up

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.699 
but it seemed like this have been set up
for<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.760> different<00:03:50.940> rotation<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:52.290> thing<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.620> I

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
for a different rotation the thing is I

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.259 
for a different rotation the thing is I
want<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.280> be<00:03:53.370> able<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.639> get<00:03:53.760> at<00:03:53.909> this<00:03:54.030> with<00:03:54.239> a

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
want to be able to get at this with a

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.050 
want to be able to get at this with a
wrench<00:03:54.569> not<00:03:54.870> not<00:03:55.620> trying<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.159> jam<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.459> wrench<00:03:56.819> up

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
wrench not not trying to jam a wrench up

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.380 
wrench not not trying to jam a wrench up
in<00:03:57.269> there<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.629> get<00:03:57.719> that<00:03:57.780> off

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
in there to get that off

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.210 
in there to get that off
one<00:03:59.900> thing<00:04:00.110> about<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.440> newer<00:04:00.620> model<00:04:01.040> though

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
one thing about the newer model though

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.840 
one thing about the newer model though
is<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:02.030> foot<00:04:02.410> it's<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.590> little<00:04:03.890> bit<00:04:04.010> shorter<00:04:04.640> a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
is the foot it's a little bit shorter a

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.950 
is the foot it's a little bit shorter a
little<00:04:05.420> more<00:04:05.870> compact<00:04:06.470> because<00:04:07.370> basically

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
little more compact because basically

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.960 
little more compact because basically
you<00:04:08.960> know<00:04:09.110> not<00:04:09.650> much<00:04:09.950> happens<00:04:10.460> between<00:04:10.640> the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
you know not much happens between the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.730 
you know not much happens between the
battery<00:04:11.390> and<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.600> motor<00:04:11.840> hat<00:04:12.080> except<00:04:12.500> for<00:04:12.680> a

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
battery and a motor hat except for a

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.970 
battery and a motor hat except for a
handle<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:14.600> newer<00:04:14.750> model<00:04:15.170> doesn't<00:04:15.410> pivot

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
handle so the newer model doesn't pivot

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.949 
handle so the newer model doesn't pivot
but<00:04:16.250> they<00:04:16.400> made<00:04:16.580> it<00:04:16.610> shorter<00:04:17.120> okay

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
but they made it shorter okay

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.930 
but they made it shorter okay
it<00:04:18.080> made<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.410> shorter<00:04:18.770> they<00:04:19.340> put<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:19.790> little

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
it made it shorter they put the little

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.150 
it made it shorter they put the little
ribs<00:04:20.299> on<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.690> side<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.170> tools<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:21.860> you<00:04:21.890> can

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
ribs on the side of the tools so you can

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.490 
ribs on the side of the tools so you can
get<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.370> little<00:04:23.180> better<00:04:23.420> grip<00:04:23.690> on<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.230> get<00:04:24.380> it

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
get a little better grip on it to get it

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.470 
get a little better grip on it to get it
out<00:04:24.590> of<00:04:24.860> course<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.190> two<00:04:25.370> tools<00:04:25.640> appear<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.360> be

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
out of course the two tools appear to be

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.050 
out of course the two tools appear to be
interchangeable

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
interchangeable

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.020 
interchangeable
and<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.570> handles<00:04:30.470> are<00:04:30.650> standardized<00:04:31.640> saying

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
and the handles are standardized saying

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.330 
and the handles are standardized saying
we<00:04:32.210> can<00:04:32.390> put<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.320> different<00:04:33.500> positions<00:04:34.190> on

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
we can put it to different positions on

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.920 
we can put it to different positions on
the<00:04:34.400> thing<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.940> lot<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.180> times<00:04:35.300> somebody's

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
the thing a lot of times somebody's

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.300 
the thing a lot of times somebody's
going<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.110> operate<00:04:36.380> with<00:04:36.590> this<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.980> handle

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
going to operate with this the handle

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.560 
going to operate with this the handle
off<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:39.020> it's<00:04:39.500> powerful<00:04:39.890> enough<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:41.240> got<00:04:41.450> to

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
off but it's powerful enough you got to

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.390 
off but it's powerful enough you got to
hang<00:04:41.750> on<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.230> and<00:04:42.500> one<00:04:42.620> of<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.800> things<00:04:43.040> that

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
hang on to it and one of the things that

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.060 
hang on to it and one of the things that
a<00:04:43.670> lot<00:04:44.540> of<00:04:44.660> guys<00:04:44.810> deal<00:04:45.140> with<00:04:45.290> their<00:04:45.830> body

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
a lot of guys deal with their body

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.420 
a lot of guys deal with their body
grinders<00:04:46.670> is<00:04:46.910> they<00:04:47.210> remove<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:48.710> blade<00:04:49.130> guard

hand is not on this they made it where
see<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.600> cannot<00:05:32.990> even<00:05:33.380> operate<00:05:34.220> that<00:05:34.400> tool<00:05:34.790> if

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
see you cannot even operate that tool if

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.360 
see you cannot even operate that tool if
you're<00:05:35.960> holding<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.620> where<00:05:36.830> your<00:05:36.950> fingers

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
you're holding it where your fingers

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.640 
you're holding it where your fingers
would<00:05:37.610> be<00:05:37.730> in<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:37.970> danger<00:05:38.150> zone<00:05:38.540> and<00:05:38.810> that's

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
would be in the danger zone and that's

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.650 
would be in the danger zone and that's
one<00:05:40.190> of<00:05:40.280> the<00:05:40.370> reasons<00:05:40.700> they<00:05:40.820> made<00:05:41.030> it<00:05:41.180> so<00:05:41.419> long

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
one of the reasons they made it so long

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.409 
one of the reasons they made it so long
as<00:05:42.080> if<00:05:42.380> you're<00:05:42.560> holding<00:05:42.919> that<00:05:42.950> tool<00:05:43.419> where

as if you're holding that tool where
your<00:05:44.540> fingers<00:05:44.900> in<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.200> danger<00:05:45.560> zone<00:05:45.590> it<00:05:46.100> will

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
your fingers in the danger zone it will
