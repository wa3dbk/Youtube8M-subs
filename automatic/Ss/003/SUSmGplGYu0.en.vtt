00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
away from them where did that even come

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.130 
away from them where did that even come
from<00:01:35.579> how<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.329> get<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.689> point<00:01:36.930> if

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
from how do we get to that point if

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.710 
from how do we get to that point if
that's<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.530> exactly<00:01:37.950> true<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.210> complex

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
that's not exactly true it's a complex

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.109 
that's not exactly true it's a complex
story<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.710> begins<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.369> 19<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119

that seemed to come out of nowhere and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.020 
that seemed to come out of nowhere and
even<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.259> president<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> 1955<00:01:50.610> President

in 1961

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.050 
in 1961
and<00:02:13.239> it's<00:02:14.019> like<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.439> rest<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.920> history<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.730> mean

the USDA got on board and there became

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.949 
the USDA got on board and there became
just<00:02:21.640> kind<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.819> like<00:02:21.970> new<00:02:22.150> institutional

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
just kind of like new institutional

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.390 
just kind of like new institutional
momentum<00:02:23.439> behind<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.739> everyone's<00:02:24.189> saying

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
momentum behind so everyone's saying

actually<00:02:33.640> went<00:02:33.909> back<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.480> dug<00:02:34.900> into<00:02:35.230> those

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
actually went back and dug into those

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.759 
actually went back and dug into those
original<00:02:36.459> studies<00:02:36.909> and<00:02:37.209> looked<00:02:37.720> into<00:02:38.200> all<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
recent years a number of investigators

were never very good you know it's
interesting<00:02:52.510> we<00:02:52.930> actually<00:02:53.230> looked<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.680> see

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
interesting we actually looked to see

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.740 
interesting we actually looked to see
what<00:02:54.010> research<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:54.549> could<00:02:54.670> find<00:02:54.940> with<00:02:55.629> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
what research we could find with the

that if you were looking for it John was

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.460 
that if you were looking for it John was
talking<00:03:10.389> a<00:03:10.450> lot<00:03:10.540> about<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.840> segment<00:03:11.019> cuz<00:03:11.260> John

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
talking a lot about the segment cuz John

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.800

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
interesting about your research is you

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.550 
interesting about your research is you
say<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:19.090> particularly<00:03:19.599> important<00:03:20.530> for

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
say this is particularly important for

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.610

that's actually good for their health
and<00:03:25.840> they<00:03:25.930> shouldn't<00:03:26.230> ignore<00:03:26.379> it<00:03:26.620> tell<00:03:26.799> us<00:03:26.919> a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
and they shouldn't ignore it tell us a

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.159 
and they shouldn't ignore it tell us a
little<00:03:27.040> bit<00:03:27.250> about<00:03:27.489> that<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:28.329> even<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:29.139> know

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
little bit about that so even you know
