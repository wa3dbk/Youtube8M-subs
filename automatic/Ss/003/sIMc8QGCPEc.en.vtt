00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
takes advantage of the qualities of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.060 
takes advantage of the qualities of
panko<00:00:53.730> oven<00:00:54.480> fried<00:00:54.750> panko<00:00:55.230> chicken<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
panko oven fried panko chicken the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
panko oven fried panko chicken the
difference<00:00:56.399> between<00:00:56.579> panko<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.480> other

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
difference between panko and other

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.900 
difference between panko and other
breadcrumbs<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.410> they<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.949> larger<00:00:59.520> crumbs

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
breadcrumbs is they are larger crumbs

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.479 
breadcrumbs is they are larger crumbs
they<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.809> toastier<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.010> fluffier

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
they are toastier and they are fluffier

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.609 
they are toastier and they are fluffier
so<00:01:02.820> when<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> use<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> lot<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
so when you use them you get a lot of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.980 
so when you use them you get a lot of
crunch<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.519> recipe<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.510> could<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.810> be

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
crunch this recipe really could not be

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.539 
crunch this recipe really could not be
simpler<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.710> we're<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> put<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
simpler first we're going to put the
