00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
before in high school I mean that first

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
before in high school I mean that first
years<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.799> kind<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:27.000> jumpy<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
years was kind of all jumpy and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.390 
years was kind of all jumpy and
everything<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.320> definitely<00:01:28.710> settled<00:01:29.189> down

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
everything but I definitely settled down

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.940 
everything but I definitely settled down
and<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.970> mean<00:01:30.270> SFA<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> good<00:01:31.380> tough<00:01:31.650> team<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and I mean SFA was a good tough team and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.060 
and I mean SFA was a good tough team and
they<00:01:32.430> were<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:33.990> matchup<00:01:34.470> we

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
they were it was this good matchup we

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.330 
they were it was this good matchup we
think<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.520> largest<00:01:35.820> crowd<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.180> play

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
think was the largest crowd to play

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.670 
think was the largest crowd to play
we<00:01:39.340> had<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.460> few<00:01:39.670> playoff<00:01:40.030> games<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.720> I<00:01:40.960> guess

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
we had a few playoff games that I guess

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.500 
we had a few playoff games that I guess
maybe<00:01:41.979> around<00:01:42.250> 10,000<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.000> would<00:01:43.119> hear<00:01:43.210> no

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
maybe around 10,000 I would hear no

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.350 
maybe around 10,000 I would hear no
