okay<00:00:37.809> cruciate<00:00:38.809> like<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.140> word<00:00:39.260> crucifix

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
okay cruciate like the word crucifix

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.850 
okay cruciate like the word crucifix
means<00:00:40.129> cross<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.239> there<00:00:41.390> are<00:00:41.510> two<00:00:41.720> of<00:00:41.870> them<00:00:42.079> so

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
means cross so there are two of them so

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.390 
means cross so there are two of them so
this<00:00:43.160> is<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:43.910> upper<00:00:44.150> leg<00:00:44.329> bone<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.720> femur

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
this is the the upper leg bone the femur

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.130 
this is the the upper leg bone the femur
there's<00:00:46.400> the<00:00:46.730> tibia<00:00:47.089> the<00:00:47.150> shin<00:00:47.690> bone

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
there's the tibia the shin bone

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.079 
there's the tibia the shin bone
there's<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.769> kneecap<00:00:49.160> head<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.699> dog<00:00:49.879> is

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
there's the kneecap head of the dog is

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.810 
there's the kneecap head of the dog is
facing<00:00:50.510> this<00:00:50.660> way<00:00:50.720> tail<00:00:51.230> facing<00:00:51.500> this<00:00:51.890> way<00:00:52.100> so

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
facing this way tail facing this way so

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.820 
facing this way tail facing this way so
cruciate<00:00:53.330> like<00:00:53.480> crucifix<00:00:54.140> there<00:00:54.589> they<00:00:54.800> are

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
cruciate like crucifix there they are

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.740 
cruciate like crucifix there they are
they're<00:00:55.610> named<00:00:55.790> by<00:00:55.970> where<00:00:56.150> they<00:00:56.300> joined<00:00:56.540> the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
they're named by where they joined the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.319 
they're named by where they joined the
the<00:00:57.079> lower<00:00:57.410> bone<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:58.850> would<00:00:59.000> be<00:00:59.120> in<00:00:59.300> the

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
the lower bone so this would be in the

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.990 
the lower bone so this would be in the
dog<00:00:59.570> cranial<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:00.739> is<00:01:00.890> caudal<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.460> humans

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
dog cranial and this is caudal in humans

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.049 
dog cranial and this is caudal in humans
the<00:01:02.270> words<00:01:02.449> are<00:01:02.629> anterior<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.530> posterior

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
the words are anterior and posterior

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.240 
the words are anterior and posterior
often<00:01:05.059> hence<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.570> term<00:01:05.720> ACL<00:01:06.530> in<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:07.070> dog

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
often hence the term ACL in the dog

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.040 
often hence the term ACL in the dog
anterior<00:01:08.240> cruciate<00:01:08.600> ligament

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
anterior cruciate ligament

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.670 
anterior cruciate ligament
okay<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.280> anterior<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.390> this<00:01:11.600> one<00:01:11.810> here<00:01:12.110> if

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
okay so anterior is this one here if

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.370 
okay so anterior is this one here if
that<00:01:12.740> ligament<00:01:13.190> is<00:01:13.550> damaged<00:01:14.090> which<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:14.930> often

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
that ligament is damaged which is often

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.460 
that ligament is damaged which is often
the<00:01:15.500> case<00:01:15.680> in<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.979> dog<00:01:17.020> then<00:01:18.020> you're<00:01:18.259> left

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
the case in the dog then you're left

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.749 
the case in the dog then you're left
with<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.740> scenario<00:01:19.160> like<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:21.520> because<00:01:22.520> the

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
with a scenario like this because the

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.400 
with a scenario like this because the
front<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.360> ligament<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.020> back<00:01:24.200> of

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
front of the ligament and the back of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.609 
front of the ligament and the back of
the<00:01:24.470> ligament<00:01:24.890> are<00:01:25.100> joined<00:01:26.229> what<00:01:27.229> that<00:01:27.410> allows

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
the ligament are joined what that allows

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.080 
the ligament are joined what that allows
us<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:28.009> do<00:01:28.190> now<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.190> push<00:01:31.429> the<00:01:31.640> lower<00:01:31.820> bone

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
us to do now is to push the lower bone

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.949 
us to do now is to push the lower bone
forward<00:01:32.509> in<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:33.800> manner<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:35.360> movement

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
forward in this manner this movement

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.589 
forward in this manner this movement
leads<00:01:36.709> to<00:01:36.890> instability<00:01:37.190> in<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.149> knee<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.479> the

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:38.599 
leads to instability in the knee of the

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.210 
leads to instability in the knee of the
dog<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.140> will<00:01:39.470> ultimately<00:01:39.890> lead<00:01:40.190> to

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
dog and will ultimately lead to

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.370 
dog and will ultimately lead to
deterioration<00:01:41.200> okay

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
deterioration okay

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.980 
deterioration okay

by<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.580> hands<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.239> veterinarian<00:01:50.869> is

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
by the hands of the veterinarian is

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.949 
by the hands of the veterinarian is
diagnostic<00:01:51.709> for<00:01:52.310> an<00:01:52.369> ACL<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:53.179> the<00:01:53.630> typical

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
diagnostic for an ACL the the typical

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.839 
diagnostic for an ACL the the typical
pet<00:01:54.170> owner<00:01:54.410> or<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.890> difficult<00:01:55.369> pet<00:01:55.520> I<00:01:55.550> guess

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
pet owner or the difficult pet I guess

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.960 
pet owner or the difficult pet I guess
is<00:01:56.090> going<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.360> show<00:01:56.539> with<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:57.580> several<00:01:58.580> several

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
is going to show with a several several

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.510 
is going to show with a several several
ways<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.509> guess<00:01:59.569> that<00:01:59.989> they'll<00:02:00.170> present<00:02:00.429> one<00:02:01.429> of

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
ways I guess that they'll present one of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.339 
ways I guess that they'll present one of
the<00:02:01.580> ways<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.910> an<00:02:02.000> acute<00:02:02.300> lameness<00:02:02.569> so<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.170> dog

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
the ways is an acute lameness so the dog

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:04.809 
the ways is an acute lameness so the dog
is<00:02:03.470> out<00:02:03.590> running<00:02:03.890> an<00:02:03.950> apart<00:02:04.310> playing<00:02:04.670> with

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
is out running an apart playing with

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.300 
is out running an apart playing with
other<00:02:04.940> dogs<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:05.509> suddenly<00:02:06.349> the<00:02:06.590> dog<00:02:06.770> yelps

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
other dogs and suddenly the dog yelps

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.400 
other dogs and suddenly the dog yelps
maybe<00:02:07.610> maybe<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.509> spilled<00:02:08.869> hit<00:02:09.110> by<00:02:09.229> another

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
maybe maybe is spilled hit by another

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.250 
maybe maybe is spilled hit by another
dog<00:02:09.679> it's<00:02:10.489> a<00:02:10.580> leg<00:02:10.759> caught<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.390> suddenly<00:02:12.140> the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
dog it's a leg caught and suddenly the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.199 
dog it's a leg caught and suddenly the
leg<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.590> up<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.280> won't<00:02:13.520> go<00:02:13.730> back<00:02:13.940> down

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
leg is up and it won't go back down

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.809 
leg is up and it won't go back down
that's<00:02:14.480> considered<00:02:14.989> an<00:02:15.080> acute<00:02:15.470> injury<00:02:15.819> a

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
that's considered an acute injury a

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.540 
that's considered an acute injury a
chronic<00:02:17.390> injury<00:02:17.569> would<00:02:17.959> be<00:02:17.989> more<00:02:18.980> consistent

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
chronic injury would be more consistent

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.040 
chronic injury would be more consistent
with<00:02:19.640> an<00:02:19.790> on-again-off-again<00:02:20.330> lameness

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
with an on-again-off-again lameness

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.780 
with an on-again-off-again lameness
where<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.590> owner<00:02:21.800> may<00:02:21.920> rest<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.340> dog<00:02:22.489> for<00:02:22.760> a

where the owner may rest the dog for a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.530 
where the owner may rest the dog for a
little<00:02:22.970> while

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
little while

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.110 
little while
dog<00:02:23.959> appears<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.560> get<00:02:24.650> better<00:02:25.120> shortly

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
dog appears to get better shortly

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.780 
dog appears to get better shortly
thereafter<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.950> dog<00:02:28.099> seems<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.430> go<00:02:28.580> lame

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
thereafter the dog seems to go lame

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.309 
thereafter the dog seems to go lame
again<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.599> they<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:29.810> they<00:02:29.930> played<00:02:30.200> this

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
again and and they so they played this

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.020 
again and and they so they played this
sort<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.620> game<00:02:30.800> back<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.310> forth<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:31.819> could

sort of game back and forth and it could

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.420 
sort of game back and forth and it could
take<00:02:32.209> weeks<00:02:32.480> or<00:02:32.989> months<00:02:33.050> very<00:02:33.890> often<00:02:34.250> by<00:02:34.340> the

is<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.099> dog<00:02:40.250> has<00:02:40.430> been<00:02:40.459> on<00:02:41.060> again<00:02:41.359> off<00:02:41.510> again

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
is the dog has been on again off again

lame seems to be doing fairly well
and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:44.030> suddenly<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.320> ligament<00:02:45.950> snaps

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
and then suddenly the the ligament snaps

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.400 
and then suddenly the the ligament snaps
and<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.880> leg<00:02:47.060> comes<00:02:47.270> up<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.750> now<00:02:47.810> owners<00:02:48.230> go

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410

now<00:02:48.680> we<00:02:48.740> have<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.070> big<00:02:49.280> problem<00:02:49.520> this<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.120> tend<00:02:50.480> to

now we have a big problem this I tend to

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.720 
now we have a big problem this I tend to
be<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.780> three<00:02:51.080> ways<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.620> we<00:02:51.770> see<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> cruciate

the early loading exercises and then by

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.719 
the early loading exercises and then by
about<00:05:33.990> week<00:05:34.350> two<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.680> staples<00:05:35.400> would<00:05:35.580> be

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
about week two the staples would be

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.230 
about week two the staples would be
coming<00:05:36.060> out<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:37.039> we<00:05:38.039> would<00:05:38.280> start<00:05:38.580> using<00:05:39.150> an

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
coming out and we would start using an

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.810 
coming out and we would start using an
electrical<00:05:39.690> muscle<00:05:40.050> stimulator<00:05:40.500> on<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:41.370> leg

electrical muscle stimulator on the leg

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.380 
electrical muscle stimulator on the leg
yeah<00:05:42.419> it's<00:05:42.750> good<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.970> they<00:05:44.970> go<00:05:45.150> home<00:05:45.300> with

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
yeah it's good and they go home with

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.990 
yeah it's good and they go home with
this<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:45.750> use<00:05:45.900> this<00:05:46.110> once<00:05:46.710> a<00:05:46.919> day<00:05:46.950> at<00:05:47.550> night

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
this and use this once a day at night
