getting taken out nice use we have a

getting taken out nice use we have a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
couple roaches in this position as well

roaches<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.670> completely<00:01:00.059> regenerated<00:01:00.660> I'm

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
roaches as completely regenerated I'm

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.280 
roaches as completely regenerated I'm
thinking<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> roaches<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:03.329> they're

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
thinking that the roaches if they're

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
thinking that the roaches if they're
burrowed<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.369> currently<00:01:05.700> taking

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
burrowed and there are currently taking

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
burrowed and there are currently taking
damage<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.630> their<00:01:07.140> rapid<00:01:07.590> regeneration

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
damage there their rapid regeneration

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.940 
damage there their rapid regeneration
should<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.520> nullified<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.270> mean<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.500> can't<00:01:10.710> you

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
should be nullified I mean you can't you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.649 
should be nullified I mean you can't you
shouldn't<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.250> able<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.640> rapidly<00:01:11.850> regenerate

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659

shouldn't be able to rapidly regenerate
while<00:01:12.930> someone's<00:01:13.380> beating<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.189> if

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
while someone's beating up on you if

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399 
while someone's beating up on you if
you're<00:01:14.520> underground<00:01:15.170> that's<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.259> my

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you're underground that's just my

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
you're underground that's just my
thought<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> would<00:01:16.860> also<00:01:17.009> counter<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> whole

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
thought it would also counter the whole

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.179 
thought it would also counter the whole
entire<00:01:18.180> size<00:01:18.900> storm<00:01:19.200> effect<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.710> top<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
entire size storm effect on top of a

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.060 
entire size storm effect on top of a
roach<00:01:20.400> roaches<00:01:21.240> heal<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:22.229> bit<00:01:22.560> slower

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
roach roaches heal a little bit slower

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
roach roaches heal a little bit slower
than<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> size<00:01:23.729> storm<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
than the size storm so I think the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.899 
than the size storm so I think the
roaches<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.799> stay<00:01:26.009> underground<00:01:26.340> under

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
roaches can stay underground under

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.149 
roaches can stay underground under
constant<00:01:27.390> storm<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.170> about<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.829> don't

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
constant storm for about like I don't

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.039 
constant storm for about like I don't
know<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:30.000> minutes<00:01:30.390> before<00:01:30.540> they're<00:01:30.840> dead

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
know if two minutes before they're dead

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.080 
know if two minutes before they're dead
because<00:01:31.259> they<00:01:31.770> regenerate<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.400> quickly<00:01:32.640> we

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
because they regenerate that quickly we

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.580 
because they regenerate that quickly we
have<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> couple<00:01:33.509> overloads<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> air

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
have a couple overloads in the air

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.249 
have a couple overloads in the air
spawning<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.460> creep<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.270> there's<00:01:36.450> creep<00:01:36.720> all

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
spawning that creep so there's creep all

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.359 
spawning that creep so there's creep all
the<00:01:37.290> way<00:01:37.439> down<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.040> way<00:01:38.130> back<00:01:38.220> up

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the way down and all the way back up

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.819 
the way down and all the way back up
these<00:01:38.939> units<00:01:39.360> moving<00:01:39.630> faster<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.560> creep

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
these units moving faster on that creep

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.440 
these units moving faster on that creep
right<00:01:40.979> now<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.729> movement<00:01:41.909> speed<00:01:42.270> is

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
right now see the movement speed is

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.600 
right now see the movement speed is
indeed<00:01:42.810> fast<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.439> those<00:01:43.920> roaches<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:44.340> move

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
indeed fast as those roaches now move

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730 
indeed fast as those roaches now move
out<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.320> overseer

think<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> changing<00:02:01.439> would<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.710> get

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
think that changing would just get

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.830 
think that changing would just get

this a queen coming in so that Queen and
going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.099> be<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.790> start<00:02:15.000> tacking<00:02:15.330> that

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
going to be going to start tacking that

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.270 
going to be going to start tacking that
ground<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.050> has<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.709> attack<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
ground so it has a to attack with the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.150 
ground so it has a to attack with the
range<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.700> three<00:02:18.060> um<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:19.050> cannot<00:02:19.650> believe<00:02:19.709> that

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
range of three um I cannot believe that

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160 
range of three um I cannot believe that
that's<00:02:20.730> really<00:02:20.880> being<00:02:21.120> used<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.599> guess<00:02:22.140> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that's really being used I guess that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.920 
that's really being used I guess that
it's<00:02:22.470> for<00:02:22.709> transfusion<00:02:23.550> transfusion<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
it's for transfusion transfusion in a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.839 
it's for transfusion transfusion in a
bullying<00:02:25.260> them<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.130> order<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.459> heal<00:02:26.819> a

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
bullying them and in order to heal a

bullying them and in order to heal a
little<00:02:27.120> bit<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.599> quickly<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:28.470> going<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
little bit more quickly so it's going to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.320 
little bit more quickly so it's going to
going<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.160> try<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> use<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.610> Queen<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.300> a
