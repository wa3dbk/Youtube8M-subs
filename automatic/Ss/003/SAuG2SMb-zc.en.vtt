00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
like a new book and then

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.900 
like a new book and then
you've<00:02:13.740> got<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.730> mesh<00:02:15.330> here<00:02:15.810> um<00:02:16.910> throughout

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
you've got a mesh here um throughout

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.970 
you've got a mesh here um throughout
segments<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> upper<00:02:19.260> as<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.710> see

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.760 
segments of the upper as you can see
there<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:21.540> aid<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.110> terms<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
there to aid in terms of the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.950 
there to aid in terms of the
breathability<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> shoe<00:02:23.880> how<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.720> works

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
breathability of the shoe how that works

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.410 
breathability of the shoe how that works
remains<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.590> be<00:02:25.620> seen<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.820> almost<00:02:26.940> looks<00:02:27.360> like

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
remains to be seen it almost looks like

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.290 
remains to be seen it almost looks like
it's<00:02:27.720> using<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.110> nike<00:02:28.530> torch<00:02:29.300> technology

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
it's using the nike torch technology

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.830 
it's using the nike torch technology
right<00:02:30.540> there<00:02:30.830> but<00:02:31.830> um<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.510> have<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.540> check<00:02:33.810> that

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
right there but um I have to check that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.050 
right there but um I have to check that
that's<00:02:34.230> what<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.440> looks<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.040> mean<00:02:35.820> you've

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
that's what it looks like I mean you've

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.670 
that's what it looks like I mean you've
got<00:02:36.090> these<00:02:36.890> carbon<00:02:37.890> fiber<00:02:38.660> sections<00:02:39.680> here

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
got these carbon fiber sections here

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.360 
got these carbon fiber sections here
like<00:02:41.220> guardrails<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.980> lateral<00:02:43.980> side<00:02:44.040> of

like guardrails on the lateral side of
the<00:02:44.459> foot<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.970> then<00:02:45.480> right<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
the foot and then right here on the
