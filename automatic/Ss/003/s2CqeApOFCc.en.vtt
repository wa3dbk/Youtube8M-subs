00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
policy actually valve run of a similar

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.420 
policy actually valve run of a similar
policy<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.240> blizzard<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.220> policy<00:01:38.220> of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.440 
feel that they're in a really good state
and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.250> remember<00:02:05.670> back<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> day<00:02:06.240> of

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
and I remember back in the day of

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.600 
and I remember back in the day of
half-life<00:02:06.899> 2<00:02:07.259> when<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.560> saw<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.829> tech<00:02:08.160> videos

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
half-life 2 when I saw the tech videos

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.729 
half-life 2 when I saw the tech videos
of<00:02:08.879> them<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.110> course<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.649> way

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
of them this is of course all the way

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.309 
of them this is of course all the way
back<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.220> mists<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.819> time<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:13.290> just

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
back in the mists of time and I just

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.059 
back in the mists of time and I just
thought

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
thought

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.739 
thought
my<00:02:14.129> goodness<00:02:14.549> this<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:15.090> game<00:02:15.299> just<00:02:15.510> looks

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:15.749 
my goodness this this game just looks

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:20.179 
my goodness this this game just looks
immense<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:17.209> can't<00:02:18.209> wait<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.480> play<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.290> of

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
immense I can't wait to play it and of

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.589 
immense I can't wait to play it and of
course<00:02:20.400> there<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.879> odd<00:02:21.120> link<00:02:21.450> of

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
course there was the odd link of

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.649 
course there was the odd link of
half-life<00:02:21.989> 2<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.879> believe<00:02:23.879> if<00:02:24.299> i'm<00:02:24.480> not

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
half-life 2 I believe if i'm not

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.020 
half-life 2 I believe if i'm not
mistaken<00:02:25.019> on<00:02:25.799> this<00:02:26.040> please<00:02:26.400> someone<00:02:26.670> correct

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
mistaken on this please someone correct

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.690 
mistaken on this please someone correct
me<00:02:27.150> if<00:02:27.209> i<00:02:27.389> am<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:28.980> from<00:02:29.129> pure<00:02:29.370> memory

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
me if i am this is just from pure memory

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.339 
me if i am this is just from pure memory
but<00:02:29.879> i<00:02:29.909> believe<00:02:29.969> someone<00:02:30.540> hacked<00:02:30.840> into<00:02:31.079> the

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
but i believe someone hacked into the

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.449 
but i believe someone hacked into the
server<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.980> stole<00:02:32.819> some<00:02:33.150> source<00:02:33.510> code<00:02:34.459> haha

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
server and stole some source code haha

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.589 
server and stole some source code haha
for<00:02:36.060> I'm<00:02:36.420> half<00:02:36.659> life<00:02:36.930> 2<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:38.389> obviously<00:02:39.389> it<00:02:39.510> was

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
for I'm half life 2 and obviously it was

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.690 
for I'm half life 2 and obviously it was
nowhere<00:02:39.930> near<00:02:40.129> representing<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.340> full<00:02:41.489> game

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
nowhere near representing the full game

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.069 
nowhere near representing the full game
I<00:02:41.760> actually<00:02:42.090> think<00:02:42.359> the<00:02:42.510> same<00:02:42.810> thing<00:02:43.049> happened

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
I actually think the same thing happened

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.739 
I actually think the same thing happened
to<00:02:43.499> quake<00:02:43.889> three<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.700> think<00:02:45.150> there's<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.480> quite<00:02:45.719> a

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:45.749 
to quake three I think there's a quite a

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.690 
to quake three I think there's a quite a
lot<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.049> quake<00:02:46.620> three<00:02:46.889> actually<00:02:47.159> stolen<00:02:47.430> as

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
lot of quake three actually stolen as

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.659 
lot of quake three actually stolen as
well<00:02:48.290> I'll<00:02:49.290> was<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.709> doom<00:02:50.010> free<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.310> think<00:02:50.549> it's

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
well I'll was it doom free I think it's

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.309 
well I'll was it doom free I think it's
actually<00:02:50.760> doing<00:02:51.150> very<00:02:51.180> actually<00:02:51.930> come<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
actually doing very actually come to

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.059 
actually doing very actually come to
think<00:02:52.409> of<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.709> anywho<00:02:53.669> more<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.269> point

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
think of it anywho more to the point

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.319 
think of it anywho more to the point
Gabe<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.310> course<00:02:56.340> was<00:02:56.669> not<00:02:56.790> very<00:02:56.909> happy<00:02:57.030> about

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
Gabe of course was not very happy about

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.689 
Gabe of course was not very happy about
this<00:02:57.780> because<00:02:58.260> as<00:02:58.829> he<00:02:58.889> said<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.430> doesn't

00:02:59.689 --> 00:02:59.699 
this because as he said it doesn't

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.729 
this because as he said it doesn't
represent<00:02:59.939> the<00:03:00.389> game<00:03:00.569> even<00:03:00.900> slightly<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.590> her

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739

one so far I've been doing but it

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.699 
one so far I've been doing but it
appears<00:03:36.449> the<00:03:36.720> valve<00:03:36.989> are<00:03:37.259> very<00:03:37.409> tight-lipped

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
appears the valve are very tight-lipped

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.319 
appears the valve are very tight-lipped
so<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.519> know<00:03:38.639> you<00:03:38.729> guys<00:03:38.909> have<00:03:39.060> really

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
anyway but I'm only can hope that the

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.749 
anyway but I'm only can hope that the
weights<00:03:46.169> worth<00:03:46.439> it<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.739> have<00:03:46.919> no<00:03:47.099> doubt<00:03:47.310> will<00:03:47.579> be

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:47.759 
weights worth it I have no doubt will be

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.479 
weights worth it I have no doubt will be
I<00:03:47.790> mean<00:03:47.849> valve<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.409> don't<00:03:49.949> think<00:03:50.009> they've<00:03:50.280> made

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
I mean valve I don't think they've made

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.020 
I mean valve I don't think they've made
