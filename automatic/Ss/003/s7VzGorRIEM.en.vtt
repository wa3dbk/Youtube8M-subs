Paris carbon black liner intense if you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.490 
Paris carbon black liner intense if you
want<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> know<00:01:54.479> actually<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.110> say<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
want to know actually how to say it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
want to know actually how to say it
because<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:56.070> everyone's<00:01:56.610> saying

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
because I know like everyone's saying

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.060 
because I know like everyone's saying
like<00:01:57.060> linear<00:01:57.630> intense<00:01:58.079> yeah<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.530> French<00:01:58.829> so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
like linear intense yeah it's French so

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.840 
like linear intense yeah it's French so
it's<00:01:59.250> actually<00:01:59.729> more<00:02:00.000> likely<00:02:00.270> new<00:02:00.630> instead<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
it's actually more likely new instead of

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
it's actually more likely new instead of
linear<00:02:02.850> cuz<00:02:03.149> there's<00:02:03.299> no<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.110> no<00:02:04.469> this

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
linear cuz there's no a in it no this

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.889 
linear cuz there's no a in it no this
has<00:02:04.710> been<00:02:04.799> out<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.189> while<00:02:05.399> but<00:02:05.850> um<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.780> is

competition and it's actually so pretty
and<00:02:51.250> it's<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.459> easy<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.819> apply<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.329> usually

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
and it's so easy to apply I usually

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.300 
and it's so easy to apply I usually
don't<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:54.109> liquid<00:02:54.500> eyeliner<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.190> are

I<00:02:58.400> was<00:02:58.579> even<00:02:58.730> more<00:02:59.000> skeptical<00:02:59.569> because<00:02:59.690> I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
I was even more skeptical because I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.830 
I was even more skeptical because I
usually<00:03:00.319> only<00:03:00.560> like<00:03:01.040> pen<00:03:01.730> eyeliners<00:03:02.450> but<00:03:02.690> this

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
usually only like pen eyeliners but this

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.360 
usually only like pen eyeliners but this
is<00:03:02.959> actually<00:03:03.109> really<00:03:03.470> nice<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:03.889> I<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.129> it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
is actually really nice and I like it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.369 
is actually really nice and I like it
the<00:03:04.849> last<00:03:05.060> thing<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:05.389> I<00:03:05.629> got<00:03:05.840> makeup<00:03:06.049> wise

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
the last thing that I got makeup wise

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.770 
the last thing that I got makeup wise
wasn't<00:03:06.920> our<00:03:07.040> dell<00:03:07.340> set<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.849> eyelashes<00:03:08.540> and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
wasn't our dell set of eyelashes and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.349 
wasn't our dell set of eyelashes and
nearly<00:03:09.099> ardell<00:03:10.099> accent<00:03:10.670> lashes<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.299> I

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
nearly ardell accent lashes and I

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.000 
nearly ardell accent lashes and I
believe<00:03:11.599> they<00:03:11.720> were<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.989> number<00:03:12.200> 305<00:03:12.739> I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
believe they were in the number 305 I

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.960 
believe they were in the number 305 I
have<00:03:13.159> a<00:03:13.190> picture<00:03:13.549> of<00:03:13.670> them<00:03:13.790> here<00:03:14.209> boom

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.090 

and<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.990> reason<00:03:18.140> why<00:03:18.350> I<00:03:18.410> only<00:03:18.590> have<00:03:18.770> this<00:03:18.950> to

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
and the reason why I only have this to

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.170 
and the reason why I only have this to
show<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.550> because<00:03:19.640> I'm<00:03:19.790> actually<00:03:19.910> wearing

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
show you is because I'm actually wearing

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.050 
show you is because I'm actually wearing
them<00:03:20.450> right<00:03:20.480> now<00:03:20.600> for<00:03:20.990> my<00:03:21.110> competition<00:03:21.940> if<00:03:22.940> you
