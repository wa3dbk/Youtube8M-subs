 as they saw friends I'm changing roles

 it was very fun, all this was a 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.290
 revenge for all those women who 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.209
 they feel harassed by those men I 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.209
 I am a Christian is one for our day 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.750
 I would like to be your daughter to tell you 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.750
 purpose 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.640
 crystal of course we very 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.680
 happy because now we want to give the 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.020
 welcome the disclosure psychologist 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.580
 of the science of unam alfonso andrÃ©s 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.410
 fernandez medina who is already with 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.630
 us to talk precisely 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.850
 from the subject we are going to do now yes the 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.070
 analysis of what they just saw of everything 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.780
 I think alfonso very interesting was 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.430
 the experiment because we are seeing a 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.430
 phenomenon that happens every day 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.230
 phenomena that are very important to 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.270
 highlight that here the woman is the one 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.910
 begins to manifest or express something that 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.010
 feels or that what he sees in man and 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.500
 man we saw the reactions really the 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.280
 man got out of wave did not expect 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.320
 because this is not common for other 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.370
 much more nervous or even we saw 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.200
 with construction workers 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.910
 they were eating a taco them 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.490
 normally or daily when 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.900
 happen they are the ones that do it and suddenly 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.540
 now we see that when receiving 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.400
 that compliment they did not know what to do 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.810
 They knew how to handle the situation but 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.940
 here is an important port that 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.370
 also the tone that says the way in 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.110
 to tell the context the place is going to 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.630
 depend a lot to know if it's a 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.000
 compliment that can be healthy as well 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.330
 say a vibrator can be the 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.710
 long or very aggressive there are some very 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.050
 aggressive that can be even as 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.310
 harassment here sometimes even the men of 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.500
 suddenly for example we saw it with the 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.180
 tattoo and suddenly it did not serve as a 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.220
 aggression 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.990
 and maybe we say good such 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.540
 once we do not feel it is rude but for him 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.100
 by his way of interpreting the message 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.090
 so he lived it then now we are 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.800
 living a phenomenon 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.470
 more and more women feel 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.240
 attacked with such compliments by 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.889
 So you have to be very careful as the 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.360
 men in particular because there 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.639
 little groups of men too that do 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.530
 with that purpose or purpose to bother but if 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.229
 we talk about the compliment can be witty 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.030
 maybe it's very light and that 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.830
 they can even do it not necessarily 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.510
 with someone unknown as we saw in the 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.110
 experiment but they do with some 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.639
 partner or some couple some friend 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.800
 It is worth everything as long as there is 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.380
 a respect since what we are seeing 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.940
 is that when elvis a christina is a 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.919
 revenge what many men tell us 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.360
 experiments have been made some parts 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.370
 of the world where much has been suffered 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.710
 harassment on the part of men and 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.090
 put the exercise in this way the 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.370
 men suddenly if they feel very 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.590
 assaulted attacked as all that 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.990
 we wrote in this note that brought us 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.340
 Cristina and I believe practically all the 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.130
 range of reactions that could have 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.750
 not because there were some that did get out 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.500
 of wave others that if it is up to 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.500
 they stopped 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.070
 the men who were accompanied by them 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.190
 calladitos and that one of the ladies 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.440
 he defended exactly above all as we are 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.180
 accustomed and there is a roll too 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.250
 very sexual erotic in some of the 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.220
 compliments that is when suddenly we fall 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.350
 in this on that label if it is me 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.730
 saying something sexual then already what 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.620
 associates directly with some aggression 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.390
 although not necessarily then 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.100
 depends a lot on the context and not the 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.450
 culture including even the states of 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.020
 the republic in the compliments are also 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.020
 very varied 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.560
 the origin of the word pyrope comes from 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.480
 greek meaning red stone 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.490
 then before they were red stones 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.100
 as a symbol that he liked that 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.540
 one way to flatter others comes from 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.100
 there it is distorted sometimes 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.930
 as time goes by now 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.430
 it's a bit more street and another one is used 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.500
 kind of words of size I think of the 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.210
 one's article as they take it because to 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.880
 I have to see in the street what they say 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.860
 things and you make faces like that 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.479
 happens but it happens like that to the two seconds you 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.100
 you are laughing because you have left 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.389
 to women's customs what 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.310
 I was asking some compaÃ±eras here 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.530
 daily book tells them anything that is the 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:28.410
 daily antilles accustomed they're going 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:32.479
 daily to the street they say daily they say 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.479
 now it worries what is happening 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.100
 and that's where you have to learn while having 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.050
 like a gene not to hook that you do not have 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.759
 to see a little filter that information if 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.600
 bothers you to filter the for either 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:49.919
 that is something aggressive for you flows and 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.410
 then you do not get hooked either 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:54.360
 you pass as if it had not happened but 

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.680
 a social phenomenon that happens not nothing 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.810
 more in the big city is also out there 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.910
 in all many thanks to the success of 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.570
