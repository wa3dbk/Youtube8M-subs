we have like in our amateur scouting

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.460 
we have like in our amateur scouting
meetings<00:03:51.489> in<00:03:51.669> Toronto<00:03:52.540> we<00:03:52.720> spent<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.229> lot<00:03:53.440> of

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
meetings in Toronto we spent a lot of

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.339 
meetings in Toronto we spent a lot of
time<00:03:53.699> trying<00:03:54.699> to<00:03:54.879> figure<00:03:55.659> out<00:03:55.840> who<00:03:56.199> we

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
time trying to figure out who we

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.080 
time trying to figure out who we
thoughts<00:03:56.620> going<00:03:56.919> to<00:03:56.979> be<00:03:57.189> there<00:03:57.430> when<00:03:57.609> we<00:03:57.790> pick

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
thoughts going to be there when we pick

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.539 
thoughts going to be there when we pick
I<00:03:58.389> think<00:03:59.319> we've<00:03:59.470> narrowed<00:03:59.769> it<00:03:59.919> down<00:03:59.979> to<00:04:00.189> like

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
I think we've narrowed it down to like

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.569 
I think we've narrowed it down to like
four<00:04:00.819> or<00:04:00.939> five<00:04:00.970> names<00:04:01.479> and<00:04:01.859> you<00:04:02.859> know<00:04:02.979> so<00:04:03.250> I'm

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
four or five names and you know so I'm

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.250 
four or five names and you know so I'm
confident<00:04:04.150> we'll<00:04:04.299> end<00:04:04.510> up<00:04:04.629> with<00:04:04.689> one<00:04:05.019> of<00:04:05.049> those

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
confident we'll end up with one of those

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.069 
confident we'll end up with one of those
players<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.129> I<00:04:06.370> think<00:04:06.939> we<00:04:07.329> have<00:04:07.359> a<00:04:07.569> chance<00:04:07.840> to

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
players and I think we have a chance to

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.559 
players and I think we have a chance to
get<00:04:08.169> a<00:04:08.229> real<00:04:08.470> good<00:04:08.680> player<00:04:08.979> so<00:04:09.090> it's<00:04:10.090> an

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
get a real good player so it's an

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.599 
get a real good player so it's an
exciting<00:04:11.079> time<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.620> year<00:04:11.769> for<00:04:11.829> us<00:04:12.250> because
