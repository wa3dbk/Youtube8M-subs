00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:09.180 

you

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.270 

the<00:00:10.059> opening<00:00:10.420> of<00:00:11.049> the<00:00:11.110> algos<00:00:11.650> video<00:00:11.950> had<00:00:12.250> a

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
the opening of the algos video had a

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.039 
the opening of the algos video had a
sort<00:00:12.639> of<00:00:12.670> granular<00:00:13.119> effect<00:00:13.509> so<00:00:13.690> just<00:00:13.869> let<00:00:14.019> a

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
sort of granular effect so just let a

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:15.449 
sort of granular effect so just let a
quick<00:00:14.259> look<00:00:14.410> at<00:00:14.500> some<00:00:14.529> of<00:00:14.679> the<00:00:14.830> settings<00:00:15.070> here

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
quick look at some of the settings here

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.790 
quick look at some of the settings here
you<00:00:15.610> see<00:00:15.759> how<00:00:15.879> uniform<00:00:16.570> that<00:00:16.779> once<00:00:16.960> I've<00:00:17.619> just

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
you see how uniform that once I've just

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.339 
you see how uniform that once I've just
gone<00:00:17.919> inside<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:18.520> lower<00:00:19.509> compound<00:00:19.990> here<00:00:20.200> and

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
gone inside the lower compound here and

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.050 
gone inside the lower compound here and
looking<00:00:20.529> at<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.710> material<00:00:21.009> and<00:00:21.310> here<00:00:21.880> we<00:00:22.029> look

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
looking at the material and here we look

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.640 
looking at the material and here we look
at<00:00:22.239> the<00:00:22.390> air<00:00:22.509> friction<00:00:22.750> flow<00:00:23.169> rate<00:00:23.439> though

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
at the air friction flow rate though

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.339 
at the air friction flow rate though
take<00:00:24.550> that<00:00:24.640> off<00:00:24.759> you<00:00:25.000> can<00:00:25.150> see<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:25.899> difference

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
take that off you can see the difference

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.900 
take that off you can see the difference
sir<00:00:26.759> there's<00:00:27.759> a<00:00:28.200> no<00:00:29.200> friction<00:00:29.739> as<00:00:29.890> they<00:00:30.340> flow

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
sir there's a no friction as they flow

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.310 
sir there's a no friction as they flow
between<00:00:31.180> each<00:00:31.450> other<00:00:31.629> therefore<00:00:31.930> we<00:00:32.079> get<00:00:32.169> out

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
between each other therefore we get out

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.040 
between each other therefore we get out
at<00:00:32.469> a<00:00:32.529> randomized<00:00:33.070> effect<00:00:33.629> but<00:00:34.629> when<00:00:34.750> it's<00:00:34.899> on

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
at a randomized effect but when it's on

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.790 
at a randomized effect but when it's on
we<00:00:35.230> get<00:00:35.410> this<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:37.149> called<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.420> uniform<00:00:38.050> effect

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
we get this it's called a uniform effect

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
we get this it's called a uniform effect
and<00:00:39.010> there's<00:00:39.250> something<00:00:39.550> which<00:00:39.670> is

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
and there's something which is

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.849 
and there's something which is
interesting<00:00:40.210> we're<00:00:40.390> going<00:00:40.629> to<00:00:40.780> say<00:00:41.589> the<00:00:41.739> air

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
interesting we're going to say the air

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.209 
interesting we're going to say the air
density<00:00:42.159> very<00:00:42.850> very<00:00:43.269> little<00:00:43.890> density<00:00:44.890> in<00:00:45.100> the

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
density very very little density in the

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.529 
density very very little density in the
effort<00:00:45.339> to<00:00:45.640> increase<00:00:45.879> that<00:00:46.179> watch<00:00:46.329> what

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
effort to increase that watch what

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.270 
effort to increase that watch what
happens<00:00:46.870> while<00:00:47.079> it<00:00:47.230> slows<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:47.649> down<00:00:47.859> with<00:00:48.190> the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
happens while it slows it down with the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.770 
happens while it slows it down with the
interaction<00:00:48.730> limit<00:00:48.969> just<00:00:48.999> increases

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
interaction limit just increases

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.299 
interaction limit just increases
slightly<00:00:49.989> you'll<00:00:50.620> see<00:00:50.859> that<00:00:51.039> how<00:00:53.309> that's

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
slightly you'll see that how that's

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.399 
slightly you'll see that how that's
pushing<00:00:54.879> on<00:00:55.089> to<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.420> particles<00:00:56.289> and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
pushing on to the particles and

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.259 
pushing on to the particles and
eventually<00:00:56.920> they<00:00:57.069> give<00:00:57.309> way<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:57.819> start<00:00:58.030> to

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
eventually they give way and start to

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.809 
eventually they give way and start to
collapse<00:00:58.839> like<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.319> so<00:01:00.100> playing<00:01:00.309> with<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:00.670> as

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
collapse like that so playing with it as

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:03.029 
collapse like that so playing with it as
he<00:01:00.999> has<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.569> big<00:01:01.870> effect<00:01:02.019> if<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.530> want<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:02.739> try

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
he has a big effect if you want to try

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.149 
he has a big effect if you want to try
to<00:01:03.100> keep<00:01:03.309> things<00:01:03.519> regular<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.479> confined<00:01:05.159> go

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
to keep things regular and confined go

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.810 
to keep things regular and confined go
back<00:01:06.370> to<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.640> original<00:01:07.420> material<00:01:08.229> let's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
back to the original material let's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.300 
back to the original material let's
reduce<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.060> friction<00:01:11.049> flow<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.660> there<00:01:13.660> we<00:01:13.780> go

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
reduce the friction flow and there we go

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.070 
reduce the friction flow and there we go
you<00:01:15.310> see<00:01:15.490> how<00:01:15.670> forward<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.210> reduce<00:01:16.660> a<00:01:16.780> bit<00:01:16.930> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
you see how forward to reduce a bit the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.870 
you see how forward to reduce a bit the
collisions<00:01:17.860> as<00:01:18.010> well<00:01:18.190> we'll<00:01:18.400> probably<00:01:18.670> get<00:01:18.820> a

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
collisions as well we'll probably get a

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.900 
collisions as well we'll probably get a
bit<00:01:19.030> more<00:01:19.180> over<00:01:19.480> there<00:01:19.840> we<00:01:20.200> go<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.670> bit<00:01:21.820> of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
bit more over there we go it's a bit of

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.890 
bit more over there we go it's a bit of
a<00:01:21.970> more<00:01:22.180> of<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:24.360> perfect<00:01:25.360> we're<00:01:25.540> looking<00:01:25.780> for

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
a more of a perfect we're looking for

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.570 
a more of a perfect we're looking for
when<00:01:25.990> they<00:01:26.110> start<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.500> spread<00:01:26.860> because<00:01:27.370> I'm

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
when they start to spread because I'm

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.520 
when they start to spread because I'm
going<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:27.850> increase<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.020> size<00:01:29.260> of<00:01:29.440> my<00:01:30.060> emitter

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.960 

the<00:01:35.530> reason<00:01:35.830> is<00:01:35.950> open<00:01:36.190> just<00:01:36.430> want<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.850> make

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
the reason is open just want to make

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.250 
the reason is open just want to make
this<00:01:37.120> actually<00:01:37.450> want<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.660> start<00:01:38.020> playing

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
this actually want to start playing

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.180 
this actually want to start playing
around<00:01:38.410> and<00:01:38.620> have<00:01:38.800> some<00:01:38.980> of<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
around and have some of the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.720 
around and have some of the
interactivity<00:01:40.120> that<00:01:41.040> comes<00:01:42.040> with<00:01:42.220> Lago<00:01:42.460> earth

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
interactivity that comes with Lago earth

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.090 
interactivity that comes with Lago earth
sir<00:01:43.090> really<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.660> quite<00:01:43.840> amazing<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:44.500> the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
sir really is quite amazing so the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.450 
sir really is quite amazing so the
volume<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.680> produce<00:01:47.980> enough

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
volume is going to produce enough

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.030 
volume is going to produce enough
particles<00:01:48.820> based<00:01:49.210> on<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.660> initial<00:01:50.040> size

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
particles based on the initial size

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.820 
particles based on the initial size
which<00:01:52.030> was<00:01:52.270> here<00:01:52.510> point<00:01:52.840> 5<00:01:53.080> units<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.770> if

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
which was here point 5 units and if

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.430 
which was here point 5 units and if
obviously<00:01:54.160> there's<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:55.080> particle<00:01:56.080> occupy<00:01:56.410> that

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
obviously there's a particle occupy that

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.020 
obviously there's a particle occupy that
space<00:01:56.650> it<00:01:56.980> won't<00:01:57.160> fill<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.460> so<00:01:57.490> it's<00:01:57.760> it's

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
space it won't fill it so it's it's

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.630 
space it won't fill it so it's it's
really<00:01:58.290> regular<00:01:59.290> volumes<00:01:59.680> work<00:02:00.280> really<00:02:00.520> well

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
really regular volumes work really well

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.970 
really regular volumes work really well
with<00:02:00.790> with<00:02:01.390> log<00:02:01.600> goer<00:02:01.840> because<00:02:02.830> obviously

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
with with log goer because obviously

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.200 
with with log goer because obviously
their<00:02:03.250> initial<00:02:03.580> values<00:02:03.910> are<00:02:04.060> very<00:02:04.240> well<00:02:04.480> set
