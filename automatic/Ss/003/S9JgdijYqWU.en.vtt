Cruiser<00:00:03.840> conversion<00:00:04.440> project<00:00:05.629> came<00:00:06.629> together

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
Cruiser conversion project came together

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.639 
Cruiser conversion project came together
really<00:00:06.930> nicely

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
really nicely

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.890

I<00:00:07.799> was<00:00:08.400> actually<00:00:08.790> completely<00:00:09.210> amazed<00:00:09.599> at<00:00:09.870> just

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
I was actually completely amazed at just

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.839 
I was actually completely amazed at just
how<00:00:10.380> straight<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.980> alignment<00:00:11.429> was<00:00:11.580> when<00:00:11.820> I

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
how straight the alignment was when I

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:12.950 
how straight the alignment was when I
took<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.090> for<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.360> ride<00:00:12.389> around<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.900> block

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
took it for a ride around the block

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.709 
took it for a ride around the block
earlier<00:00:13.759> riding<00:00:14.759> down<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.910> street<00:00:15.210> no<00:00:15.450> hands

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719

decided I'm going to leave the front

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
decided I'm going to leave the front
brake<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.140> for<00:01:48.380> now

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
brake on for now

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.499 
brake on for now
it<00:01:48.830> can<00:01:49.009> always<00:01:49.130> be<00:01:49.220> removed<00:01:49.850> or<00:01:50.030> shaved<00:01:50.240> later

I<00:02:05.210> use<00:02:05.360> multiply<00:02:05.869> tubing<00:02:06.350> for<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.800> front<00:02:07.100> half

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
I use multiply tubing for the front half

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.960 
I use multiply tubing for the front half
is<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:08.899> already<00:02:09.140> has<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.709> integrated<00:02:10.369> water

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
bottle cage Blas is there which I

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.259 
bottle cage Blas is there which I
decided<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.310> leave<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.640> tech<00:02:13.819> because<00:02:14.030> it's

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
decided to leave in tech because it's

actually<00:02:14.510> nice<00:02:14.840> having<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.230> water<00:02:15.410> bottle<00:02:15.650> when

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
actually nice having a water bottle when

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.460 
actually nice having a water bottle when
you're<00:02:16.069> out<00:02:16.220> riding<00:02:16.810> I've<00:02:17.810> got<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.019> nice<00:02:18.200> secure

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
you're out riding I've got a nice secure

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.479 
you're out riding I've got a nice secure
place<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.739> hold<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.190> then<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:21.310> guess<00:02:22.310> that

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
place to hold it then I guess that

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.630 
place to hold it then I guess that
pretty<00:02:22.700> much<00:02:22.819> sums<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.209> up<00:02:23.330> for<00:02:23.510> now
