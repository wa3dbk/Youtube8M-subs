00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
symbols marked for that so Dumbo is the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.709 
symbols marked for that so Dumbo is the

kind of squarish looking symbol with the

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.350 
kind of squarish looking symbol with the
opening<00:01:11.079> on<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.200> bottom<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.700> up<00:01:12.880> o<00:01:13.119> is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
opening on the bottom and then up o is

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.920 
opening on the bottom and then up o is
the<00:01:13.930> V<00:01:15.030> easy<00:01:16.030> way<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.299> remember<00:01:16.360> this<00:01:16.600> is

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
the V easy way to remember this is

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.899 
the V easy way to remember this is
whichever<00:01:17.409> way<00:01:17.619> it<00:01:17.740> opens<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:18.310> that's<00:01:18.640> the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
whichever way it opens in that's the

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.630 
whichever way it opens in that's the
reduction<00:01:19.240> in<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:19.509> so<00:01:19.719> it<00:01:19.899> down<00:01:20.430> opens<00:01:21.430> down

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
reduction in it so it down opens down

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.550 
reduction in it so it down opens down
and<00:01:22.350> upload<00:01:23.350> opens<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:24.130> top<00:01:25.469> anytime<00:01:26.469> you're

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
and upload opens the top anytime you're

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.170 
and upload opens the top anytime you're
moving<00:01:26.770> away<00:01:26.859> from<00:01:27.009> your<00:01:27.219> body<00:01:27.340> going<00:01:27.939> down

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
moving away from your body going down

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.859 
moving away from your body going down
this<00:01:28.329> way<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.829> be<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:29.979> down<00:01:30.219> bow<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:31.630> if<00:01:31.719> you're

this way to be a down bow when if you're

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.810 
this way to be a down bow when if you're
coming<00:01:32.049> towards<00:01:32.380> body<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:33.250> way<00:01:33.429> it's<00:01:33.670> up

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
coming towards body this way it's up

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.440 
coming towards body this way it's up
though<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.740> let's<00:01:36.640> look<00:01:36.700> at<00:01:36.880> rasen<00:01:37.270> wrap
