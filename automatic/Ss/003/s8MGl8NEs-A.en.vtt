00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.580 
haven't got any chain lube now this
isn't<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> end<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> world<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.590> chain

the<00:01:40.110> chain<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.650> did<00:01:40.890> before<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.490> I'll<00:01:41.579> show

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the chain as I did before so I'll show

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.330 
the chain as I did before so I'll show
you<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.880> say<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.479> very<00:01:42.720> quick<00:01:43.159> just<00:01:44.159> take

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you this say that very quick just take

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
hold of the tire get the oil up the tube

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.170 
hold of the tire get the oil up the tube
ever<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.170> simple<00:01:49.500> really

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
ever so simple really

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.429 
ever so simple really
brain<00:01:51.180> common-sense<00:01:51.659> any<00:01:52.470> fuel<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:53.880> it

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
brain common-sense any fuel can do it

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.200 
brain common-sense any fuel can do it
just<00:01:55.439> get<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.710> trizol<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.579> drizzling<00:01:57.060> out

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
just get it trizol in just drizzling out

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.749 
just get it trizol in just drizzling out
of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.390> end<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:59.460> run<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
of the end like that and then run the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.209 
of the end like that and then run the
chain<00:01:59.790> around<00:02:00.530> just<00:02:01.530> get<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> constant<00:02:02.100> little

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
chain around just get a constant little

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.490 
chain around just get a constant little
drizzle<00:02:02.670> there<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.030> are<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.509> little

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
drizzle there we are like that little

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.789 
drizzle there we are like that little
drizzle<00:02:04.860> cross<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.649> go

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
drizzle cross it on that and then go

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.169 
drizzle cross it on that and then go
around<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.069> chain<00:02:08.369> come<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> outer

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
around the chain come out to the outer

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.920 
around the chain come out to the outer
edge<00:02:09.390> tiny<00:02:10.289> little<00:02:10.530> drizzle<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.099> that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
edge tiny little drizzle like that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.210 
edge tiny little drizzle like that
just<00:02:12.930> drizzle<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.320> on<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.590> chain<00:02:13.830> look<00:02:14.040> bit

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
just drizzle it on the chain look bit

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.610 
just drizzle it on the chain look bit
more<00:02:16.460> there<00:02:17.460> you<00:02:17.580> go<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.900> that's<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.260> then<00:02:19.440> run

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
more there you go and that's it then run

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the chain round always on the inside not

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.850 
the chain round always on the inside not
much<00:02:23.550> point<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.970> doing<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.240> on<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.390> outside

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
much point of doing it on the outside

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.180 
much point of doing it on the outside
okay

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190

why<00:02:26.340> do<00:02:26.400> chain<00:02:26.670> ever<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.690> simple<00:02:28.220> it's<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.400> easy

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
why do chain ever so simple it's as easy

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.330 
why do chain ever so simple it's as easy
as<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.900> now<00:02:30.900> that's<00:02:31.110> all<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.680> insane<00:02:32.070> Ian
