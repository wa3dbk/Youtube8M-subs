milliamp power supply and the problem
with<00:00:19.920> these<00:00:20.160> things<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:21.029> they<00:00:21.689> take<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.050> lot

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
with these things is they take a lot

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.029 
with these things is they take a lot
more<00:00:22.710> power<00:00:23.039> than<00:00:23.510> what<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.859> I'll

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
more power than what you think and I'll

show you an example of the MK 809 power

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.180 
show you an example of the MK 809 power
problem<00:00:31.099> it<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.399> plugs<00:00:33.200> directly<00:00:34.200> into<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
problem it just plugs directly into the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
problem it just plugs directly into the
back<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.480> TV<00:00:39.739> into<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.980> HDMI<00:00:41.879> port<00:00:45.320> then

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
back of the TV into the HDMI port then

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.729 
back of the TV into the HDMI port then
I'll<00:00:46.500> plug<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> power<00:00:47.520> supply<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.530> then

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I'll plug in the power supply and then

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.060 
I'll plug in the power supply and then
we'll<00:00:49.920> turn<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.739> I'll<00:00:52.739> show<00:00:53.010> you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
now I did break the mini USB port on

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.460 
now I did break the mini USB port on
this<00:01:12.220> TV<00:01:12.580> stick<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:13.540> I<00:01:13.570> have<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.080> plug<00:01:14.350> it<00:01:14.560> in

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
this TV stick so I have to plug it in

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:25.999 
this TV stick so I have to plug it in
with<00:01:17.470> this<00:01:17.770> USB<00:01:19.110> replicator

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.660 

okay<00:01:27.009> got<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.660> plugged<00:01:29.140> in<00:01:29.670> now

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
okay got the got that plugged in now

00:01:30.670 --> 00:02:17.170 
okay got the got that plugged in now
I'll<00:01:30.910> turn<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.270> on

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.059 

now<00:02:17.780> since<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.379> has<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:19.840> lack<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:20.890> since<00:02:21.890> this

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
now since it has a lack of since this

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.670 
now since it has a lack of since this
two<00:02:22.430> thousand<00:02:22.970> milliamp<00:02:23.379> isn't<00:02:24.379> enough<00:02:24.650> power

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
two thousand milliamp isn't enough power

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
two thousand milliamp isn't enough power
these<00:02:27.680> apps<00:02:28.069> are<00:02:28.400> kind<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.730> slow<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.090> load

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.110 

now<00:02:52.210> watch<00:02:52.480> what<00:02:52.780> this<00:02:53.020> does<00:02:53.080> when<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.740> hit

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
now watch what this does when I hit

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.110 
now watch what this does when I hit
YouTube

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.110 

see<00:03:04.750> how<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.019> just<00:03:05.230> shuts<00:03:05.590> down<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.910> what<00:03:09.910> that

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
see how it just shuts down and what that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.690 
see how it just shuts down and what that
is<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.629> that's<00:03:10.810> because<00:03:11.319> it's<00:03:11.530> not<00:03:11.739> getting

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
is is that's because it's not getting

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.360 
is is that's because it's not getting
enough<00:03:12.940> power<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:16.170> what<00:03:17.170> I'll<00:03:17.500> do<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:18.069> solve

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
enough power so what I'll do to solve

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:28.350 
enough power so what I'll do to solve
that<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:26.319> will<00:03:26.560> reset<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.610> only<00:03:28.209> way

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
that is it will reset it the only way

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.070 
that is it will reset it the only way
you<00:03:29.170> can<00:03:29.230> reset<00:03:29.739> it<00:03:29.769> is<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.450> unplug<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:31.810> what

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
you can reset it is to unplug it so what

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.030 
you can reset it is to unplug it so what
I'll<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.530> when<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.459> did<00:03:33.730> was<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.060> cut<00:03:34.330> two<00:03:34.690> ends<00:03:35.170> of

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.850 

a<00:03:39.239> USB<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.900> then<00:03:41.049> I<00:03:41.110> soldered<00:03:42.010> them<00:03:42.160> together

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
a USB and then I soldered them together

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.190 
a USB and then I soldered them together
and<00:03:44.860> I<00:03:45.280> plugged<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.910> into<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.209> service<00:03:46.780> port

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
and I plugged it into the service port

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.270 
and I plugged it into the service port
of<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:48.190> TV<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.180> what<00:03:49.360> this<00:03:49.569> does<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:51.010> gives

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
of the TV so what this does is it gives

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.490 
of the TV so what this does is it gives
this<00:03:52.140> TV<00:03:53.140> stick<00:03:53.530> additional<00:03:54.310> power<00:03:54.579> now<00:03:55.500> plug

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
this TV stick additional power now plug

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:06.320 
this TV stick additional power now plug
that<00:03:56.739> into<00:03:57.040> this<00:03:57.690> USB<00:03:59.760> replicator

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:22.750 

I<00:04:06.360> guess<00:04:07.050> it's<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.350> USB<00:04:07.740> fab<00:04:20.030> turn<00:04:21.030> on<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.390> TV

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
I guess it's a USB fab turn on the TV

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.800 
I guess it's a USB fab turn on the TV
now<00:04:23.760> you'll<00:04:23.970> notice<00:04:26.000> now<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.060> have<00:04:28.280> power<00:04:29.810> sort

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
now you'll notice now I have power sort

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.090 
now you'll notice now I have power sort
to<00:04:31.140> different<00:04:31.620> power<00:04:31.830> sources<00:04:32.690> into<00:04:33.690> this

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
to different power sources into this

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.010 
to different power sources into this
Android<00:04:35.100> TV<00:04:35.640> stick<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.270> I'm<00:04:36.390> actually<00:04:36.630> using

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
Android TV stick and I'm actually using

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.870 
Android TV stick and I'm actually using
the<00:04:37.350> TV<00:04:38.330> itself<00:04:40.070> with<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.400> service<00:04:42.150> USB<00:04:43.880> when

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
the TV itself with the service USB when

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.740 
the TV itself with the service USB when
I<00:04:45.000> put<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.330> into<00:04:45.540> this<00:04:45.960> USB<00:04:46.560> hub<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.750> then

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
I put that into this USB hub and then

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.020 
I put that into this USB hub and then
the<00:04:49.110> regular<00:04:49.590> power<00:04:49.890> source<00:04:50.370> that<00:04:50.460> actually

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
the regular power source that actually

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.100 
the regular power source that actually
come<00:04:51.300> with<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.900> TV<00:04:52.650> stick<00:04:53.570> and<00:04:54.570> now<00:04:54.810> you'll
