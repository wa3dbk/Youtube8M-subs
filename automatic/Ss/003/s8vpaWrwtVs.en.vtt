 David David and David David Showroom Welcome to the show How everyone 

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:20.059
 Watch directly from we survived but he will survive if the page is Obama and 

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:24.099
 I love him when I wake up in the morning and the brucco suicide bomber 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.429
 Baseball pay track of each of these 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.739
 The number one yesterday was discussing the presidential debate that we number one 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.050
 You have a lot to say about it I did get a picture on Twitter before starting 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.140
 Discussion by James Trevor 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.060
 Who had his teacher's data package he was ready to discuss 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.370
 In David's package he has to say 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.530
 Do this kind of a bit like me 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.430
 After there seems to be some similarity but anyway there is Trevor 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.110
 Send in this picture 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.130
 Ready to go 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.420
 For discussion with uh ... his dating show t - shirt 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.760
 Here is my point on this general debate 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.440
 I follow 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.030
 This is on two fronts the question of the question I was going on who wanted to 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.040
 Method and view 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.790
 Which won the essence 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.580
 If we have all these even Matt Romney 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.990
 Do well in discussing yesterday's style 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.070
 The President said on the content of all the less explosive bomber lies the way he was much more in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.340
 In line with the reality of the situation now is that the problem does not really 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.290
 It matters if you only see text 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.560
 People were absorbed through the discussion reading a text on it 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.120
 Mitt Romney's answers were totally fuzzy, 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.700
 mysterious 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.680
 When President Obama was completely controlled by the debate 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.230
 As we know and as we have known since ... John F. Kennedy discussed f_ 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.940
 Uh ... on the way back when it 's unbelievable in this Uh 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.360
 TV Discussion 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.940
 Uh ... it's not just about what you might look like the IA version of MIT Romney 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.530
 It did not do as well as it now goes as expected today we see it right 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.820
 Wing said that Romney MIT was doing incredibly well 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.800
 I was expecting it would probably see a 1-2 point bump to MIT in Romney 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.649
 In some polls the question now is 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.500
 The number of voters is hesitant and there is really Ohio for example we were 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.550
 We're talking about 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.880
 Obama is already pulling more than fifty percent so even if Romney gets all 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.019
 Who are hesitant 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.289
 He really needs to get and already decided that people had to 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.219
 President Obama 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.439
 They switched their voices and nothing actually happened to Romney in my opinion 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.879
 Which gets someone to make that change 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.529
 No you're right here is the end of the most exciting moving road 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.179
 And the mother ... all of a completely different person from when he was giving him his 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.789
 Words no doubt about it, the other thing also let talk about before 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:37.299
 We go into details before the discussion died in this way was terrible 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.979
 Jim Lehrer was not a good broker on the number of different fronts you guys do 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.579
 agree 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.509
 hundred percent 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:45.949
 The number one form of discussion 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.579
 Basically allows, enhance bit point talking in a vacuum and not 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.959
 Really pointing out from President Obama despite the reasons for his arrival 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.999
 She does not seem to want to point out the inefficiency and confusion of the face 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.359
 romley on every single issue 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.849
 Try Jim Lehrer with Let's be honest to Jim Harer with the number one try to be remotely 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.529
 In controlling the debate 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.609
 But two number to get them to handle each other during the first question 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.889
 During this first question about jobs I would like to create jobs 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:12.870
 Said Jim Lerer 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.829
 Respond directly to what he thought he said was a bomb or seven 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.750
 It was not saramous and it did not happen in the eight thousand we went in 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.409
 Expect fireworks 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.799
 They barely talk to each other 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.109
 Obama and McCain in the same two thousand and 8000 here seems to be 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.239
 Strategy really seems to be the strategy now to be said 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.880
 The questions were not good 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.499
 Ladies and the public 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.789
 There were a lot of C layers questions what are the differences between the two 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:38.659
 You are 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.909
 It's an open-ended question let's get some specific questions here 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.400
 To make it more clear that no answer is given 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.949
 If you say what the differences are 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.739
 It's cold weezy to say dialogue points and talk about whatever you want 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.790
 I noticed I'm not gonna answer C 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.840
 But at least ask a more specific question and do this task 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.340
 He had no control over the discussion either at 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.249
 After he did not really to YaST even a specific question was said 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.569
 Let's talk about that topic now that you can start one of the differences 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.659
 Between the two of you in this very broad and bright topic only the other 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.959
 Something he was saying was responding to this 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.019
 It was not awful good and the other thing I was actually looking forward to 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.079
 The screen split that we got because I like to look at how weak it was 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.440
 Reaction when the other was talking to President Obama did not look 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.310
 The council was angry in many cases when Mitt Romney was talking 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.330
 May Romney 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.650
 When President Obama was chasing Bayach look sweet peppers on his face 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.369
 It seems to go to 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:40.839
 At any time you have to listen to someone else's pecan on your birthday 

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.949
 You did not like to go along 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.710
 I did not like to go along ... oh when I saw a clip of the discussions that took place in 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.100
 The same thing you've seen before in the splitting screen 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.390
 Using a needle before the bullet that Obama had on the hit seemed a lot less 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.490
 The board is much less uncomfortable 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.650
 Then looked at the screen splitting in the closeup though uh ... so do that 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.380
 Work for more than you might get you think this was actually the screen 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.660
 I heard from Bob 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.639
 Yes that paramilitary Ronnie said this was a very strange look at his work 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.009
 The face was like drooling and it was just like eating everything but it was 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:10.889
 Very strange 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.180
 As much as a nurse and then we will get to the contacts of the singers 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.069
 All the singers we expected to hear were not one thing that 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.190
 It will even close remotely from MIT telling Romney President Obama to listen 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.979
 You are entitled to get on your own private jet 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.240
 And your home but not your truth dropped flat type of non-working when 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.400
 Everything is required 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.370
 We are the sunrise 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.960
 Yes there is only one singer who has directed Jim to Harr and Ringo's promise 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.530
 I have five seconds before your turn and I do not think it was him 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.340
 Best moment yes
