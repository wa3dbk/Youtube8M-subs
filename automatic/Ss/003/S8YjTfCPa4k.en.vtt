extra level of protection and it did it

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
revering recommends that you put some

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.880 
revering recommends that you put some
tape<00:04:04.550> where<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.510> want<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:06.020> line<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.260> be<00:04:06.530> at

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
tape where you want the line to be at

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.100 
tape where you want the line to be at
the<00:04:07.070> end<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:07.790> toe<00:04:07.970> cap<00:04:10.810> opening<00:04:11.810> up<00:04:11.960> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
the end of the toe cap opening up the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.840 
the end of the toe cap opening up the
container<00:04:12.470> you'll<00:04:12.740> find<00:04:13.040> that<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.400> sealant

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
container you'll find that the sealant

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.170 
container you'll find that the sealant
is<00:04:14.060> very<00:04:14.450> viscous<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.350> very<00:04:15.740> dark<00:04:16.100> so<00:04:16.820> be<00:04:17.030> very

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
is very viscous and very dark so be very

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.610 
is very viscous and very dark so be very
careful<00:04:17.630> when<00:04:17.720> you're<00:04:17.840> opening<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:18.290> that<00:04:18.500> you

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
careful when you're opening it that you

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.540 
careful when you're opening it that you
don't<00:04:18.710> spill<00:04:19.070> accidentally<00:04:21.250> go<00:04:22.250> ahead<00:04:22.400> and

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
don't spill accidentally go ahead and

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.940 
don't spill accidentally go ahead and
stir<00:04:22.790> it<00:04:22.910> up<00:04:23.030> you'll<00:04:23.330> find<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.080> the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
stir it up you'll find that the the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.980 
stir it up you'll find that the the
rubber<00:04:25.190> bits<00:04:25.550> are<00:04:25.820> at<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.210> bottom<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:26.780> so

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
rubber bits are at the bottom and so

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.450 
rubber bits are at the bottom and so
it's<00:04:27.170> going<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.320> take<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.680> fair<00:04:28.130> amount<00:04:28.220> of

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
it's going to take a fair amount of

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.580 
it's going to take a fair amount of
stirring<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.060> get<00:04:29.210> them<00:04:29.390> mixed<00:04:29.630> in<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.470> the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
stirring to get them mixed in to the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.670 
stirring to get them mixed in to the
upper<00:04:30.740> mixture<00:04:34.990> you'll<00:04:35.990> start<00:04:36.260> seeing<00:04:36.470> them

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
upper mixture you'll start seeing them

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.150 
upper mixture you'll start seeing them
come<00:04:36.890> at<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.100> top<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:37.580> that<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:38.890> that<00:04:39.890> the

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
come at the top so that the that the

Redwing<00:04:49.260> recommends<00:04:49.920> that<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.100> first<00:04:50.430> coat

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
Redwing recommends that the first coat

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.330 
Redwing recommends that the first coat
you<00:04:50.760> put<00:04:51.090> on<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.510> very<00:04:52.050> thin<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:53.250> you

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
you put on is very thin and that you

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.150 
you put on is very thin and that you
apply<00:04:53.670> a<00:04:53.700> second<00:04:54.240> coat<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.110> simply<00:04:55.530> dip<00:04:55.950> the

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
apply a second coat so I simply dip the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.290 
apply a second coat so I simply dip the
dauber<00:04:56.690> into<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:58.140> container<00:04:58.500> enough<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:59.300> get

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
dauber into the container enough to get

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.740 
dauber into the container enough to get
a<00:05:00.500> even<00:05:01.500> coat<00:05:02.070> on<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.700> tip<00:05:02.940> of<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.210> dauber

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.120 

applying<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.930> polyurethane<00:05:07.230> to<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.890> end<00:05:08.010> of

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
applying the polyurethane to the end of

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.120 
applying the polyurethane to the end of
the<00:05:08.220> boot<00:05:08.400> you<00:05:08.580> get<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.810> smelly<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:11.030> kind<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.120> a

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
the boot you get a smelly and kind of a

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.480 
the boot you get a smelly and kind of a
mixed<00:05:14.130> texture<00:05:14.670> as<00:05:15.630> you<00:05:15.870> put<00:05:16.080> it<00:05:16.200> on<00:05:16.490> the

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
mixed texture as you put it on the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.180 
mixed texture as you put it on the
dauber<00:05:17.850> is<00:05:18.230> retaining<00:05:19.230> a<00:05:19.380> shape<00:05:19.590> fairly<00:05:20.010> well

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
dauber is retaining a shape fairly well

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.150 
dauber is retaining a shape fairly well
and<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.670> should<00:05:20.820> be<00:05:20.940> very<00:05:21.120> straightforward

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
and so it should be very straightforward

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.500 
and so it should be very straightforward
getting<00:05:23.160> this<00:05:23.280> coat<00:05:23.550> on<00:05:23.580> evenly<00:05:26.330> it<00:05:27.330> is

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
getting this coat on evenly it is

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.800 
getting this coat on evenly it is
possible<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.110> get<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:29.040> first<00:05:29.730> coating<00:05:30.150> fairly

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
possible to get the first coating fairly

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.160 
possible to get the first coating fairly
even<00:05:31.170> and<00:05:31.730> just<00:05:32.730> a<00:05:32.850> reminder<00:05:33.170> this

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
even and just a reminder this

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.460 
even and just a reminder this
polyurethane<00:05:34.800> does<00:05:35.760> smell<00:05:36.390> pretty<00:05:36.470> strongly

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
polyurethane does smell pretty strongly

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.620 
polyurethane does smell pretty strongly
so<00:05:37.680> I<00:05:37.710> would<00:05:38.100> recommend<00:05:38.520> doing<00:05:38.640> this<00:05:38.880> in<00:05:39.450> your

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
so I would recommend doing this in your

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.270 
so I would recommend doing this in your
garage<00:05:39.870> or<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:40.920> a<00:05:41.010> well-ventilated<00:05:41.250> room<00:05:41.850> I

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
garage or in a well-ventilated room I

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.000 
garage or in a well-ventilated room I
applied<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.490> two<00:05:44.640> armor<00:05:45.110> all<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.620> way<00:05:46.740> down

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
applied the two armor all the way down

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.950 
applied the two armor all the way down
the<00:05:47.430> leather<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:48.500> over<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:50.120> rubber<00:05:51.120> lowers

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
the leather and over the rubber lowers

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.710 
the leather and over the rubber lowers
just<00:05:52.530> so<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:52.890> there<00:05:53.460> aren't<00:05:53.850> any<00:05:54.150> exposed

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
just so that there aren't any exposed

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.830 
just so that there aren't any exposed
seams<00:05:55.880> once<00:05:56.880> you're<00:05:57.030> done<00:05:57.210> you<00:05:57.420> just<00:05:57.480> need<00:05:57.750> to

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
seams once you're done you just need to

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.990 
seams once you're done you just need to
make<00:05:57.960> sure<00:05:58.020> that<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:58.620> tour<00:05:58.920> armor<00:05:59.160> container

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
make sure that the tour armor container

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.300 
make sure that the tour armor container
is<00:06:00.240> closed<00:06:00.540> up<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:01.050> your<00:06:01.680> shoes<00:06:02.010> are<00:06:02.190> in<00:06:02.280> a

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
messiest part of this project for me was

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.320 
messiest part of this project for me was
definitely<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:08.100> cleanup<00:06:08.580> so<00:06:08.790> make<00:06:09.030> sure<00:06:09.060> you

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
definitely the cleanup so make sure you

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.480 
definitely the cleanup so make sure you
clean<00:06:09.570> up<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.840> dauber<00:06:10.080> as<00:06:10.380> well<00:06:10.980> as<00:06:11.100> your

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
then tape the soles so that that second

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.750
