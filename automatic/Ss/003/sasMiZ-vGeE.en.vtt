00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
in the crock-pot for like 12 hours we

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.319 
in the crock-pot for like 12 hours we
usually<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.369> overnight<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.060> kind<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
usually do it overnight and it kind of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.520 
usually do it overnight and it kind of
depends<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:51.840> crock-pot<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
depends on your crock-pot because I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.950 
depends on your crock-pot because I
notice<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.130> lot<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> newer<00:01:53.610> ones<00:01:53.939> cook<00:01:54.299> kind

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
notice a lot of the newer ones cook kind

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.780 
notice a lot of the newer ones cook kind
of<00:01:55.049> hotter<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> might<00:01:56.130> only<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.430> eight

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
of hotter so it might only be eight

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.749 
of hotter so it might only be eight
hours<00:01:57.290> but<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> could<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.950> longer<00:01:59.219> than<00:01:59.490> twelve

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
hours but it could be longer than twelve

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.490 
hours but it could be longer than twelve
if<00:01:59.939> you're<00:02:00.119> using<00:02:00.299> an<00:02:00.540> older<00:02:00.659> crock-pot<00:02:01.079> just

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
if you're using an older crock-pot just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.819 
if you're using an older crock-pot just
kind<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.740> kind<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.250> berries<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:04.380> always<00:02:04.680> use

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
kind of kind of berries we always use

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.410 
kind of kind of berries we always use
our<00:02:04.950> old<00:02:05.189> crock<00:02:05.549> pot<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.119> feel<00:02:06.299> like

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
our old crock pot because we feel like

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
if it like the longer it cooks the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.130 
if it like the longer it cooks the
better<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.179> is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
better it is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.540 
better it is
