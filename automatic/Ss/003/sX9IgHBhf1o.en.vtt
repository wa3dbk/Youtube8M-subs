00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
prevent this kind of behavior in the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.710 
prevent this kind of behavior in the
future<00:02:11.370> are<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:11.700> things<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.090> shouldn't<00:02:12.540> do

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
future are there things you shouldn't do

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.210 
future are there things you shouldn't do
I<00:02:12.750> mean<00:02:12.990> can<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.140> make<00:02:13.350> too<00:02:13.620> big<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.010> deal

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
I mean can you make too big of a deal

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.250 
I mean can you make too big of a deal
out<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.700> situation<00:02:14.910> well<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.600> think<00:02:15.900> they

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
out of a situation well I think they

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.559 
out of a situation well I think they
made<00:02:16.440> another<00:02:16.709> big<00:02:17.040> error<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.030> fact<00:02:18.270> that

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
made another big error in the fact that

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.980 
made another big error in the fact that
I<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:19.110> they<00:02:19.260> filed<00:02:19.620> some<00:02:19.860> kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.130> civil

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
I think they filed some kind of civil

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.190 
I think they filed some kind of civil
lawsuit<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.680> that's<00:02:23.220> you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
lawsuit so that's you

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.440 
lawsuit so that's you
that<00:02:25.680> could<00:02:25.830> come<00:02:25.950> back<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.340> bite<00:02:26.370> them<00:02:26.730> later

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
that could come back to bite them later

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.740 
that could come back to bite them later
I<00:02:28.200> don't<00:02:28.620> think<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> civil<00:02:29.460> lawsuit<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:30.090> in

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
I don't think that a civil lawsuit is in

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.060 
I don't think that a civil lawsuit is in
