00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 there were some gorillas lifting 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.440
 Academy 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.509
 look what a strange thing to follow more 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:17.070
 three gorillas came and started to run 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:18.660
 now 17 gorillas are in the gym 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.160
 therefore at this very moment after the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.250
 three other colleagues 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.590
 we have 17 gorillas about gorillas 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.590
 were lifting weight or 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.570
 originally had to set them in 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.650
 of the academy, how will I be around here? 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.690
 interest increasing weight in the gym 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.469
 So it's going to be with this thing I'm going to give. 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.149
 answer 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.440
 sure as much as curious was 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.660
 lifting when they were in the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.320
 academy before those three entered 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.539
 he gives us that figure kioman count 1 2 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.670
 so this here represents the 17 Uyghurs 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.739
 who are currently in the gym 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.320
 then will're here O blue look around 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.780
 these are the 17 Uighurs who were 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 originally at the gym 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 now three gorillas came in and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 started running so let's say that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.650
 these last three here are the gorillas 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.210
 who entered and started to run right 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.310
 three gorillas 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.900
 if I know that you now have 17 minutes in the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.360
 how many they had there 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.590
 originally lifting weight now what 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:33.869
 Nothing left so I came back here 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:36.810
 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 then how many 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.530
 pounds was lifting weight 14 is or 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.850
 it is not 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.490
 What was the account you had to do to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 arrive in these 14 ac time I noticed the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.790
 I do not know how curious there was 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.369
 in the beginning then I'll put a 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.549
 question but I know three gorillas 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.970
 came together and not even more questioning 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.680
 three but if it is equal to 17 because then 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.399
 of these three gorillas have entered the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.159
 Academy 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.680
 We got 17 gorillas and that's where we are. 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.350
 number three plus of equality 17 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.080
 to do this I can very well do 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:13.349
 17 -3 lord were not 17 - 3 will give me 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.800
 equal to that question and then as 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.120
 Valley 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.410
 already 17 -3 of course gives equal to 14 that 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.660
 was the answer I found here 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.040
 analyzing figure beauty 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.680
 Let's do one more exercise, I found 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.700
 cool do one more here here 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.970
 exercise 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.010
 Let's read I bought a bag with 13 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.810
 mini chocolate cookies 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.910
 my sister ate some and I was with 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.290
 eight of these cookies ie had a 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.180
 bag with 13 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.730
 My sister ate some and I stayed 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.810
 with eight and now how much the cookies to 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.500
 my sister with mine 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.140
 now if I had 13 cookies initially 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.700
 and my sister ate then she has to do 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.220
 an edit subtraction account 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.590
 of course the subtraction she then ate 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.380
 I lost some cookies soon I'll have 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.480
 13 - Something I do not know when she 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.890
 ate this has to be equal to how much 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.960
 must be equal to 8 was what me 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.090
 then eight left here will be my 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.010
 final situation that with eight courses 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.360
 Now, how much does it have to cost here? 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.850
 question 13 - how much equals 18 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.230
 13-5 hours because I can write 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.950
 also this equation here of the following 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.110
 way I can make 13 - eight grandchildren 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.830
 place where place 8 with the interrogation 13 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.830
 - 8 which will be equal to that 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.050
 question how much will be so 13 - 8 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.400
 It is also clear but it has reached 5 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.070
 but realize that I can still write 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.760
 this equation here in another way 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.370
 that is if I get those 8 that I 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.420
 left over and my sister 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.800
 with mine 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.320
 Let's add to those my sister 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.000
 like me this will equal the total of 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.870
 cookies that had a bag or 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.120
 13 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.360
 is or is not and then as for interrogation 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.070
 also 58 plus five equals 13 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.450
 soon I already know my answer that 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.220
 it will be 5 how many cushman did you eat 5 and 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.709
 now another question here which 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.610
 alternatives can help you solve 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.190
 the problem 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.170
 select all that apply is 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.690
 which of these equations here or 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.620
 Which ones will be related to this? 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.830
 that I wrote 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.590
 look, it will only be 13 plus five to eighteen 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.900
 solves no 18 has nothing to do 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.639
 have to add five if she ate the 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.800
 Wants me to lose 5 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.870
 not that it was added she can not eat it and 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.289
 get more involved with xande is or not 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.909
 is 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.159
 So it can not be from here, here it is. 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:39.360
 I'm going to ignore it is not right 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:42.749
 now that 13 -5 equals 8 13 -5 or 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.180
 whether she was 13 she ate 5 13 -5 I 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:48.389
 I was eight that applies here 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.599
 therefore this one is correct and the 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.159
 last 8 plus five equals 13 also 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.370
 is it right that the repair here and here 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.379
 situation here is exactly this from here right? 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.150
 I can change my question 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:04.949
 by 5 and this one here exactly this one 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.139
 that is, I exchange an interrogation here 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.719
 also by 5 I will stay with 8 but without 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.370
 that at 300 ac the same applies the eight 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.430
 that I have left 15 more her first 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.490
 years autocut here in 13 and this one from here 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.729
 is equal to the one that would be 13 -5 not 13 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.509
 five more as I explained beauty to 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.509
 the next video
