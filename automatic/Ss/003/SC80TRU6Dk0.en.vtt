here<00:00:04.580> is<00:00:04.700> a<00:00:04.730> neat<00:00:05.029> idea<00:00:05.060> I<00:00:05.420> saw<00:00:05.720> on<00:00:05.840> YouTube<00:00:06.230> a

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
here is a neat idea I saw on YouTube a

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.350 
here is a neat idea I saw on YouTube a
couple<00:00:06.380> weeks<00:00:06.770> ago<00:00:07.040> but<00:00:07.759> we're<00:00:07.970> kind<00:00:08.270> of

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
couple weeks ago but we're kind of

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.789 
couple weeks ago but we're kind of
improving<00:00:08.960> it<00:00:09.230> with<00:00:09.410> all<00:00:09.590> we've<00:00:09.770> learned

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:09.799 
improving it with all we've learned

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.039 
improving it with all we've learned
about<00:00:10.070> solar<00:00:10.490> kilns<00:00:10.969> so<00:00:11.539> this<00:00:11.719> is<00:00:11.900> how<00:00:12.020> to

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
about solar kilns so this is how to

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.010 
about solar kilns so this is how to
build<00:00:12.410> a<00:00:12.559> simple<00:00:12.830> solar<00:00:13.250> cycle<00:00:13.760> kiln<00:00:14.030> it's

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
build a simple solar cycle kiln it's

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.870 
build a simple solar cycle kiln it's
going<00:00:15.260> to<00:00:15.320> be<00:00:15.500> totally<00:00:16.190> energy

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
going to be totally energy

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.390 
going to be totally energy
self-sufficient<00:00:17.690> no<00:00:17.990> power<00:00:18.260> can<00:00:18.980> be<00:00:19.070> placed

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
self-sufficient no power can be placed

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.499 
self-sufficient no power can be placed
anywhere<00:00:20.320> portable<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:22.179> it's<00:00:23.179> going<00:00:23.269> to<00:00:23.359> work

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
anywhere portable and it's going to work

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.210 
anywhere portable and it's going to work
because<00:00:23.900> of<00:00:23.929> the<00:00:24.199> principles<00:00:24.679> we<00:00:24.830> use<00:00:24.949> on<00:00:25.130> our

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
because of the principles we use on our

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.609 
because of the principles we use on our
bigger<00:00:25.429> solar<00:00:25.730> kiln<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:26.419> we're<00:00:27.109> using<00:00:27.259> an<00:00:27.499> old

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
bigger solar kiln so we're using an old

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.569 
bigger solar kiln so we're using an old
concrete<00:00:28.220> base<00:00:28.519> that<00:00:28.820> was<00:00:28.939> a<00:00:28.970> silo<00:00:29.509> foundation

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
concrete base that was a silo foundation

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.520 
concrete base that was a silo foundation
got<00:00:31.579> a<00:00:31.609> roll<00:00:31.849> of<00:00:32.060> plastic<00:00:32.329> greenhouse<00:00:33.170> film

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
got a roll of plastic greenhouse film

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.950 
got a roll of plastic greenhouse film
six<00:00:33.980> mil<00:00:35.020> uv-protected<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.879> 14<00:00:37.879> by<00:00:38.090> 25<00:00:38.600> sheets

six mil uv-protected a 14 by 25 sheets

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.920 
six mil uv-protected a 14 by 25 sheets
cost<00:00:39.530> about<00:00:39.770> 55<00:00:40.340> dollars<00:00:40.789> so<00:00:41.719> we're<00:00:41.899> just

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
cost about 55 dollars so we're just

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.680 
cost about 55 dollars so we're just
going<00:00:42.170> to<00:00:42.230> cut<00:00:42.410> off<00:00:42.440> what<00:00:42.739> we<00:00:42.829> need<00:00:43.390> this<00:00:44.390> we

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
going to cut off what we need this we

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.459 
going to cut off what we need this we
should<00:00:44.870> be<00:00:44.989> able<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:45.230> use<00:00:45.500> four<00:00:45.920> or<00:00:45.980> five<00:00:46.160> times

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
should be able to use four or five times

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.229 
should be able to use four or five times
we<00:00:48.469> lay<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.649> across<00:00:48.920> our<00:00:49.309> foundation<00:00:49.940> so

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
we lay that across our foundation so

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.660 
we lay that across our foundation so
it's<00:00:50.989> sealed<00:00:51.320> from<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.649> ground<00:00:51.980> moisture<00:00:52.190> and

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
it's sealed from the ground moisture and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.270 
it's sealed from the ground moisture and
if<00:00:53.210> if<00:00:53.510> there's<00:00:53.859> vegetation<00:00:54.859> underneath<00:00:55.190> to

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
if if there's vegetation underneath to

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.459 
if if there's vegetation underneath to
keep<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.609> weeds<00:00:55.820> from<00:00:56.000> growing<00:00:56.090> up<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:56.719> we

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
keep the weeds from growing up in it we

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.110 
keep the weeds from growing up in it we
start<00:00:57.739> with<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.010> raw<00:00:58.129> stickers<00:00:58.550> on<00:00:58.730> top<00:00:58.940> the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
start with the raw stickers on top the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.079 
start with the raw stickers on top the
plastic<00:00:59.600> on<00:00:59.750> top<00:00:59.780> our<00:01:00.320> foundation<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:01.940> we're

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
plastic on top our foundation and we're

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.970 
plastic on top our foundation and we're
putting<00:01:02.480> our<00:01:02.660> nylon<00:01:02.839> straps<00:01:03.320> underneath<00:01:03.739> it

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
putting our nylon straps underneath it

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.740 
putting our nylon straps underneath it
now<00:01:04.010> well<00:01:04.400> it's<00:01:04.580> easy<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.089> get<00:01:05.330> them<00:01:05.449> in<00:01:05.570> there

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
now well it's easy to get them in there

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.880 
now well it's easy to get them in there
now<00:01:06.710> we<00:01:06.770> just<00:01:07.100> start<00:01:07.310> putting<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.150> lumber<00:01:08.390> on

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
now we just start putting the lumber on

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.380 
now we just start putting the lumber on
we<00:01:09.890> had<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.070> great<00:01:10.280> big<00:01:10.310> silver<00:01:10.760> maple<00:01:11.180> tree

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
we had a great big silver maple tree

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.250 
we had a great big silver maple tree
blow<00:01:11.870> down<00:01:12.110> our<00:01:12.320> yard<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:14.330> I<00:01:14.360> saw<00:01:14.630> Milt<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.050> and

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
blow down our yard so I saw Milt it and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.950 
blow down our yard so I saw Milt it and
there's<00:01:16.100> actually<00:01:16.400> one<00:01:16.580> white<00:01:16.880> pine<00:01:17.180> log<00:01:17.450> also

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
there's actually one white pine log also

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.540 
there's actually one white pine log also
that<00:01:18.260> blew<00:01:18.590> down<00:01:18.910> about<00:01:19.910> 350<00:01:20.900> board<00:01:21.140> feet<00:01:21.550> it's

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
that blew down about 350 board feet it's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.350 
that blew down about 350 board feet it's
nine<00:01:22.850> feet<00:01:23.090> long<00:01:23.320> four<00:01:24.320> feet<00:01:24.560> wide

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
nine feet long four feet wide

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.930 
nine feet long four feet wide
when<00:01:26.360> we<00:01:26.570> make<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.110> layers<00:01:28.010> we<00:01:28.340> leave<00:01:28.580> spaces

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
when we make the layers we leave spaces

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.460 
when we make the layers we leave spaces
between<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.600> boards<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:30.170> can<00:01:30.320> get

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
between the boards so you can get

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.010 
between the boards so you can get
vertical<00:01:30.860> airflow<00:01:31.460> in<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.670> pack<00:01:31.940> just<00:01:32.810> keep

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
vertical airflow in the pack just keep

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.660 
vertical airflow in the pack just keep
building<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:33.410> up

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
building it up

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
building it up
the<00:01:35.670> stranger<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.299> keep<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.780> rows<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the stranger you can keep your rows of

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.350 
the stranger you can keep your rows of
stickers<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> better<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.939> easy

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
stickers the better but this is easy

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.670 
stickers the better but this is easy
because<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.900> walk<00:01:40.080> right<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
because you can walk right around the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.490 
because you can walk right around the
pile<00:01:41.000> now<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.060> put<00:01:42.390> two<00:01:42.540> by<00:01:42.690> fours<00:01:42.960> across<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
pile now we put two by fours across the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.370 
pile now we put two by fours across the
top<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.979> add<00:01:44.100> four<00:01:44.430> straps<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:45.509> four<00:01:46.020> tons

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
top and add four straps about four tons

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.800 
top and add four straps about four tons
pressure<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.820> hold<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.119> wood<00:01:48.330> flat<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.780> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
pressure to hold this wood flat as it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.870 
pressure to hold this wood flat as it
dries<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.950> really<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.790> be

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
dries that really is going to be

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.940 
dries that really is going to be
important<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.200> now<00:01:52.350> we're<00:01:52.440> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> wrap<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
important so now we're going to wrap the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
important so now we're going to wrap the
plastic<00:01:53.100> around<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.720> we're<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
plastic around this but we're going to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.990 
plastic around this but we're going to
leave<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.320> sides<00:01:55.560> open<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.490> air<00:01:56.729> dry

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
leave the sides open so it can air dry

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.899 
leave the sides open so it can air dry
so<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.320> wrap<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.070> plastic<00:01:59.220> around<00:01:59.700> the
