the great thing about the skate support

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.410 
the great thing about the skate support
is<00:01:28.049> because<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:29.189> feel<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.850> problem<00:01:30.270> is

is because you feel like your problem is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.719 
is because you feel like your problem is
this<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.990> you're<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.650> trying<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> fix<00:01:32.520> that

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.490 
this and you're just trying to fix that
and<00:01:32.790> handle<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> never<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.439> never

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and handle it and it never it never

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.620 
and handle it and it never it never
helps<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> skateboard

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
helps and then I get on the skateboard

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.350

and<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.020> tell<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.619> fix<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:39.150> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
and I tell you to fix this and then you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.749 
and I tell you to fix this and then you
do<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.930> helps<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.920> why<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> videos

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
do and that helps that's why the videos

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.670 
do and that helps that's why the videos
are<00:01:41.790> such<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> good<00:01:42.479> way<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.200> it's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
are such a good way to do it it's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.319 
are such a good way to do it it's
because<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.369> much<00:01:44.670> easier<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.210> me<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
because it's so much easier for me to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.569 
because it's so much easier for me to
actually<00:01:45.570> look<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.259> tell<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.950> sometimes
