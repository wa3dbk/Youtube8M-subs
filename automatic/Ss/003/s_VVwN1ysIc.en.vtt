00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.140
 I come with some compaÃ±eras to these 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.210
 Winters workshops is an experience 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.490
 new because it was not known about 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.829
 robotics in this case I proposed this 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.650
 robotics and art workshop that involves 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.750
 both the two areas in a way 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.570
 explore creativity with elements 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.160
 that are very technological then here 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.809
 everything is gathered and there are the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.550
 tools and we want to take advantage of them 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.020
 in the best way it is good that there 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.539
 this type of dissemination so that 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.460
 people can know what art is not 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.929
 only the painting the drawing the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.519
 structure of the photograph but that 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.440
 They are also implementing the 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.420
 new technologies to be able 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.239
 develop other types of facilities 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.879
 interactive and also include the 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.450
 spectator so that finally he is the 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.830
 who builds the work 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.410
 the school advertising of the unit is 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.780
 different because the other allows so 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.910
 less one day have the experience that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.140
 can be done in these workshops and what 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.030
 best of all that have the contact 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.560
 direct with some publicist in this 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 case it was my turn to be a publicist 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.300
 of cocacola and they have a bath of what 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.300
 which is the mark that to be a great 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.400
 I really liked the brand because the truth is 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.620
 I was very clear about what the field was like 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.960
 in which they specialized and today with this 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.110
 I could tell that wide and everything 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.430
 what you can apply in the race 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.350
 well the objective of this workshop from 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.480
 a principle since the creation of 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.790
 ultrasound dance career 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.680
 is to show people outside what 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.630
 that our school is doing and 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.340
 also give them opportunities to come and 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.450
 take all classes that they estimate 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.910
 convenient the goal of the two 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.430
 workshops on both improvisation and 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.550
 theater games as the workshop 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.200
 dramaturgy in space claim to be 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.910
 an alternative for students of 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.650
 middle school who are interested in 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.570
 the performing arts we them 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.590
 we deliver the alternative with teachers 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.780
 from our theater school 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.060
 scenic communication that have a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.920
 closer approach to scenic art but 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.200
 in a practical way 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.380
 the goal of radio workshops 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.980
 teach students how to handle and 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.050
 how it occurs inside a radio 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.420
 professional facilities are made 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.420
 that wonders to study and sleep
