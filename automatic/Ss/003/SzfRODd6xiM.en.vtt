as<00:00:00.089> I<00:00:00.240> say<00:00:00.450> increase<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:00.930> story<00:00:01.199> from

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
as I say increase the story from

as I say increase the story from

words<00:00:38.329> when<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:40.079> about<00:00:40.200> things<00:00:40.620> our

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
words when we think about things our

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.280 
words when we think about things our
four<00:00:41.489> processes<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.239> experiences<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
four processes and experiences and the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.020 
four processes and experiences and the
way<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.530> interpret<00:00:43.829> them<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.280> influenced<00:00:44.969> by

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
way we interpret them are influenced by

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.910 
way we interpret them are influenced by
the<00:00:45.180> experiences<00:00:45.809> we've<00:00:45.960> already<00:00:46.200> had<00:00:46.710> our

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the experiences we've already had our

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.950 
the experiences we've already had our
brains<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.489> patterned<00:00:47.820> by<00:00:48.030> our<00:00:48.210> experiences

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
brains are patterned by our experiences

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
brains are patterned by our experiences
and<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.500> makes<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.860> think<00:00:50.100> inside<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.940> box

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and that makes you think inside the box

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.990 
and that makes you think inside the box
so<00:00:51.809> thinking<00:00:52.230> outside<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.010> box<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.550> much<00:00:53.820> more

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
so thinking outside the box is much more

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.090 
so thinking outside the box is much more
difficult<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:55.079> there<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.230> examples<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.949> when

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
difficult but there are examples of when

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.250 
difficult but there are examples of when
this<00:00:56.219> happens<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.789> certain<00:00:57.510> settings<00:00:57.719> people

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260

make them open to new ideas is they use

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.979 
make them open to new ideas is they use

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
much better at solving this new kind of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.820 
much better at solving this new kind of
task<00:02:18.629> in<00:02:18.840> fact<00:02:18.989> there<00:02:19.080> was<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> fifty<00:02:19.560> percent

with<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> control<00:02:22.080> subjects<00:02:22.739> who<00:02:23.190> didn't

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
with the control subjects who didn't

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.770 
with the control subjects who didn't
have<00:02:23.580> any<00:02:23.700> electrical<00:02:24.090> stimulation<00:02:24.510> or

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
have any electrical stimulation or

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.380 
have any electrical stimulation or
people<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.500> whom<00:02:25.709> they<00:02:26.160> activated<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.269> other

people in whom they activated the other

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.270 
people in whom they activated the other
side<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.870> brain<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.769> suggests<00:02:28.980> that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
side of the brain so this suggests that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.710 
side of the brain so this suggests that
you've<00:02:29.459> got<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.700> region<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.269> temporal

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
you've got this region of the temporal

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.089 
you've got this region of the temporal
lobe<00:02:30.900> which<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.260> forcing<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.920> view<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
lobe which is forcing you to view the

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.770 
lobe which is forcing you to view the
world<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.430> quite<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> strict<00:02:33.030> way<00:02:33.239> based<00:02:33.569> on

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
world in quite a strict way based on

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.780 
world in quite a strict way based on
previous<00:02:34.019> experience<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.250> switch<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.640> off

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
previous experience if you switch it off

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.030 
previous experience if you switch it off
it<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.420> make<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.750> think<00:02:36.989> outside<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.709> box

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
it can make you think outside the box

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.729 
it can make you think outside the box
and<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.730> perhaps<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.930> need<00:02:40.049> to<00:02:40.110> done<00:02:40.709> this

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
and so perhaps you need to done this

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.650 
and so perhaps you need to done this
sort<00:02:41.099> of<00:02:41.250> electrical<00:02:41.580> stimulation<00:02:42.060> apparatus

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
sort of electrical stimulation apparatus

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
sort of electrical stimulation apparatus
when<00:02:42.840> you're<00:02:42.959> trying<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.230> grapple<00:02:43.440> with<00:02:43.590> a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
when you're trying to grapple with a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.589 
when you're trying to grapple with a
complicated<00:02:44.220> problem<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.670> asked<00:02:45.299> Alan<00:02:45.510> Snyder

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
complicated problem I asked Alan Snyder

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.270 
complicated problem I asked Alan Snyder
what<00:02:45.959> are<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.140> going<00:02:46.349> to<00:02:46.500> work<00:02:46.739> on<00:02:46.950> next<00:02:47.099> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
what are you going to work on next and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.289 
what are you going to work on next and
he<00:02:47.400> said<00:02:47.549> well<00:02:47.700> we're<00:02:47.819> sort<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.000> thinking

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
he said well we're sort of thinking

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.580 
he said well we're sort of thinking
about<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.870> said<00:02:49.110> well<00:02:49.170> why<00:02:49.290> don't<00:02:49.470> you

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
about that so I said well why don't you

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.140 
about that so I said well why don't you
apply<00:02:49.799> some<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.280> your<00:02:50.459> own<00:02:50.580> stimulus<00:02:51.030> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
apply some of your own stimulus and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.130 
apply some of your own stimulus and
maybe<00:02:51.299> we'll<00:02:51.390> give<00:02:51.510> some<00:02:51.660> ideas<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.049> he

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
maybe we'll give some ideas and he

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.660 
maybe we'll give some ideas and he
laughed<00:02:52.319> put<00:02:52.560> on<00:02:52.680> your<00:02:52.769> thinking<00:02:52.920> cap<00:02:53.250> imagine
