just<00:03:46.689> to<00:03:46.900> give<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.349> little<00:03:47.560> bit<00:03:47.920> more<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.930> a

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
just to give it a little bit more of a

00:03:50.079 --> 00:04:07.369 
just to give it a little bit more of a
decorative<00:03:50.500> feel

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.080 

just<00:04:08.379> pushing<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:09.099> middle<00:04:09.430> down<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.879> little
