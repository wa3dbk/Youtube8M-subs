00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.580
 community amap 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.039
 and good morning to all these niggers of case 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.630
 and we are today with you 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 know what some people know what he 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.840
 this is some maybe not because 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.040
 that it really would not be 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.780
 talked about it going for a while i did not do any 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.309
 video from elsewhere but finally we do not 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.480
 did not talk about that so it's the map 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.550
 community as you can see 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.699
 just behind me so is well advanced 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.500
 1 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.600
 then the community map to summarize 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.699
 a little bit for those who are unaware 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 it's a map that I circulate 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.850
 subscribers in subscribers simply and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.230
 everyone can do his little construction 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.430
 on it so there you can see the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.649
 builds a little bit of everybody 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 landas the sky building of the 38 by 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.760
 example after I admit that I remember 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.980
 more pseudo I'm sorry there are some 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.489
 so much gold too had to be 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.640
 who had made his little house too 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.110
 here here here was the 2 days of foo 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.369
 sanoussi or so we had small 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.930
 houses everywhere the bollard had 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.610
 so a huge thing that I have to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.920
 goes back anyway what they did 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 it's a crazy thing 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.369
 that's them regulates kober six years 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.570
 wars their chains so you do not 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.119
 do not know they are my fear they do 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.789
 a lot of maps is pretty good and they 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.810
 have done a huge trick 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.700
 like Moses I think it's Moses 1 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.060
 who spreads the sea â€‹â€‹I pass on not play 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 very stalled level level mythology but 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
 in short, here they have done a huge thing 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.170
 in any case it's okay when you see that this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.960
 who arrives on the map 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.530
 it's absolutely amazing and so 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.090
 this is to tell you 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.880
 that today I want the channel to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.710
 raise also go I also raise there 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.500
 the community amap it allows we have the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.820
 famous fantasy counters kraft a box 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.770
 go see his chain also a lot of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.689
 redstone tutorials 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.710
 it's pretty good so that's what 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.299
 what I said I said I 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 stimulus is also the community map 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.950
 simply because it allows for 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.590
 to tie up maybe also a little low the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.450
 community around the same project a 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.000
 single and same project so I think that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.290
 it's rather beneficial for everything 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 the world for the chain is also 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.459
 also but for us they 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.959
 see that we have a common project at 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.180
 realize then it allows to have a small 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.220
 fun thing that I will spend regularly 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.630
 on the chain and so we have it so I 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.200
 let it circulate so when I 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.700
 circulate 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.210
 you will have explanations below 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.550
 anyway in the 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.020
 in the description but to make it 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.100
 to actually move I pass it to a subscriber 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.210
 which you tell me in the comments 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.800
 I go there I want the map 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.330
 I do not want to keep the tap 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.530
 here are those who want it anyway I 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.600
 their amap gateway for two days 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.800
 so it will take turns to play there 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.420
 has one that he will have then it will be a 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.920
 another another and so for two 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.270
 days and if he's sending it back to me after just 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.420
 after with its construction done on it 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.830
 his new backup and me there I the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.970
 circulate little by little and 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.230
 regularly I am a little 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.190
 video to take a look at 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.410
 new constructions 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.520
 so here we admit we have just a small 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.800
 village but this little village has to 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.540
 it becomes a huge city where I know 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.830
 maybe not with dungeons with this 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.180
 that you want you have two days 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.450
 to realize your construction on the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.190
 map 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.990
 so try not to take 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.830
 half of the map because because 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.540
 everyone needs to be 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.980
 its place on you see see a little 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.620
 the size of the buildings that's it 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.600
 remains that remains in the reasonable that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.540
 it remains even if the map and grandin sea 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.340
 but hey everyone can have 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.010
 have his little building to him and 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.870
 so here is this little panel too 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.070
 I showed you do not forget when I 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.320
 you will pass the map to put your 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.420
 little sign right there as a result like 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.020
 that we will have the name of all those who have 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.790
 participated 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.020
 I participated but I have no 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.490
 home I did not make a house 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.260
 because I'm not echoing at all 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.350
 so rebuild a house I think 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.750
 that I would put about 18 15 18 years old 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.980
 it will be 18 years to 18 months at least for 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.020
 to make a house and so it's true that 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.870
 I did not do it but I realized 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.630
 beautiful this magnificent this 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.220
 beautiful fresco third call fair 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.040
 the address of the string so 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.300
 so here she listened it was just 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.830
 a little video to tell you that the 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.170
 Community map resumes so if you 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.620
 do not hesitate to say it in the 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.420
 comments 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.560
 you have explanations in the 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.700
 description to see how all that 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.960
 works but it's pretty simple I 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.130
 sends you the backup you kept it 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.690
 for a maximum of two days 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.520
 otherwise I will not take into account 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.900
 other constructions because it takes 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.600
 they circulate is the goal of the m 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.590
 the Community amap and after two 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.390
 days when you finish you got it to me 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.800
 returned and so on it flows 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.989
 subscribers in subscribers regularly 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.519
 will make a little point of listening to me 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.739
 I'll leave you there 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.360
 make up for the community map of 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.360
 discovery minecraft hi everyone 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.940

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.620
 not to share it 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.120
 you can also put a small thumb 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.650
 green because it's always a pleasure 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.419
 and then why not be crazy 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.460
 maybe if you subscribe to the channel 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.659

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.039
