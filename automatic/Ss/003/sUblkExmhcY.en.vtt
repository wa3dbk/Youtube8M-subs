00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.950 

they'll<00:01:02.949> cut<00:01:03.160> this<00:01:03.309> rectangle<00:01:03.489> out

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.080 

and<00:01:09.960> fold<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.070> over<00:01:11.190> so<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> bad<00:01:11.760> side<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and fold it over so the bad side is

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.240 
and fold it over so the bad side is
facing<00:01:12.360> out

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.100 

at<00:01:18.250> each<00:01:18.430> end<00:01:18.700> cut<00:01:18.939> around<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.360> triangle<00:01:19.869> shaped

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
at each end cut around a triangle shaped

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.340 
at each end cut around a triangle shaped
like<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.640> make<00:01:22.329> sure<00:01:22.630> to<00:01:22.750> make<00:01:22.899> each<00:01:23.049> side

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
like so and make sure to make each side

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:50.380 
like so and make sure to make each side
even

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.760 

now<00:01:51.390> take<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.900> wire<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.140> measure<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.650> so

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
now take out your wire and measure it so

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.230 
now take out your wire and measure it so
that<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.040> longer<00:01:53.280> than<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.670> length<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.060> your

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that it's longer than the length of your

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.420 
that it's longer than the length of your
fabric<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:55.110> need<00:01:55.260> it<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.650> longer<00:01:55.890> since<00:01:56.250> we

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
fabric we need it to be longer since we

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.190 
fabric we need it to be longer since we
need<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.730> make<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.090> circle<00:01:57.510> at<00:01:57.660> each<00:01:57.870> end<00:01:58.140> of

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
need to make the circle at each end of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.960 
need to make the circle at each end of
the<00:01:58.320> wire<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.530> hold<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> round<00:01:59.250> pointy<00:01:59.700> shapes

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
the wire to hold the round pointy shapes

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.360 
the wire to hold the round pointy shapes
in<00:02:00.150> place<00:02:00.330> so<00:02:01.170> at<00:02:01.350> each<00:02:01.530> end<00:02:01.770> molt<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.190> wire

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
in place so at each end molt the wire

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.130 
in place so at each end molt the wire
into<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.790> loop<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> point<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:03.720> match<00:02:03.900> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
into a loop with a point to match the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.410 
into a loop with a point to match the
shape<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.590> fabric<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.160> twist<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:05.880> end<00:02:06.090> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
shape of the fabric and twist the end so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.920 
shape of the fabric and twist the end so
that<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.960> secure

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
that it is secure

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.060 
that it is secure
make<00:02:09.930> sure<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.170> mold<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> end<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> wire

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
make sure you mold the end of the wire

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.010 
make sure you mold the end of the wire
really<00:02:11.460> close<00:02:11.820> so<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.150> won't<00:02:12.360> be<00:02:12.480> poking<00:02:12.870> holes

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
really close so it won't be poking holes

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.850 
really close so it won't be poking holes
into<00:02:13.260> your<00:02:13.470> fabric<00:02:15.320> now<00:02:16.320> do<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.650> same<00:02:16.680> with

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
into your fabric now do the same with

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:30.130 
into your fabric now do the same with
the<00:02:17.040> other<00:02:17.220> side

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.680 

and<00:02:30.280> now<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.550> that's<00:02:31.670> done<00:02:31.880> set<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.480> wire

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
and now that that's done set the wire

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.050 
and now that that's done set the wire
side<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.440> break<00:02:33.830> out<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.130> sewing<00:02:34.340> machine<00:02:34.670> so

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
