they<00:00:39.270> set<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.719> made<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:41.070> white<00:00:41.510> using

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
they set this made up for white using

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.250 
they set this made up for white using
the<00:00:43.050> night<00:00:44.420> basically<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> goes<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.750> this

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the night basically it goes like this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.880 
the night basically it goes like this
for<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> lack<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> argument<00:00:48.260> if<00:00:49.260> white<00:00:49.649> were<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
for a lack of argument if white were to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.360 
for a lack of argument if white were to
move<00:00:50.340> next<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.039> take<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.309> queen<00:00:53.610> on

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
move next you would take your queen on

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.229 
move next you would take your queen on
d2<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.870> place<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:59.000> d5<00:01:00.859> check<00:01:02.239> he's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
d2 and place it on d5 check he's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.460 
d2 and place it on d5 check he's
threatening<00:01:04.220> blacks<00:01:05.220> King<00:01:05.760> blacks<00:01:06.510> King<00:01:06.810> now

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
threatening blacks King blacks King now

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.370 
threatening blacks King blacks King now
must<00:01:07.950> move<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:09.770> h8<00:01:11.090> cannot<00:01:12.090> move<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.689> f8

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
must move to h8 cannot move to f8

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.130 
must move to h8 cannot move to f8
because<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.490> would<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.760> checked<00:01:15.150> me<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
because that would be checked me as you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.890 
because that would be checked me as you
can<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:19.040> blacks<00:01:20.040> mover<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.729> only<00:01:21.450> move

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
can see so blacks mover that only move

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
can see so blacks mover that only move
is<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.670> h8<00:01:23.750> now<00:01:24.750> next<00:01:25.500> move<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.280> white

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
is to h8 now next move then for white

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.140 
is to h8 now next move then for white
would<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.390> move<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:29.070> knight<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:31.400> g5<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:34.070> f7

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
would be to move the knight on g5 to f7

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
would be to move the knight on g5 to f7
check<00:01:36.409> again

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
check again

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.140 
check again
so<00:01:38.549> black<00:01:39.299> man<00:01:39.720> has<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.409> only<00:01:41.189> only<00:01:41.520> move<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
so black man has to only only move is to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.889 
so black man has to only only move is to
move<00:01:42.509> back<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.430> g8<00:01:45.049> as<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.689> next<00:01:48.689> move

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
move back to g8 as you can see next move

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.569 
move back to g8 as you can see next move
then<00:01:49.170> would<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:50.210> Knight<00:01:52.100> go<00:01:53.100> from<00:01:54.829> f7<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
then would be for Knight go from f7 to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.160 
then would be for Knight go from f7 to
h6<00:01:58.909> check<00:01:59.909> again<00:02:00.329> actually<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.140> double

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
h6 check again actually it's a double

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.109 
h6 check again actually it's a double
check<00:02:01.680> queen<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.430> night

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
check queen and night

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.469 
check queen and night
you<00:02:03.960> take<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> queen<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> process<00:02:05.479> but

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you take the queen in the process but

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.869 
you take the queen in the process but
again<00:02:07.399> forces<00:02:08.399> black<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.239> move<00:02:09.450> back<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.879> h8

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
again forces black to move back to h8

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.580 
again forces black to move back to h8
again<00:02:12.690> can't

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
again can't

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.369 
again can't
to<00:02:13.860> f/8<00:02:14.760> because<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.569> would<00:02:15.780> be<00:02:15.900> checked<00:02:16.170> me

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
to f/8 because that would be checked me

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.900 
to f/8 because that would be checked me
so<00:02:17.330> you'd<00:02:18.330> have<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.720> move<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.410> h8<00:02:20.310> would<00:02:20.760> be

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
so you'd have to move to h8 would be

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.660 
so you'd have to move to h8 would be
your<00:02:21.090> only<00:02:21.450> move<00:02:22.220> for<00:02:23.220> black<00:02:24.050> next<00:02:25.050> move

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
your only move for black next move

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.210 
your only move for black next move
actually<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.060> funnest<00:02:27.390> move<00:02:27.680> for<00:02:28.680> me

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
actually this is the funnest move for me

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.130 
actually this is the funnest move for me
you<00:02:29.550> take<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.390> Queen<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:31.019> d5<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.540> go<00:02:33.540> all<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
you take the Queen on d5 and go all the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.610 
you take the Queen on d5 and go all the
way<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:35.299> g8<00:02:38.239> check<00:02:39.239> again<00:02:40.190> black<00:02:41.190> cannot<00:02:41.790> take

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
way to g8 check again black cannot take

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.500 
way to g8 check again black cannot take
whites<00:02:43.620> Queen<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.730> king<00:02:44.970> because<00:02:45.330> it's

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
whites Queen with the king because it's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.589 
whites Queen with the king because it's
protected<00:02:46.110> by<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.319> knight<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.940> only<00:02:48.150> move

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
protected by the knight so the only move

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.839 
protected by the knight so the only move
for<00:02:49.470> black<00:02:49.769> is<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.160> take<00:02:50.940> with<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.750> rook<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.459> c8

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
for black is to take with the rook on c8

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:01.100 
for black is to take with the rook on c8
