00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 icc v6 who will teach you how 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:13.049
 make fireworks on minecraft 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:15.210
 first of all i log in so how 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.460
 to make fireworks well we 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.760
 will first need a table of 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.760
 kraft so here I am going to break and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.730
 we are at pizza we need to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:41.489
 the gunpowder that we do not hold in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:52.260
 cure in a scream fear or gast the the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:55.320
 paper and dye so no matter 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.030
 which one will take from the red of the green of the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.800
 yellow 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.940
 that's to give color to your 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:12.840
 fireworks yes i need several 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:15.740
 gunpowder takes 2.64 the same for the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.740
 poplar 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:26.549
 so here first of all it's going to have to 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.380
 kraft is a firework ball 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.720
 so how do we love it but 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.829
 no matter how much gunpowder 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.659
 and then a color so that's what will 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.659
 give you for example to a small 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.810
 yellow firework ball next 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.460
 to make the fireworks so we put 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.670
 there we can put a gunpowder 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.360
 if we put one it'll go to a 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.250
 distance to a fairly low height so 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.229
 we put two it's going to go high enough 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.740
 and if we put three like that, it's okay 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.869
 go very high so we go in May 2 which 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.659
 is not bad 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.940
 our paper so there we just have 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.710
 a fireworks rocket but that does not 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.510
 who will just do a firework 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.300
 transparent so we're not going to 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.750
 see so we add our ball and 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.930
 and then we have like ours rocket 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.570
 of firework of the raid in flight two 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.720
 so that's number of gunpowder 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.760
 a little ball and I do not see there we 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.670
 let's do it 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:40.240
 the envoy of allah they we have a fire 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:42.600
 fireworks after the effects so for 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.650
 add effects so we can use 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:53.500
 of the diamond of the luminous powder that 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:58.030
 lets do the glow stone which is this 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:08.680
 block or the luminous stone and the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:11.260
 fireballs this is so what is it 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:19.360
 that it will do us so we will redo 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:20.980
 a powder a firework ball 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.170
 so here we have a file 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.030
 if we put a fireball that makes a 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.800
 big ball so a bigger one 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.630
 explosion 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.890
 if we put powder light it makes 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.459
 Sparks 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.769
 finally cracklings and if we put 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.440
 diamond well we'll see a 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.050
 drag so we will try the powder 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:48.310
 bright diamond and a big ball 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:53.180

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:57.819
 so we're going to put all this a man that 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:03.670

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.670
 Here now we shall put the 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.690
