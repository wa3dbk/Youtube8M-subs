velocity of her body falling to the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.340 
velocity of her body falling to the
ground<00:03:16.920> was<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.459> high<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:18.120> her<00:03:18.600> elbow<00:03:19.019> dug

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
ground was so high that it her elbow dug

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.110 
ground was so high that it her elbow dug
into<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:20.010> into<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.519> pad<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.760> can<00:03:20.790> see<00:03:21.030> it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
into the into the pad you can see it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.710 
into the into the pad you can see it
right<00:03:21.209> here<00:03:21.440> right<00:03:22.440> here<00:03:22.470> check<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.459> out<00:03:23.720> her

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
elbows inside the damn thing that's how

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.310 
elbows inside the damn thing that's how
that's<00:03:27.750> how<00:03:27.870> Archie<00:03:28.350> was<00:03:28.530> falling<00:03:29.370> into<00:03:29.700> it

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
that's how Archie was falling into it

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.710 
that's how Archie was falling into it
she<00:03:31.320> saves<00:03:31.680> herself<00:03:31.860> twice<00:03:32.459> okay<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.510> can

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
she saves herself twice okay so you can

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.870 
she saves herself twice okay so you can
in<00:03:33.930> guys<00:03:34.350> remember<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.769> pads<00:03:35.070> are<00:03:35.430> pretty

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
in guys remember the pads are pretty

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.470 
in guys remember the pads are pretty
much<00:03:36.000> like<00:03:36.209> glass<00:03:36.510> um<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:38.670> she's<00:03:39.000> she's

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
much like glass um so she's she's

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.580 
much like glass um so she's she's
sliding<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.350> pad<00:03:41.900> she<00:03:42.900> might<00:03:43.170> not<00:03:43.200> be<00:03:43.380> able

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
sliding on the pad she might not be able

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.350 
sliding on the pad she might not be able
to<00:03:43.739> save<00:03:43.920> herself<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.430> time<00:03:44.489> she's<00:03:45.180> down<00:03:45.329> in

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
to save herself this time she's down in

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.729 
to save herself this time she's down in
points<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.900> she's<00:03:46.079> gonna<00:03:46.230> have<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.470> strike

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739

she's got to save herself and strike at
the<00:03:48.600> same<00:03:48.780> time<00:03:48.959> she<00:03:49.140> has<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> free<00:03:49.560> left<00:03:49.950> hand

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
the same time she has a free left hand

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.220 
the same time she has a free left hand
napster<00:03:51.630> probably<00:03:51.959> knows<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.350> yeah<00:03:53.340> okay

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230

but<00:03:58.230> see<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.280> velocity<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.970> she

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
but see that the velocity of that she

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.199 
but see that the velocity of that she
dug<00:04:00.570> into<00:04:00.870> like<00:04:01.320> her<00:04:01.470> elbow<00:04:02.160> dug<00:04:02.489> into<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.940> pad

during that turn and it actually might

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.230 
during that turn and it actually might
have<00:04:41.880> actually<00:04:42.199> lifted<00:04:43.199> into<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.500> air<00:04:43.620> in<00:04:44.069> the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
pressure that neb stir was still putting

pressure that neb stir was still putting
on<00:04:46.590> her<00:04:46.650> might<00:04:46.889> have<00:04:47.009> actually<00:04:47.160> helped<00:04:47.789> her

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
on her might have actually helped her

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.540 
on her might have actually helped her
forced<00:04:48.720> her<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.900> move<00:04:49.259> backwards<00:04:49.889> outside<00:04:50.430> the

forced her to move backwards outside the
ring<00:04:50.699> a<00:04:50.789> bit<00:04:50.970> more<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.389> then<00:04:51.780> she<00:04:52.259> like<00:04:52.410> popped

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
ring a bit more and then she like popped

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.430 
ring a bit more and then she like popped
up<00:04:52.949> feels<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.729> tiny<00:04:53.970> bit<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.240> air<00:04:54.389> she<00:04:55.199> moved

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
up feels a tiny bit of air she moved

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.939 
up feels a tiny bit of air she moved
outwards<00:04:55.949> and<00:04:56.720> then<00:04:57.720> her<00:04:57.990> L<00:04:58.169> will<00:04:58.349> quickly

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
outwards and then her L will quickly

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.450 
outwards and then her L will quickly
like<00:04:59.220> caught<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:01.740> pad<00:05:01.949> again<00:05:02.160> and

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
like caught the the the pad again and

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.310 
like caught the the the pad again and
she<00:05:02.820> was<00:05:02.940> able<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.210> stop<00:05:03.449> at<00:05:03.599> that<00:05:03.690> one<00:05:03.930> second

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
she was able to stop at that one second

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.620 
she was able to stop at that one second
time<00:05:04.470> before<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:05.099> fell<00:05:05.250> off<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.490> edge<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:06.060> think

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
time before it fell off the edge I think

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.259 
time before it fell off the edge I think
that's<00:05:06.840> how<00:05:06.960> it<00:05:07.110> is
