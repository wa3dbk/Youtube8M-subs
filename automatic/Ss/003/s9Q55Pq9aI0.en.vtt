they're<00:00:38.090> very<00:00:38.270> respectable<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.320> I<00:00:39.620> put<00:00:39.829> them

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
they're very respectable and I put them

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.310 
they're very respectable and I put them
in<00:00:40.070> high<00:00:40.250> regard<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:40.960> what's<00:00:41.960> really

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
in high regard and what's really

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.900 
in high regard and what's really
different<00:00:42.710> about<00:00:42.920> this<00:00:43.219> compared<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.789> the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
different about this compared to the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.520 
different about this compared to the
current<00:00:44.059> galaxy<00:00:44.600> s5<00:00:44.840> that<00:00:45.079> we<00:00:45.170> have<00:00:45.320> right<00:00:45.469> now

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
current galaxy s5 that we have right now

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.290 
current galaxy s5 that we have right now
is<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:45.980> designs<00:00:46.309> being<00:00:46.579> tweaked<00:00:47.000> a<00:00:47.239> bit

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
is the designs being tweaked a bit

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.540 
is the designs being tweaked a bit
slightly<00:00:48.050> it<00:00:48.469> seems<00:00:48.920> to<00:00:49.100> be<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.219> bit<00:00:49.280> more

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
slightly it seems to be a bit more

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.709 
slightly it seems to be a bit more
curved<00:00:50.000> along<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.960> back<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:52.340> also<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.420> it

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
curved along the back and also the it

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.110 
curved along the back and also the it
seems<00:00:54.019> to<00:00:54.140> have<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.289> brushed<00:00:54.680> metal<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.519> feel<00:00:55.850> or

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
seems to have a brushed metal of feel or

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.779 
seems to have a brushed metal of feel or
look<00:00:56.149> to<00:00:56.629> it<00:00:56.750> at<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.050> back<00:00:57.199> as<00:00:57.410> well<00:00:57.550> it's<00:00:58.550> most

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
look to it at the back as well it's most

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.000 
look to it at the back as well it's most
likely<00:00:58.850> not<00:00:59.120> going<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.600> be<00:00:59.840> metal<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.530> it's

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
likely not going to be metal and it's

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.470 
likely not going to be metal and it's
going<00:01:01.429> to<00:01:01.519> be<00:01:01.609> some<00:01:01.789> sort<00:01:01.910> of<00:01:02.000> metallic

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
going to be some sort of metallic

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.669 
going to be some sort of metallic
material<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:03.140> it's<00:01:03.230> probably<00:01:03.440> going<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.620> be

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
material so it's probably going to be

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.850 
material so it's probably going to be
plastic<00:01:04.309> maybe<00:01:05.269> with<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.570> coating<00:01:05.960> of<00:01:06.200> metal<00:01:06.530> on

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
plastic maybe with a coating of metal on

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.490 
plastic maybe with a coating of metal on
top<00:01:07.100> or<00:01:07.369> something<00:01:07.880> similar<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.659> what<00:01:08.780> LG<00:01:09.229> g3

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
top or something similar to what LG g3

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.880 
top or something similar to what LG g3
did<00:01:10.090> LG<00:01:11.090> did<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.570> g3<00:01:12.020> or<00:01:12.049> they<00:01:12.409> might<00:01:12.590> go

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
did LG did with the g3 or they might go

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.429 
did LG did with the g3 or they might go
with<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.100> galaxy<00:01:13.549> s5<00:01:13.880> root<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.360> just<00:01:14.960> make<00:01:15.259> it<00:01:15.290> a

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
with a galaxy s5 root and just make it a

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.609 
with a galaxy s5 root and just make it a
brushed<00:01:16.450> look<00:01:17.450> but<00:01:17.780> it's<00:01:17.810> really<00:01:18.350> going<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.560> be

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
brushed look but it's really going to be

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.640 
brushed look but it's really going to be
a<00:01:18.710> plastic<00:01:19.119> device<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:20.420> there's<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.439> whole

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
a plastic device so there's a whole

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.190 
a plastic device so there's a whole
bunch<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.950> options<00:01:22.100> that<00:01:22.369> Samsung<00:01:22.700> still<00:01:22.909> has

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
bunch of options that Samsung still has

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.780 
bunch of options that Samsung still has
right<00:01:24.200> now<00:01:24.229> this<00:01:24.619> is<00:01:24.770> just<00:01:24.799> leaked<00:01:25.400> images

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
right now this is just leaked images

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.190 
right now this is just leaked images
stay<00:01:26.090> tuned<00:01:26.270> for<00:01:26.479> more<00:01:26.600> official<00:01:27.020> information

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
stay tuned for more official information

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.260 
stay tuned for more official information
and<00:01:27.770> as<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.250> can<00:01:28.400> see<00:01:28.430> on<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.820> smartphones

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
and as you can see on the smartphones

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.730 
and as you can see on the smartphones
leaked<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.780> actually<00:01:30.079> says<00:01:30.259> Wednesday

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
leaked it actually says Wednesday

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.830 
leaked it actually says Wednesday
September<00:01:31.250> 12<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.000> that<00:01:32.030> could<00:01:32.329> be<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.659> date

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
September 12 so that could be the date

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.450 
September 12 so that could be the date
that<00:01:33.079> we're<00:01:33.259> going<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.680> get<00:01:34.130> some<00:01:34.310> new

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
that we're going to get some new

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.550 
that we're going to get some new
information<00:01:34.729> about<00:01:35.090> this<00:01:35.390> device<00:01:35.720> but<00:01:36.290> also<00:01:36.439> I

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
information about this device but also I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.380 
information about this device but also I
want<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:36.829> point<00:01:36.890> out<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.640> says<00:01:37.850> Wednesday

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
want to point out that it says Wednesday

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.870 
want to point out that it says Wednesday
September<00:01:38.840> 12<00:01:39.079> but<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:40.100> year<00:01:40.310> September

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
September 12 but this year September

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.330 
September 12 but this year September
12th<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.450> actually<00:01:41.840> going<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.079> be<00:01:42.200> on<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:43.130> friday

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
12th is actually going to be on a friday

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.179 
12th is actually going to be on a friday
so<00:01:43.700> there's<00:01:44.240> some<00:01:44.360> discrepancies<00:01:45.049> in<00:01:45.590> terms

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
so there's some discrepancies in terms

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.950 
so there's some discrepancies in terms
of<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.640> date<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.090> was<00:01:47.240> actually<00:01:47.509> put<00:01:47.869> on

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
of the date that was actually put on
