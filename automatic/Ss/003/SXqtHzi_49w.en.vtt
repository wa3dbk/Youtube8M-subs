we have the turbos been mounted in I've

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 
we have the turbos been mounted in I've
extended<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.410> tunnel<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.940> on<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.149> sled

guy sent the curbs he'd upgraded the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.090 
guy sent the curbs he'd upgraded the
tops<00:01:29.670> from<00:01:30.150> plastic<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.810> metal<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
tops from plastic to metal and it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.590 
tops from plastic to metal and it
already<00:01:32.280> glued<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.000> fittings<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.450> this

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
already glued all the fittings on this

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870 
already glued all the fittings on this
it's<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:33.990> put<00:01:34.200> together<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.890> when<00:01:35.759> it's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
it's all put together so that when it's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.480 
it's all put together so that when it's
under<00:01:36.060> boost<00:01:36.270> nothing<00:01:36.840> blows<00:01:37.049> apart<00:01:37.490> we've

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
under boost nothing blows apart we've

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.520 
under boost nothing blows apart we've
got<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> fuel<00:01:39.030> pump<00:01:39.600> system<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.350> with<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
got a fuel pump system here with a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.030 
got a fuel pump system here with a
regulator<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.790> there's<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> fuel<00:01:42.210> pump<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.040> it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
regulator so there's a fuel pump and it

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
regulator so there's a fuel pump and it
ties<00:01:44.250> into<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> existing<00:01:45.000> tank<00:01:45.270> there's<00:01:45.659> also

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
ties into the existing tank there's also

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.069 
ties into the existing tank there's also
an<00:01:46.049> oil<00:01:46.200> pump<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:47.220> sits<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.579> front<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
an oil pump that sits up front here and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.249 
an oil pump that sits up front here and
that<00:01:49.229> feeds<00:01:49.439> oil<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> turbo<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.970> just

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
that feeds oil to the turbo so just

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.300 
that feeds oil to the turbo so just
trying<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.350> mount<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.130> been

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
trying to mount all this it's been

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.940 
trying to mount all this it's been
installed<00:01:53.520> once<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.180> kind<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> easy<00:01:54.960> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
installed once so it's kind of easy to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.530 
installed once so it's kind of easy to
have<00:01:56.100> some<00:01:56.280> instructions<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:57.030> there's<00:01:57.390> not

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
have some instructions but there's not

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.050 
have some instructions but there's not
not<00:01:57.869> exactly<00:01:58.189> as<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.430> instructions<00:01:59.880> because

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
not exactly as the instructions because

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.999 
not exactly as the instructions because
he<00:02:00.149> changed<00:02:00.390> some<00:02:00.659> things<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.140> anyways<00:02:01.890> we're

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
he changed some things so anyways we're

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:02.990 
he changed some things so anyways we're
getting<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> point<00:02:02.430> where<00:02:02.549> I'm<00:02:02.969> just

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
getting to the point where I'm just

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.310 
getting to the point where I'm just
bolting<00:02:03.509> everything<00:02:03.810> together<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
bolting everything together and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.870 
bolting everything together and
hopefully<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> next<00:02:05.189> week<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.610> two<00:02:05.729> we'll

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
hopefully in the next week or two we'll

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.279 
hopefully in the next week or two we'll
have<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.090> running<00:02:07.099> off<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> races

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
have it running off to the races

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.170 
have it running off to the races
yeah<00:02:09.950> literally<00:02:10.399> would<00:02:10.519> be<00:02:10.549> probably<00:02:10.849> the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
yeah literally would be probably the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.800 
yeah literally would be probably the
night<00:02:11.269> before<00:02:11.450> you'll<00:02:11.780> be<00:02:12.019> down<00:02:12.920> yeah<00:02:13.810> well

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
night before you'll be down yeah well

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.059 
night before you'll be down yeah well
one<00:02:15.379> thing<00:02:15.560> putting<00:02:15.799> it<00:02:15.860> all<00:02:15.950> together

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
one thing putting it all together

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.649 
one thing putting it all together
getting<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.579> running<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.000> then<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.390> figured

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
getting it running and then just figured

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.030 
getting it running and then just figured
out<00:02:17.860> how<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.000> tune<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.180> turbo<00:02:21.110> it's<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.590> different

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
out how to tune a turbo it's a different

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.530 
out how to tune a turbo it's a different
beast<00:02:22.189> for<00:02:22.430> us<00:02:22.489> we've<00:02:22.700> never<00:02:22.849> worked<00:02:23.239> on<00:02:23.360> four

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
beast for us we've never worked on four

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.420 
beast for us we've never worked on four
strokes<00:02:23.810> before<00:02:23.989> so<00:02:24.379> it'll<00:02:25.220> be<00:02:25.340> interesting

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
strokes before so it'll be interesting

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.640 
strokes before so it'll be interesting
if<00:02:25.790> they're<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> little<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.989> know<00:02:27.110> if<00:02:27.290> it's<00:02:27.440> not

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
if they're a little you know if it's not

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.960 
if they're a little you know if it's not
running<00:02:27.950> right<00:02:28.190> it's<00:02:28.340> not<00:02:28.459> going<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.670> grenade

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
running right it's not going to grenade

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.910 
running right it's not going to grenade
the<00:02:29.090> motor<00:02:29.329> it<00:02:29.959> might<00:02:30.140> just<00:02:30.349> run<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:30.500> crap

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
the motor it might just run like crap

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.610 
the motor it might just run like crap
you<00:02:31.610> know<00:02:32.269> unless<00:02:32.480> we<00:02:32.540> really<00:02:32.959> took<00:02:33.319> too<00:02:33.500> much

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
you know unless we really took too much

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.530 
you know unless we really took too much
boost<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.129> melt<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.400> down<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.299> know<00:02:35.420> if

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
boost and melt it down but you know if

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.539 
boost and melt it down but you know if
you<00:02:35.629> start<00:02:35.810> low<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.049> work<00:02:36.290> at<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.590> if<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.370> not

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
you start low and work at it if it's not

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.039 
you start low and work at it if it's not
like<00:02:37.609> a<00:02:37.670> two-stroke<00:02:38.120> if<00:02:38.269> you<00:02:38.659> got<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.900> wrong

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
like a two-stroke if you got the wrong

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.869 
like a two-stroke if you got the wrong
fuel<00:02:39.290> mixture<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.859> you<00:02:39.920> blow<00:02:40.099> it<00:02:40.220> up<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.790> know

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
fuel mixture and you blow it up you know

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:41.740 
fuel mixture and you blow it up you know
these<00:02:41.000> things<00:02:41.180> you're<00:02:41.390> basically<00:02:41.690> just

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
these things you're basically just

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.440 
these things you're basically just
running<00:02:42.079> straight<00:02:42.140> guys<00:02:42.470> like<00:02:43.069> a<00:02:43.099> car<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.879> you

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
running straight guys like a car and you

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.000 
running straight guys like a car and you
know<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.959> little<00:02:45.200> bit<00:02:45.409> more<00:02:45.590> forgiving

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
know so it's a little bit more forgiving

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.430 
know so it's a little bit more forgiving
as<00:02:46.129> far<00:02:46.340> as<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.549> goes<00:02:46.609> though<00:02:47.319> put<00:02:48.319> it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
as far as that goes though put it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.930 
as far as that goes though put it
together<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.829> see<00:02:48.980> how<00:02:49.040> she<00:02:49.099> flies<00:02:49.400> yeah<00:02:49.730> she
