most<00:00:09.090> eight-year-olds<00:00:09.630> can<00:00:09.809> tell<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.170> that

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
most eight-year-olds can tell you that

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.980 
most eight-year-olds can tell you that
once<00:00:10.559> water<00:00:10.800> boils<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.670> turns<00:00:12.059> into<00:00:12.269> steam<00:00:12.690> and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
once water boils it turns into steam and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.200 
once water boils it turns into steam and
because<00:00:13.710> hot<00:00:13.950> air<00:00:14.099> rises<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.910> steam

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
because hot air rises that steam

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.060 
because hot air rises that steam

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
also turns back into hot water and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.100 
also turns back into hot water and

versus<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> steam<00:01:06.630> they're<00:01:07.170> still<00:01:07.409> really

versus the steam they're still really

versus the steam they're still really
really<00:01:08.159> hot<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.850> when<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.570> kettle<00:01:09.930> lid<00:01:10.049> opens

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
really hot so when your kettle lid opens

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.070 
really hot so when your kettle lid opens
really<00:01:10.710> quickly<00:01:11.220> two<00:01:11.520> things<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:12.000> happen

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
really quickly two things can happen

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.450 
really quickly two things can happen
firstly<00:01:13.080> some<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.439> those<00:01:13.560> water<00:01:13.860> droplets<00:01:14.010> can

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
firstly some of those water droplets can

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.890 
firstly some of those water droplets can
flick<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> lid<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.630> splash

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
flick up with the lid and splash

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.899 
flick up with the lid and splash
whatever<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:16.619> whoever<00:01:17.130> gets<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.729> their<00:01:17.880> way

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
whatever or whoever gets in their way

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.450 
whatever or whoever gets in their way
and<00:01:18.479> secondly<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.409> you're<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.799> careful<00:01:20.040> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
and secondly if you're not careful a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.880 
and secondly if you're not careful a
great<00:01:20.850> wallop<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> steam<00:01:21.869> comes<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.770> hits

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
great wallop of steam comes up and hits

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
great wallop of steam comes up and hits
you<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> face<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.360> know<00:01:24.570> about

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you in the face now I don't know about

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.350 
you in the face now I don't know about
you<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.259> use<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:25.650> kettle<00:01:25.920> every<00:01:26.580> single<00:01:27.180> day

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you but I use my kettle every single day

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.819 
you but I use my kettle every single day
so<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.110> experience<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.740> as

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
so I want the experience to be as

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.490 
so I want the experience to be as
pleasant<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.520> pain-free<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.420> possible<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
pleasant and pain-free as possible and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.870 
pleasant and pain-free as possible and
it's<00:01:31.619> these<00:01:31.740> kinds<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.310> everyday<00:01:32.549> kitchen

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's these kinds of everyday kitchen

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's these kinds of everyday kitchen
experiences<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> design<00:01:34.170> team<00:01:34.439> at<00:01:34.590> Sage

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
experiences that the design team at Sage

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.649 
experiences that the design team at Sage
go<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> bed<00:01:35.520> each<00:01:35.549> night<00:01:35.670> thinking<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
go to bed each night thinking about and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.230 
go to bed each night thinking about and
trying<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.350> improve<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.310> sage<00:01:38.549> invented<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
trying to improve so sage invented the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.480 
trying to improve so sage invented the
world's<00:01:39.509> first<00:01:39.540> food<00:01:40.229> safe<00:01:40.530> soft<00:01:41.040> opening

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
world's first food safe soft opening

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.760 
world's first food safe soft opening
careful<00:01:41.850> lid<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.350> there's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
careful lid as you can see here there's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
careful lid as you can see here there's
quite<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> lot<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> condensation<00:01:44.850> built<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.600> on
