salmon<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.839> think<00:00:07.440> actually<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.859> kind<00:00:08.099> of

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
salmon I think actually is kind of

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.009 
salmon I think actually is kind of
barbaric<00:00:08.550> when<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.330> really<00:00:09.480> think<00:00:09.570> about<00:00:09.840> it

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
barbaric when you really think about it

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.490 
barbaric when you really think about it
because<00:00:10.340> all<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.610> really<00:00:11.759> did<00:00:11.910> was<00:00:12.320> get<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
because all we really did was get the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.580 
because all we really did was get the
salmon<00:00:13.769> out<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.250> lake<00:00:14.460> or<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:14.969> stream<00:00:15.590> gut

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.929 
salmon out of the lake or the stream gut
