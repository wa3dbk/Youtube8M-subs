00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.570
 Y 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.570
 i 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello girls who also come once 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.280
 more to my channel I bring for you a 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.170
 makeup video is this that I 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.270
 at this moment I hope you like it very much 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.150
 you know what it is to watch the full video 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.949
 and we'll see you at the end and well let's 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.470
 start very fast obviously we are going to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.599
 put first a whole first I'm 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.089
 using the first portion of organdy kate 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.339
 because my eyelids are very fatty and 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.449
 I want the makeup to last me so 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.850
 is going to put it on the entire eyelid 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.160
 superior to touches and all 3 where 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.610
 blur it well so I do not stay 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.190
 so white and then spend with the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.050
 nix jumbo in color fear for 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.940
 perform much more shadows like 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 are you watching in the video or with the jumbo 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.480
 of nix then is to take a brush and what 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.280
 as if blurring because how is it so 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.500
 creamy I do not want that in the end to weigh 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.149
 that I applied the first week to do 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.519
 folds then what I do is that it gives 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.530
 little touches I heard it as blurring the 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.809
 palette that you will use for the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.090
 almost all makeup is the natural shock 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.949
 of maybelline here I am putting a 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.420
 nude color that brings this palette that is 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.790
 very very pretty very bright and is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.290
 special for this time and I'm going to 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.390
 put then on 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.570
 to the base of a good mix that I already have 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.040
 previously applied now what I'm going to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.840
 to do is that it will take a brown color 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.650
 I'm using the trio of coffee shadows 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.510
 basic over own Sami and I'm going to give it 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.370
 depth eye you and I 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.840
 I do it because of the basin because 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.330
 my eyes are very small then the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.120
 idea is to give them greater openness and be 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.210
 a little bit bigger and then I'm going to 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.070
 reaffirm a little the color not of the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.510
 previous palette that I used when 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.790
 we started to combine learning a 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.710
 little color and the idea is that then 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.090
 that reaffirmed all of fairy like the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.550
 intensity that you prefer and then 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.470
 in the last part of the eye in the external 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.800
 I will use the last two colors 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.080
 that are like a brown and a copper with 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.390
 very nice golden sparkles 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.970
 then you will also apply 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.009
 to be blurring so they leave 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.540
 mixing the two colors well as 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.790
 they attend the video this step can 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.709
 repeat it again so you can 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.709
 achieve the desired intensity 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.090
 Now what I'm going to do is start with 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.730
 the double outlined we started with the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.680
 Fuchsia color of coquette I'm using 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.510
 a brush not the same one that it brings because 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.870
 idea is to do the line if it's a bit 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.700
 thicker than normal for later 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.290
 use a designer I 'm 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.930
 using the tip with markers the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.120
 cover to make the line very very to 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.849
 flush the eyelashes as well as you're 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.849
 watching and ending it with a tail 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.120
 it is totally optional if you choose to put yourself 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.680
 some false eyelashes I did it because 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.290
 obviously I want the look to be a 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.030
 little more thematic and good down what 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.620
 what I'm going to use are the colors 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.750
 Same colors you use in the part 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.989
 I will use them for the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.510
 lower eyelid as you are seeing 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.090
 step to curl my eyelashes as always and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.829
 Then apply the eyelash to 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.239
 attach them to each other I'm 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.460
 using the dsp but because it has 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.950
 I liked the brush a lot 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.540
 forget please the haarp is harmful in 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.430
 the tabs below to me always me 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.680
 it happens and always like that at the last minute 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.380
 I have to do it and that's how they should stay 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.760
 the eyes as the face part does not go 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.320
 to show because I always do it in 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.910
 all the videos so let's go 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.430
 directly to the lips I'm 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.930
 using a nude color of mac they know 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.880
 that the colors and all the photos are going to 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.240
 be on the blog and I'm also going to 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.950
 use a lip after the labial 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.510
 of these that I showed you in the video of 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.909
 sammy 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.370
 to give it a little more luminosity 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.340
 and shine and make them more beautiful more 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.459
 tender that is like the idea of ​​this 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.069
 much more romantic makeup and so 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.920
 our makeup is already with leaves of 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.330
 lips and face ready with outline and 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.040
 everything else 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.230
 the steps then of this makeup 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.990
 that you can use it at night you can 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.660

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.730
 very fashionable in the delineators with 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.530
