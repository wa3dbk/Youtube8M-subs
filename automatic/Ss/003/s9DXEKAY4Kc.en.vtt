hello today we'll be revisiting
particle-based<00:00:03.300> SSP<00:00:03.990> arrow<00:00:04.259> detectors<00:00:04.770> for

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
particle-based SSP arrow detectors for

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.490 
particle-based SSP arrow detectors for
two<00:00:05.250> reasons<00:00:05.509> one<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.690> make<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.899> legend<00:00:07.379> of

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
two reasons one to make a legend of

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.459 
two reasons one to make a legend of
zelda<00:00:07.859> style<00:00:08.160> timed<00:00:08.639> toggling<00:00:09.330> switch<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:10.349> use

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
zelda style timed toggling switch to use

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.039 
zelda style timed toggling switch to use
a<00:00:10.620> bow<00:00:10.889> target<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:12.360> second<00:00:12.660> reason<00:00:12.750> will

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
a bow target and the second reason will

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.150 
a bow target and the second reason will
be<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.500> make<00:00:14.099> an<00:00:14.340> SSP<00:00:14.849> SMP<00:00:15.839> detection<00:00:16.740> system

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
be to make an SSP SMP detection system

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.950 
be to make an SSP SMP detection system
so<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.789> redirect<00:00:18.390> your<00:00:18.630> players

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
so that you can redirect your players

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.810 
so that you can redirect your players
accordingly<00:00:19.439> when<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.369> something<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
accordingly when you have something that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.620 
accordingly when you have something that
doesn't<00:00:21.270> work<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.720> their<00:00:21.900> current<00:00:22.170> game<00:00:22.470> mode

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
doesn't work in their current game mode

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.500 
doesn't work in their current game mode
so<00:00:24.630> first<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.710> general

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
so first we have the general

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.019 
so first we have the general
particle-based<00:00:27.920> detector<00:00:28.920> from<00:00:29.429> my<00:00:29.670> first

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
particle-based detector from my first

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.849 
particle-based detector from my first
error<00:00:30.210> detection<00:00:30.539> video<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.170> I'll<00:00:31.560> quickly

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
error detection video and I'll quickly

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.280 
error detection video and I'll quickly
go<00:00:32.040> over<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.460> concept<00:00:33.000> again<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:34.110> is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
go over the concept again and that is

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.979 
go over the concept again and that is
that<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.860> top<00:00:35.219> half<00:00:35.489> flower<00:00:35.790> block<00:00:36.120> houses

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
that this top half flower block houses

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.850 
that this top half flower block houses
our<00:00:38.270> pressure<00:00:39.270> pad<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.899> wooden<00:00:40.350> pressure<00:00:40.590> pad

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
our pressure pad a wooden pressure pad

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
our pressure pad a wooden pressure pad
and<00:00:41.129> although<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.730> can't<00:00:42.149> activate<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.899> with

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and although we can't activate that with

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
and although we can't activate that with
our<00:00:43.140> arrow<00:00:43.440> directly<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.550> place<00:00:45.239> our

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
our arrow directly we can place our

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
our arrow directly we can place our
arrow<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.960> side<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.710> block<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
arrow on the side of the block on the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.569 
arrow on the side of the block on the
top<00:00:47.910> half<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.480> update<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:50.309> our

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
top half and update that with our

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
top half and update that with our
particles<00:00:51.270> being<00:00:51.480> generated<00:00:51.809> from<00:00:52.110> any

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
particles being generated from any

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.260 
particles being generated from any
source<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.460> long<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> passes<00:00:54.059> through

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
source and as long as it passes through

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
source and as long as it passes through
the<00:00:54.750> area<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> our<00:00:55.350> pressure<00:00:55.559> pad<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:56.370> will

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the area of our pressure pad we will

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.689 
the area of our pressure pad we will
update<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.360> pad<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> gain<00:00:58.770> power<00:00:59.010> from<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
update the pad and gain power from the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.599 
update the pad and gain power from the
pad<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.230> were<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> fire<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.430> won't

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
pad so if we were to fire here it won't

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.420 
pad so if we were to fire here it won't
work<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.899> fire<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> top<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.220> does

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
work but if we fire to the top it does

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.969 
work but if we fire to the top it does
work<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
work and then as you see we just have a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.800 
work and then as you see we just have a
piston<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.670> powered<00:01:09.060> by<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.570> pressure

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
piston that's powered by that pressure

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.170 
piston that's powered by that pressure
pad<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.770> push<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> bit<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.310> glass<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:11.880> whatever

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
pad to push a bit of glass or whatever

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.420 
pad to push a bit of glass or whatever
you<00:01:12.299> want<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> remove<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> arrow<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.189> then

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you want and remove the arrow and then

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.460 
you want and remove the arrow and then
you<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> nice<00:01:14.880> roasted<00:01:15.689> arrow<00:01:15.900> down<00:01:16.170> below

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you get a nice roasted arrow down below

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.990 
you get a nice roasted arrow down below
here<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.869> we<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.290> any<00:01:19.710> old<00:01:20.310> redstone

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
here and we just have any old redstone

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
here and we just have any old redstone
going<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.450> however<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> want<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.619> you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
going up however you want to do it you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.410 
going up however you want to do it you
don't<00:01:22.890> even<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.610> from<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> top<00:01:24.180> if

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
don't even have to do it from the top if

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030 
don't even have to do it from the top if
you<00:01:24.450> want<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.080> push<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> arrows<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you want you can push the arrows to the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.399 
you want you can push the arrows to the
side<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:27.030> i<00:01:27.060> prefer<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.479> top<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
side but i prefer the top for the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.160 
side but i prefer the top for the
following<00:01:28.680> reason<00:01:29.130> i<00:01:29.659> wanted<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.869> make<00:01:31.020> it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
following reason i wanted to make it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.200 
following reason i wanted to make it
look<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.619> legend<00:01:32.070> zelda<00:01:32.310> eyes<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
look like the legend zelda eyes that you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.359 
look like the legend zelda eyes that you
see<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> shoot<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> eyes<00:01:34.590> closed<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
see and shoot and the eyes closed and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
see and shoot and the eyes closed and
then<00:01:35.820> whenever<00:01:36.000> they're<00:01:36.329> ready<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.720> shot

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
then whenever they're ready to be shot

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.999 
then whenever they're ready to be shot
again<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.590> reopen<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.420> top<00:01:39.570> here

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
again they reopen so on the top here

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.910 
again they reopen so on the top here
when<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.100> shot<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.939> have

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
when you shot we have

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.490 
when you shot we have
our<00:01:43.310> pressure<00:01:43.820> pad<00:01:44.119> here<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:44.659> we<00:01:45.140> have<00:01:45.170> two

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
our pressure pad here and we have two

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.530 
our pressure pad here and we have two
fires<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.310> we<00:01:46.430> generate<00:01:46.759> more<00:01:47.150> particles

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
fires so that we generate more particles

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.480 
fires so that we generate more particles
and<00:01:47.869> then<00:01:48.710> on<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.189> left<00:01:49.460> side<00:01:49.729> this<00:01:50.659> wire<00:01:50.930> here

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
and then on the left side this wire here

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.120 
and then on the left side this wire here
it's<00:01:52.490> coming<00:01:52.790> from<00:01:53.000> our<00:01:53.360> pad<00:01:53.659> into<00:01:53.990> this<00:01:54.860> side

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
will allow us to first activate our sort

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.570 
will allow us to first activate our sort
of<00:02:02.240> eyelid<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.619> will<00:02:03.770> close<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.190> eyelid

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580

push<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.270> arrow<00:02:05.450> out<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.899> way<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.289> then

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
push the arrow out of the way and then

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.550 
push the arrow out of the way and then
later<00:02:07.100> after<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.119> delay<00:02:08.539> with<00:02:08.780> these<00:02:09.170> repeaters

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
later after a delay with these repeaters

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.660 
later after a delay with these repeaters
we<00:02:10.310> will<00:02:10.519> reopen<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.330> eyelid<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:13.400> course

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
we will reopen the eyelid and of course

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.900 
we will reopen the eyelid and of course
from<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.690> same<00:02:15.050> area<00:02:15.290> here<00:02:15.739> whenever<00:02:16.640> it's

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
from the same area here whenever it's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.460 
from the same area here whenever it's
activated<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:17.660> will<00:02:17.780> take<00:02:18.019> that<00:02:18.050> power

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
activated and we will take that power

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.420 
activated and we will take that power
and<00:02:18.970> use<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.360> power<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.620> door<00:02:21.860> down<00:02:22.040> here

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
and use it to power this door down here

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.270 
and use it to power this door down here
on<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.640> slight<00:02:23.120> delay<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.380> we<00:02:24.650> can<00:02:24.860> play<00:02:25.160> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
on a slight delay so that we can play a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.059 
on a slight delay so that we can play a
little<00:02:25.489> tune<00:02:25.760> first<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:27.739> don't<00:02:27.920> really

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
little tune first and you don't really

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.860 
little tune first and you don't really
needed<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.580> note<00:02:28.700> blocks<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.150> course<00:02:29.360> but<00:02:29.660> I

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
needed the note blocks of course but I

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.809 
needed the note blocks of course but I
like<00:02:30.230> playing<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.620> nice<00:02:30.799> tune<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.400> then

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
like playing a nice tune and then

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.090 
like playing a nice tune and then
reversing<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.569> tune<00:02:32.780> whenever<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.830> eye<00:02:33.860> is

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
reversing the tune whenever the eye is

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.920 
reversing the tune whenever the eye is
opening<00:02:34.819> back<00:02:35.000> up<00:02:35.030> again<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:37.310> down<00:02:37.640> below<00:02:37.970> we

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
opening back up again so down below we

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.559 
opening back up again so down below we
can<00:02:38.959> test<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.440> out<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.920> by<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.700> way<00:02:40.970> if<00:02:41.299> your

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
can test this out and by the way if your

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.870 
can test this out and by the way if your
players<00:02:42.049> need<00:02:42.350> some<00:02:42.530> training<00:02:42.739> on<00:02:43.130> how<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.580> use

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
players need some training on how to use

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.030 
players need some training on how to use
these<00:02:44.120> because<00:02:44.390> they<00:02:44.870> need<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.319> aim<00:02:45.590> at<00:02:45.860> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
these because they need to aim at the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.310 
these because they need to aim at the
top<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.519> block<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:47.450> can<00:02:47.630> have<00:02:47.810> them<00:02:47.989> first

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
top of the block you can have them first

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.759 
top of the block you can have them first
learn<00:02:48.680> about<00:02:48.980> them<00:02:49.250> by<00:02:49.519> using<00:02:50.390> torches<00:02:51.230> such

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
learn about them by using torches such

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.069 
learn about them by using torches such
as<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.070> redstone<00:02:52.459> torches<00:02:52.880> right<00:02:53.600> on<00:02:53.780> top<00:02:54.049> of

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
as this redstone torches right on top of

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.370 
as this redstone torches right on top of
the<00:02:54.410> detector<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.340> then<00:02:56.000> when<00:02:56.180> they<00:02:56.299> fire<00:02:56.600> you

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the detector and then when they fire you

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.259 
the detector and then when they fire you
have<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.650> make<00:02:57.859> sure<00:02:57.890> they<00:02:58.250> aim<00:02:58.489> at<00:02:58.790> the

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
have to make sure they aim at the

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.440 
have to make sure they aim at the
torches<00:03:00.049> top<00:03:00.290> here

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
torches top here

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.210 
torches top here
and<00:03:01.569> then<00:03:01.810> whenever<00:03:02.020> they<00:03:02.290> hit<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.980> torch

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
and then whenever they hit it the torch

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.000 
and then whenever they hit it the torch
will<00:03:03.400> go<00:03:03.550> out<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:05.080> will<00:03:05.230> be<00:03:05.349> a<00:03:05.379> great<00:03:05.769> way

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
will go out and that will be a great way

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.650 
will go out and that will be a great way
to<00:03:06.069> train<00:03:06.430> your<00:03:06.610> players<00:03:06.879> I<00:03:07.150> think<00:03:07.180> for<00:03:07.629> the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
to train your players I think for the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.479 
to train your players I think for the
upcoming<00:03:08.290> adventure<00:03:08.800> maps<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.310> might

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
upcoming adventure maps that you might

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.070 
upcoming adventure maps that you might
use<00:03:09.670> these<00:03:09.879> on<00:03:10.060> that's<00:03:10.330> how<00:03:10.450> I'll<00:03:10.599> probably<00:03:10.840> do

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
use these on that's how I'll probably do

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.540 
use these on that's how I'll probably do
it<00:03:11.110> but<00:03:11.739> at<00:03:11.830> any<00:03:11.950> rate<00:03:12.069> you'll<00:03:12.310> want<00:03:12.489> to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
it but at any rate you'll want to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.630 
it but at any rate you'll want to
include<00:03:12.640> it<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.060> your<00:03:13.090> documentation<00:03:13.750> anyway

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
include it in your documentation anyway

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.839 
include it in your documentation anyway
but<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.970> test<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.450> out<00:03:16.890> fiio<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.130> arrow<00:03:18.310> it

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
but to test it out fiio the arrow it

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:27.280 
but to test it out fiio the arrow it
closes<00:03:19.180> door<00:03:19.870> opens<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:21.300> once<00:03:22.300> again

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.369 

very<00:03:27.950> simple<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.489> set<00:03:28.700> up<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.140> next<00:03:30.140> we<00:03:30.260> will

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
very simple to set up and next we will

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.800 
very simple to set up and next we will
be<00:03:30.469> looking<00:03:30.620> at<00:03:30.920> these<00:03:31.040> SSP<00:03:31.730> SMP<00:03:32.359> detectors

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
be looking at these SSP SMP detectors

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.780 
be looking at these SSP SMP detectors
and<00:03:33.079> I'll<00:03:33.170> be<00:03:33.379> right<00:03:33.560> back<00:03:33.709> in<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:33.950> moment<00:03:34.129> now

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
and I'll be right back in a moment now

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.000 
and I'll be right back in a moment now
if<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.750> just<00:03:36.049> want<00:03:36.319> to<00:03:36.379> look<00:03:36.650> at<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:36.829> layout

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
if you just want to look at the layout

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.289 
if you just want to look at the layout
right<00:03:37.310> now<00:03:37.489> this<00:03:37.700> would<00:03:37.819> be<00:03:37.969> a<00:03:38.000> good<00:03:38.120> time<00:03:38.239> to

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
right now this would be a good time to

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.630 
right now this would be a good time to
pause<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.689> video<00:03:38.780> otherwise<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:40.219> will<00:03:40.280> be

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.059 
be a bit boring but otherwise you can
just<00:03:50.090> listen<00:03:50.480> this<00:03:50.900> whole<00:03:51.290> thing<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.680> in<00:03:51.829> one

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
just listen this whole thing is in one

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.759 
just listen this whole thing is in one
layer<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.579> it's<00:03:53.329> rather<00:03:53.780> compact<00:03:54.379> even

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
layer and it's rather compact even

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.170 
layer and it's rather compact even
though<00:03:54.889> it's<00:03:55.069> laid<00:03:55.340> out<00:03:55.370> like<00:03:55.519> that<00:03:55.909> and<00:03:55.970> I

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
though it's laid out like that and I

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.059 
though it's laid out like that and I
like<00:03:56.420> it<00:03:56.569> because<00:03:56.689> it<00:03:57.019> makes<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.769> really<00:03:57.950> easy

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
like it because it makes it really easy

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.000 
like it because it makes it really easy
to<00:03:58.370> see<00:03:58.519> what's<00:03:58.700> going<00:03:58.849> on<00:03:59.709> basically<00:04:00.709> first

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
to see what's going on basically first

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.550 
to see what's going on basically first
we<00:04:01.220> want<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.519> save<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.689> value<00:04:03.109> whenever

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
we want to save the value whenever

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.170 
we want to save the value whenever
someone<00:04:03.980> steps<00:04:04.250> over<00:04:04.519> our<00:04:04.639> pressure<00:04:04.849> plate

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
someone steps over our pressure plate

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.179 
someone steps over our pressure plate
that<00:04:05.599> makes<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:06.049> bit<00:04:06.230> more<00:04:06.409> transparent<00:04:07.099> to

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
that makes it a bit more transparent to

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.500 
that makes it a bit more transparent to
the<00:04:07.220> user<00:04:07.310> they<00:04:07.700> can<00:04:07.819> just<00:04:07.970> walk<00:04:08.180> over<00:04:08.209> the

the top or middle or whatever and
activates<00:04:36.349> it<00:04:36.530> but<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.490> might<00:04:37.729> fail<00:04:37.970> some<00:04:38.270> day

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
activates it but it might fail some day

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.810 
activates it but it might fail some day
and<00:04:38.659> then<00:04:39.409> that<00:04:39.590> value<00:04:39.919> is<00:04:40.070> saved<00:04:40.310> just<00:04:40.639> in

be<00:05:37.069> opening<00:05:37.370> so<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.819> fast<00:05:38.060> player<00:05:38.449> might<00:05:38.779> walk

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
be opening so the fast player might walk

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.629 
be opening so the fast player might walk
through<00:05:39.409> the<00:05:39.529> wrong<00:05:39.680> door<00:05:39.740> before<00:05:40.460> it's

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
through the wrong door before it's

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.629 
through the wrong door before it's
finished<00:05:40.849> and<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:42.159> prevents<00:05:43.159> that<00:05:43.310> as<00:05:43.430> long

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
finished and that prevents that as long

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.040 
finished and that prevents that as long
as<00:05:43.759> you<00:05:43.849> have<00:05:44.029> enough<00:05:44.360> particles<00:05:44.719> being

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
as you have enough particles being

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.100 
as you have enough particles being
generated<00:05:45.469> and<00:05:45.879> then<00:05:46.879> on<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.360> left<00:05:47.599> here<00:05:47.839> we

generated and then on the left here we

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.409

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.959 
will always be active and just
demonstrate<00:06:17.120> we<00:06:17.300> can<00:06:17.569> jump<00:06:18.169> down<00:06:18.319> here<00:06:18.680> and

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
demonstrate we can jump down here and

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.519 
demonstrate we can jump down here and
step<00:06:19.969> on<00:06:20.089> our<00:06:20.210> pad

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:21.529 
step on our pad

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:23.529 
step on our pad
and<00:06:21.619> look<00:06:22.189> at<00:06:22.279> the<00:06:22.369> middle<00:06:22.609> there<00:06:23.149> you<00:06:23.239> go<00:06:23.359> it

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
and look at the middle there you go it

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.359 
and look at the middle there you go it
lit<00:06:23.719> up<00:06:23.749> and<00:06:24.019> then<00:06:24.559> the<00:06:24.829> right<00:06:24.979> side<00:06:25.219> of<00:06:25.309> the

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:25.369 
lit up and then the right side of the

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:27.969 
lit up and then the right side of the
door<00:06:25.489> lit<00:06:25.729> up<00:06:25.849> and<00:06:26.569> if<00:06:26.779> we<00:06:26.839> were<00:06:27.079> to<00:06:27.139> take<00:06:27.739> this

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
door lit up and if we were to take this

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:33.489 
door lit up and if we were to take this
here<00:06:28.249> off<00:06:28.429> and<00:06:29.829> reset<00:06:30.829> the<00:06:31.839> system<00:06:32.839> for<00:06:33.259> error

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:33.499 
here off and reset the system for error

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.619 
here off and reset the system for error
detection<00:06:33.589> we<00:06:34.549> can<00:06:34.699> see<00:06:34.879> that<00:06:35.089> if<00:06:35.269> we<00:06:35.509> were

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:35.629 
detection we can see that if we were

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.689 
detection we can see that if we were
playing<00:06:35.959> SMP<00:06:36.619> and<00:06:36.829> the<00:06:36.919> left<00:06:37.159> side<00:06:37.399> the<00:06:37.549> door

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
playing SMP and the left side the door

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:39.669 
playing SMP and the left side the door
would<00:06:37.879> be<00:06:37.909> open<00:06:38.059> because<00:06:38.509> our<00:06:39.139> detector

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:39.679 
would be open because our detector

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:42.189 
would be open because our detector
hasn't<00:06:39.979> gone<00:06:40.039> off<00:06:40.099> and<00:06:40.579> if<00:06:41.329> we<00:06:41.539> were<00:06:41.659> to<00:06:41.719> step

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
hasn't gone off and if we were to step

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:48.309 
hasn't gone off and if we were to step
on<00:06:42.379> this<00:06:42.819> the<00:06:43.819> would<00:06:44.449> be<00:06:44.899> the<00:06:45.159> SSP<00:06:46.159> door<00:06:47.199> and<00:06:48.199> we

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
on this the would be the SSP door and we

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.200 
on this the would be the SSP door and we
can<00:06:48.439> just<00:06:48.559> reset<00:06:49.129> that<00:06:49.279> again

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
can just reset that again

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.659 
can just reset that again
I<00:06:51.500> always<00:06:52.500> like<00:06:52.680> to<00:06:52.830> include<00:06:53.039> these<00:06:53.280> buttons

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
I always like to include these buttons

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:55.610 
I always like to include these buttons
as<00:06:53.850> well<00:06:54.120> so<00:06:54.600> that<00:06:54.750> you<00:06:54.840> can<00:06:54.990> reset<00:06:55.289> it<00:06:55.350> very

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
as well so that you can reset it very

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.340 
as well so that you can reset it very
easily<00:06:55.770> so<00:06:56.389> again<00:06:57.389> that's<00:06:57.539> pretty<00:06:57.840> much<00:06:57.990> it<00:06:58.050> I

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
easily so again that's pretty much it I

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.490 
easily so again that's pretty much it I
will<00:06:58.889> include<00:06:59.580> a<00:06:59.789> link<00:06:59.819> to<00:07:00.270> download<00:07:00.900> this<00:07:01.229> in
