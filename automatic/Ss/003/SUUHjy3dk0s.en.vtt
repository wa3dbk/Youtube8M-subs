similar<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.170> almost<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> same<00:01:56.100> but

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
similar to that almost the same but

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.850 
similar to that almost the same but
there<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.390> quite<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> bit<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:58.020> differences<00:01:58.680> if

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
there are quite a bit of differences if

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.969 
there are quite a bit of differences if
you<00:01:59.250> notice<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.270> end<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:01.020> think<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.710> believe

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
you notice on this end I think I believe

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.530 
you notice on this end I think I believe
this<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.790> SD<00:02:03.780> card<00:02:04.320> micro<00:02:04.500> SD<00:02:04.829> card<00:02:05.009> slot

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
this is the SD card micro SD card slot

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.730 
this is the SD card micro SD card slot
volume<00:02:06.540> rockers<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> power<00:02:07.409> button<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
volume rockers and the power button the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.070 
volume rockers and the power button the
power<00:02:07.979> button<00:02:08.340> has<00:02:08.550> been<00:02:08.580> moved<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.899> One

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
power button has been moved on the One

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.530 
power button has been moved on the One
m8<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.530> was<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.340> top<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.209> they

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
m8 it was here at the top but now they

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.770 
m8 it was here at the top but now they
have

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
have

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.020 
have
moved<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.050> over<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.340> again<00:02:14.610> we<00:02:14.850> have

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
moved it over here and again we have

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.570 
moved it over here and again we have
boomsound<00:02:15.569> dual<00:02:16.140> speakers<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:16.770> now<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.400> even

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
boomsound dual speakers but now we even

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.280 
boomsound dual speakers but now we even
have<00:02:17.700> virtual<00:02:18.360> surround<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.140> is

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
have virtual surround so that is

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.380 
have virtual surround so that is
interesting<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.400> biggest<00:02:20.760> change<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.209> would

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
interesting the biggest change I would

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.410 
interesting the biggest change I would
say<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.650> rail<00:02:22.860> facing<00:02:23.250> camera<00:02:23.640> gone<00:02:24.209> is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
say is the rail facing camera gone is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.510 
say is the rail facing camera gone is
the<00:02:24.540> ultra<00:02:24.870> pixel<00:02:25.050> camera<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.490> a

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
the ultra pixel camera now we have a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.300 
the ultra pixel camera now we have a
twenty<00:02:27.150> point<00:02:27.330> seven<00:02:27.780> megapixel<00:02:28.410> camera<00:02:28.830> with

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
twenty point seven megapixel camera with

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.940 
twenty point seven megapixel camera with
again<00:02:29.550> dual<00:02:29.819> LED<00:02:30.150> flash<00:02:30.410> we<00:02:31.410> still<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.860> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
again dual LED flash we still have the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.559 
again dual LED flash we still have the
ultra<00:02:32.160> pixel<00:02:32.310> camera<00:02:32.580> but<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.000> has<00:02:33.150> been<00:02:33.300> moved

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
ultra pixel camera but it has been moved

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.559 
ultra pixel camera but it has been moved
here<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.160> front-facing<00:02:35.580> camera<00:02:36.090> so

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
here and it's a front-facing camera so

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.040 
here and it's a front-facing camera so
let's<00:02:37.410> try<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.830> power<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:38.700> device<00:02:39.000> again

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
let's try to power on this device again

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.100 
let's try to power on this device again
the<00:02:40.830> build<00:02:41.069> quality<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.700> amazing<00:02:42.540> again<00:02:42.810> that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
the build quality is amazing again that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.130 
the build quality is amazing again that
was<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.410> same<00:02:43.620> with<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.830> One<00:02:44.700> m8<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.450> that's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
was the same with the One m8 and that's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.720 
was the same with the One m8 and that's
the<00:02:46.320> same<00:02:46.440> with<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.800> one<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.280> let's<00:02:47.459> try<00:02:47.700> to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
the same with this one so let's try to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.630 
the same with this one so let's try to
power<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.590> hope<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.040> has<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> charge

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
power this on and I hope it has a charge

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.509 
power this on and I hope it has a charge
yeah<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.510> gave<00:02:51.720> me<00:02:51.840> haptic<00:02:52.290> feedback

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
yeah it gave me haptic feedback

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.740 
yeah it gave me haptic feedback
regarding<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.850> screen<00:02:54.090> size<00:02:54.300> it's<00:02:54.510> still<00:02:54.720> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
regarding the screen size it's still a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.740 
regarding the screen size it's still a
5-inch<00:02:55.350> 1080p<00:02:55.650> screen<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:56.970> comes<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> ppi

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
actually we have nothing we just have

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.640 
actually we have nothing we just have
our<00:03:16.920> blaster<00:03:17.519> here<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.110> we<00:03:19.110> have<00:03:19.260> one<00:03:19.500> slot

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
our blaster here and we have one slot

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.740 
our blaster here and we have one slot
over<00:03:19.980> here<00:03:20.160> for<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.430> micro<00:03:20.730> SD<00:03:21.000> card<00:03:21.239> the

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
over here for the micro SD card the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.900 
over here for the micro SD card the
volume<00:03:22.079> rockers<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.860> power<00:03:23.190> on/off<00:03:23.430> button

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
volume rockers the power on/off button

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.150 
volume rockers the power on/off button
and<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.959> bottom<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.590> 3.5<00:03:26.100> mm

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
and on the bottom we have the 3.5 mm

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.729 
and on the bottom we have the 3.5 mm
headphone<00:03:26.519> jack<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.630> microUSB<00:03:27.930> slot<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.650> we

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
headphone jack the microUSB slot that we

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.740 
headphone jack the microUSB slot that we
use<00:03:28.860> for<00:03:28.980> charging<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.459> device<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.000> on<00:03:30.540> this

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
use for charging this device and on this

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.170 
use for charging this device and on this
end<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.350> believe<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.519> slot<00:03:32.880> for<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
end I believe this is a slot for the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.640 
end I believe this is a slot for the
nano<00:03:33.989> SIM<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:35.519> has<00:03:36.180> Boonton<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.410> let's

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
nano SIM and it has Boonton so let's

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.970 
nano SIM and it has Boonton so let's
quickly<00:03:38.010> just<00:03:38.130> set<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:39.000> up<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:40.079> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
quickly just set this up and it's the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.680 
quickly just set this up and it's the
setting<00:03:41.400> up<00:03:41.549> thing<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.150> should<00:03:42.329> be<00:03:42.420> done<00:03:42.540> in

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
setting up thing so it should be done in

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.090

and<00:06:03.530> I'll<00:06:04.530> just<00:06:04.770> disagree<00:06:05.219> I<00:06:05.250> don't<00:06:05.400> know<00:06:05.460> why

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
and I'll just disagree I don't know why

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.520 
and I'll just disagree I don't know why
that<00:06:05.759> came<00:06:06.090> anyways<00:06:06.599> this<00:06:07.020> is<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:07.229> blinkfeed

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
that came anyways this is the blinkfeed

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.430 
that came anyways this is the blinkfeed
and<00:06:07.979> let's<00:06:08.940> also<00:06:09.360> quickly<00:06:09.810> look<00:06:10.110> at<00:06:10.259> the

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
and let's also quickly look at the

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.260 
and let's also quickly look at the
camera<00:06:11.219> on<00:06:11.340> this<00:06:11.430> device<00:06:11.729> the<00:06:11.909> rear<00:06:12.060> facing

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
camera on this device the rear facing

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.779 
camera on this device the rear facing
camera<00:06:12.690> is<00:06:12.840> a<00:06:12.900> 20<00:06:13.349> megapixel<00:06:13.500> shooter<00:06:13.889> so

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
camera is a 20 megapixel shooter so

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.620 
camera is a 20 megapixel shooter so
let's<00:06:15.030> fire<00:06:15.479> that<00:06:15.780> up<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:17.030> let<00:06:18.030> me<00:06:18.060> bring<00:06:18.570> some

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
let's fire that up and let me bring some

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.909 
let's fire that up and let me bring some
objects<00:06:19.229> over<00:06:19.469> here<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:20.750> we<00:06:21.750> can<00:06:22.380> swipe<00:06:22.680> up

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
objects over here and we can swipe up

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.129 
objects over here and we can swipe up
and<00:06:23.039> down<00:06:23.159> to<00:06:23.280> change<00:06:23.909> the<00:06:24.090> cameras<00:06:24.690> for

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
and down to change the cameras for

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.390 
and down to change the cameras for
example<00:06:26.870> you<00:06:27.870> can<00:06:28.050> yeah<00:06:28.259> use<00:06:28.740> this<00:06:29.009> for<00:06:29.280> the

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
example you can yeah use this for the

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.029 
example you can yeah use this for the
selfies<00:06:29.880> as<00:06:30.180> you<00:06:30.780> can<00:06:30.960> see<00:06:31.169> this<00:06:31.620> is<00:06:31.710> the<00:06:31.800> ultra

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
selfies as you can see this is the ultra

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.110 
selfies as you can see this is the ultra
pixel<00:06:32.190> and<00:06:32.580> we<00:06:33.120> can<00:06:33.240> go<00:06:33.449> back<00:06:33.750> and<00:06:34.760> we<00:06:35.760> have<00:06:35.940> the

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
pixel and we can go back and we have the

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.840 
pixel and we can go back and we have the
tap<00:06:36.360> to<00:06:36.570> focus

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
tap to focus

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.270 
tap to focus
let's<00:06:38.840> use<00:06:39.170> it<00:06:39.200> without<00:06:39.530> the<00:06:39.710> tap<00:06:39.980> to<00:06:40.130> focus

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
let's use it without the tap to focus

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.600 
let's use it without the tap to focus
and<00:06:41.290> it's<00:06:42.290> not<00:06:42.470> making<00:06:42.710> any<00:06:42.950> shutter<00:06:43.310> noise

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
and it's not making any shutter noise

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.640 
and it's not making any shutter noise
and<00:06:44.030> it<00:06:44.450> says<00:06:44.630> we<00:06:44.780> can<00:06:44.810> use<00:06:44.960> though<00:06:45.260> even<00:06:45.440> the

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
and it says we can use though even the

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.130 
and it says we can use though even the
volume<00:06:45.980> key<00:06:46.160> to<00:06:46.580> capture<00:06:47.120> the<00:06:47.690> photograph

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:48.140 
volume key to capture the photograph

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.830 
volume key to capture the photograph
slits<00:06:48.500> we<00:06:49.340> take<00:06:49.670> one<00:06:49.880> more<00:06:50.030> snap<00:06:50.270> of<00:06:50.480> this<00:06:50.660> one

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
slits we take one more snap of this one

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.220 
slits we take one more snap of this one
and<00:06:51.610> there<00:06:52.610> is<00:06:52.640> a<00:06:52.790> lot<00:06:53.030> of<00:06:53.150> controversy<00:06:53.540> about

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.230 
and there is a lot of controversy about

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.070 
and there is a lot of controversy about
the<00:06:54.440> camera<00:06:54.860> on<00:06:54.980> this<00:06:55.220> so<00:06:56.060> I<00:06:56.210> will<00:06:56.540> be<00:06:56.690> testing

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
the camera on this so I will be testing

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.490 
the camera on this so I will be testing
the<00:06:57.380> camera<00:06:57.800> on<00:06:57.920> this<00:06:58.130> device<00:06:58.490> a<00:06:59.390> lot<00:07:00.140> more

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
the camera on this device a lot more

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.710 
the camera on this device a lot more
before<00:07:00.740> I<00:07:00.950> give<00:07:01.430> a<00:07:01.460> verdict<00:07:01.850> how's<00:07:02.030> the<00:07:02.360> camera

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 
before I give a verdict how's the camera

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.700 
before I give a verdict how's the camera
but<00:07:03.170> again<00:07:03.500> it's<00:07:03.980> just<00:07:04.190> about<00:07:04.790> that<00:07:05.590> hardly<00:07:06.590> a

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
but again it's just about that hardly a

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.260 
but again it's just about that hardly a
minute<00:07:07.160> or<00:07:07.280> so<00:07:07.430> since<00:07:07.610> we<00:07:07.760> were<00:07:07.880> using<00:07:08.060> the

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
minute or so since we were using the

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.200 
minute or so since we were using the
camera<00:07:08.450> and<00:07:08.810> already<00:07:09.530> the<00:07:09.680> back<00:07:09.950> I<00:07:10.280> can<00:07:10.820> feel<00:07:11.030> a

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
camera and already the back I can feel a

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.590 
camera and already the back I can feel a
little<00:07:11.360> bit<00:07:11.540> of<00:07:11.980> heat<00:07:13.180> so<00:07:14.180> it<00:07:14.420> will<00:07:14.510> be

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:14.600 
little bit of heat so it will be

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.480 
little bit of heat so it will be
interesting<00:07:14.810> to<00:07:15.020> see<00:07:15.110> how<00:07:15.470> this<00:07:15.770> device<00:07:16.070> fares

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
interesting to see how this device fares
