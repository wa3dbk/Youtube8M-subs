00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 Hello to you Denis healthier mountain 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.410
 sec elves are you today the story of 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:13.320
 camcorder accessories 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.870
 action camera start with the fact that the action 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.060
 I shoot about 80 camera 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.560
 percent of all frames for your channel 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.230
 use mainly camera 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.930
 garmin virb elif presented it to me 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 before the Baikal campaign company 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.920
 garmin 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.640
 after I lost my previous 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.440
 garmin now accessories 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.660
 the most important accessory that needs it 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 additional 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.640
 extra camera battery even though 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 you have no fixings at all 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.170
 nothing then i recommend extra 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.809
 battery to take in any way because the most 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.890
 interesting shootings start exactly then 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.559
 when you have a main battery 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.629
 the next most important thing is 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.970
 tripod adapter 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.580
 tripod need anyway for any 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.920
 camcorder but if it is not stationary 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.540
 mounted on the staff why me 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.020
 some small ones are going on 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.770
 troubles in this campaign 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.920
 screwed up the SLR just broke 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.730
 Adapter to the article and tripods I 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.640
 I recommend small and light 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.550
 cheap well there for 300-600 rubles from 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.670
 supermarkets and so why vlogger 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.790
 need a tripod for 600 rubas because 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.790
 that he is easy because if you him 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.800
 break you will not feel sorry for him because 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.280
 that you can use it as 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.190
 gigantic 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.190
 barbell spreading all the legs like this 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.920
 often sing a place 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.080
 strain their height is usually there 106 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.850
 centimeters 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.700
 the usual way of adding them is possible 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 use both as monopod and as tripod 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.110
 they will break you anyway 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.540
 crumble spoils I messed up already 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.150
 several but the price allows them regularly 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.000
 change further the important thing is this 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.900
 here's a light little monopod along with 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.730
 it easily attaches the camera 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.700
 puts in a big pocket in 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.000
 any handbag either attached to 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.370
 Backpack strap a lot of filming I'm doing 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.620
 from monopod 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.440
 while using as a monopod 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.810
 either that's a tripod that told 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.090
 for example the whole Lycian trail just 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.600
 shot with a tripod that's so light 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.270
 monopod 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.700
 may be in the subject where the state you 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.739
 cannot fasten on yourself for example during 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.620
 time there is a ski gurney very 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.750
 I did a lot of shots exactly on such 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.690
 monopod for example in a cave it is more 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.270
 is appropriate than a big tripod on it 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.500
 probably mandatory things for shooting 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.240
 ends are coming already bonus bonus 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.630
 mount 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.760
 This is a mount on my head 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.670
 see she is here on a helmet basically she 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.950
 can wear a hat 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.920
 glue pad but since casco 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.960
 someone else's time someone else's helmet 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.970
 I can't glue the pad and I have to 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.240
 use here mount on head 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.610
 most people associate action 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.180
 the camera and not us mount on my head i 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.090
 I will say that not so much filming I do with 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.100
 heads most of it with a tripod 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:45.620
 with mono bureau will be the next thing else 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.550
 more rarely using and 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.800
 This wrist mount principle 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:57.110
 sometimes i use free when needed 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.540
 hands but wants well, somehow 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.730
 distribute and direct the camera there where 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.210
 you need to either make selfies but at the same time 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.240
 that hands were free then helps out 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.959
 fastening on the wrist and absolutely 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.950
 outlandish thing is mount on the chest i 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:19.359
 practically did not use and 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.370
 Well, well, it's hard to choose at all 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.680
 its moment is hard to find moments when we 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.480
 in the subject when she is needed when she 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.330
 convenient at least I do in my opinion 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.310
 nothing good with it took off 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.610
 these are the accessories 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.919
 Do not forget of course pro power bank if 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.280
 you are far away or planning 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.370
 long shooting because well spare 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.750
 You will gain extra battery but 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:54.860
 if you want to shoot there for a hike not 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.260
 know 10 hours or 20 hours of materials 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.700
 get to love you need power 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.710
 bank to power both the main and 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.599
 extra battery 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.169
 repeat by rating 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:13.979
 first buy a spare battery second 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.800
 tripod adapter third tripod 4 itself 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.569
 monopod 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.139
 fifth mount on the head but she 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:24.389
 often already included and after 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.599
 this is just all sorts of extra things 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:33.509
 fixing the ladies on the tubes of the bike on 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:34.650
 wrists on chest and so on immediately you 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.900
 I want to warn 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.110
 if you use not native 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:44.599
 Mounts what there is there well nouneym 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.150
 Chinese they are certainly cheaper 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.860
 certainly cheaper but you know what they are 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.580
 they break their first 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.180
 I lost exactly the garmin of camera 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:01.560
 due to breakage mounts lost and more 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:04.379
 did not find therefore either secure 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.389
 the camera here 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.490
 This camera has such a tail and I 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:13.860
 wear a carabiner now 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:16.199
 show here is such a carabiner but any 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.990
 small on a loop and you can 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.659
 secure for la tail so here 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:27.930
 then fasten it so it teaches breakage 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:30.139
 mounts are not lost either there 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.379
