00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.840
 disguised my poverty 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.640
 that gravel well dog bastard prove it 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.100
 we look for the complex 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.860

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.540
 that is who who bites the pillow and 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:10.780
 I think flat or almost 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.190

 the baths and where you know wind is 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.040
 a story 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.959
 summarize the water because I do not have so much 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.840

 they had 2 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.330

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.530
 do not be fooled 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.530
 to the spill 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.670
 d 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.670
 but nothing else touching 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.150
 they 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.739
 I liked 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.550
 Y 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.330

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:39.540

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.540
 loading for carla 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.819

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.819

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.470

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.889

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.889

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.289
 good 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:12.660
 Too much the case they lost 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:15.350
 and you may be surprised why 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.350
 comparison 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.210
 therefore I when I saw manuel 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.099
 I said to bato opening base to this 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:30.009
 first second but since I saw that 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.289
 he started to give good planet that does not 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.869
 was recorded but as to what 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.270
 I just played his first song I was 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:39.430
 to embrace him the net and a half as well as 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.879
 almost going to cry I do not cry because this 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.249
 fucker was grabbing me to fight but see 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:48.339
 if it made me very emotional to meet a 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.770
 we go external with that talent and more 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:53.430
 apart since the whole family treated us 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.430
 little mother 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:00.249
 apart from everything we were not 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:04.569
 toreando with these the boys and also 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:07.439
 when his parents could win 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:10.319
 macías readers witnesses that he was 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:12.909
 super shielded with the instrument 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.669
 there had never been one of those and what 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:18.639

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:31.050
 I was cataloged in the mess 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:33.320

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.150
