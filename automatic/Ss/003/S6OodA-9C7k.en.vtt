00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
and you know that's just something I

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.720 
and you know that's just something I
kind<00:02:33.740> of<00:02:33.770> wanted<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.100> talk<00:02:34.280> about<00:02:34.310> because

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
kind of wanted to talk about because

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.250 
kind of wanted to talk about because
it's<00:02:35.150> something<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.600> little<00:02:35.780> bit<00:02:35.960> out<00:02:36.080> of<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.800 
you think about it the tactical
insurgent<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.670> reason<00:02:40.910> why<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.060> was<00:02:41.390> using<00:02:41.600> it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
insurgent the reason why I was using it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.870 
insurgent the reason why I was using it
was<00:02:42.050> because<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.710> know<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.310> got<00:02:43.460> me<00:02:43.610> right<00:02:43.820> up

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
was because you know it got me right up

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.400 
was because you know it got me right up
back<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.360> action<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.930> help<00:02:45.080> me<00:02:45.200> keep<00:02:45.350> my

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
back in the action and I help me keep my

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.990 
back in the action and I help me keep my
momentum<00:02:45.680> going<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.310> lot<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.490> times<00:02:46.730> if<00:02:46.880> i'll

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
momentum going a lot of times if i'll

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.220 
momentum going a lot of times if i'll
end<00:02:47.150> up<00:02:47.240> dying<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.600> know<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.780> have<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.990> spawn

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
end up dying you know you have to spawn

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.630 
end up dying you know you have to spawn
all<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.590> way<00:02:48.680> back<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.100> your<00:02:49.190> spawn<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.550> have

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
all the way back in your spawn you have

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.790 
all the way back in your spawn you have
to<00:02:49.760> run<00:02:49.910> all<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.270> way<00:02:50.300> across<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.780> map<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.230> by

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
to run all the way across the map and by

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.020 
to run all the way across the map and by
that<00:02:51.920> time<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.310> could<00:02:52.430> lose<00:02:52.640> some<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.850> your

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
that time you could lose some of your

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.610 
that time you could lose some of your
momentum<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:53.840> way<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:54.080> can<00:02:54.350> just<00:02:54.500> get

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
momentum but this way you can just get

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.170 
momentum but this way you can just get
right<00:02:54.920> back<00:02:55.070> up<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.490> enemy's<00:02:55.730> face<00:02:55.910> and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
right back up in the enemy's face and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.030 
right back up in the enemy's face and
just<00:02:56.300> tear<00:02:56.450> them<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.630> pieces<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.410> that's<00:02:57.950> what

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
just tear them to pieces and that's what

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.500 
just tear them to pieces and that's what
i<00:02:58.100> did<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.520> gameplay<00:02:58.730> man<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.240> it<00:02:59.330> just

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
i did in this gameplay man and it just

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.120 
i did in this gameplay man and it just
hopes<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.020> much<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.500> i<00:03:00.530> wanted<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:00.920> point<00:03:01.040> that

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
hopes so much so i wanted to point that

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.280 
hopes so much so i wanted to point that
out<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.520> guys<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.970> also<00:03:02.780> if<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.050> think

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
out to you guys and also if you think

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.930 
out to you guys and also if you think
about<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.560> if<00:03:03.800> you<00:03:03.920> are<00:03:03.950> spawning<00:03:04.430> in<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.730> back

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
about it if you are spawning in the back

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.580 
about it if you are spawning in the back
of<00:03:05.150> your<00:03:05.240> spawn<00:03:05.540> you're<00:03:06.050> gonna<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.350> run

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
of your spawn you're gonna have to run

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.380 
of your spawn you're gonna have to run
all<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.100> way<00:03:07.130> across<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.520> map<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.150> you're

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
all the way across the map and you're

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.420 
all the way across the map and you're
gonna<00:03:08.480> have<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.900> try<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.200> avoid<00:03:09.770> not<00:03:10.160> getting

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
gonna have to try to avoid not getting

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.830 
gonna have to try to avoid not getting
killed<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.850> if<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.180> think<00:03:11.390> about<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.630> the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
killed and if you think about it the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.030 
killed and if you think about it the
middle<00:03:12.080> of<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.200> map<00:03:12.380> that's<00:03:12.560> probably<00:03:12.860> one<00:03:13.010> of

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
middle of the map that's probably one of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.730 
middle of the map that's probably one of
the<00:03:13.160> most<00:03:13.250> dangerous<00:03:13.820> places<00:03:14.240> to<00:03:14.630> be<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.110> you

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
the most dangerous places to be and you

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.170 
the most dangerous places to be and you
guys<00:03:15.860> can<00:03:16.070> see<00:03:16.100> like<00:03:16.340> right<00:03:16.490> here<00:03:16.700> i<00:03:16.730> spawn

have to go across mill the map and risk
dying<00:03:22.370> or<00:03:22.610> whatever<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:23.090> helped<00:03:23.450> out<00:03:23.540> a

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
dying or whatever it just helped out a

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.900 
dying or whatever it just helped out a
lot<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.410> just<00:03:24.830> want<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.040> guys<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.460> go<00:03:25.550> on<00:03:25.700> and

try it out the tactical insertion

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.620 
try it out the tactical insertion
actually<00:03:28.220> was<00:03:28.520> very<00:03:28.850> beneficial<00:03:29.060> in<00:03:29.540> this

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
actually was very beneficial in this

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.330 
actually was very beneficial in this
gameplay<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.110> thought<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:30.890> might<00:03:31.070> just<00:03:31.220> mention

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
gameplay so thought I might just mention

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.710 
gameplay so thought I might just mention
that<00:03:31.640> but<00:03:31.820> I'm<00:03:31.910> actually<00:03:32.030> gonna<00:03:32.270> throw<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.570> a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
that but I'm actually gonna throw on a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.480 
that but I'm actually gonna throw on a
song<00:03:32.930> here<00:03:33.140> because<00:03:33.500> there's<00:03:33.980> actually<00:03:34.460> a

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
song here because there's actually a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.850 
song here because there's actually a
really<00:03:34.910> long<00:03:35.390> gameplay<00:03:35.990> considering<00:03:36.650> i<00:03:36.680> can

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
really long gameplay considering i can

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.620 
really long gameplay considering i can
edit<00:03:37.070> it<00:03:37.250> much<00:03:37.460> because<00:03:37.670> there<00:03:38.090> was<00:03:38.210> already

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
edit it much because there was already

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.360 
edit it much because there was already
too<00:03:38.750> much<00:03:38.900> fast<00:03:39.170> paced<00:03:39.440> that's<00:03:39.740> going<00:03:40.010> on<00:03:40.100> I

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
too much fast paced that's going on I

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.830 
too much fast paced that's going on I
didn't<00:03:40.850> want<00:03:40.910> to<00:03:41.060> edit<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.330> just<00:03:41.600> wanted<00:03:41.810> to

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840
