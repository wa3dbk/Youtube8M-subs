00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.549
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.720
 dvd criticism and you do not know love 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.370
 animated film once more time 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.230
 not to talk about one unfortunately 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.550
 to the cinema start and to the home entertainment 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.590
 I have missed release now 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.049
 mag picks me up and with it 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.029
 Today, it's about an alley 3 escape 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.039
 through europe year by year ten 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.880
 millions of animals in their home 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.510
 back some can do that better than 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.510
 other 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.559
 i said moment this is not new york 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.480
 but how should we get through europe 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.809
 without attracting attention stupidly to the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.809
 Life 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.120
 the poor little animals now get it 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.120
 to do with me 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.400
 Thank you, we'll get off at the next stop 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:13.670
 we want can return to their america 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:25.400
 with in the train may drive users but 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:27.740
 we are from the circus do not tell us yours 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.600
 now this autumn and home too 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:38.390
 come we allow ourselves to think of something that 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:41.659
 everything is sagging house no 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.590
 Do everything you need to do 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.590
 to come back home 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.920
 that was well worth the price 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.970
 You could run but I'm wrong 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.240
 Do not you make car on schedule? 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.619
 drive 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.619
 pinguino people that 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:18.129
 dreamworks madagascar three escape europe 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.129
 in 3d this is explained first grade 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.000
 she has ever told her that 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.000
 You look like a supermodel 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.299
 wow what a wine 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.840
 madagascar three escape through europe 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.629
 original madagascar frejus most wanted 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.280
 is from the year 2012 93 minutes is from 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.200
 6 years free and once more 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.599
 the story of alex the lion marty 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.849
 the zebra melman giraffes gloria dem 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.590
 nilpferd dean africa stuck and the 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.359
 penguins are measuring themselves to monte 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.859
 carlo dropped off the swan they did 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.079
 catch up with that I think so right 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.120
 and go on their own way 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.010
 monte carlo as everyone is reunited 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.500
 you have to get acquainted with chantal 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.720
 dubois make a keeper with 100 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.459
 percent success rate and unfortunately a lot 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.139
 to superhuman abilities she can 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.579
 run through walls and all sorts of things 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.409
 jumps and falls survive a lot 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.970
 it is a pity the film does not do well what she does 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.680
 almost a kind of superhero character 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.659
 At least that's what makes hunting fun 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.189
 animals that once the casinos in 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.599
 monte carlo have not lost the 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.489
 of course try on the flight 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.989
 somehow back home to new 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.060
 york to arrive and close 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.189
 thereby a wanderzirkus one led 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.720
 from a tiger called vitali and thus 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.359
 we come a variety of new animals 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.189
 and so are melvin &amp; co 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.299
 actually like to circus though that 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.980
 not true in the future 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.810
 of course some conflicts with it 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.549
 will bring and with that is my gasquet 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.639
 3 a hartz across europe in the 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.260
 animation style and unfortunately if I am 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.780
 honestly I am the weakest of the three 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.819
 Parts are not always higher 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.250
 bigger faster really better 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.310
 and for that madagascar 3 is unfortunately god 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.319
 one of the examples par excellence man 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.030
 has a lot of gags and a lot of chemistry 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.739
 which you had to share the first two 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.269
 to deal with and the second already 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.010
 worse than the first man had 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.049
 the figures always take their time 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.669
 Figures give more room for gags 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.139
 for moments to go for feelings that 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.239
 you have everything through action and has 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.449
 and ultimately chases is thus replaced 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.380
 the film only fast and thus pretty 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.970
 boring if I'm honest 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.590
 but towards the end when it's about 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.210
 the beauty of the circus goes and the 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.260
 Attractions of the show you get together 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.000
 can stand on his legs 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.590
 with great music , by the way 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.330
 contributed by Hans Zimmer 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.070
 then again really nice against 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.620
 But the end stays a little better over the 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.830
 Most of the 93 minutes stretch too much 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.050
 way too action-heavy and as well 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.849
 boring and with that the 93 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.740
 Minutes unfortunately just as easy as two 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.289
 hours and that does not have to be straight 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.219
 in the genre of animated film that for mine 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.569
 understanding that on average 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.949
 highest level 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.300
 you look at all animationsfilmer 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.580
 looks so come to the cinemas 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.289
 feldmann the gas plans so madagascar 3 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.909
 still pretty far down through there 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.409
 I was curious about your opinion so it went 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.119
 In any case, I'm curious 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.279
 if you bring a fourth part here 

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:03.020
 or if you leave it at that one now 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.219
 may be curious what information have 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.449
 also likes to write in the 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.619
 comments and your opinion 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.539
 I'm definitely interested in 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:10.669
 which your favorite track the throttle 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.809
 my figure is of course this too 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.429
 crazy what is that 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:15.619
 ferret because something was the whole thing 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:17.089
 time alone will move it sink too 

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:19.279
 again in the third part towards the end 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:20.719
 okay, that's what I think 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.459
 especially the guest three sometimes there is 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:24.319
 just not much to say if that 

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:25.789
 film does not give much so it's about it 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.189
 unfortunately sometimes that stays 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.529
 So the movie gets from me as 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.689
 animated film just five and a half 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.639
 out of 10 possible points that is still 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.529
 acceptable because it is crafted 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.629
 still, of course, neatly natural 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.459
 Unfortunately , all in all, only made 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.899
 three and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:43.580
 I find that very sad because I really 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.139
 animated film also love it 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.059
 well friends what should now look 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.469
 twitter and facebook by dvd critics 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.539
 Otherwise we want to talk about movies 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.399
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock at the latest a new one 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:56.830
 video and until then I hope you are 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.830
 Of course, tomorrow at 3 o'clock
