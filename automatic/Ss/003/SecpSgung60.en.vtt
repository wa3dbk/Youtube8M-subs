this is really going to open up our eyes
and<00:04:37.550> make<00:04:37.670> our<00:04:37.820> eyes<00:04:38.000> look<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.720> lot<00:04:38.900> bigger<00:04:39.110> and

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
and make our eyes look a lot bigger and

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.380 
and make our eyes look a lot bigger and
more<00:04:39.650> awake<00:04:39.950> now<00:04:40.250> we're<00:04:40.550> taking<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:40.970> liquid

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
more awake now we're taking a liquid

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.330 
more awake now we're taking a liquid
liner<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:41.930> we're<00:04:42.140> just<00:04:42.320> going<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.710> follow<00:04:42.950> the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
liner and we're just going to follow the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.160 
liner and we're just going to follow the
natural<00:04:43.550> curve<00:04:43.790> of<00:04:44.240> our<00:04:44.420> I<00:04:44.600> when<00:04:44.870> we're<00:04:45.020> going

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
natural curve of our I when we're going

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.950 
natural curve of our I when we're going
along<00:04:45.470> here<00:04:46.010> but<00:04:46.610> then<00:04:46.820> when<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.270> get<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.810> the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
along here but then when we get to the

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.680 
along here but then when we get to the
end<00:04:47.990> we're<00:04:48.740> going<00:04:48.890> to<00:04:49.010> flick<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.640> up<00:04:49.820> where<00:04:50.390> our

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
end we're going to flick it up where our

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.870 
end we're going to flick it up where our
crisp<00:04:51.320> I<00:04:51.590> shadow<00:04:51.950> line<00:04:52.250> is<00:04:52.460> from<00:04:52.610> where<00:04:52.790> the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
crisp I shadow line is from where the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.180 
crisp I shadow line is from where the
sticky<00:04:53.090> tape<00:04:53.180> was<00:04:53.600> enter<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.290> line<00:04:54.620> up<00:04:54.860> there

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
sticky tape was enter a line up there

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.620 
sticky tape was enter a line up there
and<00:04:55.460> then<00:04:55.760> we're<00:04:55.880> going<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.090> draw<00:04:56.300> another

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
and then we're going to draw another

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.510 
and then we're going to draw another
line<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:57.170> connects<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.710> line<00:04:57.890> we<00:04:58.070> just<00:04:58.250> drew

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
line that connects the line we just drew

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.940 
line that connects the line we just drew
at<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.820> top<00:04:59.210> and<00:04:59.390> also<00:05:00.020> where<00:05:00.350> we<00:05:00.530> just<00:05:00.770> drew

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
at the top and also where we just drew

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.560 
at the top and also where we just drew
the<00:05:01.100> line<00:05:01.310> there<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:01.820> we're<00:05:01.910> going<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.210> reline

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
the line there so we're going to reline

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.210 
the line there so we're going to reline
there<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:03.230> then<00:05:03.440> we're<00:05:03.530> going<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.830> just<00:05:03.950> fill

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
there and then we're going to just fill

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.920 
there and then we're going to just fill
it<00:05:04.340> in<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.730> it's<00:05:04.880> going<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.150> create<00:05:05.390> a<00:05:05.600> really

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
it in and it's going to create a really

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.410 
it in and it's going to create a really
beautiful<00:05:06.080> winged<00:05:06.710> effect<00:05:06.980> which<00:05:07.790> follows

eyeshadow really complemented it very
nicely<00:07:29.760> and<00:07:30.210> the<00:07:30.390> red<00:07:30.600> lips<00:07:30.870> just<00:07:31.050> created<00:07:31.500> the

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
nicely and the red lips just created the

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.800 
nicely and the red lips just created the
perfect<00:07:31.800> pop<00:07:32.280> of<00:07:32.310> color<00:07:32.730> and<00:07:32.970> so<00:07:33.210> that<00:07:33.420> is<00:07:33.630> the

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.810 
perfect pop of color and so that is the

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.540
