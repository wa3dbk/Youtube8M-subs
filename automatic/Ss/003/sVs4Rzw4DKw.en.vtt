00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
now let me just break this in which

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.560 
now let me just break this in which
route<00:00:45.899> places<00:00:46.320> sorry<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.370> um<00:00:47.640> okay

route places sorry about that um okay

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.420 
route places sorry about that um okay
now<00:00:48.750> let's<00:00:48.960> try<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:52.820> heck<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.420> here

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
now let's try the heck is going on here

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.170 
now let's try the heck is going on here
let's<00:00:56.430> try<00:00:56.610> again<00:00:56.730> ah<00:00:58.579> but<00:00:59.579> as<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.879> see

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
let's try again ah but as you can see

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:12.399 
let's try again ah but as you can see
it's<00:01:01.370> generates<00:01:02.370> pistons<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:04.159> push<00:01:05.159> them<00:01:05.400> up

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.350 

and<00:01:14.299> now<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.780> works<00:01:16.490> with<00:01:17.490> sticky<00:01:17.970> pistons

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and now this works with sticky pistons

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.670 
and now this works with sticky pistons
and<00:01:18.540> regular<00:01:19.530> pistons<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.810> these

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and regular pistons so if we get these

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
and regular pistons so if we get these
down<00:01:22.950> basically<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.790> pistons<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.240> want<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
down basically the pistons you want to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.630 
down basically the pistons you want to
duplicate<00:01:24.570> other<00:01:25.049> ones<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> top<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.159> we

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
duplicate other ones on the top so we

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.469 
duplicate other ones on the top so we
want<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.630> clear<00:01:27.900> nor<00:01:28.080> missiles<00:01:32.329> we<00:01:33.329> just

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
want to do clear nor missiles we just

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.969 
want to do clear nor missiles we just
put<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.689> there<00:01:33.840> now<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.470> only<00:01:34.619> works<00:01:34.829> with

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
put it there now this only works with

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.460 
put it there now this only works with
business<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:36.570> doesn't<00:01:36.840> work<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.079> anything

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
business it doesn't work with anything

they<00:02:06.119> will<00:02:06.240> keep<00:02:06.390> regenerating<00:02:06.689> Pistons

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
they will keep regenerating Pistons

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:20.770 
they will keep regenerating Pistons
forever<00:02:13.130> echoes<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.760> couldn't<00:02:15.630> chat<00:02:15.900> been

torches on top and then two more above

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.330 
torches on top and then two more above
here<00:03:47.319> to<00:03:48.280> wall<00:03:48.579> here<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.680> whatever<00:03:50.680> Pistons

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
here to wall here and whatever Pistons

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.030 
here to wall here and whatever Pistons
you<00:03:51.670> want<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.209> could<00:03:52.390> be<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.750> normal<00:03:53.260> or<00:03:53.620> a

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
you want it could be a normal or a

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.690 
you want it could be a normal or a
sticky<00:03:54.609> one<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:56.290> wooden<00:03:56.650> button<00:03:57.069> I<00:03:57.190> think

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
sticky one and a wooden button I think

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.199 
sticky one and a wooden button I think
the<00:03:58.209> wooden<00:03:58.480> button<00:03:58.840> is<00:04:00.090> actually<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.150> don't

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
the wooden button is actually I don't

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.990 
the wooden button is actually I don't
think<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:01.540> need<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.780> one<00:04:01.989> button<00:04:02.200> but<00:04:03.000> let's

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
think you need the one button but let's

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.090 
think you need the one button but let's
try<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.359> with<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.690> as<00:04:04.840> well<00:04:04.989> yeah<00:04:05.530> let's<00:04:05.829> see

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
try it with that as well yeah let's see

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.550 
try it with that as well yeah let's see
will<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.090> work<00:04:07.180> with<00:04:07.239> it<00:04:07.510> ok<00:04:07.959> let's<00:04:08.200> try<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.410> and

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
will it work with it ok let's try it and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.930 
will it work with it ok let's try it and
see<00:04:08.650> if<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.100> works<00:04:09.220> with<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.519> window<00:04:09.819> yep

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
see if it works with the window yep

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.069 
see if it works with the window yep
sometimes<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.239> does<00:04:13.389> put<00:04:13.569> you<00:04:13.600> out<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.870> start

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
sometimes it does put you out to start

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.310 
sometimes it does put you out to start
off<00:04:14.200> with<00:04:14.380> this<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.829> being<00:04:15.519> very<00:04:15.670> nice<00:04:16.079> ya<00:04:17.079> see

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
off with this is being very nice ya see

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.990 
off with this is being very nice ya see
it<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.680> does<00:04:17.919> work<00:04:18.100> with<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.370> one<00:04:18.579> with<00:04:18.970> the

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
it it does work with the one with the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.750 
it it does work with the one with the
number<00:04:19.690> with<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.289> normal<00:04:20.950> button<00:04:21.280> as<00:04:21.400> well<00:04:21.430> in

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
number with the normal button as well in

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.190 
number with the normal button as well in
fact<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:22.389> is<00:04:22.600> faster<00:04:23.260> so<00:04:27.960> sometimes<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.080> does

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
fact this is faster so sometimes it does

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.510 
fact this is faster so sometimes it does
bleach<00:04:29.380> out<00:04:29.530> though<00:04:29.740> it's<00:04:29.919> not<00:04:30.010> pushing<00:04:30.280> out

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
bleach out though it's not pushing out

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.820 
bleach out though it's not pushing out
this<00:04:31.060> that<00:04:31.419> much<00:04:31.570> this<00:04:32.139> time<00:04:32.380> though<00:04:32.590> it's

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
this that much this time though it's

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.670 
this that much this time though it's
weird<00:04:33.160> sometimes<00:04:33.789> it<00:04:34.330> will<00:04:34.570> push<00:04:35.260> this<00:04:35.440> block

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
weird sometimes it will push this block

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.230 
weird sometimes it will push this block
up<00:04:35.860> here<00:04:36.159> it'll<00:04:36.460> do<00:04:36.700> lots<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.030> lots<00:04:37.150> of
