00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:02.240
 so 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.750
 l ladder 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.970
 I want to make it profitable again for Groitzsch 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.949
 we have a stole 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.429
 we will see 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.429
 I made that by myself 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.609
 No, yes that was shown and although Dr 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.999
 20 years old asked four crews 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.990
 their members Aben 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.789
 how to choose 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.609
 Videos can be there 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.140
 he had always done it that way he shared the videos with Rattler 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.740
 divide tracks thus recorded with cord 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.000
 and then they just unloads the video for him then that is 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.110
 certainly high 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.929
 or 4 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.020
 almost four of them too 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.020
 and then uploaded it 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.930
 and here I have him I thought so well 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.620
 one percent so we can serve us now 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.540
 Windows Movie Maker with the design overheads worthwhile 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.260
 That's how I started it 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.740
 Regeneron stops at the laps and then easy 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.670
 and in the Austrian Morena 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.370
 so more accurate 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.990
 Sports Minister 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.950
 the samedi button 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.650
 up here 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.420
 and then we also go videos 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.420
 and add photos 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
 it was just beside it 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.630
 what here 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.150
 Baykal first world s 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.200
 to open 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.680
 the video works 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.550
 9 3 seconds 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.040
 I just like it shorter I just like it 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.940
 that's so 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.680
 we have 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.140
 4-victory by almost 150 square meters per year 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.560
 Post they could 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.880
 if we want to cut that again 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.090
 Aben 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.919
 Exactly we are doing it up here 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.189
 and go to edit 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.049
 then there's a backend that means sharing 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.539
 just click on it 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:21.449
 and then we shared that and we have a video here and while 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.809
 Williams demonstration made a video 2- 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.319
 that has primacom inserting their effect for example or so daniel 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.589
 withdraw 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.550
 and that's worth the effect site owner - is not that 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.899
 I'm doing simple 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:37.819
 right-click 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.259
 we got 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.269
 and then we have the fruit seconds 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.059
 so then we go back up here on the left to start page 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.119
 May started 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.639
 so that's the start page 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.639
 and around here now 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.539
 which I already have 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.849
 We have different settings 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.879
 the without you my custom settings 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.749
 I've already done all that 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.389
 to have 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.119
 we just go on it now so German is displayed that Juno 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.939
 create custom settings 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.339
 Here we go 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.829
 and around 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.869
 Walser if you are new 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.929
 and just do it now 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.139
 There is much praise here 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.589
 Why 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.729
 Yes 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:36.799
 their doors 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.939
 the door 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.949
 the girls 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.279
 the girls 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:44.339
 the 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.339
 bru um 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.299
 continue and listen 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.759
 Leave the chamber then he had the parents 82 times 27 percent 27 b 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.899
 The operators can quietly raise a bit 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:03.289
 in front of tens of thousands of Oberalp 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.289
 and lapwing the secondary 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.299
 The couch would be 108 MW 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.819
 Rovio minute 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.209
 also let theme with 30 frames 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.680
 To also leave the audio coding of the ATC one 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.109
 and just leave 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.219
 to save 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:25.880
 here Kirk the percent 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.880
 save the custom settings at Cham 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.909
 then he closes the whole 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.909
 We went to save it again on the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.629
 and then click here on our own set their job area white 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.719
 but of course that part about the young man to something 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.460
 wat Thomas Clack 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.460
 and then we'll change that now 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.129
 just times 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.009
 v continue 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.370
 May in the movie 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.080
 then 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.080
 Ducked pretty fast - Rees could hope 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.909
 all the program is so simple you can have received 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.620
 You should not have four authors from the program 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.259
 but Finland was lost and then cut to videos and blow dry 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:24.939
 no idea 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:26.539
 short attitude mail 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.879
 to save the movie on YouTube 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.650
 easier for me 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.650
 and then let's go was saying 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.650
 shut down 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.590
 the team around project manager Ulrich ig-sprecher that is not 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.920
 because I always go here 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.920
 Breakball continues there 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:51.139
 No I do not save it 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.139
 that means lead 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.719
 Brussels 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.559
 Not a good three years she is safe enough for my body 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:03.240
 actually completely off 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.469
 the quality 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:07.629
 all right, there is better 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.089
 but also 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:13.050
 very easily 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.099
 that was it from kidneys 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:18.810
 Percent locked Pareja and take a pleasant from 1 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:22.939
 a pleasant night or a pleasant day 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:24.899
 Euro per biker I'm out for you
