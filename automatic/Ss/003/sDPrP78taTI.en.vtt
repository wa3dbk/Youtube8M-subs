00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.530
 Mayor TV 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.419
 I have the new types of speakers 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.459
 from Scubapro 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.709
 who is already on the boat 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.949
 presented to the public this is about 700 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.939
 that according to Scubapro 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.529
 the new peak year in the 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.720
 neither family 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.980
 We want to test this shipping company right now in action 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.270
 and we have to do that 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.300
 Look for ideal conditions 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.320
 what a hell of a lot we really are Larissa thrown out here and 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.520
 there are way 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.470
 about 28 offered traces 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.210
 and off the Mexican coast 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.090
 and this little rock has been 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.150
 it's the rocker game again 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.300
 and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.630
 offer excellent conditions 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.030
 Year already through the second stage of the Sar 700 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.140
 a little bit more 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.520
 As already said, this plate is second stage from Swisttal 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 both the works and the housing 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.730
 I have to say visually very successful 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.560
 and how does Gruber know about impossible 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.840
 there is an adjusted screw 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.050
 Voigt limit the species resistance 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.640
 about the screwdrivers 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 because reconciling needs can adapt 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 in the year in combination with the first stage 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.180
 MK 25 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.090
 that's the samples 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.150
 High performance computer controlled stage by Scubapro 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.829
 about one 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.820
 BW steered 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.840
 has 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.270
 were guests 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.540
 to a certain extent 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.390
 the hoses still 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.340
 FÃ¼rth we settings bit of color life can actually always be one 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.340
 optimal angle to the diver exists 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.960
 we will be here right now with the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.949
 Go to Prague water 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:09.329
 and look 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.329
 we put ourselves in practice 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.699
 we have to take the hare a month 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.699
 why turn 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.699
 for his performance 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.249
 Resistance is very low one can adjust it by adjustable 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.220
 who minimal adjust what my taste already 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.579
 think about it the magnifying glass 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.749
 Now solve easily 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:23.749
 I should be ready for my taste 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.869
 van Gaal we have him 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.869
 under water Isner hit high waves 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.559
 only comes with it 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:33.899
 So he has 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:35.979
 not really well rated 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.819
 in any case 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.099
 Let's look at the pleasant moon over the value spread out 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.249
 at all, one's weight is not 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.649
 Lohan gets a little uncomfortable 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.799
 Favre I think real regulator
