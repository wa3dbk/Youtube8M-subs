00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.320
 when you open the door 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.710
 fear Island 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.710
 this rain knocked over 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.759
 the box of the same style 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.620
 insisted on 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 in the language that is ours 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 if we do not use 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.690
 accomplice 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.690
 I think it will be given all pretty clean 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.480
 the uncle of the victims 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.300
 do not try to open and from here I'll take a break as hobby bonbons 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.270
 the option is when only the same tooth 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 but expensive for this 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.130
 - since everything 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.130
 five months before deposing the dictator 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.940
 the presidency 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.810

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.879
 Sleepless 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.989
 low vision 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.989
 where the environment 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:39.809
 it's interesting 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.809
 and it is not so great that she 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.479

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.919
 you choose which side you're going to stay 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.029
 the whole magnetic rope 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:20.679
 We're still alive. 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:23.939
 for a while 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.289
 Same thing as always Denise Richards wrote to the wise president 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:32.909
 Sao Paulo 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.909
 I'm going to give a link in the middle after the feat in piumhi 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.779
 from what I know he has he's heavy with human heat 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.479
 without physical differences 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:59.129
 cisco citrix seixas 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.669

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:24.759
 who wants to use it 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.759
 short so I think it's a good option 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.289
 - play always put 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.289
 in this show 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.870
 I'm just going to call in sea jumping 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.759
 even with the kers regeneration system 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.759
 this here does not 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.389
 one of the keyboards so well known 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.389
 but he spoke a little tired 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.770
 more visual 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.650
 it has no foundation 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.509
 itself 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.719
 the moment 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.719
 So folks I came back here, no. 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:14.149
 the mec has such a sound audience is another ensure the appointment 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.580
 in five games the main player is not good 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.199
 the oil is that he 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.529
 stay tuned since the team does not 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.529
 as leader of a powerful 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.189
 about being the other author 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.189
 next to the stadium 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.770
 the mayor dr 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.710
 catching the best club in the world 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.719
 she is serious 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.059
 after the show 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.189
 passing by and saw dr. 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:21.860

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.860
 this has already passed and saw everything flawless from the furniture along 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.240
 the big mac 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.529
 if we are to put another car 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.180
 on the other side the doctor 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.759
 This is to put it all alone. 

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.899
 everything and moved away from the year 

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:07.059

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:10.210
 the palm trees play here straight 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.930
 I can eat here 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.930
