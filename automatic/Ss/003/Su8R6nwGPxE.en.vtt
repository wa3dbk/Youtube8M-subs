00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 before starting the video I would like to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.190
 ask you to cork in my 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.370
 facebook page and follow me on 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.370
 twitter 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.390
 save salve people from youtube to cocoa 8038 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 with one more video for you good months 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.779
 ago I made a video of the first 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 about the first episode of the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.650
 denis and coe anime at the time said no 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.670
 had tanned and therefore would not 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.769
 watch the rest 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 however after a while I solved it 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.210
 give the anime a chance and I ended up being 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.940
 involved the plot for the sake of 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.530
 lack of time I ended up stopping at the 15th 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.309
 episode and I was too lazy to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.710
 finish 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.360
 I went on vacation and did not even three 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.100
 days that I discovered that the first 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.820
 season of the anime ended with 20 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.579
 episodes 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.170
 then I thought mano I arrived at 15 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.750
 So I think I'm going to finish is to do the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.270
 what and when I'm watching an old 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 questioning turned my head because 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
 is it so rare to find a good 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.660
 romance in manga 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.760
 is a question that opens space for 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.870
 several answers as well as some 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.140
 problems 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.470
 1 The problem might be in my search. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.210
 two 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.890
 the problem may be in my design 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.060
 and 3 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.490
 the problem may be in the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.860
 conflict between Brazilian culture and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.689
 the video is one more 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.490
 of those in which I had an idea and 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.650
 I decided to bring the discussion to the channel 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.720
 I'll try to find an answer and I'll wait. 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.729
 that you help me find a work 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.590
 with the characteristics that quoted him 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.659
 I'll start by basing myself on a tweet 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.090
 I did not know if it's the romances 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.729
 men who are specific in their 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.659
 general or if something Japanese for all 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.610
 ages 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.040
 but the love relationships I see 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 in the manga generally tested a lot of 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.710
 reality 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.600
 I think it's one more thing. 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.610
 facing the public shonny but 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.610
 I confess that it bothers this business. 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.930
 pure naive love etc. involving 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.549
 students in high school 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.119
 especially when it comes to works 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.189
 full of fans service and arem in most 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.079
 of them is evident sexual desire of the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.060
 male characters as well as the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.259
 sensuality of several of the characters 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.180
 female 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.280
 However, there is that business of staying 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.720
 embarrassed when you stay together 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.450
 red when I lend a hand and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.740
 127 beauty and this is in fact occurs in 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.050
 some moments in our context 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.690
 Brazilian but I believe that instead 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.850
 none of the world and I have more than 8,000 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.030
 chapters to give a kiss 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.620
 I say when you are 11 to 14 years old 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.600
 understandable and scroll to give the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.760
 first kiss and then there is a certain 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.080
 innocence but I'm talking about colors 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.240
 between the ages of 15 and 18 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.190
 good to my eyes is a little irritating to see 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.660
 the character of the air in a work in which the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.570
 protagonist surrounded by women 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.250
 attractive people who like him do nothing 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.709
 the question of the first kiss can be 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.570
 something Japanese I imagine it to be 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.670
 a kind of taboo so the age 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.709
 average to do for the first time 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.140
 It may be bigger but I do not have so much 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.450
 I sure as hell would like it too. 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.250
 have studied for a while in japan only 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.440
 to see if some things that are frequent 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.660
 found in manga and anime are 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.360
 fact from real life 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.030
 finally about the harem fan services there are no 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.770
 much doubt they exist frequently 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.080
 in the works to be something that attracts 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.209
 public chonin and perhaps the aspect of the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.430
 protagonist doing nothing is more 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.120
 to stimulate the fans' imagination. 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.459
 that to portray reality itself I 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.290
 I already commented on problems 2 and 3 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.540
 Yes, the fact that I do not find the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.519
 commanders of good manga can be 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.130
 something related to my design 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.600
 of what is a good romance after all if the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.440
 The proposal is only to attract an 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.140
 bigger 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.760
 the device services and lack of attitude 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.900
 of the characters can be a strategy 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.850
 useful 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.340
 It may also relate to the 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.049
 third problem that I mentioned is 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.769
 between Japanese culture and 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.450
 Brazilian 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.940
 my reality is totally different 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.160
 of theirs and what does not make much sense 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.290
 for me can make full sense by 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.230
 but I have not yet commented on 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.910
 this first problem may be that I 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.459
 is looking for wrong 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.010
 how well good first of all i did not read 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.040
 many manga that tackles the theme 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.769
 romantic 100% in these and leather liquent in 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.950
 standby or some just sketches one 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.350
 romance and others gave more prominence 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.900
 but the fact is that although in almost no 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.729
 of them there was a character with attitude 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.150
 they are all aimed at the public 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.680
 chonin 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.710
 and that's why I would like to ask 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.290
 help you my dear subscribers for me 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.900
 recommend in a mangal 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.389
 preference manga in which there is a romance 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.210
 that looks real without major damages 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.699
 nothing a story with your feet on the ground 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.110
 If you met the manga facing 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.100
 the public if these 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.919
 features 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.470
 It's even better if it's a show you but it 's 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.910
 half chatinho to read more beauty let's go 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.530
 break the prejudices 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.979
 remembering that I'm not looking in 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.470
 team and hi or shit like that is I just 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.570
 I want to know if there is a normal work in 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.080
 that there is a normal romance 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.940
 want an example sonim this yes is the 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.030
 single term of romance that seemed to 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.090
 true fact and not idealized 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.550
 now talking a little about the nice coe 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.740
 I say that even though I do not like it very much. 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.270
 all this pure and naive aspect of self 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.520
 I learned to relay such a characteristic 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.610
 so much so that one of my favorite works 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.220
 is 100% old and I even made a 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.380
 Case and back and comenda coming back with Michel 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.539
 I can say that in the end I enjoy 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.789
 enough to really encourage production 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.610
 very good at several times karate 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.260
 idealized mixed with the caricature 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.870
 and made you laugh 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.639
 in fact if as you want 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.639
 collecting the anime at first was 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.530
 100% identical among several others 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.080
 take a look at the taco store 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.659
 because they already have dvds ready 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.659
 to send the whole service with the best 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.130
 quality for you is newey is obliged to 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.289
 all who watched videos and liked 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.699
 would like to subscribe favorite in divulge 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.560
 and do not forget to put your 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.599
 comments talking about what they found 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.190
 I also cut my facebook page and 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:05.620
 moved twitter 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.460
 Just to tell you that I got to win. 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.419
 the press registration there in the anime 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.889
 frames 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.449
 so I'll probably go 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.389
 probably not will surely 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.099
 I'll show up a few days there but I'll give 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.760
 a zoom better warning for you when 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:25.500
 when it is decided what days I am 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.500
 the others and more left
