about the new TV it's been working
pretty<00:00:22.710> well<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:23.340> two<00:00:23.970> months<00:00:24.300> ago<00:00:24.359> we

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
pretty well about two months ago we

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.220 
pretty well about two months ago we
started<00:00:25.740> getting<00:00:25.920> some<00:00:26.310> image<00:00:26.699> degradation

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
started getting some image degradation

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.169 
started getting some image degradation
where<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.470> top<00:00:28.859> half<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> screen<00:00:29.730> looked

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
where the top half of the screen looked

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.330 
where the top half of the screen looked
like<00:00:30.330> there<00:00:30.510> was<00:00:30.570> ghost<00:00:30.900> image<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:32.009> kind<00:00:32.250> of

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
like there was ghost image we kind of

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.030 
like there was ghost image we kind of
start<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.700> white<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> purple<00:00:34.040> flashes

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
start to see white and purple flashes

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.389 
start to see white and purple flashes
especially<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> lighter<00:00:36.239> background

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
especially on the lighter background

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.260 
especially on the lighter background
shows<00:00:38.540> that<00:00:39.649> proceeded<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.550> worse<00:00:41.760> over

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
shows that proceeded to get worse over

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.869 
shows that proceeded to get worse over
time<00:00:42.540> where<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.620> whole<00:00:43.649> screen<00:00:44.250> would<00:00:44.309> start

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
time where the whole screen would start

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.880 
time where the whole screen would start
to<00:00:45.000> look<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.360> these<00:00:45.539> ghost<00:00:45.930> flashes<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to look like these ghost flashes and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.150 
to look like these ghost flashes and
this<00:00:47.579> wasn't<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.000> problem<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.600> could<00:00:48.750> be

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
this wasn't a problem that could be

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.010 
this wasn't a problem that could be
fixed<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> white<00:00:51.030> feature<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
fixed with the white feature on the

fixed with the white feature on the
plasma<00:00:52.590> TV<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:52.949> other<00:00:53.250> words<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> wasn't<00:00:53.699> like

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
plasma TV in other words it wasn't like

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.850 
plasma TV in other words it wasn't like
a<00:00:53.910> burnin<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:55.020> something<00:00:55.739> was

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
a burnin it was really something was

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.910 
a burnin it was really something was
wrong<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> image<00:00:57.120> or<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.480> TV<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.260> did

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
wrong with the image or the TV I did

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
wrong with the image or the TV I did
some<00:00:59.129> research<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> Internet

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
some research on the Internet

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.139 
some research on the Internet
I<00:01:00.690> went<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> bunch<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.620> user<00:01:01.829> boards<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.520> found

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
I went to a bunch of user boards I found

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.250 
I went to a bunch of user boards I found
out<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.510> actually<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.899> fairly<00:01:04.140> common

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
out it's actually a fairly common

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.910 
out it's actually a fairly common
problem<00:01:04.769> eventually<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:07.229> leads<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
problem eventually it leads to the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.060 
problem eventually it leads to the
television<00:01:08.909> completely<00:01:09.720> failing<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.860> won't

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
television completely failing it won't

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.149 
television completely failing it won't
turn<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.490> no<00:01:11.880> image<00:01:12.299> no<00:01:12.330> sound<00:01:12.900> nothing<00:01:13.770> at

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
turn on no image no sound nothing at

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
turn on no image no sound nothing at
least<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> common<00:01:15.119> failure<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
least that's the common failure and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.899 
least that's the common failure and
through<00:01:16.439> more<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.950> research<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.729> did

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
through more of the research that I did

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.850 
through more of the research that I did
on<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.180> internet<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.720> found<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.619> kind<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
on the internet I found out it's kind of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.490 
on the internet I found out it's kind of
a<00:01:19.950> progressive<00:01:20.340> problem<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.350> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
a progressive problem and that if you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.710 
a progressive problem and that if you
get<00:01:22.710> any<00:01:22.860> repairs<00:01:23.310> done<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.820> should<00:01:24.030> replace

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
get any repairs done you should replace

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.350 
get any repairs done you should replace
or<00:01:25.170> repair<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.400> boards<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.210> are

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
or repair all of the boards that are

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210 
or repair all of the boards that are
involved<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> failure<00:01:28.650> there's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
involved with the failure there's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.100 
involved with the failure there's
primarily<00:01:29.850> three<00:01:30.270> boards<00:01:30.630> I'm<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> show

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
primarily three boards I'm going to show

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.270 
primarily three boards I'm going to show
them<00:01:31.290> from<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> backside<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:33.049> decided<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.409> try

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
them from the backside I decided to try

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.030 
them from the backside I decided to try
and<00:01:35.549> make<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> repairs<00:01:36.210> myself<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.990> terms<00:01:37.770> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and make the repairs myself in terms of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.130 
and make the repairs myself in terms of
taking<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> boards<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.450> shipping<00:01:39.869> them

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
taking out the boards and shipping them

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.830 
taking out the boards and shipping them
off<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.829> repair<00:01:41.579> place<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:42.810> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
off to a repair place that will for a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.010 
off to a repair place that will for a
pretty<00:01:43.829> much<00:01:43.979> reasonable<00:01:44.880> fixed<00:01:45.299> price<00:01:45.600> go

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
pretty much reasonable fixed price go

pretty much reasonable fixed price go
through<00:01:46.350> each<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> boards<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.399> send

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
through each of the boards that you send

can<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.159> here<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.930> have<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.850> TC<00:02:02.850> -<00:02:03.240> P<00:02:03.750> 55<00:02:04.590> V<00:02:05.430> T<00:02:05.790> 30

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.279 
can see here I have a TC - P 55 V T 30
so<00:02:06.719> that's<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:07.140> 55<00:02:08.099> inch<00:02:08.129> plasma<00:02:08.640> TV<00:02:09.140> several<00:02:10.140> of

and<00:02:23.450> they<00:02:24.320> repaired<00:02:24.800> them<00:02:25.040> pretty<00:02:25.340> much

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
and they repaired them pretty much

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.850 
and they repaired them pretty much
within<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.970> week<00:02:26.180> week<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.690> half<00:02:26.720> send<00:02:27.680> them

the<00:02:28.790> really<00:02:29.390> hardest<00:02:29.780> part<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.490> repair

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
the really hardest part of this repair

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.600 
the really hardest part of this repair
is<00:02:31.960> what<00:02:32.960> are<00:02:33.110> called<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.650> ribbon<00:02:34.130> cables

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
is what are called the ribbon cables

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.200 
is what are called the ribbon cables
which<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:36.020> can<00:02:36.260> see<00:02:36.530> right<00:02:36.830> here<00:02:36.890> that's<00:02:37.850> one

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
which you can see right here that's one

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.320 
which you can see right here that's one
of<00:02:38.360> them<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.720> television<00:02:39.320> has<00:02:40.000> ten<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.180> them

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
of them the television has ten of them

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.090 
of them the television has ten of them
at<00:02:41.780> least<00:02:41.960> that's<00:02:42.170> what<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.320> think<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.740> has<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
at least that's what I think it has the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.220 
at least that's what I think it has the
three<00:02:46.100> boards<00:02:46.550> that<00:02:46.790> we<00:02:47.120> are<00:02:47.300> interested<00:02:48.020> in

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
three boards that we are interested in

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.449 
three boards that we are interested in
replacing<00:02:48.590> are<00:02:49.930> all<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.709> left-hand<00:02:52.190> side

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
replacing are all on the left-hand side

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.550 
replacing are all on the left-hand side
of<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.790> TV<00:02:53.030> there's<00:02:53.570> this<00:02:53.780> larger<00:02:54.290> board

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
of the TV there's this larger board

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.850 
of the TV there's this larger board
which<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.490> from<00:02:55.790> here<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.350> down<00:02:57.350> here<00:02:57.650> at<00:02:57.740> the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
which is from here to down here at the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.440 
which is from here to down here at the
bottom<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.400> then<00:02:58.520> these<00:02:58.670> two<00:02:58.970> signal

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
bottom and then these two signal

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.510 
bottom and then these two signal
generators<00:03:00.020> I<00:03:00.230> think<00:03:00.440> they<00:03:00.530> call<00:03:00.740> them<00:03:00.890> maybe

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
generators I think they call them maybe

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.330 
generators I think they call them maybe
an<00:03:01.700> SC<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.270> an<00:03:02.450> SD<00:03:02.840> board<00:03:03.170> or<00:03:03.440> an<00:03:03.560> su<00:03:04.010> board

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
an SC in an SD board or an su board

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.460 
an SC in an SD board or an su board
those<00:03:05.030> are<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.360> three<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.810> are<00:03:05.930> involved

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
those are the three that are involved

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.230 
those are the three that are involved
again<00:03:06.740> really<00:03:07.430> doesn't<00:03:07.790> matter<00:03:07.910> what<00:03:08.120> you

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
again really doesn't matter what you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.199 
again really doesn't matter what you
call<00:03:08.450> them<00:03:08.630> in<00:03:08.840> our<00:03:09.350> case<00:03:09.650> I<00:03:09.950> just<00:03:10.459> took<00:03:10.970> them

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
call them in our case I just took them

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.960 
call them in our case I just took them
out<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:12.020> television<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.800> package<00:03:13.610> them<00:03:13.850> up

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
out of the television I package them up

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.540 
out of the television I package them up
went<00:03:14.270> to<00:03:14.390> FedEx<00:03:14.810> sent<00:03:15.170> them<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.739> repair

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
went to FedEx sent them to the repair

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.390 
went to FedEx sent them to the repair
place<00:03:16.880> they<00:03:17.780> did<00:03:18.140> whatever<00:03:18.380> they<00:03:18.680> do<00:03:18.739> sent

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
place they did whatever they do sent

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.550 
place they did whatever they do sent
them<00:03:19.580> back<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.120> then<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.750> tricky<00:03:21.110> part<00:03:21.350> is

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
them back and then the tricky part is

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.470 
them back and then the tricky part is
again<00:03:21.860> putting<00:03:22.190> them<00:03:22.400> together<00:03:22.610> the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
again putting them together the

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.060 
again putting them together the
different<00:03:23.959> components<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.769> have<00:03:24.800> to

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
different components that you have to

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.270 
different components that you have to
take<00:03:25.190> apart<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.760> here<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.180> course<00:03:26.840> are<00:03:27.170> the

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
take apart on here of course are the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.590 
take apart on here of course are the
Phillips<00:03:28.280> screws<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:28.700> hold<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.300> boards

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
Phillips screws that hold the boards

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.090 
Phillips screws that hold the boards
down<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.680> have<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:30.920> be<00:03:31.220> able<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.900> remove<00:03:33.100> the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
down you have to be able to remove the

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.910 
down you have to be able to remove the
ribbon<00:03:34.700> cables<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.690> way<00:03:35.810> these<00:03:35.989> work<00:03:36.050> you

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
ribbon cables and the way these work you

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.770 
ribbon cables and the way these work you
should<00:03:37.160> do<00:03:37.280> some<00:03:37.489> research<00:03:37.880> on<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.360> internet

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
should do some research on the internet

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.020 
should do some research on the internet
but<00:03:39.380> basically<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.130> put<00:03:40.340> your<00:03:40.489> finger<00:03:40.790> on<00:03:40.820> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
but basically you put your finger on the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.030 
but basically you put your finger on the
back<00:03:41.150> side<00:03:41.450> here<00:03:41.630> this<00:03:42.140> flips<00:03:42.560> up<00:03:42.800> like<00:03:43.010> a

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
back side here this flips up like a

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.860 
back side here this flips up like a
little<00:03:43.310> hinge<00:03:43.550> then<00:03:44.330> this<00:03:44.510> ribbon<00:03:44.840> cable

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
little hinge then this ribbon cable

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.199 
little hinge then this ribbon cable
comes<00:03:45.440> out<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:46.280> have<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.610> do<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:46.880> for<00:03:47.180> each

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
comes out you have to do that for each

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.960 
comes out you have to do that for each
of<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.690> ribbon<00:03:48.560> cables<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.310> attach<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.670> the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
of the ribbon cables that attach to the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.780 
of the ribbon cables that attach to the
plasma<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.690> front<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.110> TV<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:52.130> these

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
plasma the front of the TV and these

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.420 
plasma the front of the TV and these
guys<00:03:53.090> down<00:03:53.360> here<00:03:53.660> are<00:03:53.870> kind<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.290> hidden<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:55.400> you

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
guys down here are kind of hidden so you

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.670 
guys down here are kind of hidden so you
may<00:03:55.970> have<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.330> take<00:03:56.450> this<00:03:56.660> bracket<00:03:57.110> off<00:03:57.260> this

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
may have to take this bracket off this

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.180 
may have to take this bracket off this
pops<00:03:58.519> out<00:03:58.820> upwards<00:03:59.810> then<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:00.830> remove<00:04:01.130> the

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
pops out upwards then you can remove the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.890 
pops out upwards then you can remove the
screw<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.670> you'll<00:04:01.970> have<00:04:02.120> easy<00:04:02.269> access<00:04:02.570> to

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
screw and you'll have easy access to

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.070 
screw and you'll have easy access to
those<00:04:03.200> guys<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.920> lot<00:04:04.640> of<00:04:04.940> screws<00:04:05.300> go<00:04:05.600> into<00:04:05.900> this

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
those guys a lot of screws go into this

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.539 
those guys a lot of screws go into this
they're<00:04:06.890> all<00:04:06.920> pretty<00:04:07.310> much<00:04:07.430> identified<00:04:08.239> with

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
they're all pretty much identified with

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.000 
they're all pretty much identified with
this<00:04:10.549> kind<00:04:10.880> of<00:04:10.940> gold<00:04:11.180> band<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:12.350> can<00:04:12.530> see<00:04:12.709> over

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
this kind of gold band you can see over

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.740 
this kind of gold band you can see over
here<00:04:13.040> here's<00:04:13.489> an<00:04:13.610> example<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.269> one<00:04:14.450> there's

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
here here's an example of one there's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.810 
here here's an example of one there's
always<00:04:14.930> an<00:04:15.170> arrow<00:04:15.350> pointing<00:04:15.799> to<00:04:15.920> them<00:04:16.070> you've

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
always an arrow pointing to them you've

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.610 
always an arrow pointing to them you've
got<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.030> couple<00:04:17.330> of<00:04:17.540> ribbon<00:04:17.870> cables<00:04:18.290> smaller

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
got a couple of ribbon cables smaller

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.460 
got a couple of ribbon cables smaller
ones<00:04:18.919> this<00:04:19.640> guy<00:04:19.910> here<00:04:20.270> and<00:04:20.390> again<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.350> way

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
ones this guy here and again the way

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.530 
ones this guy here and again the way
this<00:04:21.680> works<00:04:21.919> is<00:04:22.130> this<00:04:22.479> flips<00:04:23.479> up<00:04:23.780> from

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
this works is this flips up from

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.720 
this works is this flips up from
the<00:04:24.630> back<00:04:24.840> there's<00:04:25.230> a<00:04:25.290> little<00:04:25.470> hinge<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.520> it

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
the back there's a little hinge and it

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.850 
the back there's a little hinge and it
basically<00:04:27.000> releases<00:04:27.900> or<00:04:28.080> loosens<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> ribbon

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
basically releases or loosens the ribbon

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.130 
basically releases or loosens the ribbon
cable<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.550> slide<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.030> out<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.990> also

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
cable so you can slide it out you also

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.660 
cable so you can slide it out you also
have<00:04:31.410> these<00:04:31.560> connectors<00:04:32.100> here<00:04:32.310> which<00:04:32.520> I

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
have these connectors here which I

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.180 
have these connectors here which I
wasn't<00:04:32.970> familiar<00:04:33.120> with<00:04:33.420> so<00:04:34.200> I<00:04:34.650> thought<00:04:35.040> they

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
wasn't familiar with so I thought they

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.040 
wasn't familiar with so I thought they
split<00:04:35.490> out<00:04:35.670> this<00:04:35.910> way<00:04:36.120> but<00:04:36.180> in<00:04:36.480> fact<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.900> have

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
split out this way but in fact you have

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.500 
split out this way but in fact you have
to<00:04:37.200> squeeze<00:04:37.560> them<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.400> they<00:04:38.520> pop<00:04:38.790> upwards

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
to squeeze them and they pop upwards

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.870 
to squeeze them and they pop upwards
towards<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.860> then<00:04:40.980> that<00:04:41.100> releases<00:04:41.430> them

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
towards you and then that releases them

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.090 
towards you and then that releases them
and<00:04:42.180> then<00:04:42.810> you<00:04:42.930> have<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.110> ribbon<00:04:43.500> cable<00:04:43.830> here<00:04:44.010> in

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
and then you have a ribbon cable here in

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.580 
and then you have a ribbon cable here in
the<00:04:44.190> center<00:04:44.490> between<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.570> signal<00:04:46.200> generator

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
the center between the signal generator

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.780 
the center between the signal generator
boards<00:04:46.950> I<00:04:47.100> think<00:04:47.130> that's<00:04:47.490> what<00:04:47.640> they're

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
boards I think that's what they're

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.150 
boards I think that's what they're
called<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.270> then<00:04:48.900> you've<00:04:49.050> got<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.530> connector

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
called and then you've got a connector

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.420 
called and then you've got a connector
over<00:04:50.190> here<00:04:50.640> which<00:04:51.390> is<00:04:51.630> again<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.200> squeeze<00:04:53.040> lift

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
over here which is again a squeeze lift

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.590 
over here which is again a squeeze lift
and<00:04:54.090> then<00:04:54.300> slide<00:04:54.690> back<00:04:55.010> so<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:57.120> hardest<00:04:57.480> part

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
and then slide back so the hardest part

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.530 
and then slide back so the hardest part
of<00:04:57.960> this<00:04:58.140> like<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.830> said<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.430> getting<00:05:00.000> these

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
of this like I said is getting these

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.130 
of this like I said is getting these
ribbon<00:05:01.350> cables<00:05:01.380> back<00:05:02.250> into<00:05:02.610> place<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:03.300> probably

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
ribbon cables back into place I probably

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.200 
ribbon cables back into place I probably
spend<00:05:04.620> close<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.890> an<00:05:05.280> hour<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.640> a<00:05:05.670> half<00:05:05.850> or<00:05:06.060> two

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
spend close to an hour and a half or two

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.470 
spend close to an hour and a half or two
hours<00:05:06.350> I'd<00:05:07.350> put<00:05:07.620> them<00:05:07.770> in<00:05:07.980> turn<00:05:08.910> on<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.270> TV

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480

look at it see that I had a problem turn

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.640 
look at it see that I had a problem turn
the<00:05:13.080> TV<00:05:13.500> off<00:05:14.000> pull<00:05:15.000> them<00:05:15.180> out<00:05:15.410> reset<00:05:16.410> them

television Willis was less than four

television Willis was less than four
years<00:05:47.550> old<00:05:48.080> basically<00:05:49.080> stopped<00:05:49.470> working

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
years old basically stopped working

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.040

they're out of the business you can't
find<00:05:52.350> these<00:05:52.590> boards<00:05:53.100> so<00:05:53.340> it's<00:05:53.490> not<00:05:53.670> as<00:05:53.850> if<00:05:53.970> you

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
find these boards so it's not as if you

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.600 
find these boards so it's not as if you
