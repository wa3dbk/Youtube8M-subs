description on the at the bottom of the
screen<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.360> which<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.200> kind<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.470> cool<00:02:10.649> sets

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
screen there which is kind of cool sets

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.660 
screen there which is kind of cool sets
the<00:02:11.099> connection<00:02:11.520> method<00:02:11.940> when

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
the connection method when

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.059 
the connection method when

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
short brief description on what it is so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.790 
short brief description on what it is so
that's<00:02:18.849> kind<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.120> cool<00:02:19.380> don't<00:02:20.380> see<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.650> in

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
that's kind of cool don't see that in

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.720 
that's kind of cool don't see that in
mini<00:02:20.950> cameras<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:24.130> pixel<00:02:24.520> mapping

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
mini cameras it's pixel mapping

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.010 
mini cameras it's pixel mapping
brightness<00:02:25.630> monitor<00:02:26.170> brightness<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.810> some

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
brightness monitor brightness so some

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.970 
brightness monitor brightness so some
difference<00:02:29.350> so<00:02:29.500> there's<00:02:29.709> quite<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.920> few

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
difference so there's quite a few

situations only the one light the

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.270 
situations only the one light the
computer<00:05:10.020> monitor<00:05:10.229> light<00:05:10.650> that's<00:05:10.919> it

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
computer monitor light that's it

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.170 
computer monitor light that's it
I<00:05:11.340> do<00:05:12.090> guys<00:05:12.330> Jake<00:05:12.659> here<00:05:12.900> cheers<00:05:13.770> everybody

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.040 
okay so this is basically the quality of
the<00:05:22.770> video<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:24.210> you're<00:05:24.330> looking<00:05:24.390> at<00:05:24.720> me<00:05:24.840> now

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
the video that you're looking at me now

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.490 
the video that you're looking at me now
it's<00:05:25.350> in<00:05:25.670> 720p<00:05:26.720> mode<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:29.810> got<00:05:30.810> some<00:05:31.110> daylight

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
it's in 720p mode and got some daylight

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.920 
it's in 720p mode and got some daylight
coming<00:05:31.800> in<00:05:32.210> it's<00:05:33.210> not<00:05:33.360> very<00:05:33.540> sunny<00:05:33.840> outside

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
coming in it's not very sunny outside

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.140 
coming in it's not very sunny outside
but<00:05:34.500> a<00:05:34.530> little<00:05:34.770> bit<00:05:34.890> overcast<00:05:35.340> so<00:05:35.820> this<00:05:36.060> is

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
but a little bit overcast so this is

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.040 
but a little bit overcast so this is
basically<00:05:36.540> what<00:05:36.720> you<00:05:36.870> got<00:05:37.640> so<00:05:38.640> not<00:05:39.600> sure<00:05:39.810> how

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
basically what you got so not sure how

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.140 
basically what you got so not sure how
how<00:05:40.560> crisp<00:05:40.920> or<00:05:41.130> clear<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.580> is<00:05:41.670> turning<00:05:41.940> out

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
how crisp or clear that is turning out

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.410 
how crisp or clear that is turning out
but<00:05:42.450> I<00:05:42.630> think<00:05:43.560> it's<00:05:43.890> the<00:05:44.550> video<00:05:44.790> seems<00:05:45.120> to<00:05:45.270> have

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
but I think it's the video seems to have

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.810 
but I think it's the video seems to have
a<00:05:45.450> pretty<00:05:45.660> good<00:05:45.840> angle<00:05:46.410> to<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.710> as<00:05:47.070> well<00:05:47.400> when

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
a pretty good angle to it as well when

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.690 
a pretty good angle to it as well when
when<00:05:48.510> I<00:05:48.540> hit<00:05:48.720> the<00:05:48.870> video<00:05:49.020> button<00:05:49.860> the

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
when I hit the video button the

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.080 
when I hit the video button the
dedicated<00:05:51.090> video<00:05:51.420> button<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.830> it<00:05:53.100> took<00:05:53.430> the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
dedicated video button and it took the

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.010 
dedicated video button and it took the
the<00:05:54.780> it<00:05:55.170> took<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:56.040> preview<00:05:56.790> of<00:05:57.030> for<00:05:57.900> the

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
the it took the the preview of for the

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.370 
the it took the the preview of for the
still<00:05:58.470> image<00:05:58.770> screen<00:05:59.280> and<00:05:59.600> it<00:06:00.600> sort<00:06:01.200> of<00:06:01.290> went
