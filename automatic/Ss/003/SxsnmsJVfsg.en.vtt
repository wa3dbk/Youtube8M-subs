decorative concrete Institute don't

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
decorative concrete Institute don't
overlook<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> importance<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.340> tool<00:00:17.609> and

overlook the importance of this tool and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.670 
overlook the importance of this tool and
this<00:00:18.180> tool<00:00:18.390> happens<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:19.020> what<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.260> call<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
this tool happens to be what we call a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.620 
this tool happens to be what we call a
squeegee<00:00:19.980> back<00:00:20.279> now<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:21.300> use<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
squeegee back now you can use a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
squeegee back now you can use a
traditional<00:00:22.010> wet/dry<00:00:23.010> vac<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.609> doing

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
traditional wet/dry vac for doing

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.370 
traditional wet/dry vac for doing
all-purpose<00:00:24.539> cleaning<00:00:24.990> whether<00:00:25.170> you're

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
all-purpose cleaning whether you're

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
all-purpose cleaning whether you're
preparing<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.980> floor<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.369> an<00:00:26.460> acid<00:00:26.789> stain<00:00:27.029> or

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
preparing the floor for an acid stain or

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.529 
preparing the floor for an acid stain or
cleaning<00:00:28.260> stain<00:00:28.529> residue<00:00:28.730> however<00:00:29.730> as<00:00:30.029> your

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
cleaning stain residue however as your

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.959 
cleaning stain residue however as your
projects<00:00:31.349> become<00:00:31.619> larger<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.279> graduate

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
projects become larger and you graduate

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.030 
projects become larger and you graduate
to<00:00:33.120> much<00:00:33.300> bigger<00:00:33.480> projects<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> much

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to much bigger projects this is a much

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.560 
to much bigger projects this is a much
more<00:00:35.219> efficient<00:00:35.730> tool<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.090> use<00:00:36.300> than<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
more efficient tool to use than a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
more efficient tool to use than a
traditional<00:00:36.809> wet/dry<00:00:37.680> vac<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.610> use<00:00:38.820> this

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
traditional wet/dry vac so we use this

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.670 
traditional wet/dry vac so we use this
frequently<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.809> not<00:00:39.930> only<00:00:40.050> cleaning<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
frequently for not only cleaning the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
frequently for not only cleaning the
concrete<00:00:41.040> substrate<00:00:41.520> prior<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> staining

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
concrete substrate prior to the staining

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.860 
concrete substrate prior to the staining
process<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.770> after<00:00:44.219> we've<00:00:44.399> used<00:00:45.329> an<00:00:45.480> acid

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
process but after we've used an acid

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.540 
process but after we've used an acid
stain<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.200> an<00:00:46.320> example<00:00:46.800> there's<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.250> lot<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
stain as an example there's a lot of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.160 
stain as an example there's a lot of
residue<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.120> needs<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.480> cleaned<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
residue that needs to be cleaned up and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.110 
residue that needs to be cleaned up and
this<00:00:49.680> tool<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:49.920> great<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.760> cleaning<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
this tool is great for cleaning the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389 
this tool is great for cleaning the
stain<00:00:51.329> residue<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:52.320> pretty<00:00:52.590> basic<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.219> how

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
stain residue it's pretty basic on how

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
stain residue it's pretty basic on how
it<00:00:53.550> works<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.270> see<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.050> case<00:00:55.320> we

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it works but you can see in this case we

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.889 
it works but you can see in this case we
have<00:00:55.710> an<00:00:55.829> arm<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> does<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.510> once

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
have an arm and what the does is once

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.380 
have an arm and what the does is once
you<00:00:58.079> unlatch<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> arm<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.219> simply<00:00:59.609> puts<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you unlatch the arm it simply puts the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.510 
you unlatch the arm it simply puts the
rubber<00:01:00.600> seal<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.199> contact<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> concrete

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
rubber seal in contact with the concrete

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.939 
rubber seal in contact with the concrete
surface<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.899> pretty<00:01:04.170> simple<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.650> how<00:01:04.799> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
surface so it's pretty simple on how it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.880 
surface so it's pretty simple on how it
works<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:06.119> addition<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.530> see

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
works in addition to that you can see

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160 
works in addition to that you can see
that<00:01:08.130> once<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.610> fill<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> tank<00:01:09.060> whether<00:01:09.900> it's

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that once you fill the tank whether it's

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.560 
that once you fill the tank whether it's
just<00:01:10.500> all-purpose<00:01:11.280> cleaning<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> concrete

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
just all-purpose cleaning the concrete

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539 
just all-purpose cleaning the concrete
or<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:13.080> stain<00:01:13.350> residue<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.250> has<00:01:14.400> an

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
or with stain residue it has an

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.310 
or with stain residue it has an
attachment<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.689> simply<00:01:15.900> bring<00:01:16.200> it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
attachment here you simply bring it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.740 
attachment here you simply bring it
outside<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.310> lift<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.729> arm<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
outside and you lift this arm and it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.320 
outside and you lift this arm and it
allows<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.740> water<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.100> escape<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
allows the water to escape out of the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
allows the water to escape out of the
drum<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.229> let's<00:01:22.500> show<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.680> how<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.890> tool

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
drum so let's show you how this tool

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:40.380 
drum so let's show you how this tool
works

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.280 

the<00:01:41.290> tool<00:01:41.860> can<00:01:42.220> be<00:01:42.250> used<00:01:42.820> both<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.840> forward

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
the tool can be used both in a forward

00:01:44.290 --> 00:02:04.870 
the tool can be used both in a forward
position<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:45.040> a<00:01:45.190> reverse<00:01:45.520> position

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880
