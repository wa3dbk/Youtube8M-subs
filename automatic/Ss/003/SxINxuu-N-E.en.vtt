00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.770
 put it on how it's going good today I brought you a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.929
 picture with mixed technique and with the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.049
 thematic of astrology but it can be 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.170
 applicable to any good topic the idea 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.150
 that or you can leave this technique to cover 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.910
 with slips a background to be able 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.369
 recover a fabric that we have or for 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.680
 do it on wood in some box or 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.140
 good frame the first thing we do is 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.480
 cut newspaper strips with 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.040
 scissors in this case and what we're going to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 make is with acrylic brush 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.500
 as a watery thing to achieve strips of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.450
 different colors all this after we 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.510
 will serve to make that kind of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.420
 'pupae' with papers made by 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.309
 we good you read this all the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.649
 colors that we are going to choose have to 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.480
 be bright colors colors be cheerful 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.770
 so then let's put for example 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.020
 a green well bright 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.840
 and dilute it with water so that some 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.380
 do not cover let's say the letters of the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.380
 newspaper and good this we let it dry 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.460
 very well it 's easy I'm not going to continue 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.040
 with this I have some strips 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.670
 finished and dry we will show how 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.190
 are applied on the basis I here have a 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.710
 step by step performed but let's 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.010
 show first the part of how to adhere 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.960
 this is simple with vinyl glue 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.710
 we apply directly to the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.090
 frame or the wood pretty tail very 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.939
 we throw them 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.920
 and we are putting for example the first 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.539
 Band-aid of color 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.539
 let's put a blue band 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.290
 we examine well towards the edge and 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.070
 we press we can place a queue 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.010
 vinyl above and also dilute it 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.560
 a bit this later when it dries goes 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.940
 to be transparent then when 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.340
 we have well placed well on the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.540
 first strip we are putting a little more 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.540
 of tail in the next 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.260
 and there we are going to put the color and the super 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.000
 We put a little bit with the former going 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.920
 staying as staggered does not have to 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.520
 to get space, it was good then 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.620
 what we do is look for a design in 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.260
 this case I chose my zodiac sign that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.730
 is tauro then I made a design in a 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.400
 piece of paper passes through the wood on 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.250
 bushing and we are going to prepare a pastita like 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.069
 to be able to texturize and a paste of 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.930
 hands to stop a more marmoset 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.329
 is another version of 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.180
 of texture then what we do is a 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.030
 little vinyl tail we have a little bit of 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.409
 plastic noise in wall noise 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.760
 It can also be a gesture if you 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.129
 they have the cheese that is one in noise 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.469
 artistic but if not directly with the 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.870
 in noise and queues if we are going to add 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:09.540
 a little bit of sand to give a 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.849
 nice texture to this stone look 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.069
 according to the amount of flour that 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.400
 we are going to get thicker the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.319
 granulometry or less we can 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.069
 put a little bit more 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:27.280
 there we decided how many we like and 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.950
 let's apply it with a little brush 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.959
 small to not happen to us can be a 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.329
 Bristle brush does not need to be 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.819
 already has the mixture with the vinyl 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.209
 you need to put this vinyl tail 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.219
 first in the says then well let's go 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.760
 depositing the material first one 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:48.220
 amount let's put a little more 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.650
 and then what we do is give you these 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.420
 little touches when it starts to vary if you 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.849
 we give these little touches is going to be with 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.340
 the texture so characteristic of 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.970
 good piece then when this is already 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.500
 complete what I decided is to give something of 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.019
 Contrast with metallic colors 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.709
 so let's take a little bit of 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.170
 patinas in this golden case and we're going to 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.690
 start to pass on the stone run 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.100
 very nice is a patina to the water but 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.799
 it could also be a patina to the wax 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.960
 good that deleted this we can also 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.990
 illuminate with a patina a little more 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.750
 pearl clarita on one side and I tell you 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.240
 very fast the tips varnish the background in 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.430
 the finished one has a cracker of two 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.350
 components and in the cracks the bitumen of 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.410
 judea and one can directly put 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.690
 Judea bitumen and remove a little bit 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.729
 know in pasta if we want to give something 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.470
 more an effect on the old as in the 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.360
 cardinal I really like how the 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:52.110
 letter of the magazine that's why it's very 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.250
 well fine 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.849
 thank you very much to zone I hope that you 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.070
 like to do it but yes that's good 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.260
 we thank you very much already we know in another 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.389
 opportunity as well will be a pleasure 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.900
 good barbara we continue with 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.900
 much more
