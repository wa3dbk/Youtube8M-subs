outsider if you saw it down there at the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.980 
outsider if you saw it down there at the
bottom<00:02:50.500> i<00:02:50.980> really<00:02:51.550> like<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.880> card<00:02:52.150> too<00:02:52.390> but

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
bottom i really like this card too but

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.420 
bottom i really like this card too but
it's<00:02:53.290> not<00:02:53.380> better<00:02:53.680> than<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:53.920> Ronnie<00:02:54.160> law

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it's not better than that Ronnie law

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.360 
it's not better than that Ronnie law
I've<00:02:54.580> compared<00:02:54.940> every<00:02:55.300> single<00:02:55.660> stat<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
I've compared every single stat and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.160 
I've compared every single stat and
basically<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.550> kam<00:02:57.730> chancellor<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.360> worse<00:02:58.870> in

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
basically the kam chancellor is worse in

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.680 
basically the kam chancellor is worse in
every<00:02:59.470> category<00:02:59.650> but<00:03:00.250> hot<00:03:00.490> are<00:03:01.060> tied<00:03:01.420> with

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
every category but hot are tied with

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.270 
every category but hot are tied with
ronnie<00:03:01.900> Lott<00:03:02.140> in<00:03:02.260> every<00:03:02.410> category<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:03.100> hot

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
ronnie Lott in every category but hot

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.490 
ronnie Lott in every category but hot
that's<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.209> only<00:03:04.480> advantage<00:03:04.780> kam<00:03:05.140> chancellor

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
that's the only advantage kam chancellor

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.620 
that's the only advantage kam chancellor
has<00:03:05.740> so<00:03:06.430> I'm<00:03:06.520> going<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> keep<00:03:06.880> my<00:03:06.940> ronnie<00:03:07.330> Lott

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
has so I'm going to keep my ronnie Lott

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.600 
has so I'm going to keep my ronnie Lott
and<00:03:07.810> i'll<00:03:08.680> probably<00:03:08.890> end<00:03:09.010> up<00:03:09.160> selling<00:03:09.220> that

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
and i'll probably end up selling that

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.060 
and i'll probably end up selling that
kam<00:03:09.850> chancellor<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.630> then<00:03:11.380> over<00:03:11.709> on<00:03:11.740> my

I<00:04:39.130> really<00:04:39.340> like<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.550> car<00:04:39.759> cuz<00:04:39.940> finessin

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
I really like this car cuz finessin

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.040 
I really like this car cuz finessin
Power<00:04:40.810> Move<00:04:41.110> run<00:04:41.320> was<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.530> exact<00:04:42.070> same<00:04:42.430> and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
Power Move run was the exact same and

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.300 
Power Move run was the exact same and
he'll<00:04:44.050> shoot<00:04:44.289> through<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.590> gap<00:04:44.770> sometimes<00:04:45.190> I

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
he'll shoot through the gap sometimes I

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.830 
he'll shoot through the gap sometimes I
was<00:04:45.400> kind<00:04:45.610> of<00:04:45.639> like<00:04:45.789> why<00:04:46.060> don't<00:04:46.120> like<00:04:46.479> Casey

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
was kind of like why don't like Casey

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.330 
was kind of like why don't like Casey
because<00:04:47.080> his<00:04:47.350> finesse<00:04:47.650> move<00:04:47.830> isn't<00:04:48.009> a<00:04:48.130> good

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
because his finesse move isn't a good

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.159 
because his finesse move isn't a good
but<00:04:48.550> really<00:04:49.120> for<00:04:49.270> defensive<00:04:49.690> tackles<00:04:50.080> you

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
but really for defensive tackles you

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.420 
but really for defensive tackles you
really<00:04:50.380> don't<00:04:50.560> need<00:04:50.680> that<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:50.979> really<00:04:51.280> need

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
really don't need that you really need

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.420 
really don't need that you really need
more<00:04:51.610> power<00:04:51.910> move<00:04:52.300> but<00:04:53.259> I<00:04:53.710> really<00:04:54.130> like<00:04:54.280> this

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
more power move but I really like this

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.330 
more power move but I really like this
sap<00:04:54.699> card<00:04:55.229> he's<00:04:56.229> not<00:04:56.380> that<00:04:56.560> bad<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.039> either<00:04:57.130> as

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
sap card he's not that bad and either as

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.730 
sap card he's not that bad and either as
Casey<00:04:57.759> so<00:04:58.120> it's<00:04:58.270> kind<00:04:58.419> of<00:04:58.509> like<00:04:58.660> it<00:04:59.410> doesn't

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
Casey so it's kind of like it doesn't

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.960 
Casey so it's kind of like it doesn't
really<00:04:59.860> matter<00:05:00.099> which<00:05:00.340> one<00:05:00.550> you<00:05:00.580> use<00:05:00.669> because

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
really matter which one you use because

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.460 
really matter which one you use because
they're<00:05:01.150> both<00:05:01.330> basically<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.930> same<00:05:02.139> chord
