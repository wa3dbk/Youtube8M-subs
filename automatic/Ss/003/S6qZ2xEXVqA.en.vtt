00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
one and it's been a while since I made a

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.730 
one and it's been a while since I made a
video<00:00:08.370> but<00:00:09.330> I've<00:00:09.599> bought<00:00:09.960> some<00:00:10.170> trains<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
video but I've bought some trains in the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.560 
video but I've bought some trains in the
last<00:00:11.010> few<00:00:11.280> weeks<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.790> they<00:00:11.940> are<00:00:12.059> starting<00:00:12.420> to

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
last few weeks and they are starting to

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.450 
last few weeks and they are starting to
arrive<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.429> Trackmaster<00:00:15.330> Victor<00:00:16.460> now

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460

having<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.180> watched<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.690> Blue<00:00:19.050> Mountain

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
having just watched the Blue Mountain

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.759 
having just watched the Blue Mountain
mystery<00:00:19.859> movie<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:21.260> think<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.680> of

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
mystery movie I think it's kind of

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.560 
mystery movie I think it's kind of
fitting<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.279> will<00:00:23.430> start<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:23.910> Victor

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.089 

because<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:28.019> interesting<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.769> see<00:00:28.949> his

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
because it's interesting to see his

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.020 
because it's interesting to see his
backstory<00:00:31.850> well<00:00:32.850> they're<00:00:33.090> pretty<00:00:33.329> disturbing

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
backstory well they're pretty disturbing

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.160 
backstory well they're pretty disturbing
kind<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.149> cool<00:00:37.219> it's<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.430> newest<00:00:38.730> style<00:00:38.969> box

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.110 

the<00:00:43.170> most<00:00:43.770> 2012<00:00:44.399> engines<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:47.120> think

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the most 2012 engines have now I think

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
the most 2012 engines have now I think
that<00:00:48.600> I'll<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.870> switching<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.469> type<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that I'll be switching to this type of

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.520 
that I'll be switching to this type of
box<00:00:50.600> sooner<00:00:51.600> or<00:00:51.809> later

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.140 

and<00:00:55.040> I<00:00:55.190> think<00:00:55.280> it's<00:00:55.580> better<00:00:55.730> than<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.120> old

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
and I think it's better than the old

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.290 
and I think it's better than the old
type<00:00:56.630> that<00:00:57.220> used<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:58.310> hate<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:58.820> could<00:00:59.030> hang<00:00:59.180> on

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
type that used to hate you could hang on

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.870 
type that used to hate you could hang on
the<00:00:59.420> pegs<00:00:59.660> because<00:01:00.140> this<00:01:01.130> one<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:01.489> can<00:01:01.640> sort

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
the pegs because this one you can sort

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.470 
the pegs because this one you can sort
of<00:01:01.970> reseal<00:01:02.780> afterwards

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.690 

getting<00:01:09.480> out<00:01:09.750> nothing<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.770> held<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.220> by<00:01:11.250> some

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
getting out nothing is held in by some

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
getting out nothing is held in by some
sticks<00:01:14.300> as<00:01:15.300> per<00:01:15.930> usual<00:01:18.650> now<00:01:19.650> I've<00:01:19.830> got<00:01:20.010> him<00:01:20.160> on

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
sticks as per usual now I've got him on

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.170 
sticks as per usual now I've got him on
eBay

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
eBay

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.240 
eBay
he<00:01:21.480> cost<00:01:21.750> around<00:01:22.010> $20<00:01:23.010> or<00:01:23.370> so

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
he cost around $20 or so

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.250 
he cost around $20 or so
so<00:01:25.760> that's<00:01:26.030> quite<00:01:26.270> a<00:01:26.360> bit<00:01:26.540> cheaper<00:01:26.900> than<00:01:27.080> the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
so that's quite a bit cheaper than the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.580 
so that's quite a bit cheaper than the
stores<00:01:27.560> here<00:01:29.650> some<00:01:30.650> instructions<00:01:32.350> were<00:01:33.350> held

green<00:01:50.240> truck

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.010 

and<00:01:58.460> there<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.840> locomotive<00:02:00.550> itself<00:02:02.020> so

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.509 
all seem to be placed straight on the
back<00:03:24.110> panel<00:03:24.349> that<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.829> sticker

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
back panel that is a sticker

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:33.550 
back panel that is a sticker
I<00:03:27.790> think<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.970> side<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:31.420> plastic<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:33.349> there's

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
I think the side is plastic so there's

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.880 
I think the side is plastic so there's
no<00:03:33.709> sticker<00:03:34.099> there<00:03:34.780> well<00:03:35.780> let's<00:03:36.140> give<00:03:36.379> him<00:03:36.590> his
