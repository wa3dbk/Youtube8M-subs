first<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.729> all<00:01:09.820> bloating<00:01:10.509> is<00:01:10.720> nothing<00:01:11.110> but

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
first of all bloating is nothing but

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.270 
first of all bloating is nothing but
water<00:01:11.770> being<00:01:12.130> retains<00:01:12.850> in<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.750> body<00:01:14.280> that's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
water being retains in the body that's

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.889 
water being retains in the body that's
all<00:01:15.460> it<00:01:15.610> is<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:16.210> so<00:01:16.360> it's<00:01:16.539> pretty<00:01:16.720> much<00:01:16.840> like

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
all it is and so it's pretty much like

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.249 
all it is and so it's pretty much like
water<00:01:17.670> because<00:01:18.670> your<00:01:19.090> body<00:01:19.270> retains<00:01:19.750> water<00:01:19.840> so

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
water because your body retains water so

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.020 
water because your body retains water so
that<00:01:20.289> water<00:01:20.649> sticks<00:01:21.100> between<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.610> skin<00:01:22.000> and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
that water sticks between the skin and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.359 
that water sticks between the skin and
the<00:01:22.270> muscle<00:01:22.750> which<00:01:23.259> makes<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.679> look<00:01:23.920> like<00:01:24.190> you

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
the muscle which makes you look like you

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.830 
the muscle which makes you look like you
have<00:01:24.490> no<00:01:24.520> muscle<00:01:24.940> definition<00:01:24.970> if<00:01:25.539> you<00:01:25.630> have

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
one and also it just gonna make sure low

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.150 
one and also it just gonna make sure low
fat<00:01:28.660> but<00:01:28.899> you're<00:01:28.959> really<00:01:29.110> an<00:01:29.289> artist<00:01:29.590> because

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160

like<00:01:30.310> if<00:01:30.399> you<00:01:30.490> weight<00:01:30.670> yourself<00:01:30.789> you'll

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209 
like if you weight yourself you'll

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:32.639 
like if you weight yourself you'll
notice<00:01:31.539> that<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:31.840> are<00:01:31.869> be<00:01:32.050> exactly<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.590> same

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
notice that you are be exactly the same

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.969 
notice that you are be exactly the same
weight<00:01:32.979> but<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.880> know<00:01:33.970> just<00:01:34.149> look<00:01:34.330> like<00:01:34.509> this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
weight but you know just look like this

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.430 
weight but you know just look like this
so<00:01:35.979> unfortunate<00:01:36.910> we<00:01:37.090> passed<00:01:37.840> some<00:01:38.020> wage<00:01:38.200> but

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
so unfortunate we passed some wage but

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.260 
so unfortunate we passed some wage but
it's<00:01:38.590> not<00:01:38.770> much<00:01:39.039> to<00:01:39.520> make<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.700> difference<00:01:40.090> when

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
it's not much to make a difference when

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.490 
it's not much to make a difference when
you<00:01:40.330> weight<00:01:40.479> yourself<00:01:40.599> so<00:01:41.080> that's<00:01:41.200> why<00:01:41.380> it's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
you weight yourself so that's why it's

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.749 
you weight yourself so that's why it's
got<00:01:41.619> a<00:01:41.649> fresh<00:01:41.830> change<00:01:42.039> for<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> lot<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.520> people
