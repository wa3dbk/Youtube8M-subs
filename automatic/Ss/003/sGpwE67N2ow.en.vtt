00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
little project it's been a while since I

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.150 
little project it's been a while since I
should<00:00:15.240> did<00:00:15.360> something<00:00:15.660> really<00:00:16.349> scale<00:00:16.769> or<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
should did something really scale or the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.210 
should did something really scale or the
customs<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.659> terms<00:00:19.259> of<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.589> fabrication

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
customs so in terms of like fabrication

some<00:00:20.429> of<00:00:20.519> that<00:00:20.609> soap<00:00:20.999> I<00:00:21.539> picked<00:00:21.989> up<00:00:22.079> this

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
some of that soap I picked up this

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.370 
some of that soap I picked up this
chassis<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.210> 136<00:00:24.779> scale<00:00:24.989> so<00:00:25.199> let<00:00:25.319> me

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
chassis here so 136 scale so let me

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.929 
chassis here so 136 scale so let me
unbox<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.919> and<00:00:25.980> I'll<00:00:26.159> show<00:00:26.249> you<00:00:26.369> what<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.579> start

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
unbox it and I'll show you what I start

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:39.890 
unbox it and I'll show you what I start
up<00:00:27.029> plans<00:00:34.100> like<00:00:35.100> three<00:00:35.400> boxes<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.060> there<00:00:38.900> first

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
up plans like three boxes in there first

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.220 
up plans like three boxes in there first

portable charger your book with extra
two<00:00:59.460> different<00:00:59.730> pinions<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> Shabbat

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
two different pinions to a Shabbat

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.690 
two different pinions to a Shabbat
Eclipse<00:01:01.260> an<00:01:01.770> extra<00:01:02.270> extra<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.480> eclipse

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
Eclipse an extra extra for eclipse

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.459 
Eclipse an extra extra for eclipse
that's<00:01:05.700> out<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.119> won't<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.109> using<00:01:07.259> this

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
that's out there won't be using this

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:18.649 
that's out there won't be using this
stuff<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.969> get<00:01:18.090> eight<00:01:18.359> for<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
stuff so you get eight for the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:32.940 
stuff so you get eight for the
transmitter<00:01:19.139> and<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.249> the<00:01:20.780> charger

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.900 

see<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.190> for<00:01:34.460> last<00:01:36.520> better<00:01:37.520> we're<00:01:37.820> gonna

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
see that for last better we're gonna

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.620 
see that for last better we're gonna
have<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:40.390> whole<00:01:41.390> school

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
have the whole school

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:56.680 
have the whole school
27<00:01:44.630> megahertz<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:55.670> there's<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.910> rock<00:01:56.210> there

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
27 megahertz so there's a rock there

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.150 
27 megahertz so there's a rock there
antennas<00:01:57.260> inside<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.710> box<00:01:58.390> right<00:01:59.390> there

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
antennas inside the box right there

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.010 
antennas inside the box right there
so<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.000> won't<00:02:02.210> be<00:02:02.300> using<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.570> I'm<00:02:02.869> actually

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
so I won't be using that I'm actually

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.510 
so I won't be using that I'm actually
probably<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:03.560> see<00:02:03.740> if<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.920> can<00:02:04.570> put<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:06.520> computer

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
probably I see if I can put the computer

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.250 
probably I see if I can put the computer
some<00:02:07.790> conversion<00:02:08.540> in<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.810> that's<00:02:08.990> meant<00:02:09.200> for

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
some conversion in it that's meant for

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.770 
some conversion in it that's meant for
the<00:02:09.440> 124<00:02:10.010> steel<00:02:10.250> stuffing<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.880> was<00:02:11.450> looking<00:02:11.690> at

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the 124 steel stuffing I was looking at

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.960 
the 124 steel stuffing I was looking at
it<00:02:11.990> looks<00:02:12.140> sort<00:02:12.350> of<00:02:12.410> like<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.680> same<00:02:12.890> same<00:02:13.700> size

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
it looks sort of like the same same size

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.930 
it looks sort of like the same same size
and<00:02:14.240> everything<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:14.860> whole<00:02:15.860> thing<00:02:16.100> yet<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.490> fit

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and everything so whole thing yet to fit

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.940 
and everything so whole thing yet to fit
if<00:02:17.000> not<00:02:17.330> I'll<00:02:17.570> probably<00:02:17.810> do<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.590> Russia's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
if not I'll probably do the Russia's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.800 
if not I'll probably do the Russia's
conversion<00:02:19.459> on<00:02:19.670> there's<00:02:20.000> something<00:02:20.150> how<00:02:20.750> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
conversion on there's something how to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
conversion on there's something how to
I'll<00:02:20.959> figure<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.320> out

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
I'll figure it out

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:32.320 
I'll figure it out
so<00:02:22.790> put<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.180> here<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:29.270> then<00:02:31.239> we've<00:02:32.239> got

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
so put that in here and then we've got

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.470 
so put that in here and then we've got
the<00:02:32.480> truck<00:02:32.720> here<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:32.989> let<00:02:33.350> me<00:02:33.440> just<00:02:34.300> prep<00:02:35.300> these

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
the truck here so let me just prep these

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.750 
the truck here so let me just prep these
tires<00:02:35.840> here<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.769> here<00:02:36.950> we<00:02:37.070> go<00:02:37.220> we've<00:02:37.400> got<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
tires here so here we go we've got the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.970 
tires here so here we go we've got the
136<00:02:38.690> scale<00:02:39.519> desert<00:02:40.519> truck<00:02:41.410> pop<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.560> body<00:02:42.769> up

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
136 scale desert truck pop the body up

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.340 
136 scale desert truck pop the body up
here<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.100> can<00:02:46.310> show<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.670> preview

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
here so I can show you a preview

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.970 
here so I can show you a preview
hopefully<00:02:48.350> what's<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.769> become<00:02:49.070> this<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:50.980> I'm

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
hopefully what's to become this so I'm

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.390 
hopefully what's to become this so I'm
going<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.400> see<00:02:53.150> if<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.620> 2.7<00:02:54.620> I'm<00:02:55.070> sorry<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
going to see if the 2.7 I'm sorry the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.479 
going to see if the 2.7 I'm sorry the
2.4<00:02:55.880> gigahertz<00:02:56.830> conversion<00:02:57.830> will<00:02:57.980> fit<00:02:58.250> in

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
2.4 gigahertz conversion will fit in

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.580 
2.4 gigahertz conversion will fit in
here<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.970> looks<00:02:59.030> about<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.600> same<00:02:59.780> size<00:03:00.110> so

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
here it looks about the same size so

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.990 
here it looks about the same size so
hopefully<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.100> doesn't<00:03:01.310> mean<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.700> layouts

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
hopefully it doesn't mean the layouts

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.050 
hopefully it doesn't mean the layouts
the<00:03:02.150> same<00:03:02.360> on<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.570> crystals<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:05.480> we'll<00:03:05.630> see

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
the same on the crystals so we'll see

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.150 
the same on the crystals so we'll see
picked<00:03:08.060> up<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.299> few<00:03:08.330> hop<00:03:09.290> ups<00:03:09.970> at<00:03:10.970> cjz<00:03:12.010> these<00:03:13.010> are

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
picked up a few hop ups at cjz these are

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.060 
picked up a few hop ups at cjz these are

model kit see

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.740 
model kit see
and<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.260> was<00:03:42.440> really<00:03:42.650> intrigued<00:03:42.980> by<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:44.150> so

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
and I was really intrigued by it and so

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.000 
and I was really intrigued by it and so
I<00:03:44.780> picked<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.170> up<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.810> going<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.379> be<00:03:48.620> I

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
I picked it up and this is going to be I

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.890 
I picked it up and this is going to be I
guess<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.790> kid<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.269> from<00:03:50.450> Revell<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.170> it's<00:03:51.440> a

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
guess the kid is from Revell and it's a

guess the kid is from Revell and it's a
it<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:56.110> think<00:03:57.110> it's<00:03:57.319> a<00:03:57.409> thirty<00:03:57.680> it's<00:03:57.860> called

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
it is I think it's a thirty it's called

it is I think it's a thirty it's called
a<00:03:58.190> 32<00:03:59.530> Ford<00:04:00.530> sedan<00:04:01.129> so<00:04:02.000> there's<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:03.079> cab<00:04:03.349> there

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
a 32 Ford sedan so there's a cab there

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.069 
a 32 Ford sedan so there's a cab there
and<00:04:06.879> I'm<00:04:07.879> gonna<00:04:08.060> have<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.329> modify<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.750> back

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
and I'm gonna have to modify the back

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.979 
and I'm gonna have to modify the back
just<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.860> bit<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.220> fit<00:04:10.430> that<00:04:10.579> engine<00:04:11.150> fit<00:04:11.870> the

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
just a bit to fit that engine fit the

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.080 
just a bit to fit that engine fit the
motor<00:04:12.140> from<00:04:12.409> coming<00:04:12.709> out<00:04:12.769> but<00:04:13.549> as<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:13.760> can<00:04:13.879> see

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
motor from coming out but as you can see

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.659 
motor from coming out but as you can see
the<00:04:14.299> wheel<00:04:14.450> wells<00:04:14.690> are<00:04:14.840> pretty<00:04:15.049> nice<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.920> the

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
the wheel wells are pretty nice and the

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.729 
the wheel wells are pretty nice and the
width<00:04:16.850> of<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.150> is<00:04:17.539> pretty<00:04:17.959> decent<00:04:18.169> em<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.650> know

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
width of it is pretty decent em you know

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.289 
width of it is pretty decent em you know
look<00:04:19.010> they<00:04:19.160> all<00:04:19.250> have<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.459> wide<00:04:19.699> offset<00:04:20.120> but<00:04:20.269> I

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
look they all have a wide offset but I

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.310 
look they all have a wide offset but I
look<00:04:20.479> like<00:04:20.660> it's<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:21.049> know<00:04:21.109> muscle<00:04:21.590> car<00:04:21.799> and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
look like it's you know muscle car and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.279 
look like it's you know muscle car and
this<00:04:24.610> tub<00:04:25.610> is<00:04:25.639> really<00:04:26.210> narrow<00:04:26.419> but<00:04:27.169> it

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
this tub is really narrow but it

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.090 
this tub is really narrow but it
actually<00:04:27.440> fits<00:04:28.630> this<00:04:29.630> like<00:04:30.139> it<00:04:30.620> was<00:04:30.680> made<00:04:31.070> for

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
actually fits this like it was made for

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.460 
actually fits this like it was made for
it<00:04:31.430> so<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:32.120> actually<00:04:32.510> lucked<00:04:32.870> out<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.260> know<00:04:33.350> I

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
it so I actually lucked out I know I

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.909 
it so I actually lucked out I know I
actually<00:04:34.250> fit<00:04:34.669> this<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.900> 24<00:04:36.320> scale<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.830> it

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
actually fit this to the 24 scale and it

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.490 
actually fit this to the 24 scale and it
was<00:04:37.010> too<00:04:37.160> big<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.580> was<00:04:37.699> just<00:04:37.850> hoping<00:04:38.120> that

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
was too big and I was just hoping that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.469 
was too big and I was just hoping that
the<00:04:39.500> 36<00:04:40.100> scale<00:04:40.340> would<00:04:40.490> fit<00:04:40.760> so<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.030> tested<00:04:41.270> it

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
the 36 scale would fit so I tested it

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.310 
the 36 scale would fit so I tested it
cgz<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:42.530> fit<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.220> microti<00:04:44.000> so<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.020> just

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
cgz and it fit the the microti so I just

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.290 
cgz and it fit the the microti so I just
figured<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:46.190> get<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.520> desert<00:04:47.060> Trump

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
figured that I get the desert Trump

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.909 
figured that I get the desert Trump
because<00:04:47.570> it's<00:04:47.690> got<00:04:47.840> just<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.260> slightly<00:04:48.560> longer

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
because it's got just a slightly longer

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.629 
because it's got just a slightly longer
wheelbase<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:50.570> allow<00:04:50.900> for<00:04:51.380> you<00:04:52.370> know<00:04:52.490> the

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
wheelbase to allow for you know the

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.420 
wheelbase to allow for you know the
clearance<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.150> this<00:04:53.300> cab<00:04:53.539> and<00:04:54.169> then<00:04:55.070> in<00:04:55.280> the

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
clearance of this cab and then in the

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.170 
clearance of this cab and then in the
front<00:04:55.610> of<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:57.200> bumper<00:04:57.380> there<00:04:57.789> we've<00:04:58.789> got<00:04:58.940> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
front of the bumper there we've got the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.920 
front of the bumper there we've got the
grille<00:04:59.450> for<00:04:59.810> it<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:01.240> it's<00:05:02.240> gonna<00:05:02.419> look<00:05:02.690> like<00:05:02.750> a

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
grille for it so it's gonna look like a

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.159 
grille for it so it's gonna look like a
hot<00:05:03.169> rod<00:05:03.470> I<00:05:03.800> mean<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.310> can<00:05:04.460> sort<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:04.729> see<00:05:05.270> what

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
hot rod I mean you can sort of see what

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.610 
hot rod I mean you can sort of see what
I'm<00:05:06.200> going<00:05:06.560> for<00:05:06.650> there<00:05:07.240> so<00:05:08.240> I<00:05:08.539> say<00:05:09.349> quick
