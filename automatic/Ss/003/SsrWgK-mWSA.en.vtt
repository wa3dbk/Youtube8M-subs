00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.840
 yes 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.600
 very good everyone to a new video of 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.850
 millet legendary weapon of sport more 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.230
 quickly and well he believes teach the 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.090
 legendary torque shotgun too 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.980
 known as the flaquer to get 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.220
 this shotgun we will have to kill a 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.320
 boss who is going to release this flaquer in 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.880
 the mission all that other small 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.790
 to achieve this mission we will have to 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.830
 go before to the triton plains that 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.290
 will be here in the rewards panel 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.120
 accept this mission and save the game 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.770
 because diego saves the game because 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.840
 this boss is only going out once 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.730
 once we kill him and he has not released us 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.440
 the weapon if we save the game is not going to 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.440
 come back out so have this in 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.290
 account save the game before and go to 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.420
 kill it and if you do not release it then if you are 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.550
 in console just turn off the console 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.590
 or go to the start menu without saving the 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.120
 starting if you are started there is a way 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.590
 easier to do what is to take the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.180
 saved game folder 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.680
 documents to teach how to get there 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.410
 that folder 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.630
 and if you do not release it then take the game 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.700
 saved that I had chosen before and 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.650
 exchange for the one that was already in the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.710
 game when you have already killed the monster 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.160
 well we have to go first for this 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.600
 site 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.610
 liver of stanton that is this site that 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.310
 I just pointed on the map and once 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.619
 we have here on the site this we will have 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.390
 that part of the mission and make a 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.490
 small puzzle that is very simple now 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.290
 it is taught of many two are made 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.720
 seconds we make that little puzzle 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.710
 so that the little ones come out 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.810
 enemies that we are going to have to go 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.610
 killing who are going to be stork 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.490
 and when we kill the first 5 tork 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.100
 we'll get the little boss the little author 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.020
 boss that if they kill him he may release it 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.280
 the skinny here comes the little puzzle 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.540
 what we have to do is very simple 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.090
 we just have to give the valve 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.360
 central and then the valve to the valve 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.070
 right and already there would be done 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.070
 is one of the simplest points that 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.229
 I've seen in the whole game but it's good 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.490
 better not to leave a zen puzzle if it is 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.320
 simple that can be done in a 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.600
 moment a puzzle is super 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.210
 complicated to take us half an hour 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.310
 let's kill the little ones I'm here 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.929
 what we have to rescue the monads 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.729
 but the aunt is realizes that the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.920
 monada are not really Mo'Nique but 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.720
 that are a fucking shit and says that the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.000
 kill everyone so we have to 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.590
 kill the not so adorable storcks and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.260
 once we killed five of them we 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.790
 the torque will be even more disgusting than 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.220
 it is hector who is going to be the one who releases the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.980
 flaquer as I said I remember what 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.870
 same in case you have not heard this one 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.910
 torque only comes out once 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.850
 once only so they keep the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.440
 and if not starting out this 6 if you dare 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.710
 I said I'll kill him and unresolved the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.200
 flaquer 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.810
 copy the saved game to pc and the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.640
 you get in the game or 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.830
 it just came out of the console without 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.540
 save the game so you can 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.980
 kill him again to have a one 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.770
 probability that you release this weapon 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.730
 here I will teach how to do pc 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.710
 we have to go to the start menu and 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.780
 here in the normal menu I already had it 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.780
 saved the game we will have to leave 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.810
 to my documents my game order the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.180
 priest and strain huilo huilo game save 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.610
 data and a lot of numbers in a bunch 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.930
 of numbers we remove the game we paste 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.270
 which we already have saved before 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.660
 accept the mission and return to the game 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.640
 choose by choosing the character because if 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.560
 we do not say the character does not go it's not going to 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.620
 load that game once we choose it 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.970
 we give to continue and we will be in 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.000
 the part where we had not yet accepted 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.319
 the mission here I will jump to the part 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.870
 where I get the flaquer that is a 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.329
 they did not leave that with about ten attempts 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.909
 or about fifteen remind us of the same 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.129
 but good here the boss comes out I kill him 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.849
 and I get the flaquer anyway 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.319
 neither is it a very good soul in itself to not 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.700
 be that you use a trick that I will teach 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.650
 now in the shooting test is not a weapon 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.450
 ammunition yes but if you use the copy trick 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.340
 in signal now or to go pretty well 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.019
 here you see I'm using I'm 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.209
 shooting from the bullets two by two 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.060
 because I do a double shot and I left a 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.260
 video explaining how it's done in another 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.930
 at another time I will make a video for 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.280
 teach how the double shot is made but 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.069
 anyway, even if he does 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.930
 that is a super special does not have 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.030
 pretty good exclusive damage but if 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.310
 we are very close or very far from the 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.039
 enemies we're going to make you nothing here 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.630
 you see that I have to be at a distance 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.180
 concrete to do something to them and what if 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.639
 I am either too far away or very close to you not 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.620
 I'm going to do nothing to them here, the 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.900
 way of the pirate ship so the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.849
 I killed with one shot but already here it kills me 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.190
 uncle this and I get it I do not know how 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.550
 Relive so much distance with the flaquer 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.940
 but good 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.000
 and here and I teach her a little skinny 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.190
 operating in a more clear site 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.570
 in a more open area because it's not in 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.910
 a more closed area 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.320
 the explosions will stay closer together 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.600
 but an open area stay a little 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.190
 even more expanded if you use this 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.860
 trick that I'm going to do now could 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.020
 kill almost any enemy even to 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.850
 the heads of a shot 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.010
 you have done a beastly harm like I have 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.170
 done this damage simply because the 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.410
 I'll just talk more extended in 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.720
 another video the flaquer the damage that does 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.340
 does the damage of the weapon that we carry in the 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.800
 hand when all the explosions come out 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.080
 each of those explosions will have the 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.520
 damage of the flaquer that is 5000 but if 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.170
 we change quickly to a missile launcher 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.310
 that for example I have the nucleus that 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.320
 has 100 111,000 each explosion of the 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.240
 flag airbag is going to do that 111 thousand 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.170
 as it would be like about 500 more damage 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.880
 about 50 times more damage so you know 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.460
 if you use this trick could kill 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.950
 to the final heads of practically a 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.840
 shot so you will not try to try it anymore 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.320
 I will make a video explaining a little better 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.280
 in another moment 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.870
 and nothing 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.130
 and well this has been everything but that 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.200
 liked the video if it has served well 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.430
 You know I could give you a like comment 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.600
 have any suggestions and subscribe 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.800
 for more in the description leave the 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.090
 twitter of the channel so that you can 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.680
 pass the photo of the legendary you go 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.180
 getting with my methods and over 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.830
 forward the recovery with all of them 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.690
 and I have enough I'll also leave 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.190
 the steam group in case you do not have to 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.450
 nobody to play with ordering pri si 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.580
 which in the team group always 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.990
 you will find someone who plays board 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.820
 in the psyche the safest thing is that 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.139
 play in Spanish so nothing that 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.139
 have a good day and until next time 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.500
 I like to dance and thank you I understand 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.150
 point of view for a long time 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.250
 resistance needed someone like you 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.250
 See you on another adventure
