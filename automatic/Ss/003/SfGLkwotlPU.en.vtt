00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.279

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.279
 case review have fun 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.990
 yes this case comes from the company tank 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.970
 as you can see here and is for that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.240
 new iphone 5 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.869
 the case is called grischa the case 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.849
 will be delivered in this packaging 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.890
 kept green and white 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.690
 here is still such a small front 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.140
 hole where you feel the case again 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.950
 can 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.250
 and yes, everything is free here with it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.500
 I also see the wonderful case 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.410
 I have the transparent case here now 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.440
 I chose it because it is very good 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.329
 looks natural to the white iphone 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 there is the case in other colors of the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.050
 link to amazon is below in the video 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.500
 description there is still blue there 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.360
 touchpen which has the old channel 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.310
 I also link you to a video 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.070
 again below 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.960
 and now I just do the pace 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.369
 It's easy on the iphone 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.270
 because this case is a tipi cases and tokio 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.000
 means that it's just a plastic 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.030
 nice cases but what you think too 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.170
 can turn very well so rubbery 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.530
 Let's say it like this 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.650
 As you can see, I now have the case 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.420
 times rang the iphone and I think 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.079
 It actually looks very good to me 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.430
 you also like the bar cases 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.880
 this black border 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.490
 I think it's a bit much because 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.430
 you can see the aluminum bit 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.670
 but not so much here and 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.969
 took the pool logo again and yes 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.890
 you can see it 's an iphone 5 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.920
 I had a turn on the black iphone 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.790
 So my buddy because you can not see that 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.960
 so good because it's a bit dark 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.470
 yes, the case has a small leonard 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.470
 able design and yes I think is one 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.430
 very successful case is available for 9 euros 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.890
 95 So this variant and yes now 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.260
 We come once to the whole recess 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.830
 on the left side we can see the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.500
 see the savings for the news and 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.450
 the two volume regulators are 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.550
 been covered and I find them 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.610
 can be quite hard to press 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.730
 like the power button up here 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.250
 You can also serve very bad 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.670
 down here I think that's very good 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.990
 that is all individually spared as one 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.300
 So good can be seen here then micro 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.050
 Speakers suffer from cables and headphones 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:02.010
 entrance on this side we have 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.489
 unfortunately no recess for the sim-lock 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.239
 and here on the right side we have 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:13.650
 again the bar writing so that's it 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:17.310

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.160
