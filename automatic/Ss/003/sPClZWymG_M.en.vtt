00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.780
 long bewerbung room at the end of the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.059
 other room but i hope that i will 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.160
 anyway, because I'm not really good at it 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.390
 was and that's why I do it now 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.039
 also and so I have something for you 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.680
 but do not say today 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.269
 factory has the compact considered and 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.029
 I hope that in some with you 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.779
 also affect world will not enter 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.910
 not all 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.559
 and here I start with the first one 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 i was definitely the one we know 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.850
 quite a lot of you are over here 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.000
 so far cross the zebra crossing 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.530
 with street and easy here all 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.239
 times the topic will rise then goes 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.690
 you always exactly the spaces between 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.039
 black white black and so does 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.230
 the fuel we will not each 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.090
 I am allowed to drink on that belief 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.090
 I'm not the only one this market though 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.559
 we do everything unconsciously and have to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.899
 I was not so aware of that 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.000
 we actually say rider in that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.340
 everyday life make that the normal people 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.560
 the country think in the second act m 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.990
 the child also determines a lot of 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.170
 you if your mother in Saxony we 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.659
 that david hottman out which 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.119
 and so said in the old how 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.090
 in the next room song or virus is 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.460
 no you gallop or play 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.840
 appearances 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.310
 I always do that but I am 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 Unconsciously I just go and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.040
 example at the stairs comes to speak 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.040
 we jump about how international 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.420
 do more 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.939
 I think I would be the 1 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.830
 I'm pretty sure if you 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.790
 Forest walk with parents with one 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.790
 Dog on the road does not know what you do 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.729
 lawyer makes and then comes a fat 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.100
 log in the middle of the road at random 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.710
 and you happen to gallop on the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.149
 building condition and jumps randomly 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.200
 like a horse over the tree trunk 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.300
 who knows then the next fact is 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.250
 Definitely a thing I do 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.500
 actually always simple or mine 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.209
 imagine 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.010
 So if you drive with a car 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.130
 a country road and right next to you 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.630
 and over all lousy and then comes 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.180
 great you guys what you think wow 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.920
 really good song and then you think 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.680
 you have aligned them this way 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.739
 just so casually could push the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.239
 windows harisch for could and me with it 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.430
 raid looks of BMW AG 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.989
 I have that too I write that one 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.130
 the thing with it the rider at all 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.459
 do not talk and what actually knows 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.340
 not as I say it now but for example in 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.430
 nobody thinks of any riding 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.390
 further into the human chain looks for 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.880
 so valued or leather boots continue 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.989
 Think things in cycling at all 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.829
 not proven and what do actually 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.359
 as the people partly already beginning 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.209
 year to the next clock and so on 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:09.170
 last but not least we talk 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.600
 not so I do not like it 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.989
 and that is also descending one 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.060
 Great tennis a dramatic sport 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.400
 performance and I would really have 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.829
 say it 's olympic one on one 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.670
 but eighty worth it 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.440
 nobody talks about it 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.810
 everyone just goes out and explains 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.269
 drowsy and nobody talks about it 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.130
 how exhausting it actually is 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.400
 also for the last day and I believe it 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.030
 is one of the facts that you too 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.550
 most have 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.470
 it concerns and two men becomes 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.410
 passing them and I think so 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.660
 Woltering immediately fixes the eyes 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:58.959
 the fields things and he free and hers 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:04:01.030
 space and I think to myself still so up 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.370
 on three times the horse in it 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.660
 you kind of ask are support so 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.190
 I think that last time 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.750
 joy with both skaters so 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.750
 founded by the women and to do 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:22.690
 and less than his horse falls away 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:24.550
 The video will give me when I hope I 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.870
 have recently fallen and I 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.940
 me in the small look against the 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.680
 travel world team and maybe because 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.790
 I write even more facts 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.620
 please the comments 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.139
 People could still join us 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.669
 Do it because I'm the series very much 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.380
 cool because you just have a look 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.300
 The tires can be learned a little bit 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.040
 actually too typical but in the 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.770
 Endeffekt can be noticed because it finally 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.720
 Everyone will be so self-evident 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.310
 and taken together in it 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.310
 come and see
