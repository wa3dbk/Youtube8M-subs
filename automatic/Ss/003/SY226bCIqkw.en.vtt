not<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> all<00:00:46.320> everything<00:00:47.100> else<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
not like it all everything else for the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.490 
not like it all everything else for the
most<00:00:47.610> part<00:00:47.940> I've<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.480> enjoyed<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.230> this

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

main colors that you want as matte

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
main colors that you want as matte
shadows<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.180> always<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.719> match

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.219 
transition shade always a matte brow
bone<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.659> mean<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.140> have

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
bone in there I mean you can have

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
bone in there I mean you can have
shimmer<00:02:01.530> as<00:02:01.740> well<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.460> think<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.729> matte<00:02:02.939> one

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
shimmer as well but I think a matte one

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.359 
shimmer as well but I think a matte one
is<00:02:03.360> typical<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.320> almost<00:02:04.560> everybody<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
is typical for almost everybody and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.730 
is typical for almost everybody and
again<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> matte<00:02:06.540> darker<00:02:06.930> shades<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
again with the matte darker shades the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.710 
again with the matte darker shades the
lighter<00:02:07.950> shades<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.520> absolutely<00:02:08.910> despise<00:02:09.239> I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
lighter shades I absolutely despise I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.559 
lighter shades I absolutely despise I
was<00:02:09.989> having<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.470> high<00:02:10.890> hopes<00:02:11.099> about

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
was having really high hopes about

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.800 
was having really high hopes about
this<00:02:11.659> transition<00:02:12.049> shade<00:02:12.469> right<00:02:12.799> here<00:02:13.060> but<00:02:14.060> you

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
this transition shade right here but you

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.479 
this transition shade right here but you
couldn't<00:02:15.230> even<00:02:15.319> see<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.680> on<00:02:15.739> my<00:02:15.859> eye<00:02:15.889> like<00:02:16.340> it

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
couldn't even see it on my eye like it

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.979 
couldn't even see it on my eye like it
wasn't<00:02:16.700> pigmented<00:02:17.239> enough<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.659> where<00:02:17.810> you

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
wasn't pigmented enough to where you

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.539 
wasn't pigmented enough to where you
could<00:02:18.139> see<00:02:18.349> that<00:02:18.590> definition<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.370> was

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
could see that definition this was

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:20.979 
could see that definition this was
actually<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.909> first<00:02:20.180> color<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.659> applied

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
actually the first color that I applied

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.479 
actually the first color that I applied
to<00:02:21.170> my<00:02:21.290> eyes<00:02:21.469> as<00:02:21.799> my<00:02:21.950> transition<00:02:22.459> shade

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
to my eyes as my transition shade

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.160 
to my eyes as my transition shade
because<00:02:22.939> it<00:02:23.329> looks<00:02:23.540> like<00:02:23.719> it<00:02:23.870> would<00:02:23.989> be<00:02:24.019> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
because it looks like it would be the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.309 
because it looks like it would be the
perfect<00:02:24.889> kind<00:02:25.129> of<00:02:25.249> color<00:02:25.459> for<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:26.139> but<00:02:27.139> it's

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
perfect kind of color for that but it's

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.949 
perfect kind of color for that but it's
not<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.859> was<00:02:28.159> really<00:02:28.459> disappointed<00:02:28.670> in<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.299> this

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
not I was really disappointed in it this

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.520 
not I was really disappointed in it this
shade<00:02:30.230> right<00:02:30.469> next<00:02:31.099> to<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.639> had<00:02:32.060> such<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.319> high

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
shade right next to it I had such a high

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.949 
shade right next to it I had such a high
hopes<00:02:33.829> for<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.159> you<00:02:34.760> swatch<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.689> it<00:02:35.840> is

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
hopes for this you swatch it and it is

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.679 
hopes for this you swatch it and it is
absolutely<00:02:36.709> stunning<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:37.790> look<00:02:38.120> at<00:02:38.269> that<00:02:38.450> I

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
absolutely stunning like look at that I

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.470 
absolutely stunning like look at that I
applied<00:02:39.439> it<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.620> my<00:02:39.980> eyes<00:02:40.159> and<00:02:40.579> it<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.879> so

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
applied it to my eyes and it is so

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.839 
applied it to my eyes and it is so
difficult<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.530> blend<00:02:42.739> now<00:02:43.099> I<00:02:43.129> will<00:02:43.430> say<00:02:43.609> that

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
difficult to blend now I will say that

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.220 
difficult to blend now I will say that
the<00:02:44.000> darker<00:02:44.269> shades<00:02:44.510> obviously<00:02:45.049> do<00:02:45.200> have

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
the darker shades obviously do have

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.629 
the darker shades obviously do have
better<00:02:45.590> pigmentation<00:02:46.250> than<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.459> lighter

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
better pigmentation than the lighter

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.610 
better pigmentation than the lighter
shades<00:02:46.969> but<00:02:47.180> usually<00:02:47.629> that's<00:02:48.079> just<00:02:48.349> how<00:02:48.469> it

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
shades but usually that's just how it

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.899 
shades but usually that's just how it
goes<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:49.040> darker<00:02:49.310> shades<00:02:49.489> are<00:02:49.609> always<00:02:49.819> gonna

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
goes the darker shades are always gonna

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.580 
goes the darker shades are always gonna
have<00:02:50.120> more<00:02:50.239> pigmentation<00:02:50.750> because<00:02:51.260> they're

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
have more pigmentation because they're

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.520 
have more pigmentation because they're
darker<00:02:52.099> let<00:02:52.519> me<00:02:52.609> just<00:02:52.790> say<00:02:52.939> this<00:02:53.209> black<00:02:53.629> is<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
choppiness black ever it's not smooth it

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
with this I absolutely do not think it's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.439

worth<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.799> money<00:03:51.979> this<00:03:52.340> will<00:03:52.489> not<00:03:52.669> be<00:03:52.879> used<00:03:53.120> at

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
worth the money this will not be used at

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.199 
worth the money this will not be used at
all<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.109> may<00:03:54.709> have<00:03:55.069> high<00:03:55.280> expectations<00:03:56.120> but

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
all I may have high expectations but

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.749 
all I may have high expectations but
when<00:03:56.599> you<00:03:56.689> pay<00:03:56.870> $80<00:03:57.500> or<00:03:57.680> something<00:03:58.009> you<00:03:58.340> expect

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759 
when you pay $80 or something you expect

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.089 
when you pay $80 or something you expect
those<00:03:58.879> high<00:03:59.090> expectations<00:03:59.840> to<00:03:59.930> be<00:04:00.290> met<00:04:00.500> that's

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
those high expectations to be met that's

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.770 
those high expectations to be met that's
