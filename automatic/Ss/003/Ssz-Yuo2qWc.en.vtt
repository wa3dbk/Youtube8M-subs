that's<00:04:35.520> nice<00:04:35.760> like<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.930> inside<00:04:37.650> is

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
that's nice like that the inside is

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.550 
that's nice like that the inside is
white<00:04:38.040> brings<00:04:38.669> out<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:39.060> outsole<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:40.020> lot<00:04:40.470> of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
white brings out that outsole a lot of

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.200 
white brings out that outsole a lot of
people<00:04:40.800> complain<00:04:41.130> about<00:04:41.160> that<00:04:41.580> actually

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
people complain about that actually

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.270 
people complain about that actually
which<00:04:42.510> is<00:04:42.540> surprising<00:04:43.260> because<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:44.010> really

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
which is surprising because I really

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.740 
which is surprising because I really
thought<00:04:44.460> matched<00:04:45.240> well

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
thought matched well

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.080 
thought matched well
or<00:04:45.900> else.you<00:04:46.290> to<00:04:46.590> have<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> random<00:04:47.729> white

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
or else.you to have a random white

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.860 
or else.you to have a random white
outsole<00:04:48.530> but<00:04:50.210> really<00:04:51.210> looking<00:04:51.450> forward<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.840> a

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
outsole but really looking forward to a

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.870 
outsole but really looking forward to a
plane<00:04:52.169> in<00:04:52.350> these<00:04:52.500> guys

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
plane in these guys

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.360 
plane in these guys
the<00:04:54.030> only<00:04:54.210> other<00:04:54.360> 28<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:54.960> have<00:04:55.250> are<00:04:56.250> the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
the only other 28 I have are the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.120 
the only other 28 I have are the
original<00:04:56.880> ones<00:04:56.910> that<00:04:57.240> release<00:04:57.539> your<00:04:58.440> black<00:04:58.770> I

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
original ones that release your black I

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.409 
original ones that release your black I
like<00:04:59.700> your<00:04:59.880> green<00:05:00.080> these<00:05:01.080> aren't<00:05:01.350> here<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:02.419> I

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
like your green these aren't here and I

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.980 
like your green these aren't here and I
like<00:05:03.690> those<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.930> lot<00:05:04.020> does<00:05:04.380> it<00:05:04.530> dope<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.840> one

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
like those a lot does it dope to but one

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.340 
like those a lot does it dope to but one
thing<00:05:07.520> is<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:09.260> translucent<00:05:10.260> sole<00:05:12.350> the

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
thing is the translucent sole the

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.920 
thing is the translucent sole the
translucent<00:05:14.280> sole<00:05:14.460> just<00:05:14.700> dust<00:05:15.419> tends<00:05:15.780> to

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
translucent sole just dust tends to

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.620 
translucent sole just dust tends to
stick<00:05:16.200> more<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.530> translucent<00:05:17.400> soles<00:05:17.640> and<00:05:17.940> so<00:05:18.600> I

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
stick more to translucent soles and so I

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.770 
stick more to translucent soles and so I
just<00:05:18.840> had<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.050> to<00:05:19.650> wipe<00:05:20.210> more<00:05:21.210> often<00:05:21.570> than<00:05:21.750> I

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
just had a to wipe more often than I

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.230 
just had a to wipe more often than I
would<00:05:21.990> in<00:05:22.169> a<00:05:22.260> solid<00:05:22.620> rubber<00:05:22.770> but<00:05:23.640> I<00:05:23.669> mean<00:05:23.850> it's

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
would in a solid rubber but I mean it's

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.279 
would in a solid rubber but I mean it's
not<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.419> big<00:05:24.630> deal<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:24.930> me

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
not a big deal to me

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.430 
not a big deal to me
it's<00:05:25.710> just<00:05:25.950> I'm<00:05:26.820> hoping<00:05:27.270> that's<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.140> solid

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
it's just I'm hoping that's a solid

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.950 
it's just I'm hoping that's a solid
rubber<00:05:28.590> on<00:05:28.800> carbon<00:05:29.700> fibers<00:05:30.090> just<00:05:30.450> I<00:05:30.660> won't

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
rubber on carbon fibers just I won't

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.950 
rubber on carbon fibers just I won't
have<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.169> worry<00:05:31.320> about<00:05:31.350> wiping<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:31.979> know<00:05:32.100> just
