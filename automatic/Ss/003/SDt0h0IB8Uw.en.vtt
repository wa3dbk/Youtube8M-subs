hi<00:00:17.200> this<00:00:17.260> is<00:00:17.710> melissa<00:00:18.340> with<00:00:18.490> stitch<00:00:18.730> saying

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
hi this is melissa with stitch saying

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.150 
hi this is melissa with stitch saying
that<00:00:19.300> calm<00:00:19.810> and<00:00:20.110> today<00:00:20.410> we're<00:00:20.710> going<00:00:20.830> to<00:00:20.950> talk

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
that calm and today we're going to talk

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.280 
that calm and today we're going to talk
a<00:00:21.400> little<00:00:21.670> bit<00:00:22.029> about<00:00:22.060> swatching<00:00:22.900> de<00:00:23.050> Leite

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
a little bit about swatching de Leite

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.650 
a little bit about swatching de Leite
now<00:00:24.009> swatching<00:00:24.490> de<00:00:24.610> gauge<00:00:24.790> is<00:00:25.000> important<00:00:25.480> for

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
now swatching de gauge is important for

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.560 
now swatching de gauge is important for
two<00:00:25.900> reasons<00:00:26.340> one<00:00:27.340> if<00:00:27.670> your<00:00:27.849> gauge<00:00:28.060> is<00:00:28.330> not

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
two reasons one if your gauge is not

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.380 
two reasons one if your gauge is not
accurate<00:00:29.170> you<00:00:29.410> could<00:00:29.890> end<00:00:30.220> up<00:00:30.400> with<00:00:30.669> a<00:00:30.730> project

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
accurate you could end up with a project

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.350 
accurate you could end up with a project
that<00:00:31.900> is<00:00:32.260> larger<00:00:32.800> or<00:00:33.010> smaller<00:00:33.489> than<00:00:34.030> you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
that is larger or smaller than you

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.689 
that is larger or smaller than you
intended<00:00:34.629> it<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.140> be<00:00:35.260> so<00:00:35.890> swatching<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.489> gauge

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
intended it to be so swatching the gauge

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.049 
intended it to be so swatching the gauge
is<00:00:37.260> critical<00:00:38.260> for<00:00:38.590> projects<00:00:39.190> that<00:00:39.220> are<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.970> be

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
is critical for projects that are to be

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.280 
is critical for projects that are to be
a<00:00:40.090> certain<00:00:40.690> size<00:00:41.879> secondly<00:00:42.879> if<00:00:43.120> your<00:00:43.510> gauge<00:00:43.870> is

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
a certain size secondly if your gauge is

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.160 
a certain size secondly if your gauge is
not<00:00:44.320> correct<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:45.129> could<00:00:45.690> run<00:00:46.690> out<00:00:46.809> of<00:00:46.840> yarn

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
not correct you could run out of yarn

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.170 
not correct you could run out of yarn
and<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.739> is<00:00:47.920> never<00:00:48.339> a<00:00:48.460> good<00:00:48.640> thing<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.379> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
and that is never a good thing and so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.729 
and that is never a good thing and so
we're<00:00:52.180> going<00:00:52.269> to<00:00:52.330> begin<00:00:52.510> by<00:00:53.110> talking<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.620> little

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
we're going to begin by talking a little

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.460 
we're going to begin by talking a little
bit<00:00:53.920> about<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.790> gauge<00:00:55.030> that<00:00:55.690> can<00:00:55.870> be<00:00:55.989> found<00:00:56.170> at

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
bit about the gauge that can be found at

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.860 
bit about the gauge that can be found at
the<00:00:56.650> beginning<00:00:56.860> of<00:00:57.339> your<00:00:57.640> pattern<00:00:58.030> so<00:00:58.540> pick<00:00:58.720> up

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
the beginning of your pattern so pick up

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.740 
the beginning of your pattern so pick up
any<00:00:59.140> pattern<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.920> at<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.699> front<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.330> the

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
any pattern and at the front of the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.990 
any pattern and at the front of the
instructions<00:01:02.290> usually<00:01:02.890> at<00:01:02.979> the<00:01:03.129> top<00:01:03.159> you're

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
instructions usually at the top you're

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.530 
instructions usually at the top you're
going<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.299> see<00:01:04.600> a<00:01:05.670> heading<00:01:06.670> called<00:01:06.850> gauge<00:01:07.180> and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
going to see a heading called gauge and

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.190 
going to see a heading called gauge and
it<00:01:07.690> will<00:01:07.810> say<00:01:07.990> something<00:01:08.049> like<00:01:09.690> 11<00:01:10.690> double

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
it will say something like 11 double

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.370 
it will say something like 11 double
crochets<00:01:11.619> per<00:01:12.040> 4<00:01:12.369> inches<00:01:12.790> or<00:01:13.270> 11<00:01:14.020> double

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
crochets per 4 inches or 11 double

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.609 
crochets per 4 inches or 11 double
crochets<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.159> 6<00:01:15.460> rows<00:01:15.760> per<00:01:16.150> 4<00:01:16.360> inches<00:01:16.750> that's

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
crochets and 6 rows per 4 inches that's

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.469 
crochets and 6 rows per 4 inches that's
what<00:01:17.830> mine<00:01:18.040> says<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.610> says<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.180> can<00:01:19.360> be

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
what mine says it says that it can be

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.410 
what mine says it says that it can be
obtained<00:01:19.930> with<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.710> size<00:01:21.300> G<00:01:22.300> hook<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:25.210> is

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
obtained with a size G hook now that is

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.610 
obtained with a size G hook now that is
a<00:01:25.450> good<00:01:25.690> place<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:25.930> start

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
a good place to start

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.280 
a good place to start
begin<00:01:26.950> your<00:01:27.040> gauge<00:01:27.400> swatch<00:01:27.640> with<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.630> size<00:01:28.840> G

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
begin your gauge swatch with the size G

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.840 
begin your gauge swatch with the size G
hook<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.680> want<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.950> make<00:01:30.070> a<00:01:30.100> foundation<00:01:30.430> chain

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
hook you want to make a foundation chain

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.580 
hook you want to make a foundation chain
that<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.660> going<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.900> be<00:01:32.020> long<00:01:32.290> enough<00:01:32.530> to

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
that is going to be long enough to

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.850 
that is going to be long enough to
measure<00:01:33.070> at<00:01:33.550> least<00:01:33.580> 4<00:01:34.330> inches<00:01:34.690> I<00:01:34.990> recommend<00:01:35.500> 6

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
measure at least 4 inches I recommend 6

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.040 
measure at least 4 inches I recommend 6
so<00:01:36.400> that<00:01:36.550> you<00:01:36.640> can<00:01:36.820> take<00:01:37.060> foam<00:01:37.330> measurements

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
so that you can take foam measurements

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.640 
so that you can take foam measurements
in<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.530> several<00:01:39.100> areas<00:01:39.280> of<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.820> swatch<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.590> I'm

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
in in several areas of the swatch so I'm

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.960 
in in several areas of the swatch so I'm
going<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.830> start<00:01:42.010> with<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.160> foundation<00:01:42.310> chain

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
going to start with a foundation chain

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.190 
going to start with a foundation chain
and<00:01:43.000> then<00:01:43.270> you're<00:01:43.420> going<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.570> begin<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.900> just

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
and then you're going to begin to just

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.350 
and then you're going to begin to just
work<00:01:44.590> in<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.980> stitch<00:01:45.220> that<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.820> gauge<00:01:46.030> calls

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
work in the stitch that the gauge calls

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.120 
work in the stitch that the gauge calls
for<00:01:46.630> in<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:46.900> case<00:01:47.110> it<00:01:47.320> called<00:01:47.530> for<00:01:47.800> double

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
for in this case it called for double

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.190 
for in this case it called for double
crochets<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:48.730> I<00:01:48.760> have<00:01:49.060> worked<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.540> series<00:01:50.170> of

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
crochets so I have worked a series of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.350 
crochets so I have worked a series of
rows<00:01:50.620> in<00:01:50.950> double<00:01:51.400> crochet<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:55.000> worked<00:01:55.210> it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
rows in double crochet and I worked it

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.840 
rows in double crochet and I worked it
with<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.659> G<00:01:55.870> hook<00:01:56.050> now<00:01:56.409> let's<00:01:57.100> see<00:01:57.370> if<00:01:57.640> that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
with the G hook now let's see if that

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.719 
with the G hook now let's see if that
came<00:01:58.090> out<00:01:58.270> correctly<00:01:59.280> how<00:02:00.280> we're<00:02:00.400> going<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.580> do

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
came out correctly how we're going to do

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.250 
came out correctly how we're going to do
that<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:00.940> we're<00:02:01.060> going<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.210> take<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.420> hard<00:02:01.780> side

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
that is we're going to take a hard side

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.040 
that is we're going to take a hard side
of<00:02:02.440> ruler<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.979> flexible<00:02:03.790> ruler<00:02:04.180> will<00:02:04.450> not<00:02:04.720> work

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
of ruler a flexible ruler will not work

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.590 
of ruler a flexible ruler will not work
it<00:02:05.380> won't<00:02:05.650> be<00:02:05.890> as<00:02:06.100> accurate<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.270> want<00:02:07.510> to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
it won't be as accurate so you want to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.770 
it won't be as accurate so you want to
use<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.930> hard<00:02:08.289> ruler<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.429> we're<00:02:10.060> going<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.300> mark

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
use a hard ruler and we're going to mark

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.970 
use a hard ruler and we're going to mark
where<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:12.730> inch<00:02:12.970> where<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.870> zero<00:02:14.170> begins<00:02:14.620> and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
where one inch where the zero begins and

the<00:04:24.250> stitches<00:04:24.610> are<00:04:24.789> very<00:04:25.120> very<00:04:25.450> crumpled<00:04:25.870> up

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
the stitches are very very crumpled up

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.710 
the stitches are very very crumpled up
and<00:04:26.169> very<00:04:26.590> very<00:04:26.919> tight<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:27.430> they<00:04:28.120> can<00:04:28.240> be<00:04:28.360> very

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
and very very tight and they can be very

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.600 
and very very tight and they can be very
difficult<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.260> tell<00:04:29.500> us<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:29.800> in<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:30.070> case<00:04:30.310> I

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
difficult to tell us so in that case I

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.589 
difficult to tell us so in that case I
would<00:04:30.820> recommend<00:04:31.389> you<00:04:32.139> know<00:04:32.260> counting

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
would recommend you know counting

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.060 
would recommend you know counting
putting<00:04:34.599> your<00:04:34.690> ruler<00:04:34.960> up<00:04:35.080> here<00:04:35.380> counting<00:04:35.919> the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
putting your ruler up here counting the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.370 
putting your ruler up here counting the
stitches<00:04:36.460> four<00:04:36.669> four<00:04:36.849> inches<00:04:37.150> they're<00:04:37.479> moving

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
stitches four four inches they're moving

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.980 
stitches four four inches they're moving
in<00:04:38.469> over<00:04:38.740> here<00:04:39.070> counting<00:04:39.880> four<00:04:40.120> four<00:04:40.690> inches

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
here

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.839 
here
making<00:04:42.669> sure<00:04:42.699> you<00:04:42.910> have<00:04:43.000> good<00:04:43.210> lighting<00:04:44.849> let's

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
making sure you have good lighting let's

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.330 
making sure you have good lighting let's
talk<00:04:46.000> about<00:04:46.150> row<00:04:46.539> gauge<00:04:46.840> as<00:04:47.080> well<00:04:47.259> too<00:04:47.590> now<00:04:48.280> the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
talk about row gauge as well too now the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.370 
talk about row gauge as well too now the
pattern<00:04:48.849> that<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:49.300> was<00:04:49.449> looking<00:04:49.690> at<00:04:49.870> calls<00:04:50.110> for

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
pattern that I was looking at calls for

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.089 
pattern that I was looking at calls for
six<00:04:51.060> six<00:04:52.060> rows<00:04:52.300> four<00:04:52.599> four<00:04:52.780> inches<00:04:53.169> so<00:04:53.410> again

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
six six rows four four inches so again

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.800 
six six rows four four inches so again
we<00:04:54.340> take<00:04:55.349> in<00:04:56.349> place<00:04:57.099> our<00:04:57.340> pin<00:04:57.699> at<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.060> zero<00:04:58.419> and

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
we take in place our pin at the zero and

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:07.170 
we take in place our pin at the zero and
at<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.620> four<00:04:59.889> and<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:06.310> count<00:05:06.580> rows<00:05:06.789> we<00:05:07.060> have

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
at the four and we count rows we have

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.110 
at the four and we count rows we have
one<00:05:07.389> two<00:05:07.780> three<00:05:07.810> four<00:05:08.229> five<00:05:08.979> six<00:05:09.280> so<00:05:09.970> we're

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
one two three four five six so we're

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.809 
one two three four five six so we're
right<00:05:10.330> on<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.780> is<00:05:10.960> not<00:05:11.229> always<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.740> case<00:05:11.919> so

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
right on that is not always the case so

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.640 
right on that is not always the case so
again<00:05:13.090> it<00:05:13.330> is<00:05:13.360> very<00:05:13.569> important<00:05:14.259> that<00:05:14.289> you

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
again it is very important that you

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.879 
again it is very important that you
adjust<00:05:14.860> your<00:05:15.430> hook<00:05:15.789> size<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:16.960> reflect<00:05:17.530> the

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
adjust your hook size to reflect the

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.490 
adjust your hook size to reflect the
gauge<00:05:18.159> that<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.639> pattern<00:05:19.000> calls<00:05:19.240> for<00:05:19.509> if<00:05:19.930> you

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
gauge that the pattern calls for if you

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.219 
gauge that the pattern calls for if you
want<00:05:20.770> to<00:05:21.130> have<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.669> through<00:05:22.389> to<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.840> pattern

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
want to have it through to the pattern

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.120 
want to have it through to the pattern
size<00:05:24.030> otherwise<00:05:25.030> again<00:05:25.840> just<00:05:26.560> being<00:05:26.740> off<00:05:26.919> as

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
size otherwise again just being off as

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.370 
size otherwise again just being off as

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.580 
little as one stitch four four inches
can<00:05:30.009> result<00:05:30.310> in<00:05:30.669> in<00:05:31.150> a<00:05:31.599> project<00:05:31.810> that<00:05:32.110> is<00:05:32.229> one

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
can result in in a project that is one

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.279 
can result in in a project that is one
size<00:05:32.830> larger<00:05:33.340> or<00:05:33.610> one<00:05:33.880> size<00:05:34.150> smaller<00:05:34.449> than<00:05:35.080> you

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
size larger or one size smaller than you

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.520 
size larger or one size smaller than you
intended<00:05:35.590> it<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.159> be<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:36.960> that's<00:05:37.960> really<00:05:38.259> all

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
intended it to be and that's really all

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.950 
intended it to be and that's really all
there<00:05:38.770> is<00:05:38.800> to<00:05:38.949> gauge<00:05:39.880> swatching<00:05:40.419> now<00:05:40.630> you<00:05:40.690> know

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
there is to gauge swatching now you know

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.490 
there is to gauge swatching now you know
how<00:05:41.139> to<00:05:41.199> do<00:05:41.380> it<00:05:41.530> no<00:05:41.949> excuses
