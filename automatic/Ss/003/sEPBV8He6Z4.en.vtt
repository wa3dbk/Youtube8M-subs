00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
hydration is very important for elite

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.280 
hydration is very important for elite
athletes<00:00:05.910> because<00:00:06.270> several<00:00:06.750> studies<00:00:07.140> have

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
athletes because several studies have

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.740 
athletes because several studies have
shown<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:07.770> many<00:00:08.010> sports<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.670> if<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.120> lose<00:00:09.360> 2%

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
shown in many sports that if you lose 2%

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.470

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
give us some feedback when we first

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.319 
give us some feedback when we first
started<00:00:31.349> testing<00:00:31.560> hockey<00:00:31.980> teams<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:33.059> found

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
started testing hockey teams we found

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.910 
started testing hockey teams we found
that<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.630> least<00:00:33.809> one-third<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> players

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that at least one-third of the players

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
that at least one-third of the players
we're<00:00:35.700> letting<00:00:35.969> themselves<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.570> too

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
we're letting themselves get too

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.680 
we're letting themselves get too
dehydrated<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:38.430> practices<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> especially

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
dehydrated in practices and especially

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
dehydrated in practices and especially
during<00:00:40.050> games<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.950> we're<00:00:41.160> trying<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> give

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
during games so we're trying to give

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
during games so we're trying to give
some<00:00:41.850> feedback<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.329> these<00:00:42.719> young<00:00:42.930> players<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
some feedback to these young players to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.840 
some feedback to these young players to
see<00:00:43.770> whether<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.129> they're<00:00:44.399> doing<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.670> good

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
see whether or not they're doing a good

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.779 
see whether or not they're doing a good
job<00:00:45.120> staying<00:00:45.750> hydrated<00:00:46.340> because<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> stay

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
job staying hydrated because if you stay

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.610 
job staying hydrated because if you stay
hydrated<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> chance<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.140> optimal

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
hydrated then the chance for optimal

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.250 
hydrated then the chance for optimal
performance<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.460> enhanced<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.050> try

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
performance is enhanced so what we try

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.630 
performance is enhanced so what we try
to<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.829> meet<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.219> players<00:00:53.489> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to do is we meet with the players that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.250 
to do is we meet with the players that
we<00:00:53.969> explain<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.420> them<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:54.960> will<00:00:55.140> have

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
we explain to them that they will have

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500 
we explain to them that they will have
to<00:00:55.379> give<00:00:55.500> us<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.710> small<00:00:55.920> urine<00:00:56.309> sample<00:00:56.699> from<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
to give us a small urine sample from the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.119 
to give us a small urine sample from the
urine<00:00:57.690> sample<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.469> determine<00:00:58.800> how

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
urine sample we can determine how

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.680 
urine sample we can determine how
hydrated<00:00:59.760> they<00:00:59.879> were<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.420> showed<00:01:00.660> up

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
hydrated they were when they showed up

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.770 
hydrated they were when they showed up
at<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> rink<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:03.090> them<00:01:03.359> actually

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
at the rink then we have them actually

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.660 
at the rink then we have them actually
weigh<00:01:03.960> their<00:01:04.229> body<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.739> from<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.280> time<00:01:05.610> on

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
weigh their body and from that time on

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.539 
weigh their body and from that time on
they<00:01:06.390> drink<00:01:06.720> only<00:01:07.229> from<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> bottles<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.430> we

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
they drink only from the bottles that we

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.429 
they drink only from the bottles that we
give<00:01:08.729> them<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.270> monitor<00:01:09.570> how<00:01:10.049> much<00:01:10.229> they

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
give them so we monitor how much they

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
give them so we monitor how much they
drink<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:10.979> they're<00:01:11.100> getting<00:01:11.400> ready<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
drink when they're getting ready for the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.420 
drink when they're getting ready for the
training<00:01:12.810> session<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.799> then<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.280> also

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
training session and then we also

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
training session and then we also
monitor<00:01:14.760> how<00:01:15.119> much<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.509> drink<00:01:15.780> when<00:01:16.170> they're

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
monitor how much they drink when they're

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.469 
monitor how much they drink when they're
on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> ice<00:01:16.740> from<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.640> information<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:18.450> we

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
on the ice from that information then we

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.359 
on the ice from that information then we
have<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.960> feel<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.229> how<00:01:20.009> much<00:01:20.189> they're

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
have a good feel for how much they're

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.910 
have a good feel for how much they're
drinking<00:01:20.820> when<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> practice<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.930> over<00:01:22.080> we

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
drinking when the practice is over we

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
drinking when the practice is over we
ask<00:01:23.070> them<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> come<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.930> another

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
ask them to come back in to have another

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
ask them to come back in to have another
body<00:01:25.439> mass<00:01:25.830> way<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.610> take<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.939> sweat<00:01:27.150> patch

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
body mass way we take the sweat patch

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.690 
body mass way we take the sweat patch
off<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.140> their<00:01:28.290> forehead<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.520> can

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
off that's on their forehead and we can

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.370 
off that's on their forehead and we can
assess<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.329> their<00:01:30.659> salt<00:01:30.930> intake

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
assess the their salt intake

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.640 
assess the their salt intake
so<00:01:32.100> essentially<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.299> assess<00:01:34.049> how<00:01:34.590> much

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
so essentially you can assess how much

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.100 
so essentially you can assess how much
they<00:01:35.040> sweat<00:01:35.340> by<00:01:35.700> knowing<00:01:36.000> how<00:01:36.150> much<00:01:36.299> body<00:01:36.869> mass

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
they sweat by knowing how much body mass

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.410 
they sweat by knowing how much body mass
they<00:01:37.350> lost<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.950> how<00:01:38.070> much<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.430> drank<00:01:38.759> during

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
they lost and how much they drank during

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.100 
they lost and how much they drank during
the<00:01:39.570> period

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the period

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
the period
it<00:01:40.320> affects<00:01:40.619> players<00:01:41.040> abilities<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> make

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
it affects players abilities to make

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.340 
it affects players abilities to make
good<00:01:41.939> decisions<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.630> think<00:01:42.659> being

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
good decisions and I think being

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.660 
good decisions and I think being
hydrated<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:43.979> being<00:01:44.130> hydrated<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.610> the

appropriate<00:01:45.210> supplement<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.229> mix<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.680> really

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
appropriate supplement and mix is really

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.700 
appropriate supplement and mix is really
critical<00:01:47.460> for<00:01:47.490> performance<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> GSSI

critical for performance what the GSSI
is<00:01:49.770> trying<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.880> collect<00:01:51.030> data<00:01:51.180> on

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
is trying to do is to collect data on

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.530 
is trying to do is to collect data on
elite<00:01:52.649> athletes<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.430> also<00:01:53.759> recreational

elite athletes and also recreational

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.719 
elite athletes and also recreational
athletes<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.619> how<00:01:55.770> much<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.159> sweat<00:01:56.430> how

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
athletes about how much they sweat how

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.609 
athletes about how much they sweat how
much<00:01:56.909> energy<00:01:57.329> they<00:01:57.509> need<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.020> forth<00:01:58.439> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
much energy they need and so forth and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.530 
much energy they need and so forth and
therefore<00:01:59.340> use<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.850> science<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:00.509> that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
therefore use that science or that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.810 
therefore use that science or that
information

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
information

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.240

and<00:02:01.940> make<00:02:02.630> products<00:02:03.290> that<00:02:03.440> will<00:02:04.040> help

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250
