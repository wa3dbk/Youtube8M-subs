00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
packaging how do we get this off I think

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.080 
packaging how do we get this off I think
it's<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.190> matter<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.489> peeling<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.059> off

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it's just a matter of peeling it off

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.080 
it's just a matter of peeling it off
like<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> foam<00:00:50.610> packaging

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090

little bit of extra packing inside here

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.720 
little bit of extra packing inside here
which<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.149> rid<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:58.100> like<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.430> and
