00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
can really hold on to this in my

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.979 
can really hold on to this in my
permanent<00:00:35.220> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:36.030> highlighted<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.780> or

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
permanent if you have highlighted it or

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.020 
permanent if you have highlighted it or
bleached<00:00:37.289> it<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.800> makes<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.129> lot<00:00:38.280> more<00:00:38.340> porous

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
bleached it it makes a lot more porous

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.270 
bleached it it makes a lot more porous
and<00:00:39.329> my<00:00:39.510> hair<00:00:39.719> already<00:00:40.079> grabs<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.770> warmth

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and red colors so I guess it was kind of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
and red colors so I guess it was kind of
expected<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.190> I'm<00:00:44.460> trying<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> grow<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.270> my
