because your friends are is doing one
thing<00:01:34.079> doesn't<00:01:34.619> mean<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> do

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.740 
thing doesn't mean you're going to do
that<00:01:35.369> too<00:01:35.640> because<00:01:35.850> everyone<00:01:36.420> wants<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
that too because everyone wants a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.660 
that too because everyone wants a
different<00:01:37.079> major<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.340> feel<00:01:38.369> that
