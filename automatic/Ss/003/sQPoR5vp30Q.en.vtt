00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
the foam audio and not the stereo but i

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.290 
the foam audio and not the stereo but i
found<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:33.730> easy<00:01:34.210> fix<00:01:34.570> for<00:01:34.720> that<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.820> can<00:01:36.970> see

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
found a easy fix for that so you can see

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.900 
found a easy fix for that so you can see
that's<00:01:37.870> the<00:01:38.080> phone<00:01:38.290> audio<00:01:38.470> icons<00:01:39.220> connected

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.000 
that's the phone audio icons connected
now<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:41.340> stereo<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:42.910> saw<00:01:43.120> it<00:01:43.150> disappear

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
now the stereo and you saw it disappear

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.900 
now the stereo and you saw it disappear
