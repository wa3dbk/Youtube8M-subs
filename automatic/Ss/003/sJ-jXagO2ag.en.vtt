in with that hand I'll just show you

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.120 
in with that hand I'll just show you
around<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.330> speaker<00:02:42.690> very<00:02:42.810> quickly<00:02:43.140> there<00:02:44.099> is

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
around the speaker very quickly there is

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.270 
around the speaker very quickly there is
an<00:02:44.640> LED<00:02:44.940> light<00:02:45.120> here<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.170> comes<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:46.650> when

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
an LED light here and this comes on when

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.970 
an LED light here and this comes on when
you<00:02:47.370> switch<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.849> unit<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.769> green<00:02:49.769> light

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
you switch the unit on green light

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.740 
you switch the unit on green light
obviously<00:02:50.130> means<00:02:50.519> you've<00:02:50.670> got<00:02:50.790> power<00:02:51.030> we've

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
obviously means you've got power we've

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.960 
obviously means you've got power we've
got<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> slider<00:02:52.349> control<00:02:52.860> here<00:02:53.160> which<00:02:53.640> controls

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
got a slider control here which controls

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.780 
got a slider control here which controls
the<00:02:54.330> volume<00:02:54.690> on<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.959> speaker<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:56.700> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the volume on the speaker and then you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.199 
the volume on the speaker and then you
switch<00:02:57.090> all<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.480> way<00:02:57.569> around<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.230> turn<00:02:58.500> off

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
switch all the way around to turn off

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.449 
switch all the way around to turn off
there's<00:03:00.209> also<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.750> built-in<00:03:01.080> cable<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:04.459> just

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
there's also a built-in cable so just

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.650 
there's also a built-in cable so just
put<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> pin<00:03:06.330> in<00:03:06.360> there<00:03:07.819> here<00:03:08.819> we<00:03:08.970> go<00:03:09.180> that's<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
put a pin in there here we go that's the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.600 
put a pin in there here we go that's the
three-and-a-half<00:03:10.200> millimeter<00:03:10.680> cable<00:03:11.069> out<00:03:11.340> so

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
three-and-a-half millimeter cable out so

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.390 
three-and-a-half millimeter cable out so
that<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> tight<00:03:12.810> tight<00:03:13.170> fit<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.860> bit

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
that is a tight tight fit that is a bit

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.300 
that is a tight tight fit that is a bit
of<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.610> bad<00:03:15.450> design<00:03:15.870> feature<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:16.440> there<00:03:16.680> what<00:03:17.280> I

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
of a bad design feature on there what I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.830 
of a bad design feature on there what I
would<00:03:17.489> suggest<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.970> when<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.239> put<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.630> back

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
would suggest is when you put this back

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.390 
would suggest is when you put this back
in<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.230> probably<00:03:19.530> will<00:03:19.680> get<00:03:19.830> better<00:03:19.980> with<00:03:20.250> time

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
in it probably will get better with time

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.130 
in it probably will get better with time
but<00:03:20.819> maybe<00:03:20.970> leave<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.299> poking<00:03:21.780> out<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> little

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
but maybe leave it poking out a little

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.059 
but maybe leave it poking out a little
bit<00:03:22.400> not<00:03:23.400> ideal<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.180> let's<00:03:24.900> move<00:03:25.110> on<00:03:25.290> there's

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
bit not ideal but let's move on there's

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.180 
bit not ideal but let's move on there's
also<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.519> jack<00:03:27.209> here<00:03:27.540> on<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.019> side<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:29.130> is

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
also a jack here on the side and this is

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.000 
also a jack here on the side and this is
used<00:03:29.579> for<00:03:29.700> daisy<00:03:30.150> chaining<00:03:30.600> devices<00:03:31.320> so<00:03:31.920> if

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
used for daisy chaining devices so if

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.259 
used for daisy chaining devices so if
you<00:03:32.070> have<00:03:32.190> more<00:03:32.370> than<00:03:32.519> one<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.700> these<00:03:32.850> speakers

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
you have more than one of these speakers

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.630 
you have more than one of these speakers
you<00:03:33.420> could<00:03:33.570> plug<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.870> in<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:35.010> port<00:03:35.430> on

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
you could plug this in to the port on

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.120 
you could plug this in to the port on
the<00:03:35.700> second<00:03:36.420> speaker<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.049> then<00:03:37.709> use<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
the second speaker and then use the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.430 
the second speaker and then use the
second<00:03:38.489> speakers<00:03:38.880> cable<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.870> go<00:03:39.989> into<00:03:40.290> your

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
second speakers cable to go into your

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.890 
second speakers cable to go into your
iPod<00:03:40.980> or<00:03:41.040> your<00:03:41.280> iPhone<00:03:41.400> or<00:03:42.120> your<00:03:42.239> mp3<00:03:42.420> player

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
iPod or your iPhone or your mp3 player

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.349 
iPod or your iPhone or your mp3 player
and<00:03:43.380> then<00:03:44.010> you'd<00:03:44.130> have<00:03:44.280> two<00:03:44.489> speakers<00:03:44.940> with

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
and then you'd have two speakers with

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.360 
and then you'd have two speakers with
music<00:03:45.750> coming<00:03:45.989> out<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.470> then<00:03:46.859> there's<00:03:47.069> also<00:03:47.220> a

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
music coming out and then there's also a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.800 
music coming out and then there's also a
little<00:03:47.459> symbol<00:03:47.819> there<00:03:48.090> which<00:03:48.239> shows<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.480> lock

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
little symbol there which shows a lock

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.809 
little symbol there which shows a lock
symbol<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.799> we<00:03:49.950> can<00:03:50.100> actually<00:03:50.370> twist<00:03:50.549> this

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
symbol so we can actually twist this

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.750 
symbol so we can actually twist this
round's<00:03:51.150> one<00:03:51.359> lock<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.980> sort<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.280> releases

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
round's one lock and it sort of releases

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.849 
round's one lock and it sort of releases
this<00:03:53.970> bass<00:03:54.239> expansion<00:03:54.989> port<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.739> that's

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
this bass expansion port and that's

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.590 
this bass expansion port and that's
going<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.130> give<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.430> more<00:03:56.670> expensive<00:03:57.209> or

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
going to give you a more expensive or

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.800 
going to give you a more expensive or
more<00:03:57.810> sort<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.489> deeper<00:03:59.489> warmer<00:04:00.060> sound<00:04:00.329> so<00:04:00.720> I'll
