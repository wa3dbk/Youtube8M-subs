00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
Project Runway so far well overall I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.900 
Project Runway so far well overall I
think<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.750> show<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.560> entire<00:00:17.039> show<00:00:17.550> has

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
think that the show the entire show has

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.050 
think that the show the entire show has
been<00:00:18.890> very<00:00:21.619> unprecedented<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.640> designs

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
been very unprecedented with the designs

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.029 
been very unprecedented with the designs
i<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.930> lot<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> designers<00:00:26.390> well

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039

designers for the season dan well I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.439 
designers for the season dan well I
definitely<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.430> Lee<00:00:56.879> Ann<00:00:57.059> Marshall

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
definitely think that Lee Ann Marshall

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.540 
definitely think that Lee Ann Marshall
is<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.800> be<00:01:00.140> winning<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.590> 100<00:01:01.829> thousand

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
is going to be winning the 100 thousand

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.429 
is going to be winning the 100 thousand
dollars<00:01:03.470> um<00:01:04.470> next<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.700> her<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.330> probably<00:01:07.080> going

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
dollars um next to her is probably going

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.370 
dollars um next to her is probably going
to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:08.840> jarrell<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.880> court<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.450> think

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
to be jarrell and then court on I think

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.300 
to be jarrell and then court on I think
Kota<00:01:13.710> has<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.369> potential<00:01:15.350> don't<00:01:16.350> pull

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
Kota has a lot of potential don't pull

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.499 
Kota has a lot of potential don't pull
her<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.150> choices<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.810> course<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
her out the choices of course but I

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
her out the choices of course but I
didn't<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:22.170> Leon<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.770> very

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
didn't you think like Leon is very

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
didn't you think like Leon is very
linear<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.850> architectural<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.960> very

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
linear and architectural and very

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.319 
linear and architectural and very
predictable<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:28.829> thing<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.340> LeAnn<00:01:29.790> has

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
predictable the thing that LeAnn has

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.390 
predictable the thing that LeAnn has
something<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.140> most<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.799> American

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
something that most of American

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.170 
something that most of American
designers<00:01:32.939> don't<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:35.189> called<00:01:35.549> style

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
designers don't have it is called style

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.140 
designers don't have it is called style
either<00:01:36.720> you're<00:01:37.079> born<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.280> or<00:01:38.640> you're<00:01:38.759> not

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
either you're born with it or you're not

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.390 
either you're born with it or you're not
and<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:40.229> think<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.619> lot<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.070> desires

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and I think that a lot of the desires

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.429 
and I think that a lot of the desires
that<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> shows<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> show<00:01:42.479> have

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that the shows in the show have

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.120 
that the shows in the show have
basically<00:01:44.189> come<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.329> into<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> world<00:01:46.130> live

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
basically come out into the world live

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.090 
basically come out into the world live
on<00:01:47.430> TV<00:01:47.729> they've<00:01:48.689> shows<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.320> their<00:01:49.470> path<00:01:49.770> in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
on TV they've shows in their path in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.450 
on TV they've shows in their path in
their<00:01:50.579> path<00:01:50.850> was<00:01:51.450> not<00:01:51.750> project<00:01:52.590> Brian<00:01:52.950> parks

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
their path was not project Brian parks

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.530 
their path was not project Brian parks
so<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> think<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.570> LeAnn<00:01:55.380> has<00:01:55.829> something<00:01:56.280> that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
so I think that LeAnn has something that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.040 
so I think that LeAnn has something that
her<00:01:57.900> house<00:01:58.110> she<00:01:58.890> has<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.160> gift<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.120> therefore

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
her house she has a gift and therefore

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.400 
her house she has a gift and therefore
she<00:02:01.830> must<00:02:01.860> win<00:02:02.660> Project<00:02:03.660> Runway<00:02:04.080> because

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
she must win Project Runway because

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.860 
she must win Project Runway because
other<00:02:04.710> than<00:02:04.830> that<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.490> won't<00:02:06.120> believe<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
other than that I won't believe on the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.499 
other than that I won't believe on the
show<00:02:07.080> anymore<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.830> I'm<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.450> to

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
show anymore and I'm not going to go to

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.600 
show anymore and I'm not going to go to
lifetime<00:02:10.220> lifetime<00:02:11.220> TV<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.270> watch<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.260> show

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
lifetime lifetime TV and watch the show

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.880 
lifetime lifetime TV and watch the show
