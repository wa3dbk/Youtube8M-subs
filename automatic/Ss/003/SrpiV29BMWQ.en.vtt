00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.269
 hello guys it 's late do not believe me for 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.640
 bring you a new kraft 1.7 problem 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.230
 point 10 called rpg heart works with 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.910
 forge so it does not come from carlos davalos 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.710
 and that what is not added then in this 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.630
 case we totally change the cut of 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.890
 minecraft as you are watching and it puts us 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.930
 at the top gives us my little face 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.369
 so a 0 just below that 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.500
 would represent the experience levels 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.090
 that I have in the part the red bar 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.010
 would represent health instead of 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.260
 He pointed out in heart what would be in points 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.520
 then we have the green bar that would be 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.930
 the hunger bar instead of 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.430
 represent it in thighs represents 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.980
 also in points and below we have 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.300
 just the experience bar just 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.370
 I put the Chinese also a little 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.199
 how to change between different cats that 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.819
 we can get to have with this mode 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.379
 okay guys we have also 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.670
 just at the bottom in the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.589
 armor that we have and what we 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.309
 protect and finally we also have a 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.989
 effect status valuator voucher 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.789
 that if for example start throwing 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.920
 exhibitions you will see that in the part 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.540
 upper right I have an effect that 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.250
 would be this channel that of the portion that 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.680
 I throw away vouchers and put another one because it will be 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.510
 another effect if I throw another one another and so 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.370
 with all regretted that I get to have 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.060
 during the time it reaches 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.530
 have them 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.610
 that's how I'm seeing I have one that 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.350
 is blinking why 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.930
 because I have less than 10 seconds left 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.430
 from generation 2 that just the one 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.290
 is signaling at the top 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.970
 right in the third position is worth 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.740
 guys then when they 're spending 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.660
 the effect will start blinking so that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.490
 you realize that the effect is not going 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.290
 to last a lot this way we can 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.880
 control a bit also the effect that 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.830
 we have how much time we have left 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.410
 have to be giving the lae and looking 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.240
 the time in this part then guys 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.310
 this is what the mod brings us but 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.110
 then we also have the options of 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.550
 customization turn min another thing is 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.680
 true before personalization if we 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.990
 we come to the water that for example here 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.390
 we have water we get inside and you go to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.920
 see that also the air bar or good 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.900
 what is the little bubbles of air that we 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.970
 they came out now it comes out in the form of a bar 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.770
 and in a great way it's worth if it's convenient 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.899
 have here and you will see it fixos 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.180
 It's worth as you see I see a blue bar 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.119
 that when he's in his opponent obviously 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.470
 I am in your rival not worth not not clear 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.300
 I spend is not spent because I have the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.650
 water electricity position but 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.989
 good that when we do not have it 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.220
 starts to wear out very quickly and 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.959
 Well, more or less the same 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.550
 speed than the bubbles but what 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.070
 we can control much better because 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.819
 we have just different then 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.489
 I think it's cool 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.290
 quite having the bar of this 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.790
 way let's go from here and let's go 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.739
 now to the customization options 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.900
 it's worth the customization options the 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.519
 we can see inside this menu we give 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 to options as you see the states back 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.319
 to the game achievements and so on 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.329
 we give you here rpg rpg hat options and 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.760
 here we can edit different things by 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.620
 example we can make it activate or it 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.329
 deactivate I can put the normal broth 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.859
 from minecraft or I'm going to put the mod's 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.109
 I can also put it so that it 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.239
 extend so good for it to be the 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:56.030
 extended that I had before with texture 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.919
 blue so he does not come out here together 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.389
 otherwise the part of 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.189
 down here is the experience bar 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.099
 that is living the life bar of 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.560
 hungry inventory the face levels 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.719
 armor and effects and good for 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.560
 this is changing between different 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.030
 you are seeing then here will be the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.489
 experience of this part of this 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.909
 it is the same as before and little more after 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.439
 We have to receive the message when 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.689
 update the mod that really 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.430
 this already depends on each one is worth this 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.439
 so that the player's face comes out or not 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.599
 pull out the player's face here in this 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.500
 part of us come to the next 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.450
 next menu voucher 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.310
 edith barr we can make it come out 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.890
 of experience or the value of the 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.349
 experience in points or that does not come out 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.060
 because also that the life comes out or 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.560
 that not the stamina the good 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.180
 It ends is not that hunger but good 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.010
 I can also put it right and then 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.420
 have we can change the color you can 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.739
 change the color to the air bar 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.630
 that before I saw that it was blue we can 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.780
 change will be by any green color 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.819
 yellow white gray red this job 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.650
 then you can put the bar 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.299
 hungry in any other with what 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.620
 It also comes completely customized 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.569
 to put the color that we 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.769
 we want the experience also 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.720
 we can do the same thing I can 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.549
 put the color that we want to 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.260
 the experience as if we want to put you 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.730
 yellow wire the green experience 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.380
 that maybe there are also people at the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.569
 that you like changed then we can 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.099
 put it also the one of life through 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.709
 you can change it if you want if it is 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.489
 fancy and then also the amber that 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.450
 in theory in theory it should be he created 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.389
 this 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.490
 the framework that we have but I'm not for 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.950
 nothing sure I'm not sure at all and 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.020
 the truth that no idea no no did not reach 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.479
 have but good that equally 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.039
 you see the claim is there after 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.720
 we can make the armor does not come out or 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.300
 not 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.370
 in this case it does not appear is ending in 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.040
 the 1.7 point 10 must be blocked or 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.050
 something must happen because here I would have 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.060
 appear a small icon of the armor 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.730
 according to also the state of this armor 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.800
 and in this case it does not come out not really 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.480
 Well, if you do not know, then nothing here 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.860
 we also have the protection and we have 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.440
 we would also be here we can see 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.940
 also the state of this one but it's a 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.460
 pity that I do not get to get out of this 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.290
 way then well this we have already 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.060
 seen let's go to status 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.680
 efe that this is so that you see the 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.360
 effects that we currently have or that we do not 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.600
 see each other so they look great they look 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.490
 small and also so that it stops so that 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.440
 blink kosten spending or not 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.880
 bad for mbale guys then this 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.890
 is the mode has nothing else I hope that 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.960
 we are given a lot, it is useful to press like 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.250
 and new favorites the next video and 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.250
 see you later
