turning round in tanks the problem seems

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.670 
turning round in tanks the problem seems
to<00:02:06.420> stem<00:02:06.690> from<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.990> fact<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:07.410> are<00:02:07.440> both

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
to stem from the fact that you are both

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.109 
to stem from the fact that you are both
the<00:02:07.860> gunner<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.429> driver<00:02:08.790> in<00:02:09.000> these

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
is the left stick this means you turn

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.100 
is the left stick this means you turn
and<00:02:14.670> accelerate<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> same<00:02:15.660> analog

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and accelerate with the same analog

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.540 
and accelerate with the same analog
stick<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.560> this<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.920> much<00:02:17.160> more<00:02:17.340> frustrating

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
stick and this is much more frustrating

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
than it sounds

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.750 
than it sounds
hit<00:02:19.260> detection<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.860> also<00:02:20.130> pretty<00:02:20.430> bad

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
hit detection is also pretty bad

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.730 
hit detection is also pretty bad

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.380 

I<00:02:28.760> sifted<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.910> target

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
third-person shooting itself it's about

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.870 
third-person shooting itself it's about
the<00:02:38.470> combination<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.370> using
