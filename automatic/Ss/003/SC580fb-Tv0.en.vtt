 we finished putting our chicken one 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.070
 Once they have the salt, let's put 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.070
 the legs 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.400
 this part is very big we can 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.050
 split 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.480
 if you do not find the potatoes 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.120
 The big chambray can be split into 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.620
 four or two 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.620
 how can we split it in two 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.750
 If you want, you can put a little more 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.240
 of salt to the potatoes now the butter 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.820
 We are going to distribute pieces of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.840
 butter over here 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.840
 others here 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.140
 the oven already I already turned it on it has to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.490
 be hot 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.180
 what I used 160 degrees since I put the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.900
 we are going to put so much pepper in 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.900
 powder 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.970
 ground pepper 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.060
 with that enough 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.060
 and now let's add the juice 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.030
 are 2 kilos of chicken plus the two rooms and 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.080
 the huacal and the molleras 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.560
 were 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.950
 750 ml of the juice now all this what 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.420
 We are going to cover with aluminum foil a 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.870
 Once I covered it with aluminum 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.510
 let's put it in the oven if you do not 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.310
 they have an oven or their time is not 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.769
 It allows 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.400
 in a saucepan they can put it well 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:59.340
 after covering it they can put it 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.870
 over the grill on the stove and they're going 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.269
 to leave approximately 45 minutes 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.830
 without opening it and then uncovering it for 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.140
 check 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.880
 it's already in the oven and we're going to leave it 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.920
 one hour with 15 minutes at 160 degrees already 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.660
 spent an hour with 15 minutes we're going to 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.890
 check the chicken but very carefully 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.910
 because it is hot and ximo 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.440
 Be careful with the steam you release 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.440
 this on the grill 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.410
 I'm going to introduce a knife to see if 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.410
 already cooked the chicken if it has already been cooked 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:43.140
 I'm going to follow the chicken pieces 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.140
 so that the potatoes are below 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.519
 good once the pieces were left 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.780
 up and the pod the chips were left 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:00.490
 down I'm going to I'm going to put them back 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.370
 baked but I'm not going to cover it 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.360
 I'm going to let the juice be consumed 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.360
 little already without the aluminum and in the malt what 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.490
 let's leave about 15 minutes after 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.980
 15 minutes let's pay the chicken 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.180
 and after taking the chicken out of the oven 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.519
 that's how we stayed 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.949
 let's accompany it with a red rice 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.470

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:29.360

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.199
 how many eat how many things are eaten 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.199
 I eat one with some sweetbreads 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.789
 We put two baby gizzards 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.680
 in the water fields 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.680
