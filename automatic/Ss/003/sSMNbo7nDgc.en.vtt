00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
surface area to start okay so as you go

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.380 
surface area to start okay so as you go
you<00:00:52.410> put<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> under<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.699> want<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> count

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
to two seconds one two and then catch

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.599 
to two seconds one two and then catch
one<00:00:57.899> two<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:58.530> catch<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.070> will<00:00:59.430> help

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
one two and then catch it that will help

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.069 
one two and then catch it that will help
you<00:00:59.850> practice<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.750> let<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:00.960> sit

fingernail wants it to get there then

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.270 
fingernail wants it to get there then
you're<00:01:33.960> gonna<00:01:34.080> be<00:01:34.260> rate<00:01:34.440> of<00:01:34.560> such<00:01:34.740> winding<00:01:35.160> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you're gonna be rate of such winding it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
you're gonna be rate of such winding it
for<00:01:35.490> example<00:01:35.670> once<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> sits<00:01:36.360> there<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
for example once it sits there then you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
for example once it sits there then you
move<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.980> your<00:01:38.010> finger<00:01:38.430> pad<00:01:38.640> okay<00:01:39.180> want<00:01:39.750> to
