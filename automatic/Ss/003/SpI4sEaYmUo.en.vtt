00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hello 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:22.320
 an all smokey eye using makeup 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:31.619
 the most part is the number 0 0 5 and the pop 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:33.570
 art smoky eye pencil number 0 0 3 created 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.450
 the perfect base for smokey makeup 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 applying the eye trainer he created the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.219
 smokey using makeup structure 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.680
 the pop art smoky eye pencil his 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.350
 soft and fondant texture perfect for 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.480
 easily create smokey makeup and it is 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.250
 ideal to use both on the rhyme 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.610
 superior ciliary but also inside 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.610
 eye 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.159
 the important thing is that the color of the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.030
 pencil has been near the base of the 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.799
 I believe in the smokey structure 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.799
 eyes and then later I will go to fade 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.930
 rough with colored fists to metallic 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.360

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.890

 lacrimal is in the corner of the eye 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.850
 I apply the same color also in the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.030
 lower eyelid always starting from the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.030
 center 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.860
 black ends the brown and I apply it 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.930
 in the corner of the eye and close to 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.350
 tear duct to intensify the 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.350
 color 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.070
 the use of light dove color for 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.770
 blend the shading well for 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.130
 baptize the eyelid and part of it 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.130

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.290

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.750

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.250

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.280

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.280

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.209
 applying mascara black bampa 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.590
