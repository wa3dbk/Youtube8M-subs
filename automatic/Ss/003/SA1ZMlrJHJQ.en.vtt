00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
now a normal combustion engine in a car

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.070 
now a normal combustion engine in a car
has<00:03:05.700> hundreds<00:03:06.300> of<00:03:06.360> moving<00:03:06.599> parts<00:03:06.840> right<00:03:06.959> but

hundred and fifteen pounds how does this

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.100 
hundred and fifteen pounds how does this
work<00:03:11.700> an<00:03:11.880> electric<00:03:12.209> motor<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.510> quite<00:03:12.780> simple

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
work an electric motor is quite simple

work an electric motor is quite simple
there's<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.440> only<00:03:13.530> two<00:03:13.920> parts<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.610> only

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
there's really only two parts and only

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.370 
there's really only two parts and only
one<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:14.970> them<00:03:15.090> moves<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.569> rotors<00:03:15.930> apart<00:03:16.260> the

wired up into 99 of what we called

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
