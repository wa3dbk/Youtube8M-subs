edge on the right side and I'm shadow
side<00:01:23.840> of<00:01:23.869> something<00:01:24.709> in<00:01:24.829> a<00:01:24.860> way<00:01:25.039> like<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.459> so

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
side of something in a way like that so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:35.550 
side of something in a way like that so
I'm<00:01:26.539> just<00:01:26.689> going<00:01:26.929> to<00:01:26.959> use<00:01:27.109> the<00:01:27.289> edge<00:01:27.439> of<00:01:27.619> it

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.779 

notice<00:01:36.560> how<00:01:36.739> I'm<00:01:36.860> using<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.340> edge<00:01:37.459> of<00:01:37.640> the

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
notice how I'm using the edge of the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.050 
notice how I'm using the edge of the
Kestrel<00:01:38.329> not<00:01:39.099> for<00:01:40.099> the<00:01:40.159> boria's<00:01:40.579> going<00:01:40.849> like

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
Kestrel not for the boria's going like

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.600 
Kestrel not for the boria's going like
this<00:01:41.560> I'm<00:01:42.560> using<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:44.890> fairly<00:01:45.890> soft<00:01:46.429> on<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.090> edge

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
this I'm using a fairly soft on the edge

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.719 
this I'm using a fairly soft on the edge
so<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:49.879> a<00:01:50.349> red<00:01:51.349> gray<00:01:51.679> and<00:01:51.920> I'm<00:01:52.099> it's<00:01:52.399> quite

a pale tone that's getting moving wants
back<00:01:56.420> there<00:01:56.780> they'll<00:01:57.649> be<00:01:57.739> using<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.159> number

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
back there they'll be using the number

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.020 
back there they'll be using the number
six<00:01:58.700> color<00:01:59.390> shaper<00:01:59.750> this<00:02:00.259> is<00:02:01.030> marvelous

the trunks and the twigs it's almost

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:10.720 
the trunks and the twigs it's almost
random<00:03:04.099> way<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.819> sort<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.150> leans<00:03:05.450> out<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:09.730> they

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
random way it sort of leans out and they

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.460 
random way it sort of leans out and they
get<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.150> little<00:03:11.269> lovely<00:03:11.720> sense<00:03:12.139> of<00:03:12.319> atmosphere

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
get a little lovely sense of atmosphere

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.280 
get a little lovely sense of atmosphere
them<00:03:15.790> down<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.819> bit<00:03:16.940> about<00:03:17.269> I'm<00:03:17.569> also<00:03:17.870> kind<00:03:18.230> of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
them down a bit about I'm also kind of

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.490 
them down a bit about I'm also kind of
down<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.709> bit<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:19.069> warmer<00:03:19.370> color<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:21.230> it's

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
down in a bit of a warmer color so it's

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.319 
down in a bit of a warmer color so it's
neatly<00:03:21.939> front-facing<00:03:22.939> with<00:03:24.040> password<00:03:25.329> length

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
neatly front-facing with password length

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:42.630 
neatly front-facing with password length
and<00:03:27.109> one<00:03:27.319> like<00:03:27.620> this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.660 

see<00:03:43.360> what<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.870> does<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.770> it<00:03:44.980> takes<00:03:45.190> all<00:03:45.490> the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
see what it does is it takes all the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.500 
see what it does is it takes all the
colors<00:03:46.000> together

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.750 

and<00:03:50.050> it<00:03:50.140> makes<00:03:50.319> that<00:03:50.560> effect<00:03:51.099> like<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.580> get

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
and it makes that effect like you get

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.220 
and it makes that effect like you get
them<00:03:51.909> corrugated<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.549> rusty<00:03:54.549> calibrated<00:03:55.510> red

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
them corrugated and rusty calibrated red

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.500 
them corrugated and rusty calibrated red
painted<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:59.250> this<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.549> so<00:04:00.760> easy<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.330> do<00:04:01.480> it

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
painted and this is so easy to do it

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.130 
painted and this is so easy to do it
with<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.239> one's<00:04:04.480> more<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.900> bushy

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
with this but this one's more of a bushy

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:24.930 
with this but this one's more of a bushy
one<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:07.060> that's<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.540> dark<00:04:08.379> bits<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.980> it

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.360 

unless<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:25.960> all<00:04:26.080> comes<00:04:26.320> across<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.980> front<00:04:27.100> of

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
unless it all comes across in front of

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.640 
unless it all comes across in front of
this<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:30.480> there<00:04:31.480> was<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.630> tree<00:04:31.930> that<00:04:32.140> I've<00:04:32.470> just

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
this on there was a tree that I've just

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.350 
this on there was a tree that I've just
moved<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.070> out<00:04:33.160> of<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:33.910> we<00:04:34.000> could<00:04:34.150> see

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
moved it out of it so that we could see

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.560 
moved it out of it so that we could see
this<00:04:34.540> bond<00:04:35.670> clearer<00:04:39.060> like<00:04:40.060> this<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.390> to

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
this bond clearer like this is to

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.260 
this bond clearer like this is to
describe<00:04:40.990> with<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.560> brasses<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.640> cdks

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
describe with the brasses and cdks

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
describe with the brasses and cdks
things<00:04:43.750> like<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:46.540> then<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.870> put<00:04:47.080> any

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
things like that and then to put any

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.000 
things like that and then to put any
some<00:04:47.530> of<00:04:47.650> these<00:04:47.710> red/gray<00:04:49.410> that's<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.530> basis

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
some of these red/gray that's the basis

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.090 
some of these red/gray that's the basis
of<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:54.210> lighter<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.750> same<00:04:56.020> color<00:04:56.830> but<00:04:57.010> the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
of that lighter the same color but the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.470 
of that lighter the same color but the
lighter<00:04:57.340> tone<00:04:59.700> so<00:05:00.700> now<00:05:00.850> I'm<00:05:00.970> starting<00:05:01.450> to

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
lighter tone so now I'm starting to

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.970 
lighter tone so now I'm starting to
build<00:05:01.840> up<00:05:02.110> this<00:05:02.380> area<00:05:03.150> rough<00:05:04.150> ground<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.950> I

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
build up this area rough ground so I

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.400 
build up this area rough ground so I
don't<00:05:06.550> want<00:05:06.790> to<00:05:06.910> do<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.180> this<00:05:07.330> way<00:05:07.570> because

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
don't want to do it this way because

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.350 
don't want to do it this way because
I'll<00:05:08.800> get<00:05:09.010> that<00:05:09.190> sort<00:05:09.430> of<00:05:09.520> smooth<00:05:09.730> it<00:05:09.910> make<00:05:10.150> my

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
I'll get that sort of smooth it make my

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.710 
I'll get that sort of smooth it make my
no<00:05:10.420> wanted<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.410> do<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.860> wanted<00:05:12.790> to<00:05:13.210> look<00:05:13.390> like

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
no wanted to do I wanted to look like

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.820 
no wanted to do I wanted to look like
it's<00:05:14.020> all<00:05:14.140> growing<00:05:15.750> dead<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:16.960> dying<00:05:17.080> phone<00:05:17.560> is

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
it's all growing dead and dying phone is

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.790 
it's all growing dead and dying phone is
shut<00:05:18.190> so<00:05:18.430> that's<00:05:18.730> what<00:05:18.910> my<00:05:19.060> myself<00:05:19.800> muted

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
shut so that's what my myself muted

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:29.370 
shut so that's what my myself muted
color<00:05:26.160> just<00:05:27.160> shoot<00:05:28.150> it<00:05:28.330> down<00:05:28.510> again<00:05:28.870> some<00:05:29.260> of

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
color just shoot it down again some of

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.640 
color just shoot it down again some of
the<00:05:29.470> green<00:05:29.740> colors<00:05:31.020> these<00:05:32.020> are<00:05:32.080> coming<00:05:32.350> for

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
the green colors these are coming for

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:46.220 
the green colors these are coming for
closer<00:05:32.920> to<00:05:33.040> the<00:05:33.220> path

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:06:05.210 

down<00:05:46.920> in<00:05:47.100> the<00:05:47.190> outside<00:05:47.670> cause<00:06:03.650> but<00:06:04.650> what<00:06:04.860> I<00:06:04.890> got

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
down in the outside cause but what I got

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.700 
down in the outside cause but what I got
is<00:06:05.460> a<00:06:05.490> stick<00:06:06.180> of<00:06:06.270> Castille<00:06:06.810> and<00:06:07.050> the<00:06:07.290> peloton

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
is a stick of Castille and the peloton

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.290 
is a stick of Castille and the peloton
and<00:06:08.570> I'm<00:06:09.570> going<00:06:09.780> to<00:06:09.990> free<00:06:10.860> some<00:06:11.550> of<00:06:11.670> the<00:06:11.790> paddle

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
and I'm going to free some of the paddle

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.320 
and I'm going to free some of the paddle
off<00:06:12.860> on<00:06:13.860> to<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.220> picture<00:06:16.910> now<00:06:17.910> it's<00:06:18.090> kind<00:06:18.300> of

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
off on to the picture now it's kind of

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.640 
off on to the picture now it's kind of
it's<00:06:18.540> sort<00:06:18.720> of<00:06:18.840> solid

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
it's sort of solid

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.840 
it's sort of solid
I<00:06:19.680> don't<00:06:20.640> like<00:06:20.850> it<00:06:21.030> so<00:06:21.210> much<00:06:21.240> so<00:06:25.670> this<00:06:26.670> is<00:06:26.820> a

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
I don't like it so much so this is a

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.090 
I don't like it so much so this is a
little<00:06:27.090> hot<00:06:27.450> brush<00:06:28.250> it's<00:06:29.250> got<00:06:29.430> a<00:06:30.380> I<00:06:31.380> just<00:06:31.920> cut

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
little hot brush it's got a I just cut

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.510 
little hot brush it's got a I just cut
it<00:06:32.250> so<00:06:32.850> that<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:33.090> shape<00:06:33.600> of<00:06:33.780> it<00:06:34.230> and<00:06:34.500> it<00:06:35.280> makes

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
it so that the shape of it and it makes

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.290 
it so that the shape of it and it makes
a<00:06:35.730> really<00:06:35.760> nice<00:06:36.860> texture<00:06:37.860> thanks<00:06:38.310> so<00:06:38.880> you're

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
a really nice texture thanks so you're

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.930 
a really nice texture thanks so you're
filling<00:06:39.540> up<00:06:39.720> the<00:06:39.870> grain<00:06:40.140> and<00:06:40.700> removing<00:06:41.700> some

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
filling up the grain and removing some

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.540 
filling up the grain and removing some
of<00:06:42.060> the<00:06:42.120> possible<00:06:42.860> so<00:06:43.860> it<00:06:44.010> makes<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.310> lovely

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
of the possible so it makes a lovely

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.600 
of the possible so it makes a lovely
effect<00:06:45.030> I<00:06:45.530> like<00:06:46.530> this<00:06:46.740> but<00:06:46.890> bottoms<00:06:47.280> of<00:06:47.490> the

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
effect I like this but bottoms of the

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.090 
effect I like this but bottoms of the
buildings<00:06:48.150> to<00:06:48.270> be<00:06:48.480> a<00:06:48.780> minimum<00:06:49.560> of<00:06:49.800> foliage

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
buildings to be a minimum of foliage

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.610 
buildings to be a minimum of foliage
make<00:06:50.730> this<00:06:50.880> building<00:06:51.330> look<00:06:51.510> as<00:06:51.990> if<00:06:52.170> it's<00:06:52.320> part

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
make this building look as if it's part

00:06:52.620 --> 00:07:11.589 
make this building look as if it's part
of<00:06:52.860> the<00:06:52.980> landscape

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:27.420 

let's<00:07:11.960> put<00:07:12.289> the<00:07:12.469> yeah
