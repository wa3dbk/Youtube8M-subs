00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.150 
in the game and we don't know how long
the<00:02:30.180> game's<00:02:30.330> gonna<00:02:30.510> be<00:02:30.890> there's<00:02:31.890> only<00:02:32.010> gonna

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the game's gonna be there's only gonna

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.800 
the game's gonna be there's only gonna
be<00:02:32.280> like<00:02:32.340> thousands<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.060> lines<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.330> dialogue

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
be like thousands of lines of dialogue

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.960 
be like thousands of lines of dialogue
that<00:02:34.050> some<00:02:35.010> people<00:02:35.250> are<00:02:35.280> gonna<00:02:35.430> have<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.790> read

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
that some people are gonna have to read

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.540 
that some people are gonna have to read
and<00:02:36.239> say<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.610> guess<00:02:39.709> only<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.280> apple

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
and say so I guess only in the apple

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.340 
and say so I guess only in the apple
also<00:02:41.850> after<00:02:42.120> translating<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.810> English<00:02:42.840> so

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
also after translating to English so

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.350 
also after translating to English so
that's<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.650> take<00:02:43.800> even<00:02:44.040> longer<00:02:44.190> time<00:02:44.459> so

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
that's going to take even longer time so

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.960 
that's going to take even longer time so
he<00:02:45.810> doesn't<00:02:45.989> know<00:02:46.290> either<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:47.730> probably

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
he doesn't know either you probably

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.620 
he doesn't know either you probably
won't<00:02:48.239> know<00:02:48.360> for<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.600> while<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.980> that's<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.450> is
