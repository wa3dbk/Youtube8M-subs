00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
tiny bit of a deep there like i can see

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.600 
tiny bit of a deep there like i can see
some<00:03:05.170> flash<00:03:05.440> or<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:05.980> case<00:03:06.190> but<00:03:06.430> that's

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
some flash or on the case but that's

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.300 
some flash or on the case but that's
minimum<00:03:07.680> open<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:11.530> might<00:03:11.920> be<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.100> problem

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
minimum open this might be a problem

minimum open this might be a problem
it's<00:03:12.730> really<00:03:13.150> deep<00:03:13.420> there<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.080> maybe<00:03:14.739> it'll<00:03:15.190> be

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
it's really deep there so maybe it'll be

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.620 
it's really deep there so maybe it'll be
kind<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.760> hard<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.000> turn<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.900> on<00:03:17.050> but<00:03:17.290> yeah<00:03:18.010> so

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
kind of hard to turn it on but yeah so

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.530 
kind of hard to turn it on but yeah so
