00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.689 

I've<00:00:30.210> done<00:00:30.509> several<00:00:30.840> films<00:00:31.529> where<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.309> actually

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
I've done several films where I actually

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.140 
I've done several films where I actually
haven't<00:00:33.420> written<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.320> score<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.190> guess<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.970> best

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
haven't written a score I guess the best

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.660 
haven't written a score I guess the best
way<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> describe<00:00:36.900> it<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.350> I've<00:00:37.620> improvised<00:00:38.400> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
way to describe it is I've improvised a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.149 
way to describe it is I've improvised a
score<00:00:39.000> against<00:00:39.540> picture<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> audience

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
score against picture but the audience

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.639 
score against picture but the audience
would<00:00:41.460> never<00:00:41.699> know<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.089> I'd<00:00:42.570> say<00:00:42.839> on<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.230> film

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
would never know it I'd say on this film

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.299 
would never know it I'd say on this film
I<00:00:44.040> wanted<00:00:44.970> this<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.960> non<00:00:46.350> orchestral

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
I wanted this to be a non orchestral

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.450 
I wanted this to be a non orchestral
score<00:00:47.690> with<00:00:48.690> orchestral<00:00:49.140> elements<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
score with orchestral elements in it and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
score with orchestral elements in it and
I<00:00:50.699> think<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> most<00:00:51.329> part<00:00:51.510> I've<00:00:51.960> done<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.400 
is you're you're doing with it
artistically<00:01:03.089> because<00:01:03.629> time<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.379> short

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410

to have them part of this process also

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.850 
to have them part of this process also
is<00:04:48.450> that<00:04:48.600> we're<00:04:48.690> using<00:04:48.720> Sibelius<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.740> the

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
realize what James has written and and

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.650 
realize what James has written and and
we<00:06:20.610> couldn't<00:06:20.790> have<00:06:20.910> done<00:06:21.060> it<00:06:21.120> without<00:06:21.330> Pro

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
we couldn't have done it without Pro

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.330 
we couldn't have done it without Pro
Tools<00:06:21.810> HD<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.320> without<00:06:22.590> the<00:06:22.710> MIDI<00:06:22.950> that<00:06:23.220> we
