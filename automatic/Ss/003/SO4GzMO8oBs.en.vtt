00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi all i'm francesca i'm the only one 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140
 multina who still hadn't made a 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.269
 video on youtube 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.450
 I apologize very much though really between 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.130
 internships universities and so on day 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.490
 I had free time today is one 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.800
 beautiful day I had a few light 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.430
 absolutely need to make a video e 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.830
 so here I am to show you a ladder 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.439
 essence I decided to make the video 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.040
 because this mascara I tell you immediately of 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.230
 what we are talking about so we take off 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 immediately a thing 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.710
 sorry for the framing is the delle 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.690
 show girl and and is a scale that seeks to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.719
 solve the problem of the region is 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.110
 better eyelashes 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.690
 It is difficult to explain how it works 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.640
 valley review written those that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.550
 normally sees themes and obviously on 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.559
 nick site 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.530
 so here I go to explain 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.960
 how it works then first 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 the handle if we see that the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:14.060
 cap to a movable transparent part ed 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:17.009
 a red handle fixed here if we 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.590
 let's see if it's closed if we go to 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.630
 uncorking the mascara does not work from here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.549
 nothing needs to be used this part 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:35.090
 we get the handle and it opens up 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:35.090
 This is the help I can get 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.520
 it's all perfect maybe the only one 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.880
 sin if we really want to find it is that 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.790
 some mascara lumps lurk in 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.040
 tip however, in short, is a 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.710
 very good product 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.070
 operation is a particular trick 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.800
 then handle part moving the part 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.010
 mobile as you see in the braids that 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.770
 indicates the movement I initially thought 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.420
 you should turn the transparent part 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:17.200
 however if you see help it goes around the part 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.250
 transparent the bottle brush stands still as 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:26.410
 it works then you have to keep with the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:33.750
 average and the index the transparent part e 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:36.430
 turn a mascara through the handle 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.780
 I try to show you I hope to take 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.100
 the shots you see when you give 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.370
 put a mascara known so yes it 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.370
 I admit 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.390
 here I apologize again for the umpteenth 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.340
 once for the shots but mine 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.500
 current with the mirror module is 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.390
 terrifying 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.550
 no all the details and the 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.310
 considerations on this product from 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.700
 description to my opinions 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.830
 you will find in milk's review here 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.230
 below in case I leave you the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.790
 link for those arriving 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.340
 initially this youtube and not 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.880
 know the site go there read 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.640
 because anyway I hit the video here 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.570
 is only on the operation of the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.580
 rotation briefly however I can say 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.300
 that the product is really good 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:41.870
 I recommend it is a wonderful black 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.269
 ultra black and trust me because it says so 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.050
 a girl with blond eyelashes of 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.970
 undo ash and the perfect color of the 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.330
 mascara is essential for me 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.970
 and with regard to the rotation game e 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.920
 I must say that he is certainly nice 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.579
 I don't think it's innovative though 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.299
 fundamental for the success of the 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.060
 application 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.400
 I tell you very often it will be for mine 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.110
 however, very little coordination 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.030
 return difficult to move into apply 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.579
 mascara in the usual movement 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.750
 in addition it will also add the rotation 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.930
 I must tell you that in any case it is carrots 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.390
 rail you whether you don't 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.169
 the result is excellent, therefore, if 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:36.020
 you happen to find this the schenker 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.690
 in the stand essence here in Italy 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.370
 buy the price anyway 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.160
 definitely affordable compared to 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.440
 mascara that you find for sale 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.370
 other brands, however, you really have a good one 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.580
 product almost as good as mine 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.380
 favorite say tris that you know I believe 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.110
 from my reviews 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.150
 in any case I promise you mine 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.760
 next video will be better 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.770
 I will train with right-hand shots a 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.250
 left and so on 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.819
 and nothing dissolute and I hope this 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.810
 my first video was helpful and 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.590
 no kiss 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.590
 Hello
