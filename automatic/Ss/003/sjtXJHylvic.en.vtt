already exists writing over it there is
not<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:09.030> easy<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.140> find

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
not do it is because it's easy to find

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.929 
not do it is because it's easy to find
then<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> search<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.700> rid<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
podcast trade it so I'm going to do a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.080 
podcast trade it so I'm going to do a
series<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> video<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:36.030> one

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
series on the video one but this one

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.390 
series on the video one but this one
we're<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.570> doing<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.990> audio<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
we're just doing is audio but that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.710 
we're just doing is audio but that
doesn't<00:01:38.700> mean<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.000> can't<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.360> sophisticated

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
doesn't mean it can't be sophisticated

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.469 
doesn't mean it can't be sophisticated
than<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.590> sophisticated<00:01:41.479> video

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
than it will be sophisticated video

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.840 
than it will be sophisticated video
podcasts<00:01:43.439> are<00:01:43.530> absolutely<00:01:44.070> enormous<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.729> you

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
podcasts are absolutely enormous and you

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.280 
podcasts are absolutely enormous and you
probably<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.659> want<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.899> make<00:01:46.020> them<00:01:46.259> more

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
probably don't want to make them more

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
probably don't want to make them more
than<00:01:46.560> about<00:01:46.619> three<00:01:46.770> minutes<00:01:47.159> long<00:01:47.509> because

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
than about three minutes long because

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.480 
than about three minutes long because
they<00:01:48.750> become<00:01:49.079> unwieldy<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.950> difficult<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
they become unwieldy and difficult to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.380 
they become unwieldy and difficult to
download<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.320> way<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:53.299> making<00:01:54.299> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
download so this is one way of making it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.749 
download so this is one way of making it

you can also drop artwork and do markers
