00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.930
 in short, I had to tell you 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.939
 say from the beginning today the subject 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.159
 of the video what is it all 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.570
 just how the sniper changed me 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.610
 do not want the sniper even the name there 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.780
 figure also changed and this is the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.710
 following this famous video that 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.049
 appears on the screen you see it here so 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.340
 following the rage as is this 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.049
 once I told you I had you 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.150
 promised I'll make you a video of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.100
 solutions how not to rager on call 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 of duty and I will be frank with you 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.909
 my dog ​​a rage in the soul of the style 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.950
 competitors but I'm not a 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.869
 hateful ie what is to say 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.340
 than in the guys who rage all the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.500
 time while here they are not 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.659
 necessarily how to say that they are not 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.790
 necessarily sometimes they are not good 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.200
 sometimes they are really bad 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.490
 faith and it's bad faith exists 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.930
 as in the video game I you 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.490
 will say and that is a minimum of 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.360
 competition it happens to be bad 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 faith but not always 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.969
 must know how to put a limit like 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.350
 I told you what are the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.630
 solutions that I found 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.490
 personally he'll say to avoid 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.229
 other books and that made me 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.850
 change that one makes change also my 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.100
 mindset on call of duty trimmers 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.450
 30 with you 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.130
 snipe the fact of playing a lot at 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.310
 snipe to confront people who propose 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.900
 played alarm was a great solution 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.790
 I tell you clearly you come back 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.140
 in a game and yet I'm going to have 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.360
 something eh it's very often at 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.890
 sniper thrown like carnage of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.030
 massacres of dramas but there's game 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.319
 in which it's just a woman 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.330
 it's just disgusting is 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.650
 disgusting because actually the guys in 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.380
 face so much jousting with weapons 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.900
 easy and wait-and-see manner 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.950
 causes this you will end the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.020
 negative game 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.959
 it can be some kits it can 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.000
 to be of several kills in passing there 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.220
 is not that sniper unfairly that 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.840
 I sometimes made negative 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.290
 for example if you go to play mining 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.580
 and it's frankly you know that's it 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.260
 you will enter a game I see them 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.840
 tomahawk quads you see talking world 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.580
 in the montages of naive hours etc 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.800
 do not believe you will not do me 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.150
 directly I tell you 15 so that's fine 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.180
 come as you go 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.610
 training and wants to say how 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.180
 explain his cdu will make the score 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.470
 negative 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.360
 and precisely it has to get used to 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.739
 in your head because the transition from 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.140
 this one is when I want to come 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.970
 docu you have to get used to 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.400
 to want to play a year for this famous 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.079
 clip where to play simply for the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.269
 pleasure you can also go into a 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.530
 game die a hundred and fifty two times and 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.390
 to tell you in the end what is it 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.950
 changed when I told you 150 12 times I 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.630
 do not talk to you about rab dhure evers 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.920
 booth because there are frankly you 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.470
 have the impression today you tell them 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.090
 I do not know what they are 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.700
 do not understand what I mean but 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.560
 this is just to explain you dies 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.700
 in a game many times ends up with 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.590
 a shit score 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.720
 then you'll tell yourself what's this 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.609
 changed in my life you put the controller 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.140
 think it's going to change nothing in your life 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.060
 and the people who will talk to you all the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.829
 time stats and ratios it is them 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.030
 it's the biggest victims of call 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.799
 of duty you know the biggest 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.850
 victims of this game why because in 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.970
 they do not even realize 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.440
 but they are thoroughly in a kind of 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.540
 trap in fact all the time wanting 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.950
 do stadium stats stages 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.329
 I tell you clearly before 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.220
 I was a scorer people I loved 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.390
 finish first make big assault of 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.980
 ta razer hydra 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.870
 but it only gives you rage 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.970
 above the rage of the often sees too 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.260
 of bad faith a solution that I have 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.060
 also to give is not too much 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.680
 play call of duty and I tell you 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.970
 because I played a lot of this game and 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.799
 I can tell you that my 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.810
 plays I feel that age and mutu 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.240
 the more you take the fun side that's it 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.520
 also something to tell you also another 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.410
 thing the fact of not hesitating to do 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.030
 breaks from certain game modes that 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.830
 are reputed marne for the hard try and 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.240
 it's to change completely 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.160
 you can go sell the game will be customs 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.110
 to redo in a pale or at stake first 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.670
 pebbles and sticks it's going to relax 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.740
 frankly what is it that can also 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.220
 to make sure that you add - on 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.900
 call of duty 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.600
 having a physical activity 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.480
 regular that allows you to let off steam 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.130
 to relax to relieve you in passing that 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.630
 will have noticed I'm on a table a 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.290
 other style of play a lot more 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.360
 a wait 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.650
 like what am I am I am able to 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.360
 play it's not being being preferred 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.610
 both in aggressive mode hooligans but 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.070
 also in wait-and-see mode anticipate 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.480
 the spawn and c is also in cloud mode 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.430
 like the temple you see me in the garage 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.960
 of the sceqe these are spots that are very 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.180
 known to be able to leave precisely 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.220
 here are several styles and I love 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.110
 because the sniper really changed me 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.790
 change my mind and I will 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.860
 you confess a thing what when 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.570
 I stop playing at the stadium and I 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.700
 resume tears it's a crazy thing 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.650
 I swear, people listen to me 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.360
 well it's the best way for me 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.680
 to evolve on call of duty this is a 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.390
 plays with weapons and illicit threats 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.520
 or with those who ask for the most 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.460
 challenge and when you take back an alfalfa 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.650
 silbande a this garage on bo2 a 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.600
 obsidian style or I do not know what 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.360
 esma speakeasy form will become redone 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.100
 it's amazing the number of series that 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.150
 I can realize so I 'm going to 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.710
 make a small summary 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.090
 but I tell you I'll tell you anyway 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.440
 that this is rabies it's part 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.210
 also call of duty call of duty 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.380
 who has a fair play game ie 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.120
 that there are people who are very often 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.450
 infamous and disgusting in their way of 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.010
 to play 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.870
 me for example it happens to me of rage and 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.490
 very often there are a lot of subscribers 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.919
 who sees me on the string of tonio must 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.500
 know that the moments of rage that you 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.140
 go see you in my friend tonio's companion 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.970
 its 5 to 10% the maximum of my time from 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.830
 game on call of duty the rest of the time 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.320
 it's very often I'm laughing yes I say 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.300
 I have at home with guys who have you well etc 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.740

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.000
 think he 'll confirm it anyway he 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.000
 did not shoot will confirm I want him 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.800
 say he initiates so and walt becker does not 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.440
 daddy had targeted on this good right 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.690
 make a brief friends to summarize the 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.430
 regular physical activity situation does not 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.310
 do not play too much at cod do not hesitate to 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.600
