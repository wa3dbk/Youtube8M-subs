age that wherever they get the smell of

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.650 
age that wherever they get the smell of
TNT<00:00:14.029> the<00:00:14.240> smell<00:00:14.570> of<00:00:14.600> manually<00:00:15.590> scratch<00:00:15.920> with

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
TNT the smell of manually scratch with

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.250 
TNT the smell of manually scratch with
three<00:00:17.660> second<00:00:18.650> up<00:00:18.860> to<00:00:18.920> five<00:00:19.310> seconds<00:00:20.000> so<00:00:20.260> so

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
three second up to five seconds so so

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.230 
three second up to five seconds so so
there<00:00:21.440> are<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:21.770> be<00:00:21.800> good<00:00:22.160> in<00:00:22.310> detection<00:00:22.700> mind

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
there are to be good in detection mind

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.290 
there are to be good in detection mind
should<00:00:23.720> be<00:00:24.550> faster<00:00:25.550> learning<00:00:26.350> but<00:00:27.350> also

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
should be faster learning but also

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.870 
should be faster learning but also
occurrence<00:00:29.300> in<00:00:29.480> detecting<00:00:30.050> for<00:00:30.590> example<00:00:31.039> this

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
occurrence in detecting for example this

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.160 
occurrence in detecting for example this
rat<00:00:32.180> is<00:00:32.410> always<00:00:33.410> detecting<00:00:34.010> 100%<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:35.960> can

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
rat is always detecting 100% so you can

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.400 
rat is always detecting 100% so you can
say<00:00:36.350> that<00:00:36.530> that<00:00:36.770> this<00:00:36.980> rat<00:00:37.250> is<00:00:37.430> good<00:00:38.410> everyday

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
say that that this rat is good everyday

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.310 
say that that this rat is good everyday

just be put in the kitchen we leave them

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.560 
just be put in the kitchen we leave them
there<00:01:00.170> for<00:01:00.230> playing<00:01:00.829> for<00:01:01.070> 15<00:01:01.489> minutes<00:01:01.910> but

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570

also we have long leash where we also
practicing<00:01:06.079> working<00:01:06.439> with<00:01:06.649> them<00:01:07.509> people<00:01:08.509> in

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:08.569 
practicing working with them people in

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.889 
practicing working with them people in
Tanzania<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.560> are<00:01:10.039> thinking<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:11.209> the<00:01:11.539> rat<00:01:11.689> is

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
Tanzania we are thinking that the rat is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.389 
Tanzania we are thinking that the rat is
so<00:01:12.319> destructive<00:01:12.859> and<00:01:13.429> is<00:01:14.590> animal<00:01:15.590> that<00:01:15.829> we

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
so destructive and is animal that we

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.510 
so destructive and is animal that we
should<00:01:16.639> keep<00:01:16.969> it<00:01:17.179> away<00:01:17.389> from<00:01:17.569> the<00:01:18.229> people<00:01:19.039> but

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
should keep it away from the people but

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.599 
should keep it away from the people but
now<00:01:19.819> they<00:01:20.060> hear<00:01:20.389> a<00:01:20.749> pop<00:01:21.139> was<00:01:21.380> telling<00:01:22.159> variety

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
now they hear a pop was telling variety

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.279 
now they hear a pop was telling variety
to<00:01:22.729> detect<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.209> landmine<00:01:23.630> as<00:01:23.869> well<00:01:24.109> as

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
to detect a landmine as well as

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.120 
to detect a landmine as well as
tuberculosis<00:01:25.179> so<00:01:26.179> now<00:01:26.389> the<00:01:26.450> people<00:01:27.130> they

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
tuberculosis so now the people they

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.309 
tuberculosis so now the people they
don't<00:01:28.340> even<00:01:28.609> hate<00:01:29.029> the<00:01:29.060> rat<00:01:29.420> because<00:01:29.840> now<00:01:30.079> they

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
don't even hate the rat because now they
