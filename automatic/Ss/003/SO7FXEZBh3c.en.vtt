00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.100 
now because they're kickboard that goes
along<00:02:54.590> here<00:02:55.150> seal<00:02:56.150> all<00:02:56.330> this<00:02:56.480> often<00:02:56.750> give<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.019> a

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
along here seal all this often give it a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.490 
along here seal all this often give it a
nice<00:02:57.260> finish<00:02:57.650> has<00:02:58.550> got<00:02:58.989> 140<00:02:59.989> millimeters

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
nice finish has got 140 millimeters

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.190 
nice finish has got 140 millimeters
clearance<00:03:01.239> so<00:03:02.239> I'm<00:03:02.330> going<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.540> set<00:03:02.720> these<00:03:02.870> legs

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
clearance so I'm going to set these legs

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.949 
clearance so I'm going to set these legs
to<00:03:03.470> roughly<00:03:03.860> 140<00:03:04.580> millimeters<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.690> there's

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
to roughly 140 millimeters so there's

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.240 
to roughly 140 millimeters so there's
not<00:03:06.050> much<00:03:06.140> adjusting<00:03:06.650> needs<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.980> be<00:03:07.069> done

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
not much adjusting needs to be done

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.420 
not much adjusting needs to be done
where<00:03:07.459> it's<00:03:07.610> in<00:03:07.730> place<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.959> screw<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.440> out

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.640 

141<00:03:13.430> milliliters<00:03:14.239> it's<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.080> beauty<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.470> these

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
141 milliliters it's the beauty of these

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.410 
141 milliliters it's the beauty of these
adjustable<00:03:16.250> legs<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.849> then<00:03:17.030> we<00:03:17.120> can<00:03:17.269> just

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
adjustable legs and then we can just

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.479 
adjustable legs and then we can just
fine-tune<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.140> as<00:03:18.349> we<00:03:18.500> go<00:03:18.680> when<00:03:19.040> it's<00:03:19.220> in<00:03:19.340> place

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
fine-tune it as we go when it's in place

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.120
