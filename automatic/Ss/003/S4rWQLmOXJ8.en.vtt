00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
because the godiva chocolate covered

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.650 
because the godiva chocolate covered
strawberries<00:05:30.340> are<00:05:30.520> like<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.820> million<00:05:31.120> dollars

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
strawberries are like a million dollars

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.230 
strawberries are like a million dollars
their<00:05:32.140> price<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.560> start<00:05:32.770> at<00:05:32.890> 1999<00:05:33.669> and<00:05:34.000> then

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
their price to start at 1999 and then

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.080 
their price to start at 1999 and then
they<00:05:34.360> go<00:05:34.540> up<00:05:34.750> there<00:05:35.290> very<00:05:35.560> reasonable<00:05:36.190> so<00:05:36.550> if

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
they go up there very reasonable so if

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.940 
they go up there very reasonable so if
you<00:05:37.510> want<00:05:37.690> to<00:05:37.780> do<00:05:37.900> something<00:05:38.140> special<00:05:38.350> you

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
you want to do something special you

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.170 
you want to do something special you
have<00:05:39.100> a<00:05:39.130> little<00:05:39.370> bit<00:05:39.580> more<00:05:39.760> money<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.090> spend

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
have a little bit more money to spend

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.060 
have a little bit more money to spend
and<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.720> think<00:05:41.080> chocolate<00:05:41.680> covered

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
and I think chocolate covered

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.220 
and I think chocolate covered
strawberries<00:05:42.669> or<00:05:42.970> any<00:05:43.480> kind<00:05:43.660> of<00:05:43.780> dessert

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
strawberries or any kind of dessert

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.320 
strawberries or any kind of dessert
isn't<00:05:44.650> really<00:05:44.860> good<00:05:45.040> though<00:05:45.310> that<00:05:45.850> is<00:05:46.060> it<00:05:46.300> for

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
isn't really good though that is it for

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.530 
isn't really good though that is it for
