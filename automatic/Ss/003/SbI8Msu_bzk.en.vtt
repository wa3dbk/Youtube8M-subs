00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 in exclusive interview with jaime record 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.400
 lozano told us about his unexpected retirement 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.820
 of the courts at 34 years old 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.280
 I felt pretty good, it was not, it was not 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.129
 something or not the aspect was related 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.600
 physical or much less always in my 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.970
 mind was 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.570
 to be able to retire 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.690
 at an age that was competing 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.000
 especially since 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.240
 I did not want to spend what happened to me 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.840
 last year that was playing sometimes sometimes 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.730
 not sometimes I concentrate that was something 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.090
 that I did not want to live I felt good 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.910
 and I was always very involved and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.590
 and I say obviously the people who know me 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.970
 He knows that I fought in every training 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.970
 for a position and 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.480
 and always try to give 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.250
 puts on the field the best lush jaime 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.470
 then I was not tired but I was 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.150
 It was very clear what I wanted to do and 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.670
 was to retire at an age that I 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.680
 I knew I could still compete and 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.930
 can be when I say great level 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.850
 that my decision was made with 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.390
 tranquility was not something visceral nor 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:18.159
 much less this I thought it was 15 years 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.159
 that I enjoy to the maximum what 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.670
 the truth that I am very grateful with 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.530
 everyone who was by my side from 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.320
 child for helping me to be a better soccer player 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.510
 better person but but not and although 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.990
 comes the real madrid that I 'm not 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.790
 happy I am preparing to 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.780
 something else and good 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.320
 and everything I could do in my career 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.570
 the truth that I am very very satisfied and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.270
 grateful I tell you with all those who 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.039
 I'm talking about me 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.679
 the former college midfielder 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.700
 also he revealed why he did not want to play 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.700
 on the rise mx 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.680
 I never wanted I had thought 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.350
 the league of promotion and good 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.710
 and that he did not really thank the team 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.280
 low for thinking about me because he had a year 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.430
 that practically rises frozen I played 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.560
 very little and good they noticed me 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.840
 as a referent of that team the age 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.060
 thank you very much but but my 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.330
 plans was not first I left the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.920
 capital and unless this can go out I 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.260
 always kill me to be the best 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.260
 team and to be in prison then 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.810
 It never crossed my mind if I had 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.390
 been a different player than the best 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.910
 sometimes trains well sometimes not already 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.230
 This time he did not play for other 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.240
 situations because maybe he said 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.010
 well then what I get and one way 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.330
 but when you know what I think deserves 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.250
 that you have to fight to the death for that 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.020
 Jimmy also talked about how his 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.720
 pumas exit with the directive 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.390
 led by alberto garcía aspe 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.190
 everything is normal 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.830
 I say 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.230
 it can not go well because they are 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.730
 complicated situations but neither is 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.340
 something bad i go calm 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.409
 what I was saying, I say mostly to 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.909
 my friends to my family that I'm leaving the 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.879
 football and I can see the face to everything 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:19.000
 world with that I want to stay not 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.220
 I never played bad to anyone I never made you 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.410
 something for my benefit for is happening 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.940
 above someone and good everyone 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.349
 He knows what he did well and what he did wrong 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.730
 not then I say it's a way out I think 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:37.510
 that professional if I see him and greeted him 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.340
 and as if nothing and so so but great 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.349
 friends we are not always of all 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.080
 things that we work with and this is 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.200
 the case seems that the relationship was 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.090
 purely professional and is there 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.560
 about whether he would accept that the club 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.180
 auriazul will perform a match 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:58.610
 farewell I doubt about the possibility 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.190
 I do not know I do not know I never went from the idea of 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.550
 to make a as well as I had clear idea of 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.220
 retire at an age like this is never 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.200
 it was in my mind to make a game of 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.200
 my friends against me or cougars against 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.920
 my friends I do not know this one was never my 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.920
 intention and 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:23.310
 they did not know what I would do if I got it 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.710
 at that opportunity I do not know if we would take it 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.389
