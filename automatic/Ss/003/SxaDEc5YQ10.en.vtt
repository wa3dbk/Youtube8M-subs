we<00:00:00.149> have<00:00:00.269> here<00:00:00.480> is<00:00:00.570> a<00:00:00.599> test<00:00:00.930> rig<00:00:01.110> they<00:00:01.199> are

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230 
we have here is a test rig they are

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.690 
we have here is a test rig they are
going<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.439> use<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.860> see<00:00:02.040> how<00:00:02.129> much<00:00:02.340> load<00:00:02.550> these

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
going to use to see how much load these

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.120 
going to use to see how much load these
wing<00:00:02.970> sections<00:00:03.449> could<00:00:03.659> take<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.589> it's<00:00:04.920> pretty

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
wing sections could take and it's pretty

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.590 
wing sections could take and it's pretty
simple<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.549> got<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> couple<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.029> soft<00:00:06.270> stools

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
simple we got a couple of soft stools

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.009 
simple we got a couple of soft stools
here<00:00:07.130> and<00:00:08.179> support<00:00:09.179> apparatus<00:00:09.719> here<00:00:09.870> with

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
here and support apparatus here with

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.780 
here and support apparatus here with
foam<00:00:10.200> up<00:00:10.410> here<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.099> will<00:00:11.250> deform<00:00:11.580> to

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
foam up here so that it will deform to

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.580 
foam up here so that it will deform to
the<00:00:12.150> shape<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.990> underside<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the shape of the underside of the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.010 
the shape of the underside of the
airfoil<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.580> know<00:00:14.730> concentrate<00:00:15.599> any

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
airfoil so that you know concentrate any

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.380 
airfoil so that you know concentrate any
loads<00:00:16.289> at<00:00:16.529> any<00:00:16.680> particular<00:00:16.980> point<00:00:17.400> on<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
loads at any particular point on the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.710 
loads at any particular point on the
bottom<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> airflow<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.720> set

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
bottom of the airflow we have this set

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.269 
bottom of the airflow we have this set
of<00:00:21.840> clamps<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.590> top<00:00:22.800> which<00:00:23.070> have

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
of clamps here on the top which have

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.130 
of clamps here on the top which have
foam<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.789> top<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.210> again<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.570> intended<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
foam at the top and again is intended to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.839 
foam at the top and again is intended to
spread<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> load<00:00:25.949> out<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> little<00:00:26.310> bit<00:00:26.519> more<00:00:26.670> so

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
spread the load out a little bit more so

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.429 
spread the load out a little bit more so
you<00:00:26.939> don't<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.210> concentrations<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.170> stress

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
you don't have concentrations of stress

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.880 
you don't have concentrations of stress
on<00:00:28.650> quarters<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.160> wood<00:00:29.630> that<00:00:30.630> comes<00:00:31.529> apart

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
on quarters of the wood that comes apart

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.110 
on quarters of the wood that comes apart
being<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.160> loosen<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:32.880> slide

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
being and loosen this so we can slide

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.299 
being and loosen this so we can slide
another<00:00:33.329> wing<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.290> then<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.680> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
another wing in and then we have this

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
another wing in and then we have this
little<00:00:35.520> tree<00:00:35.820> arrangement<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.570> which<00:00:36.870> takes

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
little tree arrangement here which takes

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.709 
little tree arrangement here which takes
a<00:00:37.320> loads<00:00:37.559> or<00:00:38.280> distributes<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.910> load<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.570> these

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
a loads or distributes a load of these

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.560 
a loads or distributes a load of these
weights<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:41.040> four<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.430> these<00:00:41.610> evenly<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
weights to all four of these evenly and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.840 
weights to all four of these evenly and
we<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> 500<00:00:43.050> pound<00:00:43.500> scale<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.190> which

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
we have a 500 pound scale here which

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.190 
we have a 500 pound scale here which
believe<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.270> or<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.450> some<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> these<00:00:45.960> will

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
believe it or not some of these will

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
believe it or not some of these will
probably<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.890> able<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.190> take<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:48.239> we

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
probably be able to take and then we

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.610 
probably be able to take and then we
have<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:50.000> fixture<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.690> 11<00:00:52.170> 45

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
have a fixture here that we have 11 45

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.180 
have a fixture here that we have 11 45
pound<00:00:52.980> weights<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> weight<00:00:53.910> room<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
pound weights from the weight room and

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.220 
pound weights from the weight room and
before<00:00:56.190> Jack<00:00:56.640> from<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.059> ground<00:00:57.300> screw<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
before Jack from the ground screw and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.709 
before Jack from the ground screw and
the<00:00:59.190> point<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.789> slowly<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the point here is to slowly and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.010 
the point here is to slowly and
carefully<00:01:01.699> put<00:01:02.699> load<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.629> wing<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:06.020> see

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
carefully put load on this wing and see

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.890 
carefully put load on this wing and see
what<00:01:07.140> it'll<00:01:07.320> take<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.510> you<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.659> need<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
what it'll take and you just need to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.450 
what it'll take and you just need to
make<00:01:10.020> sure<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> starts<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> get

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
make sure that we when it starts to get

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.820 
make sure that we when it starts to get
up<00:01:11.580> toward<00:01:11.760> 300<00:01:12.180> pounds<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.900> camera<00:01:13.770> is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
up toward 300 pounds but that camera is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.260 
up toward 300 pounds but that camera is
on<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.220> way

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
on that way

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.109 
on that way
okay

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.310 

alright<00:01:22.310> okay<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:23.939> slowly<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:25.079> is<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
alright okay so I'm slowly this is a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.020 
alright okay so I'm slowly this is a
critical<00:01:25.710> part<00:01:25.859> discipline<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.520> getting

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
critical part discipline just getting

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:48.070 
critical part discipline just getting
this<00:01:27.149> thing<00:01:27.359> to<00:01:27.509> move<00:01:28.159> just<00:01:29.159> barely

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.420 

watch<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.680> back

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:04.340 

yeah

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.230 

and<00:02:04.440> survive

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.330 

200
