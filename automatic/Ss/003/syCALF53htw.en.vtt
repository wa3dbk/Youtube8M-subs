00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.850 
I've been wondering how long does it
take<00:00:53.239> for<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:53.690> guys<00:00:53.720> to<00:00:53.900> produce<00:00:54.230> one<00:00:54.650> of<00:00:54.680> your

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
take for you guys to produce one of your

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.770 
take for you guys to produce one of your
typical<00:00:54.980> 10-minute<00:00:55.640> episodes<00:00:56.059> that's<00:00:56.600> a

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
typical 10-minute episodes that's a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.630 
typical 10-minute episodes that's a
really<00:00:57.110> great<00:00:57.230> question<00:00:57.350> ray<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.100> it's<00:00:58.430> tough

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
really great question ray and it's tough

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.310 
really great question ray and it's tough
to<00:00:58.760> answer<00:00:59.059> that<00:00:59.180> one<00:00:59.330> directly<00:00:59.750> because<00:00:59.960> each

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
to answer that one directly because each

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.470 
to answer that one directly because each
episode<00:01:00.980> is<00:01:01.250> different<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.150> crew<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.420> I

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
episode is different so the crew and I

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.030

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
and we kind of came upon the number of

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.130 
and we kind of came upon the number of
48<00:01:06.380> collective<00:01:06.979> working<00:01:07.490> hours<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.420> make<00:01:08.630> one

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
48 collective working hours to make one

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.690

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
every single week and it's different

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.380

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
based on animal and location but there's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.640 
based on animal and location but there's
three<00:01:14.479> different<00:01:14.840> parts<00:01:15.080> that<00:01:15.140> goes<00:01:15.350> into

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
three different parts that goes into

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.740 
three different parts that goes into
every<00:01:16.040> single<00:01:16.310> episode<00:01:16.750> pre-production

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
every single episode pre-production

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.200 
every single episode pre-production
production<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:18.590> post-production<00:01:19.210> first

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
production and post-production first

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.000 
production and post-production first
let's<00:01:20.420> talk<00:01:20.600> about<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:21.140> pre-production<00:01:21.560> and

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
let's talk about the pre-production and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.469 
let's talk about the pre-production and
it<00:01:22.220> starts<00:01:22.610> with<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:22.880> internet<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.390> with

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
it starts with the internet and with

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.300 
it starts with the internet and with
field<00:01:23.780> guides<00:01:24.020> I<00:01:24.229> do<00:01:24.439> a<00:01:24.560> ton<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:24.950> research

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
field guides I do a ton of research

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.980 
field guides I do a ton of research
about<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.729> animals<00:01:26.119> that<00:01:26.299> I<00:01:26.330> might<00:01:26.630> want<00:01:26.900> to

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
about the animals that I might want to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.600 
about the animals that I might want to
encounter<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:27.979> start<00:01:28.280> researching

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
encounter and then I start researching

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.789 
encounter and then I start researching
the<00:01:28.820> locations<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.689> we<00:01:29.780> can<00:01:29.900> travel<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.380> to

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
the locations that we can travel to to

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.800 
the locations that we can travel to to
ultimately<00:01:31.189> encounter<00:01:31.640> these<00:01:31.760> animals<00:01:32.150> once

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
ultimately encounter these animals once

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.510 
ultimately encounter these animals once
I<00:01:32.930> figure<00:01:33.229> out<00:01:33.380> what<00:01:33.680> animal<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:34.130> we<00:01:34.280> want<00:01:34.430> to

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
I figure out what animal is we want to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.490 
I figure out what animal is we want to
go<00:01:34.610> after<00:01:34.939> we<00:01:35.299> start<00:01:35.539> booking<00:01:35.810> our<00:01:36.049> trip<00:01:36.320> and

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
go after we start booking our trip and

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.679 
go after we start booking our trip and
then<00:01:36.859> production<00:01:37.369> begins<00:01:37.820> once<00:01:38.359> we<00:01:38.509> actually

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
then production begins once we actually

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.870 
then production begins once we actually
get<00:01:39.049> on<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.409> ground<00:01:39.649> in<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.859> location<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:40.700> can

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
get on the ground in a location it can

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.999 
get on the ground in a location it can
take<00:01:41.030> us<00:01:41.179> days<00:01:41.539> sometimes<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.469> find<00:01:42.710> some<00:01:42.920> of

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
take us days sometimes to find some of

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.580 
take us days sometimes to find some of
these<00:01:43.100> animals<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:43.820> it's<00:01:44.149> me<00:01:44.420> it's<00:01:44.840> mark<00:01:45.320> its

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
these animals so it's me it's mark its

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.020 
these animals so it's me it's mark its
chance<00:01:46.130> it's<00:01:46.460> Melissa

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
chance it's Melissa

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
we'll be out there three four or five

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.840 
we'll be out there three four or five
days<00:01:51.109> trying<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.799> encounter<00:01:52.100> as<00:01:52.369> many<00:01:52.579> animals

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
days trying to encounter as many animals

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.940 
days trying to encounter as many animals
as<00:01:53.179> we<00:01:53.329> can<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:53.960> let's<00:01:54.170> say<00:01:54.289> we're<00:01:54.469> in<00:01:54.560> Arizona

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
as we can so let's say we're in Arizona

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.770 
as we can so let's say we're in Arizona
we've<00:01:55.130> put<00:01:55.310> together<00:01:55.429> a<00:01:55.609> list<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:55.939> 15

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
we've put together a list of 15

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.819 
we've put together a list of 15
different<00:01:57.079> animals<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.409> we<00:01:57.560> want<00:01:57.710> to

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
different animals that we want to

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.620 
different animals that we want to
encounter<00:01:58.070> we're<00:01:58.729> not<00:01:58.850> going<00:01:58.999> to<00:01:59.060> see<00:01:59.179> all<00:01:59.210> 15

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
encounter we're not going to see all 15

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.300 
encounter we're not going to see all 15
of<00:01:59.659> these<00:01:59.840> animals<00:02:00.229> we<00:02:00.499> might<00:02:00.710> see<00:02:00.920> five<00:02:01.159> of

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
of these animals we might see five of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.010 
of these animals we might see five of
those<00:02:01.369> animals<00:02:01.819> and<00:02:01.969> then<00:02:02.329> we<00:02:02.420> might<00:02:02.569> see<00:02:02.780> four

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
those animals and then we might see four

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.989 
those animals and then we might see four
or<00:02:03.049> five<00:02:03.140> we<00:02:03.619> didn't<00:02:03.979> plan<00:02:04.159> on<00:02:04.189> seeing<00:02:04.549> I've

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:04.999 
or five we didn't plan on seeing I've

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.120 
or five we didn't plan on seeing I've
got<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.420> be<00:02:05.509> ready<00:02:05.719> for<00:02:06.049> any<00:02:06.289> situation<00:02:06.530> and

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
got to be ready for any situation and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.160 
got to be ready for any situation and
any<00:02:07.280> animal<00:02:07.520> at<00:02:07.819> any<00:02:08.210> point<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.600> time<00:02:08.630> which

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
any animal at any point in time which

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.320 
any animal at any point in time which
makes<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.530> challenging<00:02:09.710> once<00:02:10.550> we're<00:02:10.789> there<00:02:10.850> in

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
makes it challenging once we're there in

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.850 
makes it challenging once we're there in
the<00:02:11.510> environment<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.050> let's<00:02:12.290> say<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.770> a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
the environment and let's say it's a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.350 
the environment and let's say it's a
rattlesnake<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.490> if<00:02:13.790> we've<00:02:13.910> encountered<00:02:14.150> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
rattlesnake and if we've encountered the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.910 
rattlesnake and if we've encountered the
rattlesnake<00:02:14.810> I've<00:02:15.020> caught<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.440> rattlesnake

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
rattlesnake I've caught the rattlesnake

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.440 
rattlesnake I've caught the rattlesnake
the<00:02:16.310> catch<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.700> obviously<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.270> most

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the catch is obviously the most

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.420 
the catch is obviously the most
dangerous<00:02:17.810> part<00:02:18.110> once<00:02:18.590> I've<00:02:18.740> got<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.069> animal

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
dangerous part once I've got the animal

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.670 
dangerous part once I've got the animal
in<00:02:19.580> my<00:02:19.910> hands<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.360> under<00:02:20.569> control<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.350> camera

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
in my hands and under control the camera

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.230 
in my hands and under control the camera
team<00:02:21.860> can<00:02:22.040> move<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.340> close<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.790> we<00:02:22.940> begin

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
team can move in close and we begin

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.600 
team can move in close and we begin
filming<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.930> presentation<00:02:24.530> segment<00:02:24.920> after

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
filming the presentation segment after

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.520 
filming the presentation segment after
we<00:02:25.730> get<00:02:25.940> all<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.510> footage<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.020> we<00:02:27.110> needed<00:02:27.319> in

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
we get all the footage that we needed in

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.850 
we get all the footage that we needed in
the<00:02:27.590> field<00:02:27.830> then

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the field then

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.040 
the field then
goes<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.610> post-production<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.020> a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
goes in to post-production this is a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.230 
goes in to post-production this is a
whole<00:02:31.470> different<00:02:31.740> ballgame<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.090> where

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
whole different ballgame this is where

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.780 
whole different ballgame this is where
you<00:02:33.360> actually<00:02:33.810> put<00:02:34.050> together<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.950> puzzle<00:02:35.160> now

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you actually put together the puzzle now

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.220 
you actually put together the puzzle now
when<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.030> come<00:02:36.180> back<00:02:36.330> from<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.660> trip<00:02:36.810> we<00:02:37.080> have

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
when we come back from a trip we have

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.980 
when we come back from a trip we have
anywhere<00:02:37.620> between<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.340> don't<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.180> maybe<00:02:39.480> 40

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
anywhere between I don't know maybe 40

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.050 
anywhere between I don't know maybe 40
and<00:02:40.110> 50<00:02:40.440> hours<00:02:40.920> worth<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.280> footage<00:02:41.460> think

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and 50 hours worth of footage think

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.210 
and 50 hours worth of footage think
about<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.450> 40<00:02:42.960> or<00:02:43.110> 50<00:02:43.530> hours<00:02:43.920> worth<00:02:44.130> of

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
about that 40 or 50 hours worth of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.920 
about that 40 or 50 hours worth of
footage<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.730> breaks<00:02:44.940> down<00:02:45.090> into<00:02:45.810> these

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
footage that breaks down into these

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.080 
footage that breaks down into these
little<00:02:45.990> seven<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.770> ten<00:02:46.950> minute<00:02:47.250> segments<00:02:47.700> so

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
little seven to ten minute segments so

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.610 
little seven to ten minute segments so
we<00:02:48.240> begin<00:02:48.510> sifting<00:02:48.840> through<00:02:49.050> all<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.380> it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
we begin sifting through all of it

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.710 
we begin sifting through all of it
finding<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.220> best<00:02:50.340> shots<00:02:50.670> finding<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.510> takes

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
finding the best shots finding the takes

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.600 
finding the best shots finding the takes
that<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.900> don't<00:02:52.170> mess<00:02:52.350> up<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:52.890> piecing<00:02:53.520> them

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
that I don't mess up on and piecing them

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.370 
that I don't mess up on and piecing them
together<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.450> comes<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.840> sound<00:02:55.050> effects

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
together then comes the sound effects

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.140 
together then comes the sound effects
comes<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> music<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.580> comes<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.970> color

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
comes the music and comes the color

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.300 
comes the music and comes the color
correction<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.750> ultimately<00:02:58.590> we<00:02:59.100> have<00:02:59.280> a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
correction and ultimately we have a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.400 
correction and ultimately we have a
finished<00:02:59.640> episode<00:02:59.910> we<00:03:00.660> get<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.900> upload<00:03:01.230> to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
finished episode we get to upload to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.260 
finished episode we get to upload to
YouTube<00:03:01.709> for<00:03:02.100> everyone<00:03:02.490> out<00:03:02.640> there<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.880> enjoy

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
YouTube for everyone out there to enjoy

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.360 
YouTube for everyone out there to enjoy
so<00:03:03.810> again<00:03:04.050> I'd<00:03:04.260> see<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> total<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.100> put<00:03:05.250> together

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
so again I'd see a total to put together

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.340 
so again I'd see a total to put together
one<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.760> our<00:03:05.880> typical<00:03:06.090> 10<00:03:06.450> minute<00:03:06.660> episodes<00:03:07.110> it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
one of our typical 10 minute episodes it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.010 
one of our typical 10 minute episodes it
probably<00:03:07.890> takes<00:03:08.070> about<00:03:08.250> 48<00:03:08.760> working<00:03:09.330> hours

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
probably takes about 48 working hours

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.290 
probably takes about 48 working hours
that<00:03:10.350> was<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> fantastic<00:03:11.190> question<00:03:11.370> ray<00:03:11.760> keep
