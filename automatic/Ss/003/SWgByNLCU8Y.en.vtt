00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.530
 coins coahuila and really never we 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.550
 had touched a disaster this 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.710
 magnitude and I think that as miners or 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.900
 It is essential to help people who are 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.900
 of my home because here is my home 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.190
 well, we bring tuna sofas paper 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.190
 sanitary diapers 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.420
 because I think it's thinking about it 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.830
 to other people like when I 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.650
 I'm going to suffer an accident I think it's 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.850
 will receive the help in the same way 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.800
 I tell everyone to take 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.240
 conscience because then like so much to 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.190
 they passed them to us can 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.560
 happen and well it's good to help people 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.200
 and I found out about the facebook and the truth 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.760
 yes I was very surprised by all the pictures 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.380
 what city life already coins 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.990
 more than anything helping this 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.970
 becoming aware of bringing things 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:10.360
 indispensable as food roll 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.190
 canned things like this this and that that 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.860
 content because if we would pass 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.560
 they the same would help us so that 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.890
 it would be very good and that on the part of 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.890
 churches 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.860
 I say you have to support people when you 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.800
 you need because if it does not reach 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.170
 to pass something to us the same as it would be 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.909
 well that they supported us then it is a 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.859
 granite of sand that maybe 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.219
 to people who need it right now 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.859
 well after yesterday when I found out 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.719
 that the tornado had happened 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.150
 then I started to check to see where I was going 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.120
 to see little centers to 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.140
 Well, to support a little bit and then today 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.640
 in the morning to buy all the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.070
 things and after I found out about 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.040
 that here is going to be a collection center 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.110
 then so this help and 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.530
 all those who have already done so 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.410
 thank you on behalf of all of you 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.190
 coahuila that are affected and therefore that 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.190
 top tires
