okay so to make a basic text animation
there's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> number<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> different<00:01:27.270> ways<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
could do it you can do it manually using

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.030 
could do it you can do it manually using
you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.820> theory<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:31.619> keyframe

I'm just going to toggle down the
animation<00:01:57.659> presets<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.310> down<00:01:59.460> here

animation presets then if I go down here

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
animation presets then if I go down here
to<00:01:59.700> text<00:02:00.390> you'll<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.780> there's<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> number<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
to text you'll see there's a number of

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.170 
to text you'll see there's a number of
folders<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> bunch<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.549> presets<00:02:02.790> in

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
folders here with a bunch of presets in

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.030 
folders here with a bunch of presets in
there<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.229> sophisticated<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
there that are really sophisticated that

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.130 
there that are really sophisticated that
you<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:06.000> away<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:06.960> want<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you can use right away so if you want to

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.770 
you can use right away so if you want to
animate<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.740> let's<00:02:08.489> say<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.970> center<00:02:09.390> spiral

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
animate in let's say a center spiral

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.660 
animate in let's say a center spiral
first<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.319> all<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.160> drag<00:02:11.459> it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
first one all I have to do is drag it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.920 
first one all I have to do is drag it
right<00:02:11.700> onto<00:02:11.940> my<00:02:12.300> text

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
right onto my text

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.330 
right onto my text
you'll<00:02:13.170> notice<00:02:13.409> it<00:02:13.530> disappeared<00:02:14.159> because

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
you'll notice it disappeared because

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.280 
you'll notice it disappeared because
it's<00:02:14.700> actually<00:02:14.969> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.150> animate<00:02:15.569> into<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
it's actually going to animate into the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.030 
it's actually going to animate into the
frame<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.189> if<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.659> toggle<00:02:18.659> down<00:02:19.019> my<00:02:19.290> text<00:02:19.769> here

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
frame so if I toggle down my text here

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.780 
frame so if I toggle down my text here
and<00:02:20.189> then<00:02:20.780> pop<00:02:21.780> down<00:02:22.129> this<00:02:23.129> little<00:02:23.489> thing

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
and then pop down this little thing

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.220 
and then pop down this little thing
you'll<00:02:24.030> see<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.359> there's<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.659> couple<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.019> gray

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
you'll see that there's a couple of gray

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.869 
you'll see that there's a couple of gray
circles<00:02:25.709> here<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.400> means<00:02:26.579> that<00:02:26.700> there's

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
circles here that means that there's

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.550 
circles here that means that there's
keyframes<00:02:27.329> in<00:02:27.540> there<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.230> are<00:02:28.319> sort<00:02:28.500> of

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
keyframes in there that are sort of

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.199 
keyframes in there that are sort of
hidden<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.099> want<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.370> toggle<00:02:29.579> down<00:02:29.909> these

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
hidden and you want to toggle down these

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.479 
hidden and you want to toggle down these
effects<00:02:30.689> here<00:02:31.079> to<00:02:31.469> see<00:02:31.650> where<00:02:31.829> they<00:02:31.950> are<00:02:31.980> boom

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
effects here to see where they are boom

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.660 
effects here to see where they are boom
just<00:02:32.939> like<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.840> now<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.019> can<00:02:34.230> see<00:02:34.409> our

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
just like that so now we can see our

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.949 
just like that so now we can see our
keyframes<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.359> can<00:02:36.480> actually<00:02:36.629> manipulate

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
keyframes and we can actually manipulate

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.220 
keyframes and we can actually manipulate
them<00:02:37.439> as<00:02:37.680> well<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.609> if<00:02:38.909> I<00:02:39.090> scrub<00:02:39.480> forward<00:02:39.989> here

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
them as well so if I scrub forward here

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.780 
them as well so if I scrub forward here
you'll<00:02:40.469> see<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.799> little<00:02:41.069> spiral<00:02:41.639> effect

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
you'll see this little spiral effect

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.440 
you'll see this little spiral effect
pretty<00:02:42.540> cool<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.310> then<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.609> finishes<00:02:44.849> right

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
pretty cool and then it finishes right

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.149 
pretty cool and then it finishes right
here<00:02:45.599> at<00:02:45.720> around<00:02:45.930> two<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.409> a<00:02:46.470> half<00:02:46.620> seconds

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
here at around two and a half seconds

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.309 
here at around two and a half seconds
it's<00:02:47.430> pretty<00:02:47.639> good<00:02:47.819> but<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.049> wanted<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
it's pretty good but if I wanted to

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.819 
it's pretty good but if I wanted to
change<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.709> say<00:02:50.370> my<00:02:50.810> intro<00:02:51.810> text<00:02:52.200> animation

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
change that say my intro text animation

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.099 
change that say my intro text animation
needed<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.129> be<00:02:53.250> four<00:02:53.669> seconds<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.419> could<00:02:54.780> scrub

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
needed to be four seconds I could scrub

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.619 
needed to be four seconds I could scrub
forward<00:02:55.379> to<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> four<00:02:56.040> mark<00:02:56.310> here<00:02:56.790> grab<00:02:57.450> these

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
forward to the four mark here grab these

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.959 
forward to the four mark here grab these
two<00:02:57.870> keyframes<00:02:58.139> and<00:02:58.889> just<00:02:59.609> shove<00:02:59.819> them

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
two keyframes and just shove them

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:04.069 
two keyframes and just shove them
forward<00:03:00.359> a<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.569> bit<00:03:01.579> now<00:03:02.780> takes<00:03:03.780> four

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
forward a little bit now takes four

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.500 
forward a little bit now takes four
seconds<00:03:04.560> instead<00:03:04.859> of<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.099> two<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> half<00:03:05.609> so

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
seconds instead of the two and a half so

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.940 
seconds instead of the two and a half so
these<00:03:06.629> animation<00:03:07.079> presets<00:03:07.439> are<00:03:07.560> really

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
these animation presets are really

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.039 
these animation presets are really
helpful<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.489> easy<00:03:08.669> and<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:09.359> can<00:03:09.480> also<00:03:09.629> change

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
helpful and easy and you can also change

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.479 
helpful and easy and you can also change
them<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.379> can<00:03:10.409> manipulate<00:03:10.709> them<00:03:11.099> they<00:03:11.310> aren't

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
them you can manipulate them they aren't

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.550 
them you can manipulate them they aren't
set<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.030> stone<00:03:12.180> or<00:03:12.629> anything<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.379> it's<00:03:13.500> a
