00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
if someone's hair is someone has very

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
if someone's hair is someone has very
fine<00:01:22.110> hair<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> may<00:01:22.770> want<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> use<00:01:23.250> an<00:01:23.460> iron

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
fine hair you may want to use an iron

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.910 
fine hair you may want to use an iron
that's<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.479> little<00:01:24.840> bit<00:01:25.049> smaller<00:01:25.409> than<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.770> 1

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that's a little bit smaller than the 1

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.410 
that's a little bit smaller than the 1
inch<00:01:26.100> barrel<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> curl<00:01:27.270> that's

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
inch barrel and go for a curl that's

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.679 
inch barrel and go for a curl that's
just<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.439> bit<00:01:29.030> smaller<00:01:30.030> than<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.479> want

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
just a little bit smaller than you want

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.499 
just a little bit smaller than you want
because<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.020> gonna<00:01:31.140> end<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.470> falling<00:01:31.710> out

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
because it's gonna end up falling out

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.219 
because it's gonna end up falling out
okay<00:01:33.509> perfect

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
okay perfect

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.510 
okay perfect
so<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:36.439> think<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.799> important<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so I think it's really important as a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.670 
so I think it's really important as a
hairstylist<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.390> use<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:39.900> hands<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.350> much<00:01:40.500> as

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
hairstylist to use your hands as much as

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
hairstylist to use your hands as much as
possible<00:01:41.220> sometimes<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> best<00:01:42.060> tool

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
possible sometimes it's the best tool

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.350 
possible sometimes it's the best tool
they<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:43.200> use<00:01:43.710> my<00:01:43.860> hands<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.759> instead

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
they have I use my hands a lot instead

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.179 
they have I use my hands a lot instead
of<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.540> comb<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> brush<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:48.649> to<00:01:49.649> play<00:01:49.920> around
