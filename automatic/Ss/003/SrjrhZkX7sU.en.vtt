Frankenstein and The Invisible Man

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.100 
Frankenstein and The Invisible Man
I<00:00:38.670> think<00:00:38.969> there's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> couple<00:00:39.390> variants<00:00:40.079> that

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I think there's a couple variants that

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.010 
I think there's a couple variants that
are<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:41.090> if<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.510> mistaken

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
are out there if I'm not mistaken

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.750 
are out there if I'm not mistaken
there's<00:00:43.350> an<00:00:43.469> invisible<00:00:43.770> version<00:00:44.670> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
there's an invisible version of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.990 
there's an invisible version of
Invisible<00:00:45.420> Man<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.890> man<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
Invisible Man and man it's just a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.180 
Invisible Man and man it's just a
regular<00:00:48.120> guy<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:49.050> that's<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.379> demon

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
regular guy and that's a demon

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.220 
regular guy and that's a demon
ok<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.940> believe<00:00:51.270> there's<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:51.600> alternate

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
ok and I believe there's an alternate

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.869 
ok and I believe there's an alternate
version<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.649> Viper<00:00:53.129> doing<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.460> well<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.760> think

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
version of Viper doing as well I think

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.700 
version of Viper doing as well I think
there's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> glow-in-the-dark<00:00:54.329> version<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.440> I

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
there's a glow-in-the-dark version so I

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.000 
there's a glow-in-the-dark version so I
guess<00:00:56.100> that's<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> episode<00:00:56.610> nicer<00:00:57.739> well<00:00:58.739> guys

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
guess that's the episode nicer well guys

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
guess that's the episode nicer well guys
it's<00:00:59.940> pointless<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.420> talk<00:01:00.570> about<00:01:00.899> these

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it's pointless to talk about these

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.770 
it's pointless to talk about these
things<00:01:01.379> behind<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.039> plastic<00:01:02.309> Priya<00:01:02.730> let's<00:01:03.359> open
