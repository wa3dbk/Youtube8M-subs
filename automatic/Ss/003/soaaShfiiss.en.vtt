00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 And then there's the local tube shop in the area. 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.559
 well another video is how to solve the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.799
 windows 8 problem that the internet 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.890
 yuck falling randomly on all the time 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.980
 or not but every once in a while and this 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.410
 really messed up, huh? 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.220
 good how are you going to solve the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.560
 to know the name of the network card as it is 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.399
 who will know this today is the director of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:38.100
 tasks is really going to work and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.820
 Good ethernet touch google that name 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 here and from there will download much logic 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 preferably by 128 if you have not 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.329
 windows 7 and is the version of your system 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.070
 32 bits and 64 bits but it sucks 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.879
 from windows 8 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.100
 in case he always hits a model this 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.240
 everything is okay here 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.650
 the monkey he sometimes gives a wrong 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.820
 sometimes it is not nearly always to give any 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.220
 name and model and model right in the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.619
 Calo, this name I already know it's with this law. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.310
 Andrew knew that this name 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.340
 Only this one I had not seen 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.040
 it's probably not that man is going 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.229
 exchange the model only on the internet and 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.020
 you can install a program to 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.140
 It's low, is not it? 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.939
 and so good I will give an example what 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.340
 It's the slayer drive, right? 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:53.040
 You go down there by the bassaki or 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:57.119
 by the website of the program even find all 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.969
 the drivers and such and such 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.990
 if you program and fuck update 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.049
 everything does not update the hd driver 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.950
 if you do this the pc will not will not 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.060
 call again will give a blog you will 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.860
 have to 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:20.280
 The system is good, you go there. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.790
 lowered installed if it is compatible with 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.319
 windows 8 you will install normal only 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.810
 before installing if you create a dot 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.550
 System Restore 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.200
 It's just the way you wanted it. 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:39.480
 windows 7 breeding in 28 ne 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.950
 and if not compatible with the installer 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.620
 program 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.819
 in case the voice here is an example of the driver 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.819
 of my video card 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.830
 I do not know where the installer is. 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.099
 during a compressed folder and 70 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.600
 unpack and not only that here there will 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.280
 in the installer there on properties 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.610
 compatibility to run 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.610
 compatibility 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.310
 if the driver only compatible with windows 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.410
 7 without setting windows 7 to be se 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:20.099
 shares with view 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:23.549
 we have now seen 61 x pms 9895 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.930
 is almost no chance to function almost 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.650
 no chance 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.840
 I'm not saying that there is not I think 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.470
 that I would not be able to ride with nothing is so 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.510
 old that good in case i did not 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.609
 because this should work on windows 8 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.590
 Already the drive makes the point 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.959
 restoration and gave installed started the 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.989
 internet is not likely to fall 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.530
 brand new 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.630
 Good then if the one with those videos and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.250
 solve your problem and the fall of 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:05.670
 internet gives a like and if you think it was 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.569
 very good give a favorite and to the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.569
 next personal video
