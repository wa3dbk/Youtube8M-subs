call of duty titles I figured I'd do the
same<00:00:22.840> because<00:00:23.650> I<00:00:23.680> normally<00:00:24.369> post<00:00:24.520> bad<00:00:24.790> company

ton of debate over what's going to be

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.310 
ton of debate over what's going to be
better<00:00:44.649> modern<00:00:45.640> warfare<00:00:45.789> 3<00:00:45.969> or<00:00:46.390> battlefield<00:00:46.839> 3

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
better modern warfare 3 or battlefield 3

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.520 
better modern warfare 3 or battlefield 3
and<00:00:47.530> it<00:00:48.399> turns<00:00:48.940> into<00:00:49.260> occasionally<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.289> very

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
and it turns into occasionally a very

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.860 
and it turns into occasionally a very
obnoxious<00:00:50.679> flame<00:00:51.370> war<00:00:51.609> between<00:00:51.910> people<00:00:52.329> you

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
know the it's the same sorts of folks

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.369 
know the it's the same sorts of folks
that<00:00:54.670> argue<00:00:54.969> like<00:00:55.089> ps3<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.690> better<00:00:55.719> than<00:00:56.079> xbox

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
that argue like ps3 is better than xbox

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.959 
that argue like ps3 is better than xbox
which<00:00:56.739> is<00:00:56.829> better<00:00:57.010> than<00:00:57.159> PC<00:00:57.519> which<00:00:57.699> is<00:00:57.820> better

circular<00:01:01.569> logic<00:01:01.769> my<00:01:02.769> take<00:01:03.010> on<00:01:03.159> on<00:01:03.399> the

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
circular logic my take on on the

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.310 
circular logic my take on on the
difference<00:01:03.969> between<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.360> two<00:01:04.480> franchises<00:01:04.750> is

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
difference between the two franchises is

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.130 
difference between the two franchises is
at<00:01:05.500> their<00:01:05.650> very<00:01:05.830> different<00:01:06.250> games<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:07.540> played

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
at their very different games I played

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.700 
at their very different games I played
call<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.100> duty<00:01:09.460> up<00:01:09.820> through<00:01:10.330> modern<00:01:11.229> warfare<00:01:11.409> 2

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
call of duty up through modern warfare 2

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.650 
call of duty up through modern warfare 2
and<00:01:11.920> that's<00:01:12.340> when<00:01:12.550> basically<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.060> just<00:01:13.390> kind<00:01:13.630> of

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
and that's when basically I just kind of

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.330 
and that's when basically I just kind of
grew<00:01:13.840> tired<00:01:14.110> of<00:01:14.260> it<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.470> was<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.890> same<00:01:15.040> thing

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
grew tired of it it was the same thing

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.550 
grew tired of it it was the same thing
over<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.610> over<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.170> decided<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:17.320> wanted<00:01:17.500> to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
over and over and decided I wanted to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.750 
over and over and decided I wanted to
pick<00:01:17.710> something<00:01:17.920> else<00:01:18.100> up<00:01:18.280> which<00:01:18.490> is<00:01:18.610> when<00:01:18.730> I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
pick something else up which is when I

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.550 
pick something else up which is when I
started<00:01:18.820> playing<00:01:19.150> battlefield<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:19.930> don't<00:01:20.470> have

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
started playing battlefield I don't have

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.230 
started playing battlefield I don't have
anything<00:01:20.740> against<00:01:21.220> call<00:01:21.400> of<00:01:21.550> duty<00:01:21.790> I<00:01:21.910> think

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
anything against call of duty I think

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.790 
anything against call of duty I think
that<00:01:22.510> it<00:01:22.750> appeals<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.290> different<00:01:23.680> audience

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
that it appeals to a different audience

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.910 
that it appeals to a different audience
I<00:01:24.130> think<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.400> may<00:01:24.550> be<00:01:24.580> appeals<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.150> a<00:01:25.180> slightly

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
I think it may be appeals to a slightly

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.200 
I think it may be appeals to a slightly
you<00:01:26.920> know<00:01:27.010> younger<00:01:27.370> crowd<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:27.790> likes<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.060> run

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
you know younger crowd that likes to run

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.750 
you know younger crowd that likes to run
a<00:01:28.240> gun<00:01:28.860> little<00:01:29.860> less<00:01:29.980> patience<00:01:30.520> for<00:01:30.670> the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
a gun little less patience for the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.550 
a gun little less patience for the
tactics<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.810> learning<00:01:31.930> curve<00:01:32.260> that<00:01:32.440> are

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
tactics and the learning curve that are

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.930 
tactics and the learning curve that are
required<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.950> play<00:01:33.130> battlefield<00:01:33.610> but<00:01:33.730> that's

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
required to play battlefield but that's

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.340 
required to play battlefield but that's
that's<00:01:34.150> not<00:01:34.300> a<00:01:34.420> bad<00:01:34.600> thing<00:01:34.630> right<00:01:35.080> if<00:01:35.230> you're

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
that's not a bad thing right if you're

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.590 
that's not a bad thing right if you're
playing<00:01:35.530> video<00:01:35.830> games<00:01:36.070> for<00:01:36.340> fun<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.760> you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
playing video games for fun and you

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.780 
playing video games for fun and you
don't<00:01:37.750> have<00:01:37.840> fun<00:01:38.110> with<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.920> slower<00:01:39.160> tactical

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
don't have fun with the slower tactical

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.090 
don't have fun with the slower tactical
games<00:01:40.000> then<00:01:40.840> maybe<00:01:41.170> battlefield<00:01:41.710> isn't<00:01:41.980> for

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
games then maybe battlefield isn't for

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100 
games then maybe battlefield isn't for
you<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.430> don't<00:01:42.670> fault<00:01:43.240> anyone<00:01:43.540> for<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.780> I

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
you and I don't fault anyone for that I

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.550 
you and I don't fault anyone for that I
do<00:01:44.800> think<00:01:45.250> that<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:46.300> know<00:01:46.420> what<00:01:46.600> people<00:01:47.200> say

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
do think that you know what people say

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.990 
do think that you know what people say
though<00:01:47.770> it's<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.190> kids<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.520> play<00:01:48.760> call<00:01:48.970> of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
though it's the kids that play call of

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.300

going to happen but I figured I'd say it
anyway<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.890> back<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:20.920> back<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.670> gameplay

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
anyway so back to back to the gameplay

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
and employ some tactics so I'm not just

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.920 
and employ some tactics so I'm not just
running<00:04:54.730> around<00:04:54.820> getting<00:04:55.180> mowed<00:04:55.480> down<00:04:55.510> all
