00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:12.369
You know, it's really astonishing to me what
a single plant can do.

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.110
This plant is a great example of a ground
cover.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.920
Do you have an area in your yard where maybe
something doesn't grow on the ground, like

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.290
grass, because there's too much shade because
of trees or because the shade of your house?

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.450
Or that it's such a highly trafficked area,
grass won't grow.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.001
Or you've got a slope that just keeps washing
away and you need something to stabilize it.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.370
A ground cover like this is ideal.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.000
This little plant is called Winter Creeper,
and it's a tough, hard working plant.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.790
It can solve a lot of problems in your landscape.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.560
For instance, this plant will take full, hot
sun or some shade.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.170
In the South, I think it does better with
some partial shade, although it will take

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.380
full sun.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.110
In the North, well, it probably needs full
sun.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.220
And, hey, it's not finicky.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.149
It can take just about any kind of soil as
long as the soil doesn't hold water and stays

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.510
wet and boggy.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.360
The other thing that's great about this plant:
It's an evergreen.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.190
Yeah, all through the spring and summer it
has this beautiful green foliage.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.020
Then in the fall, this very same foliage turns
a beautiful sort of bronze red.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.320
Now just take a look at this bed that's planted
in Winter Creeper.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.240
Now, I couldn't see planting lawn up here
next to the house like this.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.510
And let me tell you, this area gets full,
hot, screaming sun in the summer.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.640
This plant just keeps ticking right along.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.549
I planted these about 18 inches apart in this
bed.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.740
And within one growing season they began to
knit together.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.320
And by the second growing season, you couldn't
even see the ground because they had completely

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.530
covered it.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.960
So you're probably asking, "How does this
plant do that?"

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.130
Well, you see, it puts out these long runners,
and just on the underside, you'll see these

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.140
tiny little aerial roots.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.720
Those little aerial roots connect to the moist
soil, the plant grows out, and over time begins

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720
to cover the ground.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.720
I don't know about you, but I love a plant
that not only looks good but solves a problem,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.850
and that's exactly what this Winter Creeper
does.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.539
You see, here, I only have to fertilize this
bed once a year.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.510
And if this was grass, I would have to be
fertilizing more, and I'd obviously have to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.620
be mowing it every week.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.340
But to keep this maintained beautifully, all
I have to do is raise my lawnmower up and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.380
I can mow this just like I would the lawn,
cutting off all these little tendrils to the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.230
same height, making it very uniform.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.050
I do that twice a year and I'm finished.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.080
