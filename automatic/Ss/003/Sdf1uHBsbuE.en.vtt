00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.910
 the catalyst is a part formed by a 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.189
 metal casing and a ceramic body 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.590
 coated with noble materials 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.960
 the device comprises the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.690
 exhaustion of their modern vehicles 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.750
 main function is to transform the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.660
 harmful in a good planner 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.289
 actually formed by the ceramic core 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.289
 metal and has the function of filtering 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.920
 well before the transformation of gases 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.350
 toxic and toxic to the environment. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 environment and the health and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.829
 human 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.200
 the catalyst is part of the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.300
 car exhaust is between the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.640
 engine and the muffler 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.010
 on the underside of the car usually 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.289
 below the passenger seat 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.420
 the catalysts depend on the receipt 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 of the appropriate mixture of 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.489
 proper temperature exhaust 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.710
 any additives may cause 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.579
 change in the mixture or temperature of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.609
 gases 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.019
 there are two means of a catalyst of some 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.020
 type of problem 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.680
 he can come even though the condo 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.799
 usually it topcon turns on the light of 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.960
 electronic injection or sometimes 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.229
 You pass with it is a piece that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.330
 Warm you up by running a water 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.000
 it can give a thermal shock if it loosens 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.909
 the core is to identify the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.579
 transfer for having smoked a material 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.930
 The piece is very resistant. 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.700
 high value 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.060
 depending on the vehicle some 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.520
 catalysts can cost up to one thousand reais 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.710
 therefore it is always necessary to stay 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.130
 attentive to its maintenance 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.530
 the factory determines that this trot 8 a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.229
 every 80 very far rounds 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.390
 Ronny is common is the part to be replaced is 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.140
 It's totally not that difficult. 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.840
 problem 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.200
 Okay, because you do not think very well anymore. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.970
 worked are made will be eternal 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.640
 ceramic 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.640
 usually not too many
