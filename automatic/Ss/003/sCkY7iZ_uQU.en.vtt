00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.450 

okay<00:00:00.900> third<00:00:01.230> part<00:00:01.709> in<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.949> three-part<00:00:02.399> series

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
okay third part in a three-part series

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:18.339 
okay third part in a three-part series
the<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.510> Oh

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.140 

okay<00:00:19.349> the<00:00:19.410> ISO<00:00:19.920> what<00:00:20.099> the<00:00:20.189> ISO<00:00:20.610> is<00:00:20.760> let's<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
okay the ISO what the ISO is let's do a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.420 
okay the ISO what the ISO is let's do a
quick<00:00:21.480> review<00:00:21.630> okay<00:00:22.259> the<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.950> got<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> lens

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
quick review okay the you got the lens

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.460 
quick review okay the you got the lens
in<00:00:23.700> the<00:00:23.790> aperture<00:00:24.360> which<00:00:24.750> controls<00:00:25.349> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
in the aperture which controls the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.109 
in the aperture which controls the
quantity<00:00:25.860> of<00:00:25.950> light<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.759> shutter

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
quantity of light and then a shutter

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.870 
quantity of light and then a shutter
which<00:00:27.390> controls<00:00:28.290> the<00:00:28.590> time<00:00:28.890> value<00:00:29.430> how<00:00:29.610> long

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
which controls the time value how long

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.819 
which controls the time value how long
is<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.090> light<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.930> hit<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:31.230> sensor

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
is that light going to hit the sensor

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.610 
is that light going to hit the sensor
and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> sensor<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.870> where<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> ISO

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
and then the sensor that's where the ISO

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.430 
and then the sensor that's where the ISO
is<00:00:34.770> tied<00:00:35.010> directly<00:00:35.190> into<00:00:35.910> which<00:00:36.750> means<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
is tied directly into which means the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.250 
is tied directly into which means the
ISO<00:00:37.980> controls<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.969> sensitivity<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.989> light

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
ISO controls the sensitivity of light

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.860 
ISO controls the sensitivity of light
that<00:00:40.530> hits<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.980> sensor<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.789> basically<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
that hits the sensor so basically if you

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.069 
that hits the sensor so basically if you
have<00:00:43.019> a<00:00:43.050> low<00:00:43.379> setting<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.070> ISO<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.359> not

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
have a low setting on the ISO it not

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.979 
have a low setting on the ISO it not
that<00:00:46.260> sensitive<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.039> light<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.780> kind

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that sensitive to light you really kind

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.419 
that sensitive to light you really kind
of<00:00:49.050> kind<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.440> push<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.859> light<00:00:50.039> onto<00:00:50.339> that

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
of kind of push the light onto that

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.310 
of kind of push the light onto that
sensor<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.269> not<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.600> sensitive<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
sensor and it's not that sensitive and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.529 
sensor and it's not that sensitive and
if<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.769> a<00:00:52.800> high<00:00:53.100> setting<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.089> ISO

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
if you have a high setting on the ISO

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.750 
if you have a high setting on the ISO
it's<00:00:55.050> very<00:00:55.379> sensitive<00:00:55.679> like<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> littlest

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it's very sensitive like the littlest

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.229 
it's very sensitive like the littlest
light<00:00:57.089> makes<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.719> difference<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:59.370> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
light makes a difference so that's the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.660 
light makes a difference so that's the
bottom<00:01:00.629> line<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:01.109> sum<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.859> you're

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
bottom line to sum it up and you're

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.889 
bottom line to sum it up and you're
probably<00:01:02.789> wondering<00:01:03.329> well<00:01:03.480> why<00:01:03.629> don't<00:01:03.690> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
probably wondering well why don't you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
probably wondering well why don't you
this<00:01:04.050> you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.350> photography<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.339> light<00:01:05.519> they

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
this you know photography and light they

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.149 
this you know photography and light they
go<00:01:06.240> hand-in-hand<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:07.110> crank<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> ISO

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
go hand-in-hand just crank up the ISO

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
go hand-in-hand just crank up the ISO
and<00:01:08.190> go<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.640> shooting<00:01:08.880> well<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.660> great

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and go out shooting well that's great

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.570 
and go out shooting well that's great
man<00:01:10.230> everybody<00:01:10.680> would<00:01:10.830> love<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.220> but

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
man everybody would love to do that but

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.790 
man everybody would love to do that but
you<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:12.000> when<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> crank<00:01:12.660> up<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> ISO<00:01:13.440> which

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
you know when you crank up the ISO which

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.920 
you know when you crank up the ISO which
means<00:01:14.040> turn<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.430> higher<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.450> comes<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
means turn it higher it comes with a

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.830 
means turn it higher it comes with a
cost<00:01:16.230> and<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> cost<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.520> noise<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.510> know<00:01:18.540> so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
cost and that cost is noise you know so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.590 
cost and that cost is noise you know so
the<00:01:18.960> higher<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.590> ISO<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.850> more<00:01:21.240> noise<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the higher the ISO the more noise you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.330 
the higher the ISO the more noise you
get<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.260> image<00:01:22.590> meaning<00:01:22.980> you<00:01:23.160> know<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
get on the image meaning you know you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
get on the image meaning you know you
look<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.730> it<00:01:23.760> really<00:01:24.120> close<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.990> see

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
look at it really close and you can see

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.000 
look at it really close and you can see
the<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:27.270> imperfections<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.500> see<00:01:28.650> noise

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
the the imperfections you just see noise

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.590 
the the imperfections you just see noise
back<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.670> film<00:01:29.940> days<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.300> was<00:01:30.390> called

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
back in the film days it was called

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.110 
back in the film days it was called
brain<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.620> you<00:01:31.650> always<00:01:32.190> want<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> shoot<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.910> the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
brain so you always want to shoot at the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.680 
brain so you always want to shoot at the
lowest<00:01:33.660> ISO<00:01:34.190> possible<00:01:35.190> and<00:01:35.460> that's<00:01:36.210> about<00:01:36.510> it

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
lowest ISO possible and that's about it

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.230 
lowest ISO possible and that's about it
now<00:01:36.870> how<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.440> use<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.980> ISO<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.120> where

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
now how do you use the ISO this is where

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.200 
now how do you use the ISO this is where
I<00:01:39.300> say<00:01:39.770> experimentation<00:01:40.770> comes<00:01:41.520> into<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> mix

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I say experimentation comes into the mix

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.690 
I say experimentation comes into the mix
okay<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.140> know<00:01:43.440> what<00:01:43.650> my<00:01:43.800> camera<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
okay so I know what my camera can do so

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
okay so I know what my camera can do so
if<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.000> go<00:01:45.150> out<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.420> sunny<00:01:45.750> day<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.260> I'm

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
if I go out on a sunny day I know I'm

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.560 
if I go out on a sunny day I know I'm
shooting<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:46.920> ISO<00:01:47.370> 100<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.270> Sun<00:01:48.450> is

ISO<00:01:56.550> 800<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.410> from<00:01:58.710> my

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
ISO 800 and I just know that from my

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.270 
ISO 800 and I just know that from my
camera<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.640> experience<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:01.680> when

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
camera and from experience and so when

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
camera and from experience and so when
you<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.940> know<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.450> first<00:02:03.480> thing<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you you know that's the first thing a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.420 
you you know that's the first thing a
lot<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.350> some<00:02:04.560> photographers<00:02:05.130> say<00:02:05.280> they'll

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
lot of some photographers say they'll

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.220 
lot of some photographers say they'll
set<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:05.940> last<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.420> that's<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.720> first<00:02:06.960> thing

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
set that last but that's the first thing

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.869 
set that last but that's the first thing
I<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.530> know<00:02:07.620> what<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.980> saw<00:02:08.280> I'm<00:02:08.399> shooting<00:02:08.789> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
I do I know what I saw I'm shooting that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.430 
I do I know what I saw I'm shooting that
just<00:02:09.090> by<00:02:09.209> looking<00:02:09.239> up<00:02:09.660> at<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> sky<00:02:10.140> just

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
just by looking up at the sky just

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.080 
just by looking up at the sky just
looking<00:02:10.739> at<00:02:10.830> my<00:02:10.950> conditions<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.580> know<00:02:11.640> exactly

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
looking at my conditions I know exactly

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.960 
looking at my conditions I know exactly
where<00:02:12.360> I'm<00:02:12.480> gonna<00:02:12.569> set<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.989> ISO<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:14.280> that's

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
where I'm gonna set the ISO so that's

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.820 
where I'm gonna set the ISO so that's
why<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> call<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.720> set<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.230> forget<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
why I call it a set it and forget it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.290 
why I call it a set it and forget it
but<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.130> can't<00:02:17.430> really<00:02:17.820> forget<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.240> because

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
but you can't really forget it because

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.800 
but you can't really forget it because
now

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
now

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.589 
now
have<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.080> change<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.770> when<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.069> have<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.300> I

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
have to change it when you have to so I

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.600 
have to change it when you have to so I
make<00:02:21.930> my<00:02:22.140> settings<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.800> then<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.340> start

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
make my settings and then I start

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.610 
make my settings and then I start
shooting<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.360> can't<00:02:24.630> get<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.050> aperture

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
shooting and if I can't get the aperture

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.410 
shooting and if I can't get the aperture
I<00:02:25.680> want<00:02:26.010> or<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.400> shutter<00:02:26.790> speed<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.239> want

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
I want or the shutter speed I want

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120 
I want or the shutter speed I want
that's<00:02:27.750> when<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:27.989> have<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.260> change<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.680> ISO

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
that's when you have to change the ISO

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.059 
that's when you have to change the ISO
and<00:02:29.280> nudge<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.670> up<00:02:29.819> at<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.420> stop<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.709> keep

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
and nudge it up at a stop and you keep

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.760 
and nudge it up at a stop and you keep
doing<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.849> process<00:02:33.510> until<00:02:33.930> you're<00:02:34.290> able<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
doing that process until you're able to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.400 
doing that process until you're able to
shoot<00:02:34.950> at<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.220> lowest<00:02:35.700> ISO<00:02:35.910> possible<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.200> get

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
shoot at the lowest ISO possible to get

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.350 
shoot at the lowest ISO possible to get
the<00:02:37.680> aperture<00:02:38.190> setting<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.030> shutter

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the aperture setting and the shutter

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.440 
the aperture setting and the shutter
setting<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.959> you're<00:02:40.140> trying<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.650> get<00:02:41.450> okay

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
setting that you're trying to get okay
