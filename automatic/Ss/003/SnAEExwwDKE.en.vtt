00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.070
 the setting 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.110
 is simple and fast the chassis is 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.730
 oriented relative to the north it is sufficient 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.830
 then to position the point of 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.730
 heats up and arm the springs that goes 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.730
 maintain the movement 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.120
 the mechanism wants to be simple robust and 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.120
 insensitive to bad weather 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.239
 here are some examples of cooking 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.570
 early November with limitation screen 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.009
 of power and veiled german sky 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.700
 energy is still sufficient for a 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.700
 white cooking 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.150
 mid-november with not only strong 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.490
 vitroceramic the temperature to 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.280
 the inside of the oven reaches 260 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.110
 However, it should be noted that 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.670
 presence of high evaporation is 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.670
 temperature can drop by half 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.399
 the guide mechanism 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.530
 positioning the dish so 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.050
 to obtain a stationary heating point 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.440
 in space and a direction of 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.030
 school beam always vertical 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.099
 this configuration allows to achieve 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.140
 effectively all modes of 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.000
 baking 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.549
 the mechanism based on the counter 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.260
 land movements will facilitate the 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.260
 control system design to 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.650
 know a single shareholder at speed 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.379
 constant and low torque no longer needed 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.970
 complex systems based on 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.480
 electronic computers or 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.480
 solar tracker 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.810
 in this example 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.790
 is enough to regulate the speed of the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.569
 parable if the parable does not constitute 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.670
 a novelty 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.040
 however, two points must be noted 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.140
 particular first the surface 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.650
 parables to ide and deported down 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.720
 compared to the focal laax this allows for 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.390
 straighten the solar ray towards the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.910
 vertical then the surface is 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.989
 consisting of facets 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.269
 this allows you to divide 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.239
 homogeneous solar energy on a 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.709
 surface determine this energy can 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.709
 be adjusted using a screen 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.170
 in winter 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.870
 it's not the outside temperature 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.220
 which limits the use of the oven but 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.220
 rather the deficit are the ranks
