00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
straight courses from hip line we take

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.519 
straight courses from hip line we take
slit<00:00:25.560> line<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:27.359> measure<00:00:27.630> straight

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
slit line and then we measure straight

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.810 
slit line and then we measure straight
downwards<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.390> make<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> slit<00:00:31.520> but<00:00:32.520> in

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
downwards that is we make a slit but in

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.950 
downwards that is we make a slit but in
a<00:00:33.210> line<00:00:33.390> Cathie's<00:00:34.190> after<00:00:35.190> hip<00:00:35.489> line<00:00:35.960> we

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
a line Cathie's after hip line we

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.130 
a line Cathie's after hip line we
measure<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.530> gara<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.390> we'll<00:00:39.390> make<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> slope

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
measure the gara and we'll make a slope

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.180 
measure the gara and we'll make a slope
like<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.350> flower<00:00:43.559> goes<00:00:43.920> to

when<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.840> give<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.320> seam<00:00:59.100> over<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.699> that

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
when we give a seam over here that

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.319 
when we give a seam over here that
starts<00:01:00.719> from<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:02.100> middle<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.550> our<00:01:02.760> mold<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
starts from the middle of our mold and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.510 
starts from the middle of our mold and
falls<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.320> apex<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:05.549> goes<00:01:05.880> down

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
falls on your apex and then goes down

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.640 
falls on your apex and then goes down
till<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.850> most<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> things<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.590> similar

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
till here most of the things are similar

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280 
till here most of the things are similar
to<00:01:11.430> simple<00:01:11.820> quilting<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.930> or<00:01:13.080> two

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290

measurements<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.490> take<00:01:14.700> extra<00:01:15.240> for

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
measurements you have to take extra for

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
measurements you have to take extra for
this<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.200> skirt<00:01:19.500> e<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.280> point

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
this so in this skirt e we have to point

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
this so in this skirt e we have to point
out<00:01:20.790> three<00:01:21.320> points<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.830> point<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:24.350> point<00:01:25.350> B

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
out three points that is point a point B

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.490 
out three points that is point a point B
and<00:01:26.040> Point<00:01:26.610> C<00:01:26.939> now<00:01:27.979> I'll<00:01:28.979> start<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.549> point<00:01:29.820> A

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
and Point C now I'll start from point A

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.460 
and Point C now I'll start from point A
this<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> armhole<00:01:32.659> first<00:01:33.659> measure<00:01:34.200> your

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
this is the armhole first measure your

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.590 
this is the armhole first measure your
arm<00:01:34.710> hole<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:36.240> way<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.549> then<00:01:38.549> find<00:01:39.450> out

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
arm hole in this way and then find out

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.039 
arm hole in this way and then find out
its<00:01:39.869> middle<00:01:40.460> suppose<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.450> armhole

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
its middle suppose this is my armhole

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.929 
its middle suppose this is my armhole
and<00:01:43.579> it's<00:01:44.579> middle<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.740> somewhere<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:46.939> this

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and it's middle is somewhere here this

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.870 
and it's middle is somewhere here this
point<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.810> point<00:01:50.180> now<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:53.159> second<00:01:53.670> point

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
point is a point now the second point

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.590 
point is a point now the second point
that<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.990> B<00:01:55.290> point<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:57.030> tip<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.509> your

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that this B point is the tip of your

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
that this B point is the tip of your
burst<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.880> apex<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.219> to

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
burst that is your apex so we have to

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.999 
burst that is your apex so we have to
take<00:02:02.579> measurement<00:02:03.270> from<00:02:04.020> shoulder<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
take measurement from shoulder to the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.180 
take measurement from shoulder to the
widest<00:02:05.909> point<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.420> your<00:02:06.719> burst<00:02:07.259> this

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
widest point of your burst this

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.270 
widest point of your burst this
measurement<00:02:08.879> will<00:02:09.179> use<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:10.319> find<00:02:10.590> out<00:02:10.800> my

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
measurement will use to find out my

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.720 
measurement will use to find out my
point

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
point

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.390

folded side first I'll fold my fabric
this<00:04:22.850> is<00:04:23.030> for<00:04:23.510> layers<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:26.590> then<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.860> will<00:04:28.400> do

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
this is for layers and then I will do

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.730 
this is for layers and then I will do
all<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.120> markings<00:04:29.570> for<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.020> simple<00:04:30.500> core

my<00:04:36.500> point<00:04:37.010> a<00:04:37.250> B<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.450> my<00:04:39.380> point<00:04:39.680> C<00:04:41.980> then<00:04:42.980> I<00:04:43.220> will

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
my point a B and my point C then I will

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.630 
my point a B and my point C then I will
make<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> line<00:04:44.390> that<00:04:45.380> is<00:04:45.590> princess<00:04:46.040> cut<00:04:46.340> line

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
make a line that is princess cut line

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.560 
make a line that is princess cut line
and<00:04:46.990> then<00:04:47.990> I'll<00:04:48.230> cut<00:04:49.100> this<00:04:49.310> line<00:04:49.640> after

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
and then I'll cut this line after

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.890 
and then I'll cut this line after
cutting<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.170> first<00:04:51.860> stitch<00:04:52.430> this<00:04:52.640> line<00:04:52.940> so

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
cutting and first stitch this line so

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900 
cutting and first stitch this line so
what<00:04:54.290> happens<00:04:54.800> when<00:04:55.040> you<00:04:55.220> will<00:04:55.370> stitch<00:04:55.640> this

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
what happens when you will stitch this

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.190 
what happens when you will stitch this
this<00:04:56.840> fabric<00:04:57.440> here<00:04:57.740> goes<00:04:58.400> little<00:04:58.790> outside<00:04:59.450> so

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
this fabric here goes little outside so

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.970 
this fabric here goes little outside so
my<00:05:00.440> armhole<00:05:01.070> can<00:05:01.370> get<00:05:01.580> reduced<00:05:02.290> but<00:05:03.290> I'll<00:05:03.650> cut

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
my armhole can get reduced but I'll cut

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.390 
my armhole can get reduced but I'll cut
my<00:05:04.190> arm<00:05:04.400> hole<00:05:04.610> after<00:05:04.790> I<00:05:05.860> stitch<00:05:06.860> this<00:05:07.070> line
