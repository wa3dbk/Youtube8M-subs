important things games first I'm going

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.500 
important things games first I'm going
to<00:05:59.130> go<00:05:59.250> ahead<00:05:59.280> and<00:05:59.580> benchmark<00:06:00.000> it<00:06:00.120> as<00:06:00.240> it<00:06:00.360> is

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
to go ahead and benchmark it as it is

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.080 
to go ahead and benchmark it as it is
with<00:06:00.720> the<00:06:00.840> two<00:06:01.020> gigabytes<00:06:01.530> and<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:02.039> 160<00:06:02.880> gig

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
with the two gigabytes and the 160 gig

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.540 
with the two gigabytes and the 160 gig
5400<00:06:04.020> drive<00:06:04.289> and<00:06:04.560> then<00:06:05.130> I'm<00:06:05.250> going<00:06:05.340> to<00:06:05.430> go

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
5400 drive and then I'm going to go

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.820 
5400 drive and then I'm going to go
ahead<00:06:05.580> and<00:06:05.850> upgrade<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.780> and<00:06:06.900> we'll<00:06:07.440> see<00:06:07.590> how

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
ahead and upgrade it and we'll see how

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:16.850 
ahead and upgrade it and we'll see how
the<00:06:07.890> difference<00:06:08.370> plays<00:06:08.610> out

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.919
