00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.940
 hello I am eduardo de china punto is y 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.819
 this is the first contact and the 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.629
 unboxing of this neko knot that we 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.629
 have sent for your analysis 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.289
 The first thing we are going to do is see the 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:22.630
 content of this original can with what 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.980
 what would be the contents of the box in 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.470
 this case in looking like the usual 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.590
 cardboard is made of sheet metal much more 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.420
 resistant than cardboard boxes and with 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.080
 that our phone will go much better 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.080
 protected 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.100
 what we have 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.100
 go nothing 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.150
 Well, in principle with regard to the 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.930
 The accessories it carries are the usual 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.320
 we have the usb cable with micro usb in the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.320
 other side 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.740
 here we have the headphones about 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.950
 headphones to hear the music 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.790
 here we have 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.000
 the charger a charger with usb connection 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.000
 and the adapter for Spain and here 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.460
 we have an instruction book that 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.650
 is in Spanish 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.409
 let's see with others we are interested 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.409
 in this case that would be the phone 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.909
 let's see we come a little bit 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.050
 as you can see the phone, it is in a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.780
 eco s has a design similar to htc one 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.130
 it has a bronze color I think it's the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.460
 champagne color the same they call 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.450
 gold color also in many many 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.610
 Chinese phones 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.469
 Now that is a nice color is not is not 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.409
 Ugly and it's pretty soft it's a color 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.450
 striking the golden color so no 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.140
 it looks like other phones 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.120
 tacky in this case is pretty good 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.620
 if we open the phone for the part 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.790
 rear 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.180
 we have a 2800 milliampere battery 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.900
 that can be removed is dual sim and carries 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.900
 microsd slot 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.380
 let's close it 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.760
 doing a little what would be review 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.340
 of phone specifications 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.170
 we have to carry a core processor is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.840
 say is more powerful than the previous 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.740
 neko that we analyze in this case is a 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.200
 Acta core the dmt 65 92 has a giga de 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.450
 ram with which he will be able to withstand the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.730
 multitasking has 16 gigs of 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.620
 storage a screen of 5 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.780
 inches full hd that is the resolution 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.060
 it is 1980 1920 x 1080 sorry and it has 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.910
 a 3 megapixel camera camera 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.010
 main is 13 mega pixels by the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.340
 normal bluetooth wifi connectivity and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.590
 others and with most of the 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.400
 applications thus most used for 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.519
 installed 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.350
 despite making a scorching sun it 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.150
 You can see that the screen 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.970
 I do not know if the camera will appreciate the same 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.560
 but we are going to the naked eye with what 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.380
 would be 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.960
 the eyes looks perfectly the screen 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.690
 and it is totally usable 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.330
 takes a version of Android 1 422 if not 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.790
 I'm wrong we'll check them and in 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.350
 how much to the interface that leads to the same 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.240
 that the previous one is going a little 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.340
 personalized is not excessively 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.220
 modified so it will cost us 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.250
 handle them with the phone since the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.780
 launcher is similar to not going one of the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.970
 things that gets attention goes with the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.080
 root included something quite comfortable for 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.080
 some applications 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.380
 and let's see 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.040
 we have the information in 422 I do not know if 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.790
 will be appreciated in the camera I think 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.200
 do not 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.599
 but as we say you can see perfectly the 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.799
 phone with normal use in principle 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.189
 this would be a first contact 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.590
 to show you the phone we are going to 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.450
 see a little the aesthetics 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.849
 we'll have to leave for a 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.829
 later more complete review in the 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.419
 left side of the phone to 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.959
 close it well has not closed the lid well 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.090
 before when I put him on the side 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.669
 left as we said we have the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.380
 volume control here in the part 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.289
 bottom we have the micro slot 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.080
 usb there is 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.520
 this side is completely clean and 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.339
 at the top we have the slot 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.279
 of three and a half for the audio jack and 

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:45.090
 the button off and on and good 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:48.600
 and lock also as you can see 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.730
 You take personalized bindings 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.950
 for example take the play store something 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.530
 quite important in this type of 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.310
 phones because thanks to him we can 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.470
 install what everything we need 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.689
 in principle good does not seem bad 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.729
 as you see flash with the led 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.709
 in principle as we say it does not have bad 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.289
 but it will be necessary to leave it to 

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:17.229
 test to see how the 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.509
 phone in the circumstances so what 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.279
 that would be the day to day to show you a 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.529
 little the operation and our 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:26.919
 impressions so for now this is 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:30.599
 everything and we leave you with this echo s up 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.599
 the full review until later
