00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.110
 one of the related dates of the year 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.910
 with the mobile world is approaching and this is 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.620
 if it fits even more special since it has 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.599
 place in our country specifically in 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.669
 barcelona before the avalanche of novelties 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.710
 and new products that awaits us 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.390
 during mobile world congress and 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.949
 we begin to see leaks of 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.199
 terminals with which the signatures 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.910
 they intend to attend the event in addition 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.070
 we make a space to talk to you about 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.110
 consoles and also like not the world's 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.700
 hardware 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.410
 a little over a month to be celebrated 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.640
 mobile world congress in barcelona 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.739
 comes news that may 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.420
 surprise more than one and that qualcomm 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.840
 you could lose one of your clients 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.590
 you know where I'm going 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.180
 we would be talking about one of the 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.070
 most powerful clients of the firm 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.650
 creator of processors and if 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.449
 it could effectively be about samsung 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.330
 the Koreans would dispense according to 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.160
 rumorea of ​​the snapdragon processors 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.230
 810 and they would be a blow to 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.420
 Qualcomm being one of the customers that 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.220
 more you are currently billed though by 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.080
 another side could also be htc the 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.240
 firm that had decided to disassociate 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.330
 from the manufacturer on his next smartphone 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.360
 the one m 9 as it seems for samsung the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.280
 810 snapdragon processors suffer from a 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.440
 excessive heating and therefore 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.260
 they would opt for inclusion in their teams 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.330
 of the processors themselves exynos such and 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.610
 as it would happen with the next samsung 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.470
 galaxy s 6 that if the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.659
 expectations could see the light in 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.450
 barcelona during mobile world congress 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.189
 it is htc or samsung the manufacturer that has 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.680
 decided to end the link with 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.880
 qualcomm what is sure is that as 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.590
 very late we will leave 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.250
 doubts in the first days of the next 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 month of March 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.610
 the aforementioned galaxy s 6 could slow down 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.130
 partly the fall of profits from the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.720
 firm in the smartphone segment 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.509
 we have known that in the fourth quarter 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.000
 of 2014 these have declined around 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.729
 of 27% over the same period 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.229
 of 2013 the fall could be due 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.939
 mainly to the appearance in the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.159
 market of the new iphone models 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.229
 and also to the work that certain 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.269
 Chinese firms are carrying out in 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.340
 Android territory with the appearance of 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.230
 new smartphones with features 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.140
 of high- end together with a price 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.700
 despite the bad results, these do not 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.739
 are as unfavorable as in the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.599
 previous quarter when the losses 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.640
 were almost 50 percent 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.190
 higher than the same period of the year 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.049
 previous since we have quoted the galaxy s 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.670
 6 and after many are already 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.250
 making conjectures as to the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.599
 characteristics that could gather 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.310
 we take the opportunity to recommend that 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.260
 stop by our blog where you 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.520
 You can see a complete post about the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.890
 smartphone 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.210
 samsung has very interesting projects 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.130
 facing this year 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.840
 the Korean newspaper mail business has 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.250
 spread the news that they could 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.680
 take care of manufacturing the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.660
 processor to 9 for the next terminal 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.700
 of those in the apple we think that 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.380
 It sounds very interesting according to the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.390
 newspaper information the Koreans 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.040
 would commission 75 percent of the 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.930
 manufacturing process processor 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.360
 that could house the successor of 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.130
 current iphone 6 if it finally closes 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.080
 the agreement between apple and samsung no 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.420
 it would be the first time they work together 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.790
 as they already did with the chip a-7 of 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.950
 iphone 5 s at the moment nor those of 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.020
 Cupertino nor the Koreans have confirmed 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.550
 or denied the information for which 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.920
 we will be waiting for news 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.080
 official 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.750
 we echo now what could be 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.940
 the future flagship one m 9 of htc 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.520
 the images that leaked web leaks 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.500
 respond to two models and a 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.630
 change in their aesthetics with respect to 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.640
 latest models released by the firm 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.380
 if you look at the picture you will see that 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.120
 both phones do not already have the 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.250
 features perforations in the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.290
 speakers as it had been happening in the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.210
 latest models of the brand but that 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.220
 these have been placed glued to the 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.900
 edge of the terminal between 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.510
 specifications that sound most appear 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.490
 at the moment an interesting camera and 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.710
 almost non-existent side edges 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.390
 In addition, the larger model could 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.910
 include a reader with fingerprint sensor 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.380
 If the rumors are fulfilled, we expect a 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.610
 appointment in Barcelona - loaded with 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.610
 new product presentations 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.620
 Huawei is now the one who brings us news 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.960
 again through leaks since 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.060
 they could be preparing successor for their 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.739
 base in more than seven would be called more than 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.230
 eight and we've already seen a prototype in 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.180
 photos shows a metallic appearance and 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.320
 it has virtually no borders 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.250
 screen could have a 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.900
 resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels is 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.180
 would probably release during 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.070
 this first quarter of the year and can 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.080
 that also in Barcelona - will come to 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.670
 stand in the high end with a price 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.670
 of about 650 dollars 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.389
 you think we were going to let a 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.680
 informative without talking about nvidia and amd 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.780
 now it is the latter who have 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.030
 tried to make fun of envy as a result of 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.800
 intentional errors or not that 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.580
 had in the specifications of the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.650
 graphic geforce gtx 970 the 4 gigas of 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.210
 memory that the 970 offers are 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.819
 divided into a high memory 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.130
 speed of 3.5 gigas and one of low 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.020
 0.5 speed something that envy 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.940
 will fix in your next controller 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.319
 graphic is why there is media 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.960
 seized to make a mockery 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.150
 indicating that 4 gigas means 4 gigas 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.050
 and that theirs are real in relation to 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.280
 the memory that your radio uses in r 9 290 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.319
 differing from the two memories of 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.680
 different performance that incorporates 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.840
 gtx 970 that you think all this controversy 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.470
 there really is a decline in performance 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.509
 so prominent does not remain the gtx 970 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.659
 one of the top charts despite this 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.659
 information 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.760
 in the console section os 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.340
 we will teach the first images of the 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.320
 slim version of playstation 4 we talk 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.290
 of the sales figures of microsoft and 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.520
 the new direct x12 tool is 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.860
 technology that allows you to reproduce 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.320
 effects could have a closed api and 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.000
 customized for playstation 4 and 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.780
 could be announced shortly at the door 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.220
 closed ps4 ahead of xbox one to the 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.800
 time to release the versions 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.540
 slim of their respective consoles and 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.120
 could announce the new model in the 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.710
 fair of 3 or in gamescom 2015 that 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.020
 will take place the months of June and 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.120
 August respectively an image 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.070
 filtered shows playstation 4 in 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.990
 compact version that will have the 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.720
 same specifications as the version 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.820
 original on the other hand microsoft follows 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.860
 improving its figures and is that it has sold 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.860
 more than 6 and a half million consoles 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.380
 xbox 360 and xbox one in the last 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.140
 quarter of 2014 the numbers either 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.940
 they leave in bad position to ps 4 so 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.460
 that both brands continue to sell their 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:37.520
 consoles unstoppably and you 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.900
 you are from ps4 xbox one or pc 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.060
 we finished our informative talking 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.250
 of the launch of the expected apple watch 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.990
 which will be presented in the month of April and 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.810
 we invite you to visit our blog 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.939
 where you will find all the information 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.680
 we also have an interesting 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:54.900
 section of configurations in the blog 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.810
 where we show the teams of some 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.610
 of our customers and their components 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.259
 you can see the link on the screen I hope 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.270
 that you have found interesting 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:05.219
 news to keep informed you can

 also visit social networks and the 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:09.919
 web pc components we see the 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:09.919
 next week
