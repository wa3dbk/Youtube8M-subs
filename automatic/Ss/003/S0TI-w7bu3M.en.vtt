00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.910
 hi to all and all these pseudo 17 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.529
 and today I have the honor to 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.309
 introduce my team fifa ultimate team 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.440
 to rudi garcia 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.269
 hi top a real coach how does that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.139
 is glad to be with you fighting 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.790
 very happy too 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.039
 I have the impression I built a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.180
 team because bruce did the same 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.160
 go combrouze it's complicated so I 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 build a strong team I'll go 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.400
 introduced it I like what you do 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 think I knew I wanted to make a team 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.660
 to several themes of which already the first 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.130
 cd lazare theme we will come back to it after that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.939
 I like sahara around Eden it's a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.650
 beautiful theme yes 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.600
 then a club that is important to me 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.930
 personally manchester united hockey 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.250
 with two donations of players and over 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.899
 news for the african cup 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.270
 of nations I also put players 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.140
 the ivory coast comes effect a good mix 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.030
 for whom a good collective at gold erea 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.270
 for me one of the best guardians at 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.340
 world 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.860
 especially this season yeah first 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.530
 half of the season huge 2-1 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.780
 so now here it is going to have to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.800
 they head to win this game I 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 think he's going back to work 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.280
 do we have to pass the defense on to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.060
 ivanovic Chelsea defender Kabul 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.530
 tottenham 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.850
 turned the little wink for the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.229
 victory of the ivory coast at the cut 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.610
 of africa nations and philippe and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.150
 so louise a barclays defense 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.659
 first league 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.369
 I would like tonight strong powerful hard 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.470
 on the man and I think with his 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.729
 defenses tonight there she raises she is fine 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.049
 on the sides they will be able to also 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.720
 to bring a little bit of participation 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.520
 offensive so you have a mixed finally a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.200
 defensive solidity and an offensive contribution 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.110
 it seems interesting to me then 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.479
 a middle center all the docks for me 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.009
 at the moment the best better 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.140
 center in the world but in real or 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.060
 dangerous in real gold here is jean 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.689
 true it's true finally in the game at 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.720
 close tight 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.250
 and then in the game the statistics 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.579
 speak for themselves more than 80 everywhere 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.649
 so 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.670
 and here we go to my favorite it's 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.000
 my favorite player 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.310
 in real life and my favorite player 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 almost also on fifa it's wayne 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.110
 rooney is a boosted version with the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.380
 general even more than the version of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.000
 based 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.100
 bayh did not need to booster a seen 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.630
 its quality but yes in full player 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.979
 emblematic play in symbolic but a 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.229
 player who also work he is very 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.520
 very strong but he also works to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.929
 the mind a team that's enough 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.580
 exceptional for a day of this 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.250
 class there a little known player 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.450
 leeroy do middle center of the Netherlands 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.250
 who played in the world cup honor 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.860
 yes he exploded with me I know him 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.319
 since I know him it's my friend 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.879
 long time ago that father that 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.700
 I've been using this player for three years 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.860
 on my teams fifa ultimate team because 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.330
 that he has exceptional abilities and 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.129
 it's cheap and for me it's 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.709
 bound to all and from the welcome pot to tower and 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.970
 the poor yaya turned already well seen but 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.620
 if you've been for three years 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.970
 I'm interested to see how he will have 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.410
 progressed for three years and how he 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.060
 behaves when you are in your team 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.370
 it'll be a nice surprise for me 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.110
 we will try to demonstrate his ok we beat 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.150
 knew they were going kevin attack 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.250
 Belgian Mirallas 4 stars gestures 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.480
 techniques so very important to me 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.490
 offensively that will allow to 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.900
 dribbling a very good bad foot too 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.180
 the yields are also very 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.860
 important she he raised in attack this 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.660
 who is he going to really stay in front of 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.950
 that's what I need with alone with 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.110
 my right striker so he's not going 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.960
 too loose 4 allow to approach the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.910
 presence in quick attack at 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.940
 pacers he can also score goals 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.230
 So true kevin i ai me two months 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.540
 when i arrived in lille after him has 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.460
 preferred to leave but I hardly stone is 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.470
 its very good trajectory and for a 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.180
 he defends and breaks his feet to take 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.030
 it's the least we can say here at 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.860
 the other kaspi to take 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.340
 wilfried bony time in front of 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.940
 weight 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.890
 the super power hits a volleyball 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.290
 also for maybe to leave towards 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.520
 sweden and lazard exactly these api 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.830
 winner strand if the african cup of 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.630
 nations a good point of fixing a 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.520
 player who is now who is 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.340
 now to six tickets that is part 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.640
 attackers who knew very well 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.020
 market since since the beginning of the season 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.170
 so yes it's a good choice attacker 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.210
 hair axial to say I think it is 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.550
 worthy successor of didier drogba in 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.160
 one in a slightly different style when 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.450
 same and left attacker no here 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.310
 it was a beautiful story anyway 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.260
 luck is great it's the theme 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.950
 around eden here you do what I have 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.599
 made in Lille 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.520
 and you take of hazard and you do your 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.750
 team around what so that's what you 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.860
 did today and that's normal 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.720
 because a player of this talent there 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.910
 What can your win 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.709
 team to unlock crazy situations 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.730
 the need to give him a bit keys 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.870
 keys including the attak 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.150
 that's what you did 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.060
 today so the play top thank you very much 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.010
 that but it's the pleasure to play well 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.470
 in stations and then coach 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.970
 the team I like to coach me 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.530
 but you miss on chosen so can 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.370
 maybe more will remember it 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.840
 must pass after 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.840
 you have to play yeah
