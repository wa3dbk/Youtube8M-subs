doesn't really close all the way and the
design<00:03:48.269> it's<00:03:48.569> not<00:03:48.780> really<00:03:49.229> awesome<00:03:50.099> it's<00:03:50.400> kind

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
it has this that keeps it closed which

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.099 
it has this that keeps it closed which
is<00:04:03.930> great<00:04:04.290> when<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.310> open<00:04:05.699> it<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:06.150> have<00:04:06.780> this

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
shadows and the neutral and then blushes

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.349 
shadows and the neutral and then blushes
and<00:04:16.829> then<00:04:16.949> bronzers<00:04:17.430> instead<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.269> the

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
and then bronzers instead of the

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.289 
and then bronzers instead of the
overhead<00:04:18.989> piece<00:04:19.349> it's<00:04:19.769> actually<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.549> piece<00:04:21.269> of

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
overhead piece it's actually a piece of

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.700 
overhead piece it's actually a piece of
like<00:04:22.229> hard<00:04:22.529> plastic<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.960> goes<00:04:24.960> up<00:04:25.200> stays<00:04:25.469> up

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
like hard plastic that goes up stays up

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.140 
like hard plastic that goes up stays up
in<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:26.039> a<00:04:26.070> wobbly

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
in like a wobbly

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.050 
in like a wobbly
paper<00:04:27.300> thin<00:04:27.960> piece<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.889> it<00:04:28.979> stays<00:04:29.340> shut<00:04:29.759> so

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
paper thin piece and it stays shut so

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.420 
paper thin piece and it stays shut so
this<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.330> much<00:04:30.750> better<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.380> then<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.100> back

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
this is much better and then in the back

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.969 
this is much better and then in the back
it<00:04:32.940> actually<00:04:33.360> has<00:04:33.780> blank<00:04:34.139> face<00:04:34.410> charts<00:04:34.800> so

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
it actually has blank face charts so

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.400 
it actually has blank face charts so
that<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.250> can<00:04:35.460> create<00:04:35.639> your<00:04:35.820> own<00:04:36.110> looks<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.350> I

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
that you can create your own looks and I

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.350 
that you can create your own looks and I
mean<00:04:37.530> it's<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.740> pretty<00:04:37.949> decent<00:04:38.669> stack<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.240> them

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
mean it's a pretty decent stack of them

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.480 
mean it's a pretty decent stack of them
you<00:04:39.479> get<00:04:39.630> maybe<00:04:40.229> like<00:04:40.410> 10<00:04:40.710> it's<00:04:41.400> actually

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
you get maybe like 10 it's actually

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.010 
you get maybe like 10 it's actually
smaller<00:04:41.880> than<00:04:41.940> I<00:04:42.120> thought<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.330> was<00:04:42.539> but<00:04:42.780> you

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
smaller than I thought it was but you

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.570 
smaller than I thought it was but you
could<00:04:43.110> still<00:04:43.259> get<00:04:43.440> more<00:04:43.620> than<00:04:43.770> one<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.520> you

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
could still get more than one so you

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.860 
could still get more than one so you
could<00:04:44.789> actually<00:04:44.940> make<00:04:45.180> your<00:04:45.360> own<00:04:45.449> face<00:04:45.630> starts

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
could actually make your own face starts

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.110 
could actually make your own face starts
with<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.380> colors<00:04:46.740> here<00:04:47.039> and<00:04:47.190> i<00:04:47.639> like<00:04:47.910> how

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
with the colors here and i like how

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.879 
with the colors here and i like how
compact<00:04:48.600> this<00:04:48.960> is<00:04:49.110> you're<00:04:49.320> getting<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.650> ton<00:04:49.860> of

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
compact this is you're getting a ton of

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.279 
compact this is you're getting a ton of
stuff<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.370> it's<00:04:50.520> not<00:04:51.030> in<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.330> huge<00:04:51.720> bulky

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
stuff and it's not in a huge bulky

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.320 
stuff and it's not in a huge bulky
anything<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:53.340> I'm<00:04:53.430> very<00:04:53.460> excited<00:04:53.759> about<00:04:54.180> this

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
anything so I'm very excited about this

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.850 
anything so I'm very excited about this
because<00:04:54.449> it<00:04:54.660> was<00:04:54.780> kind<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.050> an<00:04:55.229> impulse<00:04:55.620> buy

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
because it was kind of an impulse buy

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.279 
because it was kind of an impulse buy
like<00:04:56.070> last<00:04:56.310> minute<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:56.850> saw<00:04:57.720> it<00:04:57.900> on<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.050> website

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
like last minute I saw it on the website

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.260 
like last minute I saw it on the website
and<00:04:59.070> I<00:04:59.160> was<00:04:59.280> like<00:04:59.400> oh<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.550> have<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.120> other

and I was like oh I have the other
master<00:05:00.720> class<00:05:00.930> one<00:05:01.229> I<00:05:01.260> guess<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.740> should<00:05:01.919> try

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
master class one I guess I should try

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.340 
master class one I guess I should try
this<00:05:02.160> one<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:02.850> this<00:05:03.180> one<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.479> redesigned<00:05:03.960> so

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
much better so I can't wait to try this
