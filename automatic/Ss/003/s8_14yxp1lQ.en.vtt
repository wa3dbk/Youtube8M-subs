00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:05.225
 It is told that Mika can eat 21 hot dogs for 66 minutes. 

00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:09.419
 She wants to know how many minutes, m, she'll take away from her 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:14.419
 to eat 35 hot dogs if he can keep the same pace. 

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:18.432
 One big hint is the same pace ... Wait, I have to get some hair 

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:20.266
 from your tongue, okay. (laugh) 

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.147
 One big hint is the same pace. 

00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:28.147
 This means that the term "one-minute" 

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:37.024
 will be constant, they will always be the same number. 

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:40.270
 Because this is actually the pace of eating. 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.425
 Eating hot dogs for one minute will remain the same. 

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:44.545
 It will continue at the same pace. 

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:47.180
 It is told that she can eat 21 hot dogs 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.397
 in 66 minutes. 

00:00:49.397 --> 00:00:52.184
 Therefore, for one minute, at least, 

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:55.016
 are ... 21 hot dogs for 66 minutes. 

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:58.857
 We have 21 hot dogs for 66 minutes. 

00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:01.942
 Well, if the tempo of eating is always the same, 

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:05.181
 she will need this attitude here, 

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:09.604
 we will have the relationship between 35 hot dogs 

00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:14.066
 and how long it takes her to eat 35 hot dogs. 

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.984
 To repeat, the hosts will be for one minute 

00:01:16.984 --> 00:01:19.921
 constant quantity because we will have the same pace. 

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.546
 One-minute hits. 

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:25.037
 If for 21 hot dogs it takes 66 minutes, eating 35 hot dogs 

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:28.538
 it will take m minutes, these two relationships will be the same. 

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:31.546
 We have a work of direct dependence. 

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:34.007
 This will happen at the same pace. 

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:35.794
 In this situation you must 

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.851
 just find m, there is 

00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:42.498
 many different ways to do it. 

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:44.988
 The easiest way I can think of is, 

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:47.662
 that I do not want this m to be here in the denominator, 

00:01:47.662 --> 00:01:50.971
 so let's multiply both sides on m. 

00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:52.837
 I will write it in a different color. 

00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:57.819
 If we multiply this side by m and then that side by m, 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.337
 what do we get? 

00:01:59.337 --> 00:02:03.388
 On the left we have 21 on 66m. 

00:02:03.388 --> 00:02:08.378
 21 on 66 by m, 

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:12.011
 is equal to... 

00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:14.391
 Well, divide by m and multiply by m. 

00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:17.788
 These will be reduced and you will only be 35. 

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:20.469
 Now you only have to find m as the best way, 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.965
 that I can think of is multiplying both sides 

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:26.227
 the reciprocal 

00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:28.079
 of the coefficient before m. 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.749
 Let's multiply both sides by 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:34.126
 66 on 21. 

00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:36.447
 Here I just exchanged the numerator 

00:02:36.447 --> 00:02:38.518
 and the denominator to get the reciprocal, 

00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:40.200
 but I can only do it on one side of the equation, 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.291
 we have to do it on both sides, otherwise 

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.903
 this will not be equal. 

00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:48.903
 We have 66 on 21. This will be just 1. 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.215
 Once you multiply something in its reciprocal, 

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:52.921
 you will end up with a unit. 

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:57.402
 You will stay with m equals ... 

00:02:57.402 --> 00:03:01.051
 Now 35 by 66, divided by 21. 

00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:04.255
 Well 35 is the same as ... 

00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:07.842
 35 is 5 at 7, 

00:03:07.842 --> 00:03:12.279
 and 21 is 3 at 7. 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.040
 So we multiply 7 here above 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.129
 and here you have 7 in the denominator, 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.426
 you divide to 7, so they will be shortened. 

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:24.426
 This will be simplified to 5 by 66 on 3, 

00:03:27.134 --> 00:03:29.578
 then we can simplify it even more, 

00:03:29.578 --> 00:03:34.198
 because 66 is the same thing as 3 at 22. 

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:38.041
 3 by 22 and thus you have 3 in the numerator, 

00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:39.643
 multiply by 3 and have 3 in the denominator, 

00:03:39.643 --> 00:03:40.641
 divide to 3. 

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:42.916
 3 divided by 3 is 1 so you stay 

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:47.916
 with 5 by 22, which is 110. 

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:51.724
 So it will take her minutes to eat 35 hot dogs 

00:03:51.724 --> 00:03:53.326
 at the same pace. 

00:03:53.326 --> 00:03:54.736
 Some of you can solve it ... 

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:57.615
 We can form a different equation here above. 

00:03:57.615 --> 00:03:59.716
 Instead of looking for a one-minute, 

00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:01.852
 we can find how many minutes for a hot dog. 

00:04:01.852 --> 00:04:04.210
 In this situation, if you think about it 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.633
 in minutes for a hotdog, you can say that 

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:11.143
 Mika takes her 66 minutes to eat 21 hot dogs 

00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:15.370
 and it will take her m minutes 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.777
 to eat 35 hot dogs. And if we have the same pace, 

00:04:19.777 --> 00:04:22.374
 then these two relationships will be equal. 

00:04:22.374 --> 00:04:24.346
 The tempo should be the same. 

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:26.273
 So you can find me, actually 

00:04:26.273 --> 00:04:27.639
 it's easier to find m, 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.460
 just multiply both sides by 35. 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.431
 Multiply both sides by 35 and stay ... 

00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:36.632
 On the right side, you only have m, 

00:04:36.632 --> 00:04:39.906
 but on the left, we have the same idea. 

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:44.433
 You take 35, you have 35 at 66/21, 

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:46.651
 which we have already found to be 110. 

00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:50.223
 110 is equal to m. 

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.918
 There are many ways to solve it, 

00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:56.080
 but it is important that we get the same answer.
