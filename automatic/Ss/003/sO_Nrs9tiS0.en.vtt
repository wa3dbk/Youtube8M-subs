prices for the cameras over and over and
over<00:01:36.450> again<00:01:36.690> at<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.960> same<00:01:37.200> point<00:01:37.500> how<00:01:37.710> about

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
over again at the same point how about

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.200 
over again at the same point how about
we<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.190> away<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.580> jump<00:01:38.820> there<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.030> gotta

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
we go away if you jump there you gotta

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.210 
we go away if you jump there you gotta
jump<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:39.570> again<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.870> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> spun<00:01:41.040> they

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
jump there again and if you spun they

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:50.160 
jump there again and if you spun they
gasped<00:01:41.550> in<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:41.820> again

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.740 

the<00:01:50.740> Jonas<00:01:51.009> Brothers<00:01:51.220> are<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.540> awesome

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
the Jonas Brothers are so awesome

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.560 
the Jonas Brothers are so awesome
they're<00:01:53.439> like<00:01:54.090> angels<00:01:55.090> they're<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:55.540> awesome

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
they're like angels they're so awesome

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.120 
they're like angels they're so awesome
and<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.200> think<00:01:56.380> because<00:01:56.470> there<00:01:56.740> are<00:01:56.860> musicians

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
and I think because there are musicians

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.740 
and I think because there are musicians
it<00:01:57.700> helps<00:01:57.970> them<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.119> lot<00:01:58.150> with<00:01:58.330> your<00:01:58.479> dancing

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
it helps them a lot with your dancing

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.389 
it helps them a lot with your dancing
because<00:01:58.840> they<00:01:59.080> get<00:01:59.259> rhythms<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.009> that's

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
because they get rhythms and that's

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.310 
because they get rhythms and that's
really<00:02:01.149> important<00:02:01.659> because<00:02:01.689> if<00:02:02.020> we're<00:02:02.140> saying

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
really important because if we're saying

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.410 
really important because if we're saying
you<00:02:02.950> drop<00:02:03.159> on<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.549> word<00:02:03.700> world<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.210> then<00:02:04.360> you

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
you drop on the word world and then you

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.180 
you drop on the word world and then you
come<00:02:04.570> up<00:02:04.720> but<00:02:05.200> like<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:05.740> know<00:02:05.920> we<00:02:06.009> have<00:02:06.100> to

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
come up but like you know we have to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.740 
come up but like you know we have to
tell<00:02:06.460> them<00:02:06.580> through<00:02:06.880> rhythms<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.390> they<00:02:07.509> get

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
tell them through rhythms and they get

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.570 
tell them through rhythms and they get
it<00:02:07.840> right<00:02:07.960> away<00:02:08.110> because<00:02:08.380> they<00:02:08.530> know<00:02:08.860> when<00:02:09.550> to

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
it right away because they know when to

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.990 
it right away because they know when to
move<00:02:09.880> what<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.360> do<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:11.069> Joe<00:02:12.069> is<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> natural<00:02:12.819> all
