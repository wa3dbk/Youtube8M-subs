00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.420 
dark-colored clothing will get very hot
so<00:02:00.600> keep<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:00.960> mind<00:02:01.049> also<00:02:01.530> important<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
so keep that in mind also important to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.670 
so keep that in mind also important to
remember<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.210> ground<00:02:03.600> gets<00:02:04.110> extremely<00:02:04.500> hot

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
remember the ground gets extremely hot

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.590 
remember the ground gets extremely hot
in<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> summer<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.210> wouldn't<00:02:06.479> go

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
in the summer so if you wouldn't go

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.330 
in the summer so if you wouldn't go
walking<00:02:06.930> around<00:02:07.140> barefoot<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> concrete
