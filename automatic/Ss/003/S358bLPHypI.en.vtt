 medium more or less of broth then I 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.909

 heating and we booked it here good 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.209
 let's add the rice I will add a 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.879
 glass and you already add the amount 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.879
 depends on people who are to eat 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.489
 so that with the taste of chorizo ​​and 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.489
 the rest 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.770
 now let's add 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.260
 a spoonful of tomato 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.000

 let's break it for what 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.110
 with flavor we stir everything 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.840
 and I'm not going to add it at the moment because 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.190
 like chorizo ​​and already has fat and effective 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.090
 Maybe later when I'll see him end 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.090
 we add to the field 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.560

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:24.009
 well we all go back 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.610
 and now I'm going to leave it covered up 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.610
 let rice be made 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:50.150
 we cover it, we put it to 3000 and it reaches 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.190
 9 I'm going to put it three I'd rather be 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.860
 do slowly but do it well 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:58.759
 so we 're not going to wait good anymore 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.940
 time will have passed already and 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:03.820

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.680
 spicy and older 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.830
 well, it was already over and the 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.380
 last step because it would be in good silver 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.620
