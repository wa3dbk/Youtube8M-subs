00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
up your dirty room put an easy dog to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.820 
up your dirty room put an easy dog to
have<00:01:06.600> though<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> wouldn't<00:01:07.530> even<00:01:07.680> have

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
have though like you wouldn't even have

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.410 
have though like you wouldn't even have
to<00:01:07.890> take<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> walk<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.119> could<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.330> let

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to take it for a walk you could just let

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.969 
to take it for a walk you could just let
it<00:01:09.630> loose<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.049> bedroom<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.560> like<00:01:10.680> half

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it loose in your bedroom for like half

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
it loose in your bedroom for like half
an<00:01:11.220> hour<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.850> would<00:01:11.909> probably<00:01:12.090> totally<00:01:12.540> tire

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
an hour it would probably totally tire

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.450 
an hour it would probably totally tire
itself<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.409> although<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> guess<00:01:14.280> you'd<00:01:14.430> have

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
itself out although I guess you'd have

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.550 
itself out although I guess you'd have
to<00:01:14.580> let<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.600> its<00:01:15.750> duty<00:01:15.990> every<00:01:16.320> now

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
to let it out to do its duty every now

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230 
to let it out to do its duty every now
and<00:01:16.740> then<00:01:16.890> although<00:01:17.520> judging<00:01:17.700> by<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> state

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and then although judging by the state

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.490 
and then although judging by the state
of<00:01:18.270> their<00:01:18.479> bedroom<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> dog<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.229> probably

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
of their bedroom the dog would probably

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.230 
of their bedroom the dog would probably
do<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.770> under<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.280> bed<00:01:20.460> too<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.000> they

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
do that under the bed too and they

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.940 
do that under the bed too and they
wouldn't<00:01:21.450> even<00:01:21.509> notice<00:01:21.900> watching<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.680> video

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
wouldn't even notice watching this video

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
wouldn't even notice watching this video
though<00:01:23.130> helps<00:01:23.490> remind<00:01:23.759> me<00:01:23.939> about<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> simpler

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
though helps remind me about the simpler

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.539 
though helps remind me about the simpler
things<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.170> life<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.100> dog<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.430> have
