one well you learn at Apple I mean

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.610 
one well you learn at Apple I mean
certainly<00:00:39.590> before<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.860> became<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> genius<00:00:41.820> I

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
certainly before I became a genius I

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
certainly before I became a genius I
knew<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> fair<00:00:44.160> amount<00:00:44.280> about<00:00:44.520> Max<00:00:45.000> huh<00:00:45.450> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
knew a fair amount about Max huh you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.330 
knew a fair amount about Max huh you
know<00:00:45.809> hopefully<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.320> did<00:00:46.530> otherwise<00:00:46.890> why<00:00:47.219> would

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
know hopefully I did otherwise why would

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799 
know hopefully I did otherwise why would
they<00:00:47.430> hire<00:00:47.610> me<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.450> didn't<00:00:48.690> have

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
they hire me but I didn't have

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.540 
they hire me but I didn't have
experience<00:00:48.930> taking<00:00:49.559> apart<00:00:49.890> things<00:00:50.160> or

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
experience taking apart things or

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
experience taking apart things or
troubleshooting<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.840> certainly<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.199> learn

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
troubleshooting so certainly I learn

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.459 
troubleshooting so certainly I learn
those<00:00:52.739> skills<00:00:52.949> okay<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.600> after<00:00:55.199> being<00:00:55.410> in

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
those skills okay and and after being in

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.080 
those skills okay and and after being in
my<00:00:55.530> genius<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> while<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.340> sort<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.820> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
my genius for a while you sort of you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.360 
my genius for a while you sort of you
see<00:00:57.300> everything<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.079> then<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.590> become<00:00:59.219> very

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
see everything and then you become very

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180 
see everything and then you become very
comfortable<00:00:59.910> with<00:01:00.680> problem<00:01:01.680> solving<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
comfortable with problem solving and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.759 
comfortable with problem solving and
probably<00:01:02.520> shooting<00:01:02.969> trouble<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.350> at

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
probably shooting trouble on it but at

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.260 
probably shooting trouble on it but at
the<00:01:04.799> same<00:01:05.070> time<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.489> become<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> guy<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the same time you become the guy that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.570 
the same time you become the guy that
everybody<00:01:06.600> knows<00:01:06.840> he<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.920> take<00:01:08.100> apart<00:01:08.400> well

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
everybody knows he can take apart well

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.620 
everybody knows he can take apart well
sure<00:01:09.020> that's<00:01:10.020> another<00:01:10.260> issue<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.850> thing

deal<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.640> people<00:01:51.420> who<00:01:51.509> are<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.990> know

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
deal with that people who are you know

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.990 
deal with that people who are you know
angry<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.619> hell<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.220> want<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.579> tear<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:53.880> head

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
off we have to learn to deal with that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.950 
off we have to learn to deal with that
so<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.159> mean<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:56.939> probably<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.659> thing<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
so I mean that's probably the thing I

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.620 
so I mean that's probably the thing I
learned<00:01:58.259> most<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:59.280> developed<00:01:59.790> most<00:02:00.060> at<00:02:00.299> Apple

it is very Wizard of Oz yeah
I<00:06:27.279> don't<00:06:27.519> know<00:06:27.609> if<00:06:27.699> that's<00:06:27.819> just<00:06:27.969> because<00:06:28.059> it's

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:28.299 
I don't know if that's just because it's

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:30.179 
I don't know if that's just because it's
like<00:06:28.689> even<00:06:28.989> busier<00:06:29.319> now<00:06:29.379> than<00:06:29.499> when<00:06:29.859> we<00:06:30.009> were

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:30.189 
like even busier now than when we were

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.149 
like even busier now than when we were
there<00:06:30.219> I'm<00:06:30.609> and<00:06:30.879> it's<00:06:30.999> more<00:06:31.149> chaotic<00:06:31.479> but<00:06:32.159> it's

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:33.159 
there I'm and it's more chaotic but it's

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.739 
there I'm and it's more chaotic but it's
strange<00:06:33.489> that<00:06:33.579> having<00:06:34.239> been<00:06:34.359> gone<00:06:34.569> for<00:06:34.719> a

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:34.749 
strange that having been gone for a

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:35.969 
strange that having been gone for a
while<00:06:34.779> I'm<00:06:34.929> coming<00:06:35.169> back<00:06:35.289> I<00:06:35.349> don't<00:06:35.739> think<00:06:35.919> I

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
while I'm coming back I don't think I

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.249 
while I'm coming back I don't think I
could<00:06:36.129> do<00:06:36.219> that<00:06:36.249> job<00:06:36.369> again<00:06:36.789> so<00:06:37.389> Greg<00:06:37.659> given

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
could do that job again so Greg given

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.879 
could do that job again so Greg given
that<00:06:38.739> its<00:06:39.369> a<00:06:39.549> mix<00:06:39.909> of<00:06:40.149> both<00:06:40.179> the<00:06:40.959> technical<00:06:41.409> set

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
that its a mix of both the technical set

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.029 
that its a mix of both the technical set
aspect<00:06:42.459> and<00:06:42.699> the<00:06:43.149> personnel<00:06:43.959> I<00:06:44.199> think<00:06:44.649> dealing

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
aspect and the personnel I think dealing

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.619 
aspect and the personnel I think dealing
with<00:06:45.159> people<00:06:45.459> that<00:06:45.549> was<00:06:45.669> the<00:06:45.759> thing<00:06:45.909> I<00:06:46.149> I<00:06:46.419> mean

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:46.629 
with people that was the thing I I mean

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:47.909 
with people that was the thing I I mean
I<00:06:46.689> wasn't<00:06:46.869> a<00:06:47.019> genius<00:06:47.319> but<00:06:47.439> that's<00:06:47.619> the<00:06:47.709> part

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 
I wasn't a genius but that's the part

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:49.739 
I wasn't a genius but that's the part
that<00:06:47.949> I<00:06:48.099> retained<00:06:48.579> yep<00:06:48.849> the<00:06:49.149> strongest<00:06:49.479> I<00:06:49.599> put

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:49.749 
that I retained yep the strongest I put

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:51.389 
that I retained yep the strongest I put
a<00:06:49.779> lot<00:06:49.899> of<00:06:49.959> RAM<00:06:50.229> chips<00:06:50.559> in<00:06:50.709> most<00:06:51.009> of<00:06:51.189> them<00:06:51.279> were

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:51.399 
a lot of RAM chips in most of them were

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:54.299 
a lot of RAM chips in most of them were
the<00:06:51.519> right<00:06:51.699> way<00:06:52.859> someday<00:06:53.859> we'll<00:06:53.979> talk<00:06:54.189> about

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:54.309 
the right way someday we'll talk about

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:55.529 
the right way someday we'll talk about
some<00:06:54.549> instances<00:06:55.029> where<00:06:55.239> they<00:06:55.329> weren't

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
some instances where they weren't

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:58.259 
some instances where they weren't
incorrectly<00:06:56.139> and<00:06:56.349> intentionally<00:06:56.979> but<00:06:57.269> I

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:58.269 
incorrectly and intentionally but I

00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:00.449 
incorrectly and intentionally but I
think<00:06:59.139> to<00:06:59.259> me<00:06:59.379> that's<00:06:59.589> the<00:06:59.679> strong<00:07:00.009> piece<00:07:00.249> of

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:00.459 
think to me that's the strong piece of

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:02.789 
think to me that's the strong piece of
it<00:07:00.610> yeah<00:07:00.849> you<00:07:01.119> could<00:07:01.329> you<00:07:01.539> could<00:07:01.749> learn<00:07:02.139> the

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:02.799 
it yeah you could you could learn the

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:04.589 
it yeah you could you could learn the
mac<00:07:03.009> taking<00:07:03.429> parts<00:07:03.639> on<00:07:03.729> your<00:07:03.849> own<00:07:04.029> now<00:07:04.059> granted

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 
mac taking parts on your own now granted

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:06.179 
mac taking parts on your own now granted
it's<00:07:05.169> going<00:07:05.349> to<00:07:05.409> be<00:07:05.469> hard<00:07:05.619> to<00:07:05.679> find<00:07:05.919> a

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:06.189 
it's going to be hard to find a

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:07.379 
it's going to be hard to find a
situation<00:07:06.729> where<00:07:06.819> you<00:07:06.879> going<00:07:06.999> to<00:07:07.059> have<00:07:07.209> access

situation where you going to have access

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.389 
situation where you going to have access
to<00:07:07.659> so<00:07:07.839> many<00:07:07.929> machines<00:07:08.379> to<00:07:08.649> take<00:07:08.860> a<00:07:08.889> part<00:07:09.219> of

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:09.399 
to so many machines to take a part of

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:12.509 
to so many machines to take a part of
every<00:07:09.819> kind<00:07:10.389> but<00:07:10.869> there<00:07:11.409> you<00:07:11.469> go<00:07:11.499> Greg<00:07:11.829> maybe

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:12.519 
every kind but there you go Greg maybe

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:13.859 
every kind but there you go Greg maybe
he's<00:07:12.699> thinking<00:07:12.819> about<00:07:13.029> leaving<00:07:13.239> Apple<00:07:13.689> maybe

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:13.869 
he's thinking about leaving Apple maybe

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:18.059 
he's thinking about leaving Apple maybe
the<00:07:14.019> slice<00:07:16.499> perhaps<00:07:17.499> we'll<00:07:17.829> cover<00:07:17.979> that

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:18.069 
the slice perhaps we'll cover that

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:20.309 
the slice perhaps we'll cover that
another<00:07:18.489> whether<00:07:19.329> you<00:07:19.479> should<00:07:19.539> leave<00:07:19.869> if
