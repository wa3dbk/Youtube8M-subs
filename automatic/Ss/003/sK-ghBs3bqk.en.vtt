00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
going kind of like an interlocking

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.770 
going kind of like an interlocking
within<00:01:23.530> thingy<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.880> they<00:01:25.030> look<00:01:25.270> like<00:01:25.420> that

alright<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:31.470> pretty<00:01:32.470> much<00:01:32.619> how<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.799> do<00:01:33.009> one

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
alright so pretty much how you do one

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.270 
alright so pretty much how you do one

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
it's like they just take it now actually

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.529 
it's like they just take it now actually
hold<00:01:36.640> on<00:01:36.700> I<00:01:36.729> miss<00:01:36.939> me<00:01:37.119> complete<00:01:37.539> stuff<00:01:37.840> my<00:01:38.530> bed

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539

hold on I miss me complete stuff my bed
what<00:01:40.539> you<00:01:40.689> do<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:41.700> once<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:42.880> cut<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.240> into<00:01:43.479> your

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
what you do is once you cut it into your

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.620 
what you do is once you cut it into your
two<00:01:44.229> halves<00:01:44.909> not<00:01:45.909> all<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.179> way<00:01:46.270> down<00:01:46.450> of

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
two halves not all the way down of

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:56.010 
two halves not all the way down of
course<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:52.020> fold<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.259> in<00:01:53.380> half<00:01:54.509> look<00:01:55.509> at<00:01:55.780> the

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
course you fold it in half look at the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.160 
course you fold it in half look at the
two<00:01:56.229> cuts<00:01:57.569> wanting<00:01:58.569> sort<00:01:58.959> of<00:01:59.020> being

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
two cuts wanting sort of being

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.999 
two cuts wanting sort of being
uncooperative<00:01:59.619> with<00:02:00.250> me<00:02:01.319> not<00:02:02.319> uncovered<00:02:02.890> or

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
uncooperative with me not uncovered or

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.230 
uncooperative with me not uncovered or
whatever

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.700 

and<00:02:09.240> then<00:02:09.600> pretty<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:09.990> I<00:02:10.200> gotta<00:02:10.380> do<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.590> just

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
and then pretty much I gotta do is just

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.610 
and then pretty much I gotta do is just
fold<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.110> make<00:02:13.380> a

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
fold it just like that and then make a

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.210 
fold it just like that and then make a
small<00:02:13.760> incision<00:02:15.410> because<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.770> call<00:02:17.010> it

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
small incision because you can call it

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.680 
small incision because you can call it
right<00:02:18.320> there<00:02:19.320> go<00:02:19.740> on<00:02:19.800> about<00:02:20.010> halfway<00:02:20.340> through

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
right there go on about halfway through

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.130 
right there go on about halfway through
all<00:02:21.690> right

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
all right

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.340 
all right
this<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:23.070> will<00:02:23.280> stop<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.760> from<00:02:23.970> breaking<00:02:24.660> off

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
this this will stop it from breaking off

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.990 
this this will stop it from breaking off
and<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.100> way<00:02:26.220> through<00:02:26.280> once<00:02:26.820> you

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
and going all the way through once you

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.280 
and going all the way through once you
cut<00:02:27.240> this<00:02:27.420> next<00:02:27.810> button

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
cut this next button

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.640 
cut this next button
so<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.100> you're<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:30.650> go

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
so what you're going to do is go

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.310 
so what you're going to do is go
straight<00:02:31.710> through<00:02:32.810> where<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.840> made<00:02:34.140> your

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
straight through where you made your

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.020 
straight through where you made your
incision

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.860 

see<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.560> there's<00:02:40.560> your<00:02:40.800> incision<00:02:41.870> there's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
see that there's your incision there's

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.260 
see that there's your incision there's
your<00:02:43.080> cut<00:02:43.320> all<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> way<00:02:43.710> through<00:02:44.959> okay<00:02:47.270> and

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
your cut all the way through okay and

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.330 
your cut all the way through okay and
then<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.470> was<00:02:49.560> going<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.800> say<00:02:49.920> before

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
then like I was going to say before

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.970 
then like I was going to say before
where<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.570> interlock<00:02:52.050> two<00:02:52.500> interlocking

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
where the interlock two interlocking

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.960 
where the interlock two interlocking
looking<00:02:53.640> ones<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:54.660> twist<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.970> then

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
looking ones you just twist it and then

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.780 
looking ones you just twist it and then
this<00:02:57.209> one<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.870> one<00:02:58.140> at<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.410> top<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:59.430> kind<00:02:59.700> of

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
this one the one at the top just kind of

that it takes some cake I'll cut off a
little<00:03:29.460> piece<00:03:29.580> depending<00:03:30.330> on<00:03:30.630> how<00:03:30.780> big<00:03:30.990> you<00:03:31.140> on

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.650 

once<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.220> execute<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.760> situated<00:03:47.360> in<00:03:47.420> there

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
once you execute it is situated in there

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.940 
once you execute it is situated in there
this<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.920> also<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.550> hard<00:03:49.790> part

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
this is also the hard part

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:58.930 
this is also the hard part
all<00:03:51.950> right<00:03:52.150> now<00:03:54.940> once<00:03:57.280> all<00:03:58.280> right<00:03:58.580> now<00:03:58.880> you

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940

all right now once all right now you
just<00:04:00.280> sit<00:04:01.280> down<00:04:01.310> there<00:04:02.530> yes<00:04:03.530> yeah<00:04:03.800> I<00:04:03.980> don't

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
just sit down there yes yeah I don't

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.510 
just sit down there yes yeah I don't
know<00:04:04.910> if<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:05.120> can<00:04:05.270> see<00:04:05.450> but<00:04:05.830> it's<00:04:06.830> kind<00:04:07.430> of

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
know if you can see but it's kind of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:20.360 
know if you can see but it's kind of
twisting<00:04:08.060> so

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.580 

it's<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.090> little<00:04:21.329> hard<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.660> put<00:04:21.900> on<00:04:22.019> duct<00:04:22.290> tape

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
it's a little hard to put on duct tape

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.650 
it's a little hard to put on duct tape
for<00:04:22.889> some<00:04:23.100> reason<00:04:23.490> cause<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.270> keeps<00:04:24.419> coming

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
for some reason cause it keeps coming

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.659 
for some reason cause it keeps coming
undone

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
undone

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.940 
undone
instead<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:26.760> done<00:04:29.660> this<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:30.900> this<00:04:31.470> is<00:04:31.680> more

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
instead of done this is this is more

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.940 
instead of done this is this is more
like<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.340> actual<00:04:32.460> tapers<00:04:33.150> where<00:04:33.419> it's<00:04:33.950> late

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
like the actual tapers where it's late

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.430 
like the actual tapers where it's late
it<00:04:35.520> has<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:35.820> black<00:04:36.150> part<00:04:36.540> at<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.780> end<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:37.169> little

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 
that it has a little bit of a curve at

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.420 
that it has a little bit of a curve at
the<00:07:22.779> end<00:07:22.900> of<00:07:23.080> it<00:07:23.199> and<00:07:23.439> where<00:07:23.619> the<00:07:23.740> flat<00:07:23.979> part<00:07:24.309> is

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
the end of it and where the flat part is

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:30.859 
the end of it and where the flat part is
that<00:07:24.749> where's<00:07:25.749> mine<00:07:28.559> nope<00:07:29.559> that's<00:07:29.680> not<00:07:29.830> it
