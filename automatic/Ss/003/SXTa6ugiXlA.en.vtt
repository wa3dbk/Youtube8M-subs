00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
in that game that that it's hard to put

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.069

them<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.609> in<00:00:50.789> perspective<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.539> I'm<00:00:51.719> standing

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
them all in perspective as I'm standing

here<00:00:52.140> right<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> thing<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
here right now I think the thing that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.810 
here right now I think the thing that
stands<00:00:53.640> out<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.840> know<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> game

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
stands out is you know we have the game

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.470 
stands out is you know we have the game
pretty<00:00:56.820> much<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.590> our<00:00:58.859> hands<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.789> turn

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
pretty much and in our hands and we turn

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.590 
pretty much and in our hands and we turn
them<00:01:00.629> over<00:01:01.789> seems<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:05.940> probably

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
them over seems to be you know probably

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
them over seems to be you know probably
the<00:01:06.720> thing<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.899> sticks<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.800> most<00:01:07.950> as
