hacking<00:01:34.010> nuts<00:01:34.340> for<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:35.740> starter<00:01:36.740> valves<00:01:37.250> I'm

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
hacking nuts for this starter valves I'm

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.090 
hacking nuts for this starter valves I'm
just<00:01:38.090> using<00:01:38.300> my

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
just using my

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.510 
just using my
cellphone<00:01:41.000> camera<00:01:41.540> here<00:01:42.070> now<00:01:43.070> it's<00:01:43.280> going<00:01:43.460> to

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
cellphone camera here now it's going to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.399 
cellphone camera here now it's going to
do<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.850> it's<00:01:44.030> going<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.360> stop<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:47.200> stop<00:01:48.200> is

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
do is it's going to stop the stop is

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.940 
do is it's going to stop the stop is
going<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.590> come<00:01:48.799> out<00:01:49.119> pauses<00:01:50.119> for<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.360> second

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
going to come out pauses for a second

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.820 
going to come out pauses for a second
closes<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.070> collet<00:01:53.290> so<00:01:54.290> this<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.500> retracts

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
closes the collet so this it retracts

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.499 
closes the collet so this it retracts
going<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.280> start<00:01:55.520> up<00:01:55.640> again<00:01:55.759> there<00:01:56.180> she<00:01:56.330> goes

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
going to start up again there she goes

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.340 
going to start up again there she goes
and<00:01:56.810> that's<00:01:56.899> going<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.229> face<00:01:57.440> it<00:01:57.649> off<00:01:59.080> down<00:02:00.080> to

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
and that's going to face it off down to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.510 
and that's going to face it off down to
a<00:02:00.380> hole<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.220> it<00:02:01.280> has<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.460> clean<00:02:01.789> surface<00:02:03.520> okay

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
a hole so it has a clean surface okay

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.430 
a hole so it has a clean surface okay
now<00:02:04.850> it's<00:02:05.030> going<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.299> turn<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.899> little<00:02:06.110> bit<00:02:06.259> of

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
now it's going to turn a little bit of

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.500 
now it's going to turn a little bit of
the<00:02:06.530> diameter

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.780 

now<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.720> gonna<00:02:12.870> chamfer<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.790> Center

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
now it's gonna chamfer and Center

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.570 
now it's gonna chamfer and Center
basically<00:02:15.150> Center<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.870> sort<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.580> drill

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
basically Center it sort of the drill

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.840 
basically Center it sort of the drill
meet<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.570> center<00:02:19.070> now<00:02:20.070> this<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> one<00:02:20.730> twenty

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
meet the center now this is a one twenty

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.760 
meet the center now this is a one twenty
eight<00:02:21.090> drill<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> drill<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.470> come

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
eight drill but a drill in and just come

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.160 
eight drill but a drill in and just come
past<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.250> end<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> stock<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.510> when

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
past the end of the stock so that when

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.010 
past the end of the stock so that when
the<00:02:28.290> face<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.740> tool<00:02:28.980> comes<00:02:29.340> along<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:30.750> will

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
the face of tool comes along it will

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.530 
the face of tool comes along it will
clean<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.740> off<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.520> every<00:02:32.910> time<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.510> a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
clean that off so every time you have a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.410 
clean that off so every time you have a
start<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.170> new<00:02:34.350> hole<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.640> reason<00:02:35.970> being<00:02:36.090> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
start a new hole and the reason being is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.630 
start a new hole and the reason being is
if<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.960> don't<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.740> will<00:02:37.830> always<00:02:38.160> follow<00:02:38.400> that

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
if you don't it will always follow that

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.820 
if you don't it will always follow that
hole<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.000> eventually<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:40.230> found<00:02:40.410> out<00:02:40.680> if

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
hole and eventually but we found out if

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.160 
hole and eventually but we found out if
we<00:02:40.860> had<00:02:41.070> like<00:02:41.340> five<00:02:41.700> or<00:02:41.880> ten<00:02:42.060> pieces<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.720> were

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
we had like five or ten pieces that were

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.460 
we had like five or ten pieces that were
starting<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.500> go<00:02:43.680> off<00:02:43.710> center<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:45.260> now<00:02:46.260> it's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
starting to go off center so now it's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.710 
starting to go off center so now it's
counter<00:02:46.830> boring<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.430> flat<00:02:47.850> bottoming<00:02:48.360> drill

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
counter boring a flat bottoming drill

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.180 
counter boring a flat bottoming drill
for<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.760> attack<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.680> going<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.890> chamfer

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
for the attack and it's going to chamfer

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.090 
for the attack and it's going to chamfer
the<00:02:53.370> backside<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.730> now<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.360> going<00:02:57.570> to

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
the backside and now it's going to

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.390 
the backside and now it's going to
that's<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.810> blank<00:03:00.810> station<00:03:01.380> there<00:03:01.590> now<00:03:02.220> it's

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
that's a blank station there now it's

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.660 
that's a blank station there now it's
going<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.670> cut<00:03:02.850> off

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.660 

I'm<00:03:08.180> not<00:03:08.330> using<00:03:08.510> cooling<00:03:09.020> it<00:03:09.110> right<00:03:09.260> now<00:03:09.670> they

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
I'm not using cooling it right now they

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.840 
I'm not using cooling it right now they
can<00:03:10.910> see<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:12.580> okay

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
can see it okay

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.370 
can see it okay
now<00:03:14.410> stop<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:16.610> feed<00:03:17.540> stops<00:03:17.900> going<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.200> come

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
now stop the feed stops going to come

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.570 
now stop the feed stops going to come
out<00:03:18.590> better<00:03:19.310> feet<00:03:19.850> up<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.240> care<00:03:21.280> better<00:03:22.280> blow

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580
