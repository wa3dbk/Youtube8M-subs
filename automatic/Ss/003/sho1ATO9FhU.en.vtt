 wait until I'm in full I 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.200
 in knowing the video so that it does not 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.950
 lengthen so much 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.150
 It is already finishing installing already 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.150

 a little bit 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.950
 and eyebrows installed correctly this does not 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.250
 it took us that nothing of 12 minutes they give to 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.050
 close how to know if I know if you are installed 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.050
 correctly the java 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.599
 as if you installed it correctly you 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.599
 you have to go
