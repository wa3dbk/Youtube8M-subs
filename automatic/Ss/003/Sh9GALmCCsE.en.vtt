made<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.140> chopper<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> front<00:01:35.640> ends

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
made a chopper you know the front ends

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.490 
made a chopper you know the front ends
kicked<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.180> braking<00:01:36.570> trails<00:01:36.810> changed<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
kicked out braking trails changed and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.929 
kicked out braking trails changed and
it's<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> slow<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> way<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> bike

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it's going to slow the way the bike

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.090 
it's going to slow the way the bike
turns<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.200> contrary<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.860> raise<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
turns on the contrary if you raise the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
turns on the contrary if you raise the
back<00:01:41.430> end<00:01:41.700> or<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.210> lower<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> front

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
back end or if you just lower the front

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.020 
back end or if you just lower the front
end<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.649> you've<00:01:43.890> put<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.340> end<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
end now you've put the back end up and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.550 
end now you've put the back end up and
it's<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> steer<00:01:45.630> faster<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> turns

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it's going to steer faster in the turns

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.780 
it's going to steer faster in the turns
which<00:01:46.950> sounds<00:01:47.340> great

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
which sounds great

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
which sounds great
but<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.149> high<00:01:48.299> speeds<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.140> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
but at high speeds it's going to be a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.380 
but at high speeds it's going to be a
little<00:01:49.320> less<00:01:49.470> stable<00:01:49.850> think<00:01:50.850> about<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.210> when

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
little less stable think about that when

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.190 
little less stable think about that when

progressive<00:03:05.040> rate<00:03:05.190> spring<00:03:05.549> but<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.690> valving

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
progressive rate spring but the valving

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.530 
progressive rate spring but the valving
inside<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.799> what's<00:03:08.130> considered<00:03:08.670> deflective

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
inside is what's considered deflective

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.539 
inside is what's considered deflective
disc<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.410> there's<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.650> lot<00:03:10.950> more<00:03:10.980> technology

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
disc so there's a lot more technology

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.850 
disc so there's a lot more technology
inside<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.470> something<00:03:13.470> else<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.739> think

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
inside of it something else to think

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.620 
inside of it something else to think
about<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:15.120> 412<00:03:15.930> as<00:03:16.290> an<00:03:16.440> entry-level<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:17.069> a

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
about is the 412 as an entry-level is a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.259 
about is the 412 as an entry-level is a
twin<00:03:18.630> tube<00:03:18.870> shock<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.859> internally<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.880> piston

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
twin tube shock so internally the piston

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.270 
twin tube shock so internally the piston
is<00:03:21.329> much<00:03:21.510> smaller<00:03:21.870> when<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.680> 430

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
is much smaller when you get to the 430

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.120 
is much smaller when you get to the 430
it's<00:03:23.940> got<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> bigger<00:03:24.390> piston<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.019> it's<00:03:25.799> it's

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
it's got a bigger piston and it's it's

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.860 
it's got a bigger piston and it's it's
comparable<00:03:26.579> to<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:27.120> want<00:03:27.299> more<00:03:27.420> power<00:03:27.630> out<00:03:27.840> of

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
comparable to you want more power out of

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.180 
comparable to you want more power out of
your<00:03:27.930> motorcycle<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.560> know<00:03:28.829> what's<00:03:29.010> an<00:03:29.100> easy

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
your motorcycle you know what's an easy

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.710 
your motorcycle you know what's an easy
way<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.400> do<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:29.760> put<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.030> bigger<00:03:30.239> piston<00:03:30.630> in

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
way to do that put a bigger piston in

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.569 
way to do that put a bigger piston in
there<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:31.019> shock<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.739> no<00:03:31.890> different<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.340> put<00:03:32.549> a

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
there a shock is no different you put a

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.590 
there a shock is no different you put a
bigger<00:03:32.760> piston<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.180> there<00:03:33.269> you're<00:03:33.359> gonna<00:03:33.450> get

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
bigger piston in there you're gonna get

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.819

valving setup that as you ride along and
you're<00:04:09.750> hitting<00:04:10.049> your<00:04:10.170> freeway<00:04:10.530> expansion

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
you're hitting your freeway expansion

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.270 
you're hitting your freeway expansion
joints<00:04:11.459> it's<00:04:12.000> valved<00:04:12.750> in<00:04:12.900> one<00:04:13.170> fashion<00:04:13.500> you

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
joints it's valved in one fashion you

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.159 
joints it's valved in one fashion you
hit<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.489> big<00:04:14.760> bump<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.510> shaft<00:04:16.019> goes

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
hit a big bump and the shaft goes

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.860 
hit a big bump and the shaft goes
slamming<00:04:16.889> into<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.100> shock<00:04:17.400> body<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:18.329> pops<00:04:18.660> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
slamming into the shock body it pops the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.840 
slamming into the shock body it pops the
second<00:04:19.260> piston<00:04:19.590> open<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.340> changes<00:04:20.729> the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
second piston open so it changes the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.210 
second piston open so it changes the
whole<00:04:20.880> valving<00:04:21.510> so<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.349> knows<00:04:22.680> that<00:04:23.099> it

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
whole valving so that it knows that it

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.010 
whole valving so that it knows that it
needs<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.520> eat<00:04:23.729> up<00:04:23.909> that<00:04:23.940> bump<00:04:24.330> at<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.599> different

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
needs to eat up that bump at a different

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.840 
needs to eat up that bump at a different
rate<00:04:25.200> as<00:04:25.860> soon<00:04:26.099> as<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.310> suspension

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
rate as soon as the suspension

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.340 
rate as soon as the suspension
relaxes<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.540> you're<00:04:27.630> getting<00:04:27.750> back<00:04:27.960> on<00:04:28.170> the

relaxes and you're getting back on the
regular<00:04:28.650> road<00:04:28.800> there's<00:04:29.070> another<00:04:29.310> spring<00:04:29.670> in

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
regular road there's another spring in

regular road there's another spring in
there<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:30.420> pops<00:04:30.690> those<00:04:30.930> two<00:04:31.080> pistons

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
there that pops those two pistons

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.440 
there that pops those two pistons
together<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.430> give<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.670> that<00:04:32.700> nice<00:04:33.030> smooth

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
together to give you that nice smooth

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.090 
together to give you that nice smooth
road<00:04:33.780> ride<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.680> were<00:04:34.800> looking<00:04:34.920> for

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
road ride that you were looking for

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.870 
road ride that you were looking for
originally<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:36.570> that's<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.140> second<00:04:37.470> thing

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
originally so that's the second thing

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.010 
originally so that's the second thing
third<00:04:38.880> thing<00:04:39.060> we<00:04:39.180> wanted<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.540> talk<00:04:39.690> about<00:04:39.720> as

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
third thing we wanted to talk about as

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.570 
third thing we wanted to talk about as
far<00:04:40.050> as<00:04:40.290> picking<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.620> shock<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:41.040> what<00:04:41.400> do<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.520> get

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
far as picking a shock is what do I get
