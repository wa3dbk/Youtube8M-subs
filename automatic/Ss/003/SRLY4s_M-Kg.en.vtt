00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello from london and the question have something 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.010
 today london new york melbourne istanbul 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.719
 and santa petersburg together in all 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.730
 cities will be the new mazda3 today 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.410
 presented here in London in this 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.480
 hall here and I look it to me now 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 to the new mazda3 in the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.619
 wants to attack the compact class so 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.090
 called c segment is for the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.369
 automobile manufacturer the most important 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.890
 saved 25 percent of the European 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.840
 Marktes are compact with the new ones 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.510
 Mazda3, the Japanese want their own 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.160
 continue the success story now 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.989
 In order for this to work, the optics became radical 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.590
 changed keyword is the so-called 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.329
 Core design comes under the body 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.960
 the well-known skyactiv technology for 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.030
 commitment 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.789
 the length is four meters 46 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.070
 unchanged the wheelbase grows by 6 cm 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.010
 the new one is two inches shallower and 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.390
 4 cm wider sporty and dynamic 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.520
 he comes aggressively 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.350
 the 3 Series carries the already from the cx-5 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.539
 well-known grille with wings motif 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.879
 and the new headlights known from 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.010
 mazda 6 reflective paints like here 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.750
 the ruby ​​red metallic and redesigned 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.340
 wheels complete the ko design we know 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.140
 that the segment is highly competitive 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.970
 That's why the car is very important 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.680
 for us we offer with the mazda3 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.170
 car to the needs of the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.990
 Customers in the European compact class 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:26.909
 The mazda engineers have tailored it 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.220
 some things have changed the operating concept 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.420
 was simplified on too many switches 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.460
 and buttons are omitted 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.140
 the space is generous and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.360
 Of course, the mazda3 is with the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.920
 outside world connected so networked the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.079
 let various infotainment features 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.829
 partly also voice-controlled 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.090
 operate the 7 inch touchscreen 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.100
 I like the proportions 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.930
 that has the small issue of the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.470
 mazda6 and he was very successful 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.610
 Inside, it seems extremely good 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.009
 to be processed and very 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.780
 High quality materials are available 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.619
 that has not been there so far 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.850
 I believe a very decisive 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.590
 step forward 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.320
 Now I have taken her place in 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.570
 new mazda3 and one thing I have to say that 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.640
 everything looks pretty good here almost 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.209
 European the switches neat 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.200
 arranged the navigation display 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.940
 put on like it already from 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.440
 other manufacturers know but that makes 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.140
 All a really good impression 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.790
 Seats are comfortable leather steering wheel of the speedometer 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.480
 everything very clear so my 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.670
 first impression very very positive 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.319
 market launch in autumn 2013 comes the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.599
 Mazda 3 with four engines three petrol engines 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.190
 with 100 120 and 165 ps and a 150 ps 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.319
 strong common rail diesel 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.569
 In addition, the Japanese offer numerous 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.849
 Security Assistant on from the city 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.010
 emergency braking system to radar-based 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.380
 distanzregelung because he is so the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.000
 new mazda3 but he is still standing soon 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.010
 he will of course already auto image on 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.690
 heart and kidneys are tested and he 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.610
 will be compared with his 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.930
 competitors but this one has im 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.450
 Next, a proper endurance test 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.360
 that's because of hiroshima 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.819
 Frankfurt is 14,000 kilometers 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.769
 that and then he stands on the iaa and 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.360
 is presented to the audience and then 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.489
 will decide if this new 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.250
 Mazda3 is also such a crowd pleaser 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:15.410
 will be like his predecessor or his 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.410
 brothers mazda6 and cx 5
