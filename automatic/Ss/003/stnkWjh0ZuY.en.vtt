are<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:21.720> thoughts<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.619> series

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
are your thoughts going into this series

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.820 
are your thoughts going into this series
well<00:00:23.820> India<00:00:24.180> need<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.660> bounce<00:00:24.869> back<00:00:25.230> from<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
well India need to bounce back from the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.550 
well India need to bounce back from the
test<00:00:26.099> series<00:00:26.369> loss<00:00:27.359> against<00:00:27.900> England<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
test series loss against England so

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.769 
test series loss against England so
they'll<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> two<00:00:30.179> t20

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
they'll be really up for the two t20

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.170 
they'll be really up for the two t20
matches<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:31.920> they<00:00:32.730> win<00:00:32.910> both

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
matches and I think if they win both

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.040 
matches and I think if they win both
they'll<00:00:33.480> go<00:00:33.690> top<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.440> t20<00:00:35.430> championship

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
they'll go top of the t20 championship

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.959 
they'll go top of the t20 championship
with<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.079> ICC<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.010> everything<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> play<00:00:38.940> for

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
with the ICC so everything to play for

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.240 
with the ICC so everything to play for
for<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.559> but<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.590> don't<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:41.010> they're<00:00:41.129> going

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
for them but I don't think they're going

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
for them but I don't think they're going
to<00:00:41.340> win<00:00:41.460> JP<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> think<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.629> think<00:00:43.200> they're<00:00:43.320> going

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to win JP I think I think they're going

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.279 
to win JP I think I think they're going
to<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.800> apiece<00:00:44.129> okay<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.149> who's<00:00:46.050> going<00:00:46.200> to
