00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 it's time to unravel the mysteries 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.210
 from Internet 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.179
 congratulations earthlings 40 years ago 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.849
 that the man did a fantastic deed 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.320
 the first trip to the moon but who said 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.139
 that man stepped on the moon 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.520
 it's all a big frame is what 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.359
 defend the adherents of theories 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.750
 conspiracy the conspiracy 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.570
 point to a series of indications of fraud 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.660
 we separate the most outstanding 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 first the flag is more famous as 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.190
 she trembled 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.500
 if there is no wind on the moon another shadows 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.809
 how can they point to directions 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 that have values ​​as high as 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.230
 many different 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.110
 if the only source of light is the sun and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.870
 end temperatures like the astronauts 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.379
 supported 100 degrees celsius during the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.510
 day and less than 150 at night is 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:02.850
 too much wrong is impossible 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:08.700
 believe in the name of the story here in 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.560
 Detective virtual traction first to 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.659
 Flag as there is no wind on the moon 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.060
 that maintains the open flag this think 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.200
 who at the top and who said that the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.330
 trembling flag 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.490
 she only moved when she was praised for 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 national movement itself twisted the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.869
 wrist to put the flag 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.150
 in the background he sink flag on the ground 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.729
 do the flag cell phone observes event 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
 now the shadows is also easy to explain 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.770
 data 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.200
 the uneven terrain of the moon 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.360
 influences the shape and direction of 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.210
 shadows and they look very different 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.820
 also because there are several light sources of the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.710
 moon beyond the light of the sun the flashes of 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.500
 astronauts for example the ground 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.049
 reflecting the sunlight also at last the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.760
 temperatures to extreme variations of 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.620
 temperature on the moon 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.140
 the astronauts landed an area of ​​at least 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.750
 very hot we have black were 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.320
 in a well-chosen region they do not 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.030
 100 degrees and not at all 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.490
 minus 100 degrees 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.950
 the conspiracists have several 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.000
 other alleged evidence of fraud 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.250
 We will not stay the whole night. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.910
 that hitting one by one but do not 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.700
 doubt 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.910
 all issues raised are 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.860
 easily explained by science 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.840
 only that the virtual detective of lambuja 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.300
 now show arguments to finish 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.140
 once with any doubt a proof 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.510
 material 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.820
 the rocks the astronauts brought 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.650
 of the moon were studied by 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.050
 whole world nowhere 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.580
 specialist questioned the origin 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.980
 leonardo acosta 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.830
 the greatest proof that the man was on the street 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.100
 are the rock samples that have been 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.730
 Why do not you start on the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.620
 terrestrial surface 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.320
 another test at that time two 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.730
 superpowers would come 24 hours a day 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.890
 with an eye on each other 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.330
 the United States and the Soviet Union 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.200
 also participated in the big race 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.870
 space 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.450
 the Soviets spent millions of rubles 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.010
 spying the Americans and never 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.750
 in no time 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.700
 the Soviet Union manifested any 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.920
 doubt about the astronauts' journey 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200
 Americans to the moon never lost 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.420
 opportunity to show fraud 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.959
 the Russians never doubted why I 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.250
 I'm going to doubt one of the chiefs of the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.840
 conspiracists decided to address the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.690
 second man to step on the moon 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.220
 Astronaut is from ronaldo who lost 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.900
 patience when the guy said that he 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.680
 was a liar who had never been to the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.080
 moon 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.720
 Aldrin turned his hand on the ear by 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.100
 end the mother of all the tests 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.709
 few people know that astronauts 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.510
 left in the floor of the moon a panel that is 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.030
 used until today works like this 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.220
 laboratories here on earth emit signals 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.820
 who travel to the moon hit the dashboard and 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.320
 return 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.540
 can you point a laser today to 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.120
 and see it closed and reflected back 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.209
 on earth today the information is used 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.989
 without discussion by scientists from all over the 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.760
 planet 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.010
 who put his feet on the moon was not the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.290
 man so when you hear talk 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.650
 on the journey from man to moon there is no reason why 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.459
 have doubt 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.829
 of course true to say campuses 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.480
 shareholders are able to say that they do not 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.780
 that Spanish does not exist astronauts 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.760
 there are no Russians do not exist and the moon 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.400
 You already caught the moon as you know it. 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.400
 there is no one who says there are
