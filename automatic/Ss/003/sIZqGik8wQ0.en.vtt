00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
good remake has to compliment the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.100 
good remake has to compliment the
original<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.660> take<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.019> a<00:00:52.080> step

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
original right and take it a step

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.619 
original right and take it a step
further<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.010> hasn't<00:00:53.340> done<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.580> it's<00:00:54.210> just

further and it hasn't done it it's just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.360 
further and it hasn't done it it's just
it's<00:00:54.989> probably<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.220> best

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it's probably that it is the best

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.920

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that you actually play a campaign in

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.500 
that you actually play a campaign in
this<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.310> first<00:01:20.369> time<00:01:20.760> ever<00:01:20.940> it's<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.330> as

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
this for the first time ever it's not as

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.630 
this for the first time ever it's not as
a<00:01:21.659> single<00:01:22.049> individual<00:01:22.650> storyline<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.520> each

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
a single individual storyline for each

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.550 
a single individual storyline for each
character<00:01:23.940> you<00:01:24.330> actually<00:01:24.690> go<00:01:24.900> through<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.530> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
character you actually go through what I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.310 
character you actually go through what I
would<00:01:25.799> call<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.310> remake<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.299> almost<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.930> movie

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
would call a remake of almost the movie

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.319 
would call a remake of almost the movie
so<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.799> starts<00:01:29.190> out<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.549> plane<00:01:29.790> as<00:01:29.969> johnny

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
so it starts out of your plane as johnny

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.080 
so it starts out of your plane as johnny
cage<00:01:30.689> which<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.409> odd<00:01:31.890> because<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
cage which is just odd because I you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.219 
cage which is just odd because I you
know<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.359> kind<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.750> put<00:01:33.899> him<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.109> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
starring role in this it seems well at

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.639 
starring role in this it seems well at
the<00:01:36.359> beginning<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.840> start<00:01:37.229> out<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.469> him

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
then all of a sudden you do four fights

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.190 
then all of a sudden you do four fights
and<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.969> kind<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.240> taking<00:01:42.509> place<00:01:42.719> within<00:01:42.990> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
