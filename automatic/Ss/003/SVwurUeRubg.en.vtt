the best situation to play one to pass
and<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.360> also<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> did<00:01:40.229> hotel<00:01:40.979> one

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
and this is also what I did hotel one

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.940 
and this is also what I did hotel one
while<00:01:41.549> passing<00:01:42.030> l1<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.840> lb<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.290> Xbox<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
while passing l1 is lb on the Xbox and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.859 
while passing l1 is lb on the Xbox and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
fund the wheel is starting run off roll

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.310 
fund the wheel is starting run off roll
past

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
past

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.469 
past
Matuidi<00:01:46.890> place<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.790> him<00:01:47.939> after<00:01:48.149> that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
Matuidi place it back to him after that

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960 
Matuidi place it back to him after that
and<00:01:48.659> now<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.220> fact<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.729> also

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and now we are here the fact that I also

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.359 
and now we are here the fact that I also
hold<00:01:51.329> l1<00:01:51.630> while<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.200> pass<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.770> fun<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> wheel

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
hold l1 while I pass it to fun a wheel

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.060 
hold l1 while I pass it to fun a wheel
made<00:01:53.909> Matuidi<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.689> also<00:01:55.140> start<00:01:55.409> run<00:01:55.649> forward

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
made Matuidi to also start run forward

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.550 
made Matuidi to also start run forward
as<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.119> wanted<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.020> use<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> speed

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
as you can see I wanted to use the speed

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560 
as you can see I wanted to use the speed
of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> game<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.219> created<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.850> that's<00:02:00.299> why<00:02:00.540> I

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
of the game I created and that's why I

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.709 
of the game I created and that's why I
passed<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.170> directly<00:02:01.740> forward<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> Lucas<00:02:02.820> my

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
passed the directly forward to Lucas my

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.510 
passed the directly forward to Lucas my
tweet<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.110> again<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.710> good<00:02:04.860> position<00:02:05.040> after

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
tweet is again in a good position after

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.969 
tweet is again in a good position after
run<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.600> why<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> kept<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.469> playing<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
run and that's why I kept on playing it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
run and that's why I kept on playing it
fast<00:02:08.190> again<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.179> holding<00:02:09.509> l1<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.200> my

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
fast again with holding l1 and my

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.280 
fast again with holding l1 and my
attention<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:11.129> a1<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.640> pass<00:02:11.879> again

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
attention was a1 to pass again

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.649 
attention was a1 to pass again
I<00:02:12.319> have<00:02:13.129> to<00:02:13.280> admit<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.579> I<00:02:13.760> wanted<00:02:14.120> Lucas<00:02:14.510> to

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
I have to admit that I wanted Lucas to

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.660 
I have to admit that I wanted Lucas to
get<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.959> ball<00:02:15.140> but<00:02:15.560> Lavezzi<00:02:15.980> was<00:02:16.280> standing

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
get the ball but Lavezzi was standing

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.240 
get the ball but Lavezzi was standing
behind<00:02:16.790> him<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.299> that's<00:02:17.719> why<00:02:17.930> fifa14<00:02:18.590> decided

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
behind him and that's why fifa14 decided

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.459 
behind him and that's why fifa14 decided
to<00:02:19.340> play<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.579> him<00:02:19.879> again<00:02:20.629> I<00:02:20.810> used<00:02:21.049> to<00:02:21.230> want<00:02:21.409> to

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
to play to him again I used to want to

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.709 
to play to him again I used to want to
pass<00:02:21.739> between<00:02:21.980> Lucas<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.579> Lavezzi<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:23.480> know

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
pass between Lucas and Lavezzi you know

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.550 
pass between Lucas and Lavezzi you know
how<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.140> works

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
how it works

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.520 
how it works
now<00:02:25.099> we<00:02:25.159> have<00:02:25.519> this<00:02:25.879> situation<00:02:26.170> much<00:02:27.170> really

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
know if it was sim or the CPU but

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.000 
know if it was sim or the CPU but
somehow<00:02:56.419> two<00:02:56.689> of<00:02:57.109> his<00:02:57.230> players<00:02:57.530> are<00:02:57.769> now

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
somehow two of his players are now

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.089 
somehow two of his players are now
concentrating<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:59.000> Matuidi<00:02:59.560> this<00:03:00.560> leads<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:00.980> a

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
concentrating on Matuidi this leads to a

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.280 
concentrating on Matuidi this leads to a
gap<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.639> back<00:03:01.849> where<00:03:02.299> Lucas<00:03:02.689> is<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:03.079> to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
gap in the back where Lucas is going to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.339 
gap in the back where Lucas is going to
run<00:03:03.530> into<00:03:03.799> now<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:04.370> realized<00:03:05.239> this<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.689> instead

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
run into now I realized this and instead

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.710 
run into now I realized this and instead
of<00:03:06.500> crossing<00:03:06.889> it<00:03:07.189> to<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.459> middle<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:07.939> decided

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
of crossing it to the middle I decided

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.379 
of crossing it to the middle I decided
to<00:03:08.959> play<00:03:09.169> it<00:03:09.200> back<00:03:09.560> very<00:03:10.280> unexpected<00:03:10.639> when<00:03:11.299> you

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
to play it back very unexpected when you

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.569 
to play it back very unexpected when you
play<00:03:11.629> with<00:03:11.810> two<00:03:12.049> great<00:03:12.319> strikers<00:03:12.950> in<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.370> Box

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
play with two great strikers in the Box

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.210 
play with two great strikers in the Box
Lucas<00:03:14.540> has<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.810> lot<00:03:15.019> of<00:03:15.049> space<00:03:15.379> now<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.980> as<00:03:16.099> I

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
Lucas has a lot of space now and as I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.610 
Lucas has a lot of space now and as I
told<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.579> many<00:03:16.760> times<00:03:16.819> before<00:03:17.239> finish<00:03:18.169> into
