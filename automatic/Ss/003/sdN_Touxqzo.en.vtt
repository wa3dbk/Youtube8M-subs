the tabs will pop out see these tabs you
don't<00:01:30.380> want<00:01:30.499> to<00:01:30.590> break<00:01:30.770> down<00:01:31.600> see<00:01:32.600> how<00:01:32.630> they

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
don't want to break down see how they

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.629 
don't want to break down see how they
are<00:01:34.299> support<00:01:35.299> from<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.509> top<00:01:36.429> once<00:01:37.429> you<00:01:37.490> get

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
are support from the top once you get

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.080 
are support from the top once you get
that<00:01:37.729> out<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.999> way<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:39.649> should<00:01:39.710> expose<00:01:40.219> two

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
that out of the way it should expose two

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.300 
that out of the way it should expose two
screws<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:42.350> one<00:01:42.590> happens<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:42.950> be<00:01:43.009> broken

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
screws this one happens to be broken

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.419 
screws this one happens to be broken
which<00:01:43.969> is<00:01:44.149> not<00:01:44.389> a<00:01:44.420> bad<00:01:44.659> thing<00:01:44.689> well<00:01:45.530> not<00:01:45.829> for<00:01:46.310> me

maybe<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:11.510> what's<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.690> wire<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.930> feels

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
maybe not what's this wire this feels

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.690 
maybe not what's this wire this feels
like<00:03:16.879> let's<00:03:17.879> take<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> look<00:03:18.390> here<00:03:18.660> what<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.410> this
