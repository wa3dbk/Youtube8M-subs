00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 hello and welcome my name 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.289
 is tobias and today i show you how 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.830
 her the data volume of the mobile phone 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.390
 can monitor and limit that 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.310
 works in my example 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.039
 an android phone this feature is 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.599
 from the operating system 4.0 everywhere the same 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.439
 I definitely have the current one 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.989
 android 4.1 4.0 the one for this phone 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.200
 there is to get to this point 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.770
 go here in the settings 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.290
 there opens her point data usage and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.170
 There you can be the first mobile 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 So activate data when we as a child 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.440
 for example, an internetflat the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.809
 disabled here simply I make myself 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.109
 and already can a data limit 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.949
 Set to be the example 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.460
 In fact, when I talk about so much 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.530
 surfer so if if i hit that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.400
 I have 300 mb flash then I can 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.200
 here on 300 and from 3 if I 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.850
 so mb consumed turns off 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.960
 the data usage automatically 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.330
 then the mobile data becomes the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.549
 but I did not activate who 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.880
 however, for example only 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.439
 high speed internet up to 300 mb has the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.030
 For example, it can be a border 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.490
 put three here and I'll say 260 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.340
 then I am warned then then know 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.650
 But now I have to do it slowly 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.850
 so 250 I can see which one 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.470
 to use apps from me most megabit 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.590
 and i can look from the first to the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.490
 fifth november now has about 32 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.000
 ends broadcast 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.950
 and I can see exactly who's what 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.840
 it's pretty cool 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.840
 would you like to visit facebook and 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.560
 I can also consume in larger quantities 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.330
 so I do not see what 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.940
 However, background data can do 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.740
 I can restrict it 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.190
 Restrict the background data then 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.090
 possible if a limit is set 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.620
 is as if I actually say 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.910
 set mobile radio data limit when 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.950
 I set that then it works 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.570
 only yes that was already with my tip me 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.420
 think he is particularly useful for 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:38.580
 people who actually have theirs 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.470
 Internet use want to keep an eye on 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.070
 or even no internet use 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.870
 want 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.030
