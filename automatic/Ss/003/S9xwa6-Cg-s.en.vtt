on<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.770> free-for-all<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:10.490> it's<00:01:11.000> exactly<00:01:11.780> what

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
on a free-for-all and it's exactly what

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.600 
on a free-for-all and it's exactly what
I<00:01:11.990> thought<00:01:12.140> it'd<00:01:12.320> be<00:01:12.350> just<00:01:12.910> insane<00:01:13.910> spawns<00:01:14.390> and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
I thought it'd be just insane spawns and

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.560 
I thought it'd be just insane spawns and
utter<00:01:16.610> chaos<00:01:16.970> it<00:01:18.250> really<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:19.610> not<00:01:19.970> a<00:01:20.030> good<00:01:20.360> map

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
utter chaos it really is not a good map

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.760 
utter chaos it really is not a good map
to<00:01:20.870> try<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.260> run<00:01:21.380> around<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.980> be<00:01:22.330> Rambo<00:01:23.770> it's

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
to try and run around and be Rambo it's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.380 
to try and run around and be Rambo it's
a<00:01:24.830> lot<00:01:24.920> better<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.430> just<00:01:25.760> hold<00:01:25.940> on<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.090> corner

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
a lot better to just hold on a corner

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.180 
a lot better to just hold on a corner
and<00:01:26.660> just<00:01:26.960> plain<00:01:27.290> warrants<00:01:27.620> to<00:01:27.800> watch<00:01:27.980> your

more kills than then you're done there's
this<00:01:37.130> map<00:01:37.400> is<00:01:37.430> insane<00:01:37.940> like<00:01:38.390> people

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
this map is insane like people

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.450 
this map is insane like people
responding<00:01:39.980> everywhere<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:40.730> I<00:01:41.420> really

responding everywhere and I really

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.090 
responding everywhere and I really
couldn't<00:01:43.460> figure<00:01:43.760> out<00:01:43.910> a<00:01:43.970> flow<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.600> it<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:45.100> just

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
couldn't figure out a flow to it I just

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.930 
couldn't figure out a flow to it I just

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
could see we're in our being really

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.960 
could see we're in our being really
useful<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:27.200> lotta<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:28.550> drink<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.820> lot

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
useful and a lotta you just drink a lot

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.730 
useful and a lotta you just drink a lot
more<00:02:29.150> pills<00:02:29.420> together<00:02:29.720> easily<00:02:30.820> because<00:02:32.740> quite

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
more pills together easily because quite

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.350 
more pills together easily because quite
frankly<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:35.500> UAV<00:02:36.500> for<00:02:36.920> 30<00:02:37.100> seconds<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.760> probably

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
frankly a UAV for 30 seconds is probably

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.290 
frankly a UAV for 30 seconds is probably
better<00:02:38.630> than<00:02:38.870> having<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.320> program<00:02:39.680> whistle

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
better than having a program whistle

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.850 
better than having a program whistle
because<00:02:41.300> permits<00:02:42.170> will<00:02:42.320> probably<00:02:42.650> beat<00:02:42.770> you

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
because permits will probably beat you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.610 
because permits will probably beat you
one<00:02:43.070> kill<00:02:43.720> too<00:02:44.720> if<00:02:44.780> you're<00:02:44.990> really<00:02:45.140> lucky<00:02:45.350> and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
one kill too if you're really lucky and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.270 
one kill too if you're really lucky and
