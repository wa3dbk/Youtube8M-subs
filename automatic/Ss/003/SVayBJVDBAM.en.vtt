so<00:06:14.880> you<00:06:14.969> can<00:06:15.120> do<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.330> surround<00:06:15.870> displays<00:06:16.469> if<00:06:16.800> if

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
so you can do a surround displays if if

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.309 
so you can do a surround displays if if
that<00:06:17.669> suits<00:06:17.880> your<00:06:18.029> preference<00:06:18.389> also<00:06:19.169> for

over<00:06:26.159> from<00:06:26.400> your<00:06:26.520> power<00:06:26.699> supply<00:06:26.849> of<00:06:27.060> course

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
over from your power supply of course

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.519 
over from your power supply of course
you'll<00:06:27.449> need<00:06:27.630> those<00:06:27.810> plugged<00:06:28.110> in<00:06:28.259> in<00:06:28.380> order

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:28.529 
you'll need those plugged in in order

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:30.559 
you'll need those plugged in in order
for<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:28.830> card<00:06:29.039> to<00:06:29.190> work<00:06:29.370> you<00:06:30.029> also<00:06:30.210> have<00:06:30.539> a
