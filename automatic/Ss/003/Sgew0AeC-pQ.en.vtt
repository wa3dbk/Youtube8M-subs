00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.980
 at the thing 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.769
 meanwhile I am dependent on 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.199
 youtube and can not live without jörg 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.090
 sprave has a normal job 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.350
 first businessman works in the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.540
 electronics industry 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.050
 In his free time he has always been 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.510
 hurled tinkering four years ago 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.629
 he posted the first video on youtube 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.629
 on 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.680
 Burgkunstadt a small place north 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.719
 from nuremberg here turns the 48-year-old

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.600
 julia does not press the new clip 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.239
 trigger 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.430
 he has the expensive slow-motion camera through 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.769
 his videos are funded 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.780
 advertising upstream youtube 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.210
 involved in the revenue between 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.990
 two and 8000 euro come in the month 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.520
 together 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.840
 I never really thought that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.950
 you make so much money with something 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.869
 can and I have the last time 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.000
 not for more than three years 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.320
 These were really only small grants 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.030
 to my material bill 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.080
 but now it really does 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.210
 good income from almost 300 thousand 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.100
 subscriber has his slingshot channel 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.020
 The German amateur filmmaker produces 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.990
 aware in English 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.259
 mellow hope channel on the strong 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.979
 German accent is intentional because here 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.170
 now no four control panel here 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.759
 dashboard the half wishes about 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.819
 used to grabbing mechanism to cover exercise books 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.069
 lager here jörg sprave could 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.049
 but accent-free speak the worldwide 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.469
 Fans love the special charm 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.659
 his pronunciation above all 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.390
 they are enthusiastic about a powerful one 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.280
 bang 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.410
 jörg sprave is expressly no 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.220
 weaponry shoots therefore already 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.330
 sometimes with food 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.070
 there are always a few 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.880
 Do not agree to be good again 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.950
 you do not do that 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.510
 Personally, I just have to say that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.620
 I am here abound 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.790
 Do not think that it's anywhere 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.260
 Shortage is only because I think 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.420
 texts of the slingshot fired 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.770
 and sometimes I think so too 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.150
 okay, if I am ammunition 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.150
 used and not incorporate me 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.770
 800 to 1000 comments will be received 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.080
 jörg sprave is the video channel 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.830
 he makes contact with his fans important 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.830
 like to be inspired 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.630
 sometimes he meets his fans too 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.330
 personally as on the youtube video day 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.550
 in cologne science links channel is one 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.620
 the most internationally successful channels 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.480
 from germany that guys like jörg 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.740
 Sprave so well is no coincidence 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.630
 These guys are passionate about it 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.459
 First of all, they have one 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.040
 niches are discovered and inspired with their 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.170
 If the audience held then they were the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.820
 regularly content high they take care of themselves 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.350
 around their fans and tie them in the 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.360
 creative processes with a 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.630
 This is how the video evolves constantly 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.220
 Jörg Schwabe also continued on his 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.900
 channel something new ahead 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.320
 He fulfills his greatest 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.840
 become a dream actor 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.640
 So before a movie should do that 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.440
 have feature length and I want that 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.610
 but then piecemeal, as it were 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.170
 publish series on youtube 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.460
 the internet platform even takes over 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.320
 a part of the cost 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.320
 the shooting has already begun 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.050
 shift means here is shot sharp
