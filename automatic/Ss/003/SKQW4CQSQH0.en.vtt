00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.080 
looking at about a $20 price difference
between<00:03:11.560> these<00:03:11.800> low-end<00:03:12.220> ones<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:12.850> these<00:03:13.030> a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
between these low-end ones and these a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.180 
between these low-end ones and these a
little<00:03:13.360> bit<00:03:13.450> higher<00:03:13.690> end<00:03:13.720> sony<00:03:14.200> ones<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.680> so

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
little bit higher end sony ones and so

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.800 
little bit higher end sony ones and so
is<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.460> worth<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:15.970> spend<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.330> extra<00:03:16.360> twenty

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
is it worth it to spend the extra twenty

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.470 
is it worth it to spend the extra twenty
bucks<00:03:16.960> these<00:03:17.530> ones<00:03:17.830> have<00:03:18.010> two<00:03:18.700> cables<00:03:19.270> coming

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480

underneath the wheels of my chair

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.660 
underneath the wheels of my chair
getting<00:03:29.260> wrapped<00:03:29.530> around<00:03:29.740> things<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.340> even

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
getting wrapped around things I even

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.640 
getting wrapped around things I even
have<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:30.970> from<00:03:31.180> my<00:03:31.690> computer<00:03:32.050> around<00:03:32.410> my

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
corner desk around the soundboard and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.990 
corner desk around the soundboard and
then<00:03:34.660> out<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.990> side<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.980> still<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.610> always

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
then out the side and it still is always

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.210 
then out the side and it still is always
in<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.240> way<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:37.420> also<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.380> don't<00:03:38.680> like<00:03:38.950> having

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
in the way so also I don't like having

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.980 
in the way so also I don't like having
two<00:03:39.760> different<00:03:39.910> cables<00:03:40.240> coming<00:03:40.630> out<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
two different cables coming out of the

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.780 
two different cables coming out of the
ear<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.170> appreciate<00:03:41.800> one<00:03:42.100> cable<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.640> year

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
ear I appreciate one cable in the year

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.970 
ear I appreciate one cable in the year
it's<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.180> much<00:03:43.570> less<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.990> deal<00:03:44.170> with<00:03:44.380> these

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
it's that much less to deal with these

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.420 
it's that much less to deal with these
ones<00:03:45.280> do<00:03:45.490> have<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.790> ability<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.320> pop<00:03:47.320> off<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:47.890> I

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
ones do have the ability to pop off so I

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.130 
ones do have the ability to pop off so I
guess<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:48.910> could<00:03:49.090> do<00:03:49.270> some<00:03:49.540> single<00:03:49.990> ear

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
guess you could do some single ear

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.570 
guess you could do some single ear
monitoring<00:03:50.620> with<00:03:50.740> these<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:50.920> don't<00:03:51.130> know<00:03:51.400> why

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
monitoring with these I don't know why

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.850 
monitoring with these I don't know why
anybody<00:03:52.000> would<00:03:52.240> ever<00:03:52.600> do<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:53.020> I<00:03:53.260> mean<00:03:53.650> the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
nobody would ever do this so I don't

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.930 
nobody would ever do this so I don't

and have a hair band at the end but

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.280 
and have a hair band at the end but
again<00:04:03.910> these<00:04:04.060> are<00:04:04.209> good<00:04:04.420> quality<00:04:04.870> headphones

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.949 
again these are good quality headphones
but<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.610> can't<00:04:06.880> portray<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.510> quality<00:04:07.900> of

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
but and I can't portray the quality of

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.050 
but and I can't portray the quality of
the<00:04:08.050> sound<00:04:08.230> coming<00:04:08.530> through<00:04:08.620> them<00:04:09.130> but<00:04:09.730> these

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
the sound coming through them but these

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.699 
the sound coming through them but these
ones<00:04:10.300> have<00:04:10.570> a<00:04:10.600> little<00:04:10.930> bit<00:04:11.050> more<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.410> muted

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
ones have a little bit more of a muted

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.100 
ones have a little bit more of a muted
muffled<00:04:12.370> sound<00:04:12.700> these<00:04:13.060> are<00:04:13.780> definitely

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
muffled sound these are definitely

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.720 
muffled sound these are definitely
crisper<00:04:14.740> they're<00:04:14.980> clearer<00:04:15.370> they<00:04:15.550> get<00:04:15.700> a

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
crisper they're clearer they get a

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.050 
crisper they're clearer they get a
little<00:04:15.880> bit<00:04:16.090> louder<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:18.700> get<00:04:18.880> what<00:04:18.970> you

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
little bit louder so you get what you

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.670 
little bit louder so you get what you
pay<00:04:19.209> for<00:04:19.239> as<00:04:19.630> in<00:04:19.810> most<00:04:19.959> things<00:04:20.320> within<00:04:20.500> the

you're going to get some metal

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.770 
you're going to get some metal
components<00:04:24.669> you<00:04:24.760> get<00:04:25.030> better<00:04:25.210> wires<00:04:25.510> you're

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
going to get better

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.480

on<00:04:26.580> quality<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:28.319> few<00:04:28.530> disadvantages<00:04:29.280> if

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
on quality and a few disadvantages if

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.820 
on quality and a few disadvantages if
you<00:04:29.580> like<00:04:29.789> long<00:04:30.090> cords<00:04:30.599> or<00:04:30.870> palpable<00:04:31.470> ear

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
you like long cords or palpable ear

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.330 
you like long cords or palpable ear
pieces<00:04:32.729> again<00:04:33.000> over<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.539> ear<00:04:33.710> versus<00:04:34.710> on<00:04:34.979> the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
pieces again over the ear versus on the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.010 
pieces again over the ear versus on the
ear<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:35.849> a<00:04:36.090> couple<00:04:36.419> different<00:04:36.690> things<00:04:36.870> to

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
ear so a couple different things to

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.809 
ear so a couple different things to
consider<00:04:37.169> there<00:04:37.650> but<00:04:38.129> either<00:04:38.400> one<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.669> these

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
consider there but either one of these

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.550 
consider there but either one of these
are<00:04:38.970> great<00:04:39.180> headphones<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:39.930> personally<00:04:40.440> has
