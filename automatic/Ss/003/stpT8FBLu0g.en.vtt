00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 moin moin guys and girls again 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.950
 inspiration and today with the first 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.700
 by cod profi team of killer 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.849
 fish have fun so guys we have 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 I just played cod casting and I want to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.660
 Just give it a first impression of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.609
 you have as that is in play 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.609
 contrary to black ops and mw3 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.619
 accuracy 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.500
 something first what I can say 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.149
 we also have a car there 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.480
 otherwise it's just it reminds me that way 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.000
 a bit at mw2 a mix 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.829
 mw2 and bit babcock a mix 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.469
 But from what in any case is the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.590
 Weapons are about eating well 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.730
 Well not be unlocked first 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.000
 Everything written by your partner 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.890
 otherwise bad so far but me 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.930
 the game is supposed to be exaggerated 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.760
 his mission between three and laptops 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.070
 shows 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.449
 I think this mode message I even 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.670
 not really and looking away it is 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.549
 everything is not done all that is 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.490
 now possible again the first impression 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.689
 is generally very well is the play 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.070
 do not say everything because it is still in 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.380
 the preparation of this what you really do 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:22.530
 von win and the middle makes the choice 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:25.189
 very good impression but let's see what 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.189
 going 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.490
 is really cool game bit like that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.369
 I have to change others there 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.530
 and author ok a bad thing where he is 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.600
 Now I find the game bad 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.570
 find this suffering until you can 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.490
 everything possible and sufficient 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 So crystal ball is in principle 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.570
 suffer and finish all 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.330
 not like the black ops for the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.330
 German job do not do something right now 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:15.019
 say something negative okay I am 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.019
 here because I close the basta 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.920
 I find the maps I still have it 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.239
 not played it fell then 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.810
 Almost a battlefield is a 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.620
 really big but you have a few first 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.850
 okay, next camp 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.180
 So I say we are out newer 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.180
 inspiration
