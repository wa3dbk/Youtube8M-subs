00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
what happens and it's going to be

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.740 
what happens and it's going to be
essentially<00:00:24.840> used<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.199> French<00:00:25.590> press<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
essentially used for French press and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.220 
essentially used for French press and
just<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:29.210> Cuisinart<00:00:31.040> drip<00:00:32.040> machine<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.020> not<00:00:34.020> too

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
just a Cuisinart drip machine so not too

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.250 
just a Cuisinart drip machine so not too
worried<00:00:34.530> about<00:00:35.180> fine<00:00:36.180> grinding<00:00:36.750> for<00:00:36.989> espresso

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
worried about fine grinding for espresso

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:49.250 
worried about fine grinding for espresso
but<00:00:43.910> it's<00:00:44.910> good<00:00:45.180> news<00:00:45.390> news<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:47.960> I'll<00:00:48.960> just

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
but it's good news news and I'll just

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.959 
but it's good news news and I'll just
kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.850> where<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.910> got<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> break<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.870> I

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
kind of where we got to break it in so I

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.720 
kind of where we got to break it in so I
think<00:00:53.969> powers<00:00:54.690> there<00:00:55.280> looks<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.430> there's<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
think powers there looks like there's a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.420 
think powers there looks like there's a
timer<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.390> put<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.809> five<00:00:57.989> seconds<00:00:58.430> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
timer just put that to five seconds and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:15.130 
timer just put that to five seconds and
oh<00:01:01.460> yeah

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.440 

and<00:01:17.540> pull<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:19.250> glass<00:01:20.250> cup<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
and pull out the little glass cup and I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.640 
and pull out the little glass cup and I
know<00:01:24.450> glass<00:01:25.170> no<00:01:25.740> static<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.460> less<00:01:26.700> static<00:01:26.970> so

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
know glass no static or less static so

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.109 
know glass no static or less static so
anyways<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:29.180> looks<00:01:30.180> pretty<00:01:30.450> good<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:32.970> on

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
anyways I looks pretty good that was on

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.680 
anyways I looks pretty good that was on
the<00:01:33.350> drip<00:01:34.350> grind<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.259> kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
the drip grind so and I kind of see the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:48.370 
the drip grind so and I kind of see the
grinds<00:01:40.310> pretty<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:45.890> let's<00:01:46.890> try<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.190> on<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
grinds pretty good let's try it on the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:02:02.780 
grinds pretty good let's try it on the
French<00:01:49.380> press<00:01:49.970> what's<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.119> there

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:11.070 

that's<00:02:03.790> some<00:02:05.220> pretty<00:02:06.220> coarse<00:02:06.610> grinds<00:02:10.080> looks

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
that's some pretty coarse grinds looks

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.970 
that's some pretty coarse grinds looks
alright<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:13.210> do<00:02:14.080> have<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:16.770> Italian<00:02:17.770> coffee

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
alright and I do have a Italian coffee

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.880 
alright and I do have a Italian coffee
maker<00:02:18.430> type<00:02:19.060> stovetop<00:02:19.690> thing<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.260> suppose<00:02:20.680> I

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
maker type stovetop thing so I suppose I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.070 
maker type stovetop thing so I suppose I
might<00:02:21.550> use<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.030> fine<00:02:22.209> grind<00:02:22.480> for<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.780> on

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
might use the fine grind for that on

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:39.380 
might use the fine grind for that on
occasion<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:23.740> let's<00:02:23.920> try<00:02:24.130> that

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.880 

pretty<00:02:40.390> fine<00:02:40.690> but<00:02:41.520> doesn't<00:02:42.520> look<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:43.890> well

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
pretty fine but doesn't look that well

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.980 
pretty fine but doesn't look that well
it's<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.190> little<00:02:45.430> different<00:02:45.670> than<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.210> sort<00:02:46.930> of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
it's a little different than the sort of

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.070 
it's a little different than the sort of
that<00:02:47.080> medium<00:02:47.380> setting<00:02:47.740> I<00:02:47.830> did<00:02:47.980> first<00:02:48.220> but

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
that medium setting I did first but

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.200 
that medium setting I did first but
there's<00:02:50.080> still<00:02:50.320> some<00:02:50.590> pretty<00:02:50.800> big<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:52.150> know

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
there's still some pretty big you know

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.180 
there's still some pretty big you know
chunks<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.780> there<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.200> but<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.130> mentioned

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
chunks in there so but like I mentioned

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.820 
chunks in there so but like I mentioned
it's<00:02:54.610> not<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.060> be<00:02:55.120> used<00:02:55.270> for<00:02:55.830> espresso

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
it's not going to be used for espresso

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.780 
it's not going to be used for espresso
so<00:02:58.050> that's<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.530> botom<00:03:00.150> Bistro<00:03:01.150> burger<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.630> ER
