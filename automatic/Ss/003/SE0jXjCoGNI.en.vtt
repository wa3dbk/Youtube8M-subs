00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:09.240
 personal speech that speaks to me heaven 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.580
 Speak out and say who does not speak ravache. 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 we are in the top 10 for top drd fpf 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:24.900
 to perceive weak and we go there in tenth 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.890
 place in tenth place to a game of the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.120
 team the skills week and then the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.550
 suite was the game considered damn your 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.399
 graphic was gray but it's just the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.910
 vegetation was great bringing a gain 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:53.460
 that he took and in ninth place is the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:55.860
 place is the sun and another two is this 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 had sworn with the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:06.180
 glasses for the time but steel and only there me 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:12.140
 play was fought in slow and eighth 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.140
 Where is the boy? 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.450
 the taste is with 1.001 game in which you are 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.360
 basically it's such a reasonable game 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.710
 because its history the isp dig a lot 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.750
 what was happening because it was united to innovation 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.490
 in real it was a link unit 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.290
 American infantry 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 when we are at high risk 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.640
 they are the first to be 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.490
 conflict region and the last to be 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.079
 take away from it then that's why it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.310
 only with the data the squad of elite in 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:54.329
 seventh place is better 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:58.500
 in fact out of war is an ounce is very 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.920
 known and also their games as well 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.350
 and the more the air it is the luck it seems 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.399
 brought some innovation something 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.200
 different 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.750
 was a first person shooter 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.300
 developed by electronic arts base 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.480
 in id tech system 3 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.450
 locked in europe and north africa 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.380
 during the Second World War 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:30.280
 is the third game in the series to be released 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:35.110
 on arriving is the game the game era is a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:39.550
 game date Tartoni Zado was more or 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:46.750
 less because it knows then it is considered 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:51.340
 and it was not very good because it is the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.760
 his play was lacking without ever stopping 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.240
 play so go so you stay connected 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.170
 in the game and this my comment is very 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.540
 stress because if you die the organ 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.060
 team again was not much 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.930
 criticized and in fifth place this 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.050
 splinter cell pandora 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.540
 finally have cell pandora is a great game 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.230
 because he himself brings that teaching 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.860
 Stelvio because your way it is 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.380
 great because you can learn how to 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.459
 she learned to do how the 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.680
 opponents do where third person 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.880
 now the activities that only the people who 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.980
 It works for nf branch of the ns to 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.739
 called iron orbit 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.989
 the sam fisher character of the subject 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.840
 michael site 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.000
 the game was named shannon street 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.070
 during its development and then 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.320
 changed to the extinct that tone clancy's 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.360
 splinter salt 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.760
 fourth is the very strong tone 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.840
 fire scoop was a shooting game 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.470
 which was little known for its 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.160
 because he did not have that 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.920
 in the former because the game was such a 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.850
 very good first person action game 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.450
 of the new to produce many innovations 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:27.160
 things in total but the game the game pre 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:30.820
 game in joinville the active and caught 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.850
 and third, and I'm playing. 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:38.280
 Finding the psi brad macorin 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:41.410
 already the flu is neco medicine train was a game 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.380
 so those hot can speak more or 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.270
 least because their game play does not 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.250
 it was very good 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:54.310
 It's the same is so 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.740
 use the game it rake one with one 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.060
 great ambience and a great gameplay 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:05.110
 but the graphics were much more 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.720
 good for the water variety season of 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.330
 maps ambiance was great only the 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:18.220
 history was not the best 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:20.910
 second is with 29 co2 is a 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.940
 good game 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.850
 It's a good part because its action and 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.690
 gameplay is not is it gets everyone liked 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.600
 of that game and today will talk in the jungles 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.610
 jaguar ian teaches a shot with a person 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.890
 putting on the skin of longing that 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.870
 They tried to storm the village seeking 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.130
 eliminate the opposition forces present 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:48.120
 on site 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:48.120
 first and foremost is to hit store in 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.860
 los angeles is yes it deserves to stay in 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:06:00.220
 first because it is an action game 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.860
 frantic because you play well you 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:08.250
 played in the city of los angeles as it says 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:12.730
 the name and it was also a game as well 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.760
 hydrated left general glaze 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:19.510
 I knew I was being destroyed by 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.390
 a dismount of the rays of his horns and 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.910
 so you had to discuss using a 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.060
 cause of the race the setting is also 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:33.390
 very good but so the gameplay was 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.390
 locked geography burris is from backyard 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:41.550
