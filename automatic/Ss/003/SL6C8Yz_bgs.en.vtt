break if the current gets too high it's
a<00:01:14.340> safety<00:01:14.580> thing<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.600> instead<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.900> blowing<00:01:16.110> up

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
a safety thing so instead of blowing up

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.280 
a safety thing so instead of blowing up
the<00:01:16.350> whole<00:01:16.560> house<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.549> blow<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> fuse

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
the whole house you just blow the fuse

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.870 
the whole house you just blow the fuse
the<00:01:19.290> last<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> look<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> cable

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the last bit to look at is the cable

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.010 
the last bit to look at is the cable
grip<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.250> grip<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.580> cable<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.960> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
grip this is to grip the cable but it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.840 
grip this is to grip the cable but it
needs<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.590> grip<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.009> outer<00:01:26.159> sleeve<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
needs to grip the outer sleeve of the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.080 
needs to grip the outer sleeve of the
cable<00:01:27.240> not<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.229> wires<00:01:28.439> inside<00:01:29.090> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
cable not on little wires inside so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.050 
cable not on little wires inside so
which<00:01:30.240> wire<00:01:30.570> goes<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.869> which<00:01:31.170> pic<00:01:31.640> or<00:01:32.640> whatever

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
which wire goes to which pic or whatever

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.850 
which wire goes to which pic or whatever
just<00:01:33.329> fake<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.810> see<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.229> looks<00:01:34.409> nice

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
just fake up see what looks nice

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.050 
just fake up see what looks nice
oh<00:01:38.580> no<00:01:40.050> the<00:01:41.050> blue<00:01:41.380> wire<00:01:41.650> goes<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.160> left<00:01:42.400> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
oh no the blue wire goes to the left the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.330 
oh no the blue wire goes to the left the
brown<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.600> right<00:01:43.870> and<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.770> striped<00:01:45.190> one

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
brown to the right and the striped one

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.790 
brown to the right and the striped one
at<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.550> top<00:01:45.790> how<00:01:46.780> can<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.050> remember<00:01:47.290> that

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
at the top how can you remember that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.580 
at the top how can you remember that
take<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.640> second<00:01:49.120> letter<00:01:49.300> of<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.630> name<00:01:50.200> of

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
take the second letter of the name of

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.050 
take the second letter of the name of
each<00:01:50.980> color<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.580> get<00:01:52.090> left<00:01:52.390> right<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.560> top<00:01:54.060> so

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
each color to get left right on top so

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060 
each color to get left right on top so
what<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.780> earth<00:01:55.870> Way<00:01:56.170> are<00:01:56.320> all<00:01:56.440> about

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
what is the earth Way are all about

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.460 
what is the earth Way are all about
it's<00:01:57.790> another<00:01:58.120> safety<00:01:58.420> thing<00:01:58.810> mains

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
it's another safety thing mains

what's<00:03:53.530> remember<00:03:54.069> so<00:03:54.459> first<00:03:54.819> change

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
what's remember so first change
