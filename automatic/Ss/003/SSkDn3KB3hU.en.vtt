00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.460
 Being positive also means taking care of yourself 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.119
 the diet to train without diet is 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.760
 how to build a house without plans 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.530
 you need to know what to eat at what times and 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.470
 how much 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.900
 there is a saying that says not to prepare is 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.020
 prepare to fail we must 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.700
 prepare we must take time to 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.310
 elaborate a diet according to the 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.050
 requirements of our body 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.980
 taking into account a certain goal 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.530
 either increase muscle mass remove 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.650
 fat or just keep the weight 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.810
 current 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.150
 if we eat a lot more than what 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.510
 our body requires we will increase 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.820
 weight surely accumulating fat that 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.910
 we do not want if on the contrary 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.640
 we eat little well below what 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.820
 our body also needs to lower 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.660
 weight lose muscle mass and neither 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.870
 we want that all this is not bad should 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.080
 always keep a balanced diet 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.140
 is the basis that is why the importance of 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.810
 elaborate a proper diet the first 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.630
 step is to calculate the calories that you 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.850
 body needs for this we will use 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.580
 the harris formula 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.160
 Benedict that is currently used what 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.550
 first to calculate is your metabolic rate 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.729
 basal that is what your body spends for 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.800
 the mere fact of living for this we must 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.380
 make the following formula 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.750
 man by nature has more mass 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.990
 muscle that the woman is because of that 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.820
 the formulas are different 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.220
 I know that at first glance it looks very 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.770
 complex but do not worry it is not 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.369
 it's very easy to make an example 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.030
 a man of 20 years of 1.80 meters of 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.119
 height and 80 kilograms of weight the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.989
 formula would be this way we go to 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.840
 replace what is in parentheses in the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:17.099
 first parentheses 10 times the weight in 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:21.420
 kilograms which in this case is 80 in the 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:24.510
 second parenthesis 6.25 by height 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.610
 in centimeters that in this example is 1 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:33.830
 with 80 and in the third parenthesis 5 by 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.160
 the age that for this case would be 20 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:42.540
 once this is done we move on to solve 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:48.220
 the parentheses 10 for 80 to 800 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.930
 6.25 percent eighty out of 1,125 and five 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.129
 for twenty to seven 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.370
 if we do the final operation it gives us 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:01.159
 1830 calories this equals the rate 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.469
 basal metabolic what the person's 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.060
 example spends for the fact of doing 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.630
 operate your body is to say by the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.510
 fact of living 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.830
 the second thing to calculate is the amount of 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.840
 daily calories this is what you spend 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.170
 depending on your level of activity here 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.480
 the basal metabolic rate is added to 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.230
 level of activity and for that you must 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.120
 perform the following simple formula 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.790
 amount of daily calories equals 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.290
 the basal metabolic rate by the level of 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.790
 activity 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.080
 Here I will show you the different 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.350
 types of activity 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.880
 the sedentary who is the person who does not 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.520
 he exercises and has a job 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.240
 desk should multiply the rate 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.240
 metabolic by 1.2 the person with 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.480
 light activity is the one who exercises 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.370
 from 1 to 3 days per week should 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.040
 multiply the metabolic rate by 1 375 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.840
 the one of moderate activity realize 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.370
 exercise three to five days for 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.379
 week 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.270
 and must multiply the metabolic rate 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:12.000
 by 1.55 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.660
 the one of intense activity realizes 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.100
 Exercise between 6 and 7 days per week in 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.670
 this case multiplies the rate 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.980
 metabolic by 1,725 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.180
 the person with very intense activity 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.770
 you would like to exercise twice a day 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.340
 exercises of great strength and exhaustion 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.280
 for example professional athletes 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.180
 here you should multiply the rate 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.330
 metabolic by 1.9 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.340
 think very well how active you are and 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.940
 select one of the activities that 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.940
 I just mentioned 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.000
 in the case of the previous example 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.520
 suppose it is a person who has 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.219
 a moderate activity with training 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.430
 four days a week would be the 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:06.430
 next way you multiply the rate 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:11.860
 metabolic since 1830 which we took in 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:15.870
 the previous case by 1.55 which is for the 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:24.909
 moderate activity level this gives us 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:26.740
 2800 36.5 those 2800 36.5 calories are 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:30.690
 those that the body of the example name 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.550
 previous used every day by both 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.889
 ingesting this amount of calories the 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.880
 body would be maintained that is to say ni 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.950
 or lose weight and get fat 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.920
 The third point is to determine your 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.180
 objective is to go up mass or lose 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.190
 grease 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.150
 if you want to gain muscle mass add 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:54.160
 calories these will go from 300 to 500 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.370
 if you want to lose the salt it would be what 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.130
 otherwise maybe 200 to 500 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:04.030
 calories and if you want to stay in the 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.890
 current weight give you the right calories if 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.800
 you start doing this calculation of 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.750
 caloric requirements will have started 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.960
 successfully your process to have a life 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.330
 healthy and happy I hope you have been 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.690
 utility the information a hug for 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.690
 everyone
