Decay<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:30.390> think<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.380> started<00:00:31.679> this<00:00:31.800> in

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
Decay and I think I started this in

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.310 
Decay and I think I started this in
early<00:00:32.669> December<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.420> I'm<00:00:33.510> really<00:00:33.660> excited<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
early December so I'm really excited the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.200 
early December so I'm really excited the
progress<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.860> I've<00:00:34.950> made<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.430> because<00:00:35.940> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
progress that I've made and because of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.459 
progress that I've made and because of
the<00:00:36.300> poor<00:00:36.510> lighting<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:36.960> gonna<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the poor lighting it's gonna be kind of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.350 
the poor lighting it's gonna be kind of
hard<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> show<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.340> dips<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> did<00:00:39.210> take

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
hard to show you the dips so I did take

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.080 
hard to show you the dips so I did take
pictures<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.840> i<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.170> insert<00:00:40.200> at<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> end

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
pictures that i will insert at the end

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.360 
pictures that i will insert at the end
so<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.570> where<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.219> you
