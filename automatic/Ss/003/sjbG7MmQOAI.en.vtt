00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.099
 ah 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.309
 very good data android mails what's up 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.170
 how are you today I bring you information of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.550
 the next update guys the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.200
 truth is that there is a lot of desire that the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.300
 get out and well then let's talk a 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.490
 little bit of it is worth it if you do not remember very 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.349
 bad are taking out the sneak peeks voucher 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.670
 it is quite evident this and here I 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.140
 is what you are seeing and if I do not count 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.789
 that the trips since they are the advances 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.529
 that they will take out for the update 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.910
 then from this I want 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.220
 tell one thing that I have seen on twitter 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.590
 a youtube that is nobody's worth if you do not 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.440
 you remember very very very bad is numbers more 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.910
 important worldwide is worth 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.290
 clash of titans has enough 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.290
 subscribers not to say that you have more 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.149
 and on twitter he put a video worth 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.910
 saying the title of the video and the link 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.590
 ok and that video in that tweet people 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.180
 he started asking things is worth seeing 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.030
 when they get updates such as such 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.739
 then a certain richard hearts is worth a 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.539
 subscriber I guess I ask you when 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.059
 was going to be the application when I was going to 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.920
 arrive since I could not wait anymore 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.160
 then the sparks told him 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.979
 definitely this week may the 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.680
 English Dave Owens means that it is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.700
 Tuesday or Wednesday then today we are 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.930
 a day to Monday 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.690
 that means that as much 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.070
 Wednesday will be Wednesday 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.740
 update then when the people 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.880
 that is of those nervous people who 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.470
 they do not know when they will take the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.210
 update because they said it was going to be 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.790
 at most on Wednesday so he says 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.890
 the chief putt and we can find out 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.140
 so then from here we can 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.090
 deduce that they will have few little things 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.790
 more is to say today has added no clan 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.680
 maybe tomorrow add something else and the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.940
 Wednesday same or to take the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.860
 update and take the boom out of the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.810
 update or just on Wednesday 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.979
 they already get update and nothing else 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.020
 then it will have been an update 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.210
 pretty simple of those that there is not 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.830
 a lot of things to try but good 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.160
 it's interesting to see how it 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.240
 unfold the game and then 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.950
 one of the things he did to me too 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.050
 grace or a little bit like that of 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.570
 curiosity is and when you put it 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.970
 definitely this week is going to be 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.590
 sure in him then of jowell time and 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.600
 Then I ask the kid what if 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.380
 you can confirm level 7 of the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.170
 witches is I do not remember bad or wheeldon 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.920
 well, he could do better 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.260
 ensure that they were going to get more 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.670
 updates worth I mean a 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.720
 troop plan for example the improvement of 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.030
 troops d 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.000
 the witches another level of the witches I 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.220
 I mean another level of dragon is a 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.610
 Witches Tower things about this style 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.170
 the kid asked him he did not answer anymore 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.330
 weird because not normal is that always 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.550
 answer then what surprised me 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.080
 it was from the plan that you do not want to give 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.450
 clues because they are adding to these 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.580
 things then are assumptions of mine that 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.720
 Maybe they do not come to mind but good 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.730
 I always tell them because you never know 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.320
 if it's going to be real or will it be mind 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.540
 then it was just these guys 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.500
 tell you that this week we will have the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.780
 update for her we can 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.760
 try it all in the clash of land if 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.670
 I tell you guys that do in the channel 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.320
 enough videos of reviews on the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.330
 new update and I think it's going to 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.190
 Like enough water, so far 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.500

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.330

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.680
 plastics that we have started this 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.080
 late and the moment is going there 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.820
 justita justita and if you want me to upload it 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.459
 Well, 500 I like you, well, let's put 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.380
