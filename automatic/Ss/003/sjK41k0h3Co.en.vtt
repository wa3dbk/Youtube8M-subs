 muscle strengthening 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.930
 corset and improvement 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.630
 an important element of any training 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.420
 is warm-up it needs to be performed 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.850

 on any cardio trainers warmed up 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540
 muscles and joints work better therefore 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.700
 range of motion and intensity 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
 workouts increase significantly 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.630

 exercises for back muscles 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.100
 gravitron for a special simulator for 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 performing pull-ups with a counterweight 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.870
 the more you put the counterbalance 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.280
 easier it will be to do the exercise in 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.690
 this simulator is being worked out 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.750
 the latissimus dorsi 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.410
 help other biceps muscles source

 raise the chin up a bit 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.039
 look in front of us on the exhale 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.140
 we rise a little higher than the level of the handle 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.560
 the upper point of the elbows a little set aside 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.859

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.810
 it is important to ensure maximum 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.820
 mobility of the shoulder girdle in order 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.310
 to prevent the load transfer to 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.350
 biceps shoulder biceps eat and 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.520
 other pull-up options 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.770
 in the simulator gravitron 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.260
 for example when performing pull-ups 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.110
 narrow grip load moves on 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.310
 lower part of the broadest muscles and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.770
 auxiliary muscles hand flexors 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.380
 biceps when performing pullups 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.940
