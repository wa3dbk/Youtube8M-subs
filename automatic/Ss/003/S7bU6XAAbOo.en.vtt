00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
to see me may not want to see me every

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370 
to see me may not want to see me every
three<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.119> four<00:01:57.329> months<00:01:57.659> they<00:01:58.020> want<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.259> see

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
three to four months they want to see

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
three to four months they want to see
the<00:01:58.469> Botox<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.130> course<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> results<00:02:00.060> of

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the Botox of course of the results of

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.050 
the Botox of course of the results of
the<00:02:00.240> Botox<00:02:00.659> or<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.439> Zeeman<00:02:01.950> or<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.549> Dysport

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the Botox or the Zeeman or the Dysport

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.450 
the Botox or the Zeeman or the Dysport
and<00:02:03.270> essentially<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.560> not<00:02:04.920> only

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and essentially we can do not only

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.609 
and essentially we can do not only
oblate<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.299> nerve<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> chemical<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
oblate the nerve with the chemical the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
oblate the nerve with the chemical the
Botox<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.820> actually<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
Botox we can actually do it with the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.780 
Botox we can actually do it with the
radiofrequency<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.160> last<00:02:11.370> one<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
radiofrequency and that can last one to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.610 
radiofrequency and that can last one to
two<00:02:11.970> years<00:02:12.360> well<00:02:12.870> that's<00:02:12.989> really<00:02:13.290> kind<00:02:13.560> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
two years well that's really kind of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.410 
two years well that's really kind of
fantastic<00:02:13.829> especially<00:02:14.489> for<00:02:15.000> our<00:02:15.120> busy

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
fantastic especially for our busy

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.990 
fantastic especially for our busy
lifestyles<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.980> thermal<00:02:17.459> IFFT<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
lifestyles the thermal IFFT and the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.569 
lifestyles the thermal IFFT and the
thermi<00:02:18.390> tight<00:02:18.660> were<00:02:19.140> using<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.799> science<00:02:20.430> of

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
thermi tight were using that science of

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.939 
thermi tight were using that science of
heat<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.180> basically<00:02:21.660> draw<00:02:22.290> things<00:02:22.709> up

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:22.949 
heat to basically draw things up

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.770 
heat to basically draw things up
everybody's<00:02:23.760> here's<00:02:23.970> cook<00:02:24.239> bacon<00:02:24.480> before

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
everybody's here's cook bacon before

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.340 
everybody's here's cook bacon before
right<00:02:25.169> you<00:02:25.560> put<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.859> in<00:02:25.949> the<00:02:26.040> pan

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
right you put it in the pan

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.230 
right you put it in the pan
that<00:02:26.470> kind<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.740> shrivels<00:02:27.190> up<00:02:27.340> well<00:02:27.940> that's<00:02:28.060> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
that kind of shrivels up well that's the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.450 
that kind of shrivels up well that's the
same<00:02:28.540> thing<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.020> we're<00:02:29.200> looking<00:02:29.650> at<00:02:29.830> when

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
same thing that we're looking at when

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.160 
same thing that we're looking at when
essentially<00:02:30.940> we're<00:02:31.180> going<00:02:31.210> between<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.900> skin

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
essentially we're going between the skin

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.870 
essentially we're going between the skin
and<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.650> muscle<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.430> don't<00:02:33.580> smell<00:02:33.820> like

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
and the muscle you don't smell like

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.680 
and the muscle you don't smell like
bacon<00:02:34.420> but<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:35.440> got<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> picture<00:02:36.310> okay<00:02:36.700> let

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
bacon but you got the picture okay let

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.630 
bacon but you got the picture okay let
me<00:02:37.780> go<00:02:37.930> for<00:02:38.110> another<00:02:38.320> slide<00:02:38.620> now<00:02:39.460> there's

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
me go for another slide now there's

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.230 
me go for another slide now there's
actually<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.330> family<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:42.520> thermy<00:02:43.180> is

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
actually a family that thermy is

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.150 
actually a family that thermy is
actually<00:02:43.630> kind<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.930> come<00:02:44.110> out<00:02:44.290> with<00:02:44.500> some<00:02:45.040> of

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
actually kind of come out with some of

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.500 
actually kind of come out with some of
them<00:02:45.310> are<00:02:45.490> all<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.850> these<00:02:45.970> are<00:02:46.180> once<00:02:46.390> again

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
them are all of these are once again

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.900 
them are all of these are once again
minimally<00:02:47.170> invasive<00:02:47.710> let<00:02:48.190> me<00:02:48.280> be<00:02:48.460> very<00:02:48.490> clear

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
minimally invasive let me be very clear

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.950 
minimally invasive let me be very clear
there<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.660> no<00:02:49.900> cutting<00:02:50.430> no<00:02:51.430> cutting<00:02:52.300> come<00:02:52.810> on

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
there is no cutting no cutting come on

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.450 
there is no cutting no cutting come on
in<00:02:53.140> join<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> party<00:02:53.890> we<00:02:54.010> ain't<00:02:54.160> gonna<00:02:54.310> bust

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
in join the party we ain't gonna bust

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.380 
in join the party we ain't gonna bust
you<00:02:54.610> out<00:02:54.700> like<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.970> comedy<00:02:55.360> club<00:02:57.150> all<00:02:58.150> right

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
you out like the comedy club all right

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.150 
you out like the comedy club all right
so<00:02:58.810> essentially<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.380> first<00:02:59.410> one<00:02:59.860> is<00:02:59.980> called

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
so essentially the first one is called

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.640 
so essentially the first one is called
thermy<00:03:00.670> race<00:03:01.000> now<00:03:01.390> thermi<00:03:01.840> race<00:03:02.050> has<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.500> do

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
thermy race now thermi race has to do

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.140 
thermy race now thermi race has to do
with<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.860> nerve<00:03:03.040> that's<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.790> nerves<00:03:04.000> that

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
with the nerve that's the nerves that

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.000 
with the nerve that's the nerves that
basically<00:03:04.540> give<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.960> eleven<00:03:05.350> sign<00:03:05.590> and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
basically give you the eleven sign and

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.860 
basically give you the eleven sign and
you<00:03:06.400> know<00:03:06.550> when<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.820> make<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.210> sign<00:03:07.600> that

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
you know when you make that sign that

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.150 
you know when you make that sign that
you<00:03:08.050> know<00:03:08.200> you're<00:03:08.470> ticked<00:03:08.710> off<00:03:08.860> at<00:03:09.040> your

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
you know you're ticked off at your

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.680 
you know you're ticked off at your
spouse<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.640> know<00:03:09.730> how<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.910> pulls<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.480> brow

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
spouse you know how it pulls the brow

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.260 
spouse you know how it pulls the brow
down<00:03:11.020> so<00:03:11.830> if<00:03:11.980> we<00:03:12.040> take<00:03:12.340> out<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.880> nerves<00:03:13.120> that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
down so if we take out the nerves that

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.690 
down so if we take out the nerves that
pull<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.750> brow<00:03:13.960> down<00:03:14.320> either<00:03:14.650> with<00:03:14.860> Botox<00:03:15.400> or

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
pull the brow down either with Botox or

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.630 
pull the brow down either with Botox or
zmn<00:03:16.240> we<00:03:16.810> can<00:03:17.110> allow<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.410> lifting<00:03:18.160> muscle<00:03:18.550> to

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
zmn we can allow that lifting muscle to

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.520 
zmn we can allow that lifting muscle to
work<00:03:18.690> uninhibitedly<00:03:19.690> does<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.350> make<00:03:20.500> sense

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
work uninhibitedly does that make sense

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.740 
work uninhibitedly does that make sense
or<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.220> uninhibited<00:03:21.940> don't<00:03:22.270> just<00:03:22.450> make<00:03:22.570> up<00:03:22.690> a

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
or you uninhibited don't just make up a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.280 
or you uninhibited don't just make up a
word<00:03:22.930> anyway<00:03:23.500> work<00:03:23.710> with<00:03:23.920> me<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:25.540> thermi<00:03:25.960> type

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
word anyway work with me the thermi type

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.080 
word anyway work with me the thermi type
basically<00:03:26.860> has<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.160> do<00:03:27.310> with<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.550> skin<00:03:27.880> the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
basically has to do with the skin the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.210 
basically has to do with the skin the
thermi<00:03:28.660> lift<00:03:28.930> we've<00:03:29.200> calling<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.740> more<00:03:29.950> for

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
thermi lift we've calling it more for

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.530 
thermi lift we've calling it more for
the<00:03:30.250> face<00:03:30.520> and<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:31.000> where<00:03:31.180> we<00:03:31.330> do<00:03:31.510> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
the face and this is where we do the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.140 
the face and this is where we do the
most<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.140> our<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:33.040> get<00:03:33.250> our<00:03:33.370> great<00:03:33.610> results

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
most of our and get our great results

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.610 
most of our and get our great results
and<00:03:34.330> then<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.930> thurmier

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
and then the thurmier

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.590 
and then the thurmier
you've<00:03:36.340> heard<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:36.760> some<00:03:36.790> individuals<00:03:37.540> that

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
you've heard of some individuals that

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.960 
you've heard of some individuals that
really<00:03:37.900> sweat<00:03:38.410> more<00:03:38.740> than<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.190> average<00:03:39.610> they

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
really sweat more than the average they

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.430 
really sweat more than the average they
are<00:03:40.030> changing<00:03:40.540> their<00:03:40.660> shirts<00:03:40.930> two<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.320> three

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
are changing their shirts two and three

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.740 
are changing their shirts two and three
times<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.830> day<00:03:41.970> they're<00:03:42.970> walking<00:03:43.450> around<00:03:43.660> very

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
times a day they're walking around very

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.570 
times a day they're walking around very
embarrassing<00:03:44.530> situations<00:03:45.100> they<00:03:45.220> always<00:03:45.430> have

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
embarrassing situations they always have

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.040 
embarrassing situations they always have
a<00:03:45.610> coat<00:03:45.790> on<00:03:45.850> even<00:03:46.480> though<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:46.900> know<00:03:47.020> very

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
a coat on even though it's you know very

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.400 
a coat on even though it's you know very
hot<00:03:47.440> out<00:03:47.620> well<00:03:48.250> we<00:03:48.430> can<00:03:48.610> essentially<00:03:49.030> use

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
hot out well we can essentially use

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.260 
hot out well we can essentially use
knockout<00:03:50.410> than<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.890> sweating<00:03:51.220> nerves<00:03:51.550> like

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
knockout than the sweating nerves like

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.480 
knockout than the sweating nerves like
with<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.720> with<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.170> sium<00:03:53.710> and/or<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.070> Botox

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
with the with the sium and/or the Botox

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.400 
with the with the sium and/or the Botox
but<00:03:54.670> we<00:03:54.790> can<00:03:54.940> use<00:03:55.150> this<00:03:55.360> radio<00:03:55.870> frequency

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
but we can use this radio frequency

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.500 
but we can use this radio frequency
device<00:03:56.710> to<00:03:57.250> get<00:03:57.400> them<00:03:57.490> potato-chip<00:03:58.090> for<00:03:58.270> up<00:03:58.360> to

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
device to get them potato-chip for up to

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.540 
device to get them potato-chip for up to
two<00:03:58.660> years<00:03:58.690> well<00:03:59.380> that's<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.590> big<00:03:59.770> deal<00:03:59.950> okay

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
two years well that's a big deal okay

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.210 
two years well that's a big deal okay
and<00:04:00.940> then<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.870> non-invasive<00:04:02.380> ones<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.130> are

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
and then the non-invasive ones that are

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.830 
and then the non-invasive ones that are
actually<00:04:03.550> coming<00:04:03.730> soon<00:04:04.090> here<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.510> thermy

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
actually coming soon here the thermy

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.960 
actually coming soon here the thermy
smooth<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.500> therm<00:04:05.740> evolve<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.460> once

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
smooth and the therm evolve and once

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.450 
smooth and the therm evolve and once
again<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.330> just<00:04:07.360> like<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:08.080> for<00:04:08.410> can<00:04:09.100> be<00:04:09.130> in

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
again is just like that is for can be in

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.790 
again is just like that is for can be in
conjunction<00:04:09.640> with<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.150> labiaplasty<00:04:10.650> but<00:04:11.650> it's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
conjunction with a labiaplasty but it's

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.020 
conjunction with a labiaplasty but it's
basically<00:04:12.130> for<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.520> tightening<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:13.000> the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
basically for the tightening of the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.730 
basically for the tightening of the
vaginal<00:04:13.090> vault<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.900> they<00:04:14.080> just<00:04:14.320> used<00:04:14.530> once

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
vaginal vault and they just used once

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.530 
vaginal vault and they just used once
again<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.220> same<00:04:15.430> things<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.060> causes<00:04:16.510> a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
again the same things and it causes a

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.479 
again the same things and it causes a
contraction<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.350> ball<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:17.890> of<00:04:18.250> course

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
contraction of the ball and of course

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.430 
contraction of the ball and of course
you<00:04:18.670> can<00:04:18.850> see<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.180> both<00:04:19.390> customer<00:04:20.260> and

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
you can see that both customer and

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.200 
you can see that both customer and
spouse<00:04:20.710> are<00:04:20.920> usually<00:04:21.190> very<00:04:21.370> happy<00:04:21.700> about<00:04:21.790> such

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
spouse are usually very happy about such

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.920 
spouse are usually very happy about such
things<00:04:22.240> like<00:04:22.600> that

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
things like that

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.140 
things like that
the<00:04:23.500> thermi<00:04:23.830> smooth<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.340> basically<00:04:24.700> using<00:04:24.970> a

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
the thermi smooth is basically using a

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.300 
the thermi smooth is basically using a
heated<00:04:25.510> device<00:04:25.840> where<00:04:26.410> we<00:04:26.560> actually<00:04:26.920> use<00:04:27.100> them

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
heated device where we actually use them

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.310 
heated device where we actually use them
more<00:04:27.490> around<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.910> eye<00:04:27.940> area<00:04:28.450> that<00:04:28.900> causes

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
more around the eye area that causes

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.590 
more around the eye area that causes
collagen<00:04:29.830> stimulation<00:04:30.460> without<00:04:31.240> even<00:04:31.480> going

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
collagen stimulation without even going

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.480 
collagen stimulation without even going
underneath<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.200> skin<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:32.770> works<00:04:32.890> really<00:04:33.250> well

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
underneath the skin it works really well

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.640 
underneath the skin it works really well
for<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.850> finer<00:04:34.270> skin<00:04:34.660> around<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.169> eyes<00:04:35.290> if

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
for the finer skin around the eyes if

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.659 
for the finer skin around the eyes if
you<00:04:35.770> will<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.280> we're<00:04:36.370> gonna<00:04:36.460> have<00:04:36.640> some

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
you will and we're gonna have some

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.290 
you will and we're gonna have some
pictures<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.360> show<00:04:37.419> you<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.810> next<00:04:38.470> one

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
pictures to show you that next one

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.470 
pictures to show you that next one
next<00:04:40.300> one<00:04:41.100> so<00:04:42.100> this<00:04:42.280> is<00:04:42.490> essentially<00:04:43.120> I'm

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
next one so this is essentially I'm

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.390 
next one so this is essentially I'm
going<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.990> give<00:04:44.140> you<00:04:44.230> a<00:04:44.260> motto<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.770> what<00:04:45.190> this

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
going to give you a motto of what this

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.950 
going to give you a motto of what this
works<00:04:45.640> so<00:04:45.760> this<00:04:45.970> is<00:04:46.090> going<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.330> be<00:04:46.420> your<00:04:46.600> skin

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
works so this is going to be your skin

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.800 
works so this is going to be your skin
right<00:04:47.350> here<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.920> on<00:04:48.490> here<00:04:49.000> these<00:04:49.420> are<00:04:49.690> these

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
right here and on here these are these

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.690 
right here and on here these are these
little<00:04:50.050> columns<00:04:50.560> of<00:04:50.680> what<00:04:50.800> we<00:04:50.920> call<00:04:51.130> septic

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
little columns of what we call septic

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.780 
little columns of what we call septic
now<00:04:52.360> imagine<00:04:53.050> if<00:04:53.170> you<00:04:53.200> will<00:04:53.530> if<00:04:53.800> we<00:04:54.340> basically

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
now imagine if you will if we basically

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.640 
now imagine if you will if we basically
ate<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.060> few<00:04:55.330> more<00:04:55.600> cheeseburgers<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.470> we<00:04:56.560> were

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
ate a few more cheeseburgers and we were

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.560 
ate a few more cheeseburgers and we were
supposed<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.460> all<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.610> a<00:04:57.760> sudden<00:04:57.790> the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
supposed to and all of a sudden the

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.200 
supposed to and all of a sudden the
thighs<00:04:58.810> got<00:04:59.230> a<00:04:59.260> little<00:04:59.590> bit<00:04:59.800> thicker<00:05:00.400> well

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
thighs got a little bit thicker well

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.660 
thighs got a little bit thicker well
what<00:05:01.390> happens<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:02.080> these<00:05:02.560> septae<00:05:03.160> are<00:05:03.430> going

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
what happens is these septae are going

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.030 
what happens is these septae are going
to<00:05:03.790> move<00:05:03.970> butts<00:05:04.450> or<00:05:04.840> stretch<00:05:05.110> put<00:05:05.350> so<00:05:05.560> much<00:05:05.770> and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
to move butts or stretch put so much and

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.350 
to move butts or stretch put so much and
then<00:05:06.190> they're<00:05:06.340> going<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.550> hang<00:05:06.760> on<00:05:06.970> just<00:05:07.210> like

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
then they're going to hang on just like

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.270 
then they're going to hang on just like
the<00:05:07.480> pins<00:05:07.750> on<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.080> cushion<00:05:08.500> this<00:05:08.920> is<00:05:09.100> where

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
the pins on the cushion this is where

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.480 
the pins on the cushion this is where
you<00:05:09.370> see<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.760> dimpling<00:05:10.270> when<00:05:10.750> people<00:05:11.050> call<00:05:11.260> it

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
you see the dimpling when people call it

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.920 
you see the dimpling when people call it
essentially<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.610> adipose<00:05:13.060> or<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.360> fat<00:05:13.570> but

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
essentially the adipose or the fat but

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.540 
essentially the adipose or the fat but
that's<00:05:14.170> essentially<00:05:14.680> what's<00:05:15.010> happening

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
that's essentially what's happening

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.030 
that's essentially what's happening
hence<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.360> lose<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.930> weight<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.350> get<00:05:17.710> less

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
hence you lose the weight you get less

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.500 
hence you lose the weight you get less
strain<00:05:18.430> or<00:05:18.640> pull<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.120> skin<00:05:19.360> from

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
strain or pull of the skin from

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.450 
strain or pull of the skin from
underneath<00:05:19.720> is<00:05:20.170> everybody<00:05:21.010> with<00:05:21.160> me<00:05:21.190> on<00:05:21.340> that

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
underneath is everybody with me on that

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.370 
underneath is everybody with me on that
and<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.270> reason<00:05:22.540> why<00:05:22.630> I<00:05:22.690> wanted<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.080> point

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
and the reason why I wanted to point

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.780 
and the reason why I wanted to point
this<00:05:23.530> out<00:05:23.710> because<00:05:23.920> this<00:05:24.190> is<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.400> very

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
this out because this is a very

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.020 
this out because this is a very
important<00:05:25.390> model<00:05:25.810> if<00:05:26.590> essentially<00:05:27.460> you<00:05:27.790> do

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
important model if essentially you do

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.380 
important model if essentially you do
the<00:05:28.420> the<00:05:29.140> thermy<00:05:29.500> tight<00:05:29.740> if<00:05:30.130> you<00:05:30.400> will<00:05:30.610> we<00:05:31.240> are

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
the the thermy tight if you will we are

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.170 
the the thermy tight if you will we are
running<00:05:31.660> this<00:05:32.140> small<00:05:32.590> little<00:05:33.010> probe<00:05:33.790> if<00:05:34.060> you

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
running this small little probe if you

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.900 
running this small little probe if you
will<00:05:34.440> how<00:05:35.440> big<00:05:35.680> is<00:05:35.830> it<00:05:35.860> if<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:36.490> would<00:05:36.670> take<00:05:36.700> a

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
will how big is it if you would take a

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.180 
will how big is it if you would take a
pen<00:05:37.300> a<00:05:37.540> ballpoint<00:05:38.050> pen<00:05:38.200> and<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.650> take<00:05:38.920> out<00:05:39.070> you

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
pen a ballpoint pen and you take out you

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.500 
pen a ballpoint pen and you take out you
know<00:05:39.310> that<00:05:39.490> little<00:05:39.700> tube<00:05:39.910> that<00:05:39.940> has<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.330> ink

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
know that little tube that has the ink

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.400 
know that little tube that has the ink
in<00:05:40.660> it<00:05:40.750> you're<00:05:40.930> talking<00:05:41.050> about<00:05:41.200> something

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
in it you're talking about something

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.350 
in it you're talking about something
that<00:05:41.560> small<00:05:42.040> actually<00:05:42.760> it's<00:05:43.030> a<00:05:43.090> little<00:05:43.270> bit

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
that small actually it's a little bit

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.030 
that small actually it's a little bit
small<00:05:43.630> in<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:43.960> so<00:05:44.440> it's<00:05:44.620> something<00:05:44.800> actually

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
small in it so it's something actually

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.909 
small in it so it's something actually
very<00:05:45.520> very<00:05:45.850> small<00:05:46.240> that<00:05:46.750> has<00:05:46.840> a<00:05:46.900> blunt<00:05:47.290> tip<00:05:47.710> on

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
very very small that has a blunt tip on

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.920 
very very small that has a blunt tip on
the<00:05:48.100> end<00:05:48.220> and<00:05:48.400> on<00:05:48.760> that<00:05:48.970> little<00:05:49.150> tip<00:05:49.540> where<00:05:49.810> you

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
the end and on that little tip where you

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.600 
the end and on that little tip where you
would<00:05:50.020> see<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.290> little<00:05:50.320> writing<00:05:50.890> part<00:05:51.340> of<00:05:51.490> it

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
would see the little writing part of it

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.540 
would see the little writing part of it
that<00:05:52.030> actually<00:05:52.419> has<00:05:52.660> the<00:05:53.590> radio<00:05:53.950> frequency

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
that actually has the radio frequency

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.580 
that actually has the radio frequency
device<00:05:54.850> on<00:05:55.120> that<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.540> essentially<00:05:56.290> what

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
device on that and essentially what

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.920 
device on that and essentially what
you're<00:05:56.740> doing<00:05:56.800> is<00:05:57.250> not<00:05:57.790> only<00:05:57.850> dividing<00:05:58.780> the

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
you're doing is not only dividing the

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.600 
you're doing is not only dividing the
septae<00:05:59.440> or<00:05:59.620> the<00:05:59.740> thing<00:05:59.919> that<00:06:00.040> would<00:06:00.160> hold<00:06:00.370> the

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
septae or the thing that would hold the

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.210 
septae or the thing that would hold the
skin<00:06:00.880> down<00:06:01.180> but<00:06:01.840> essentially<00:06:02.380> you're<00:06:02.770> drawing

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
skin down but essentially you're drawing

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.790 
skin down but essentially you're drawing
the<00:06:03.580> fat<00:06:04.169> excuse<00:06:05.169> me<00:06:05.260> you're<00:06:05.410> drawing<00:06:05.650> the

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
the fat excuse me you're drawing the

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.980 
the fat excuse me you're drawing the
skin<00:06:06.010> tighter<00:06:06.310> so<00:06:06.940> essentially<00:06:07.600> if<00:06:07.750> you<00:06:07.960> think

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
skin tighter so essentially if you think

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.530 
skin tighter so essentially if you think
of<00:06:08.500> you<00:06:08.650> as<00:06:08.890> a<00:06:08.919> bedspread<00:06:09.460> and<00:06:09.910> then<00:06:10.000> a<00:06:10.030> blanket

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
of you as a bedspread and then a blanket

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.600 
of you as a bedspread and then a blanket
if<00:06:10.660> we<00:06:11.050> tighten<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.560> bank<00:06:11.800> it<00:06:11.980> from<00:06:12.130> below<00:06:12.340> all

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
if we tighten the bank it from below all

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.100 
if we tighten the bank it from below all
of<00:06:12.700> a<00:06:12.760> sudden<00:06:13.030> the<00:06:13.120> bedspread<00:06:13.630> sits<00:06:13.900> a<00:06:14.020> little

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
of a sudden the bedspread sits a little

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.860 
of a sudden the bedspread sits a little
bit<00:06:14.260> nicer<00:06:14.860> on<00:06:14.890> top<00:06:15.250> does<00:06:15.669> that<00:06:15.790> make<00:06:15.940> sense<00:06:15.970> so

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
bit nicer on top does that make sense so

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.990 
bit nicer on top does that make sense so
the<00:06:17.020> great<00:06:17.290> thing<00:06:17.530> about<00:06:17.560> that<00:06:17.830> is<00:06:18.310> we<00:06:18.850> are

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
the great thing about that is we are

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.060 
the great thing about that is we are
dealing<00:06:19.330> with<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:20.050> collagen<00:06:20.680> and<00:06:20.860> the

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
dealing with the collagen and the

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.490 
dealing with the collagen and the
tightening<00:06:21.490> where<00:06:21.700> it<00:06:21.790> needs<00:06:22.000> to<00:06:22.120> be

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
tightening where it needs to be

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.960 
tightening where it needs to be
minimally<00:06:23.500> invasive<00:06:24.010> without<00:06:24.370> causing

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
minimally invasive without causing

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.930 
minimally invasive without causing
damage<00:06:25.390> to<00:06:25.419> the<00:06:25.570> skin
