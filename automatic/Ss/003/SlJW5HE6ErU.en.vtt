tricky attack power so he's a nice tank
a<00:04:02.100> beastie<00:04:03.530> let's<00:04:04.530> say<00:04:04.709> yeah<00:04:04.890> well<00:04:05.100> he's<00:04:05.519> alone

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
a beastie let's say yeah well he's alone

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.460 
a beastie let's say yeah well he's alone
and<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.030> column<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.780> can<00:04:06.930> attack<00:04:07.140> him<00:04:07.349> first

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
and a column you can attack him first

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.339 
and a column you can attack him first
for<00:04:07.680> 10k<00:04:08.300> then<00:04:09.300> attack<00:04:09.659> before<00:04:09.780> other<00:04:10.019> units

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
for 10k then attack before other units

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.570 
for 10k then attack before other units
oh<00:04:10.650> yeah<00:04:10.830> he's<00:04:11.040> just<00:04:11.099> there
