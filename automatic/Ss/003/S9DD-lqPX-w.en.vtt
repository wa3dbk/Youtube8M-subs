gen<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.119> i<00:02:00.360> don't<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.170> these<00:02:01.259> are<00:02:01.409> going<00:02:01.530> to

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
gen so i don't think these are going to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.620 
gen so i don't think these are going to
be<00:02:01.680> limited<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> next<00:02:02.640> gen<00:02:02.790> only<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.390> my

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
be limited to the next gen only but my

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.359 
be limited to the next gen only but my
viewpoint<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.409> is

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
viewpoint on this is

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.440 
viewpoint on this is
like<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.460> said<00:02:06.520> I'm<00:02:06.729> gonna<00:02:06.790> get<00:02:07.000> flack<00:02:07.210> for<00:02:07.390> this

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
like I said I'm gonna get flack for this

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.690 
like I said I'm gonna get flack for this
but<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:08.110> don't<00:02:08.440> think<00:02:08.619> heists<00:02:09.130> are<00:02:09.250> gonna<00:02:09.459> be

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
but I don't think heists are gonna be

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.919 
but I don't think heists are gonna be
all<00:02:09.910> they're<00:02:10.090> cracked<00:02:10.300> up<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.539> be<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:10.780> think

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
all they're cracked up to be I think

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.360 
all they're cracked up to be I think
after<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.380> month<00:02:11.650> or<00:02:11.739> two<00:02:11.800> people<00:02:12.099> are<00:02:12.280> gonna

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
after a month or two people are gonna

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.800 
after a month or two people are gonna
get<00:02:12.520> tired<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:13.030> them<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.360> they're<00:02:13.480> really<00:02:13.690> not

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
get tired of them and they're really not

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.930 
get tired of them and they're really not
going<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.200> fun<00:02:14.950> which<00:02:15.910> is

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
going to be that fun which is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.670 
going to be that fun which is
understandable<00:02:16.330> because<00:02:16.810> over<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> while<00:02:17.470> you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
understandable because over a while you

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.110 
understandable because over a while you
know<00:02:17.770> things<00:02:17.980> get<00:02:18.130> repetitive<00:02:18.430> things<00:02:18.910> get

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
know things get repetitive things get

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.449 
know things get repetitive things get
boring<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:19.870> overall<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.739> think<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.250> hype

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
boring but overall I think the hype

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.930 
boring but overall I think the hype
train<00:02:21.489> was<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> little<00:02:22.330> too<00:02:22.450> crazy<00:02:22.750> now<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
train was a little too crazy now for the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.059 
train was a little too crazy now for the
heist<00:02:25.209> release<00:02:25.930> date<00:02:26.200> being<00:02:26.470> or<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.890> heist

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
heist release date being or the heist

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.770 
heist release date being or the heist
being<00:02:27.340> delayed<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.940> stuff<00:02:28.180> like<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.390> I

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
being delayed and stuff like that I

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.510 
being delayed and stuff like that I
don't<00:02:29.260> necessarily<00:02:29.530> think<00:02:30.010> that's<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.370> bad

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
don't necessarily think that's a bad

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.610 
don't necessarily think that's a bad
thing<00:02:30.730> either<00:02:30.790> rockstar<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.660> taking<00:02:32.019> time<00:02:32.290> to

thing either rockstar is taking time to

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.370 
thing either rockstar is taking time to
develop<00:02:32.920> highs<00:02:33.269> kind<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.450> perfect<00:02:34.900> them<00:02:35.080> even

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
develop highs kind of perfect them even

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.360 
develop highs kind of perfect them even
though<00:02:35.500> they're<00:02:35.709> still<00:02:35.950> gonna<00:02:36.040> have<00:02:36.250> their
