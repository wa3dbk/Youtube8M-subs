00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello everyone, today we will do together 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.570
 ballistics of the leave this is the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.960
 recipe let's get gloves and let's get started 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.360
 I immediately use baking soda 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 which you can find as you know al 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.130
 supermarket and citric acid that 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 you will find these two from a novel 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.869
 powder together in one 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.340
 container and began to mix well 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.510
 the powders and each other 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.910
 just using your hands in another 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.969
 bowl in admitted rice starch or starch 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.370
 of corn and I choose as a big fragrance 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.610
 bubble but you can use the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.020
 fragrance that you prefer together 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.250
 same bowl and begin to 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.170
 mix fragrance and rice starch 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.079
 then we peck the rice starch and the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.770
 fragrance in the bica sodium blog and in the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.770
 citric acid 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.770
 and always mix everything well with 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.150
 hands use rice starch because 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.170
 should keep the fragrance more 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.300
 after which in another pebble bowl na 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.370
 use is not vegetable or in this case 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.840
 help start the oil to direct the sun but 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.870
 you can use the oil that 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.140
 prefer and go to fade inside 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.150
 the chosen friend I chose mica tato 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.170
 free fireflies of minerals that this 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.170
 Emerald 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.030
 after which I divide my compound into two 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.770
 leave because I want to do 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.770
 ballistic of two different colors 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.560
 in one of these I go to put it in fact 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 my green color 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.420
 in the other I will put instead pink and 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.210
 I'm always going to mix well with the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.260
 hands too all the dust will be 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.300
 homogeneous and now that everything is homogeneous 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.810
 I have to moisten my powder with 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.540
 good taste of alcohol let's start with 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.550
 ten pin ostriches that dust 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.070
 will become that gives me like sand 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.080
 wet when it has reached this 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:20.030
 consistency then it will be ready for use 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.270
 this tool I bought from Rome 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.340
 john to do ballistics exactly though 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.520
 if you don't have any, you can use your hands 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.640
 or you can use molds in 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.640
 silicone 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.160
 I collect all the dust and then go to 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.630
 press lightly on the holes 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.350
 tool and I leave mine 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.350
 ballistics 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.050
 here are my green perfumed ballistics 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.770
 of big babol while these are mine 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.890
 pink ballistic perfumes of monoi e 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.780
 they can be good of the last 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.090
 little thoughts for Christmas since there 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.270

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.640
