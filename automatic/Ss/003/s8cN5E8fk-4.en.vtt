other<00:00:51.570> videos<00:00:52.219> like<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:54.710> show<00:00:55.710> then<00:00:55.980> doing

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
other videos like they show then doing

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.429 
other videos like they show then doing
this<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.690> right<00:01:02.719> or<00:01:03.719> maybe<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
this they go here right or maybe a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.140 
this they go here right or maybe a
better<00:01:04.680> example<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.339> without<00:01:05.790> even<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
better example would be without even the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.580 
better example would be without even the
slide<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.540> my<00:01:06.659> foot<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.670> this

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.820 

right<00:01:13.590> now<00:01:16.070> there's<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.220> lot<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.520> things<00:01:17.729> that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
right now there's a lot of things that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.510 
right now there's a lot of things that
could<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.950> happened<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> windmill<00:01:20.970> okay

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
could have happened in the windmill okay

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.770 
could have happened in the windmill okay
so<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:24.150> gonna<00:01:24.330> go<00:01:24.479> ahead<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> start<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:26.780> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
so I'm gonna go ahead and start with the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
so I'm gonna go ahead and start with the
reason<00:01:28.110> why<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> might<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
reason why I might think this is the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.990 
reason why I might think this is the
majority<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.119> why<00:01:31.049> people<00:01:31.619> can't<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
majority of why people can't do a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.990 
majority of why people can't do a
continuous<00:01:33.479> after<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.530> round<00:01:35.000> supposed

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
continuous after that one round supposed

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.130 
continuous after that one round supposed
to<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.570> round<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
to be the one round they have so the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.130 
to be the one round they have so the
first<00:01:40.409> thing<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.740> might<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> fix<00:01:41.369> whoa<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.289 

okay<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.500> when<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.130> end<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.549> Reese<00:01:47.790> tabbing

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
okay so when you do end up Reese tabbing

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.270 
okay so when you do end up Reese tabbing
you<00:01:49.170> want<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> keep<00:01:49.649> your<00:01:49.860> head<00:01:50.040> low<00:01:50.280> okay<00:01:51.140> I

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
you want to keep your head low okay I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.530 
you want to keep your head low okay I
don't<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.430> remember<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.060> stated<00:01:54.329> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
don't really remember if I stated this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.219 
don't really remember if I stated this
in<00:01:54.689> my<00:01:54.810> tournament<00:01:55.290> or<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.810> go<00:01:57.930> Henry

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
in my tournament or but I just go Henry

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.600 
in my tournament or but I just go Henry
see<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.500> again<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> problem

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
see it again because it is a problem

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.830 
see it again because it is a problem
with<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:02.219> your<00:02:02.520> head<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:03.030> it's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
with this so if your head is up it's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.859 
with this so if your head is up it's
gonna<00:02:04.079> make<00:02:04.259> your<00:02:04.409> spine<00:02:04.860> want<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.310> tilt<00:02:05.549> down

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
gonna make your spine want to tilt down

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
gonna make your spine want to tilt down
which<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.020> gonna<00:02:07.200> make<00:02:07.350> your<00:02:07.590> feet<00:02:08.009> want<00:02:08.250> to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
which is gonna make your feet want to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.010 
which is gonna make your feet want to
point<00:02:08.520> down<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.970> they'll<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> probably<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
point down so they'll be a probably a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.059 
point down so they'll be a probably a
reason<00:02:10.319> why<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.530> flop<00:02:10.890> over

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
reason why you flop over

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.899

down all right and you can see a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:29.880 
down all right and you can see a
difference<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.909> here<00:02:22.090> we<00:02:22.180> go<00:02:27.329> right<00:02:28.680> okay<00:02:29.680> and

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
difference so here we go right okay and

this is the one with the head down
we'll<00:02:31.870> keep<00:02:32.049> my<00:02:32.200> body<00:02:32.379> level<00:02:32.829> so<00:02:33.400> give<00:02:33.700> me

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
we'll keep my body level so give me

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:43.619 
we'll keep my body level so give me
momentum<00:02:34.239> I'm<00:02:34.569> going<00:02:41.250> alright<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.549> don't<00:02:43.299> mind

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
momentum I'm going alright I don't mind

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.289 
momentum I'm going alright I don't mind
that<00:02:43.689> noise<00:02:43.930> I'll<00:02:44.200> just<00:02:44.409> might<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:45.790> acting

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
that noise I'll just might have acting

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.699 
that noise I'll just might have acting
up<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:48.389> if<00:02:49.389> you<00:02:49.450> keep<00:02:49.750> your<00:02:49.930> head<00:02:50.049> low<00:02:50.260> you'll

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
up so if you keep your head low you'll

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.379 
up so if you keep your head low you'll
have<00:02:50.919> momentum<00:02:51.280> still<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.970> keep<00:02:52.090> on<00:02:52.239> going

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
have momentum still to keep on going

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:58.619 
have momentum still to keep on going
alright<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.959> next<00:02:55.989> reason<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:57.700> you

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
alright the next reason that you

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.789 
alright the next reason that you
probably<00:02:58.900> don't<00:02:59.379> get<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.180> wrong<00:03:01.180> rotation<00:03:01.799> is

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
probably don't get the wrong rotation is

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.819 
probably don't get the wrong rotation is
that<00:03:03.099> you<00:03:03.549> guys<00:03:03.730> aren't<00:03:03.909> trying<00:03:04.150> really

that you guys aren't trying really

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.490 
that you guys aren't trying really
because<00:03:05.829> what<00:03:06.220> happens<00:03:06.609> is<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.870> guys<00:03:08.049> assume
