doesn't fall off or it doesn't rattle
around<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:49.050> what<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.320> topic<00:01:49.620> army<00:01:49.950> goes

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
around that's what the topic army goes

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.590 
around that's what the topic army goes
know<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:51.690> you<00:01:51.750> take<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:51.960> off<00:01:52.970> now<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.450> you

know when you take that off now all you
got<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.820> gun<00:01:59.090> okay<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
got right here is the gun okay the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
got right here is the gun okay the
capacitor<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.220> back<00:02:02.370> here

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
capacitor is going to be back here

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.460 
capacitor is going to be back here
inside<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.480> this<00:02:04.760> but<00:02:05.760> from<00:02:05.970> this<00:02:06.120> view

inside of this but from this view
quantum<00:02:07.470> let's<00:02:07.650> put<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:07.920> back<00:02:08.190> tighten<00:02:08.819> this

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
quantum let's put this back tighten this

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.420 
quantum let's put this back tighten this
up<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.269> it's<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.479> moving<00:02:09.750> around<00:02:10.190> from<00:02:11.190> this
