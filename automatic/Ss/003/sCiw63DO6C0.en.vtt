nothing<00:01:56.560> really<00:01:56.740> very<00:01:56.859> complicated<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.759> the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
nothing really very complicated in the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.510 
nothing really very complicated in the
construction<00:01:58.979> works<00:01:59.979> very<00:02:00.219> well<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:02.520> natural

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
construction works very well the natural

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.749

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
flexibility the lexan tends to mean that

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.670 
flexibility the lexan tends to mean that
there's<00:02:09.610> no<00:02:09.789> rattles<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:11.110> window<00:02:11.530> always
