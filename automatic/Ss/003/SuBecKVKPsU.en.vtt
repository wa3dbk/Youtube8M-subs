00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
halibuts pole axes and so on so I

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.549 
halibuts pole axes and so on so I
thought<00:00:12.630> I'd<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:12.870> say<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> little<00:00:13.290> bit<00:00:13.500> about

generally in European sources is shown

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.840 
generally in European sources is shown
to<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.570> about<00:00:30.840> seven<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:31.560> eight<00:00:31.740> feet<00:00:32.040> long<00:00:32.369> so

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
to be about seven or eight feet long so

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.580 
to be about seven or eight feet long so
one<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> guys<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.780> Jorge<00:00:34.050> Silva<00:00:34.230> gives

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
one of the guys that Jorge Silva gives

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
one of the guys that Jorge Silva gives
is<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.860> put<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.160> hand<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.870> as<00:00:36.870> far<00:00:37.170> as

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
is you put your hand up and as far as

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
is you put your hand up and as far as
you<00:00:37.469> can<00:00:37.590> reach<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> top<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> with

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
you can reach up to the top of it with

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.530 
you can reach up to the top of it with
your<00:00:39.059> hand

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
your hand

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.000 
your hand
that's<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> neck<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that's about the neck that you want to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.729 
that's about the neck that you want to
record<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.430> stuff<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.149> me<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.870> guess<00:00:43.469> that's

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
record to stuff so for me I guess that's

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.340 
record to stuff so for me I guess that's
probably<00:00:44.160> about<00:00:44.570> seven<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> half<00:00:45.780> feet<00:00:45.870> or

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
probably about seven and a half feet or

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.110 
probably about seven and a half feet or
something<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:48.870> terms<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.530> spears

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
something like that in terms of spears

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.610 
something like that in terms of spears
there<00:00:51.120> seem<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.480> hitting<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> high<00:00:52.379> middle

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
there seem to hitting the high middle

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
there seem to hitting the high middle
ages<00:00:52.710> being<00:00:53.219> two<00:00:53.460> types<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.820> spam<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
short spear in a long spear there were

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.610 
short spear in a long spear there were
plates<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.660> I've<00:00:57.809> talked<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:58.050> those<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.440> a

second and so long Spears seem to have

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.299 
second and so long Spears seem to have
usually<00:01:02.250> been<00:01:02.719> about<00:01:03.890> what<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.010> talking<00:01:05.280> about

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
advance on foot and this is interesting

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.270 
advance on foot and this is interesting
for<00:01:30.509> those<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.810> us<00:01:30.930> who<00:01:31.110> study<00:01:31.350> fury<00:01:31.770> because

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
for those of us who study fury because

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.190 
for those of us who study fury because
in<00:01:32.430> Furai<00:01:32.729> he<00:01:32.970> specifically<00:01:33.360> refers<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
in Furai he specifically refers to the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.770 
in Furai he specifically refers to the
the<00:01:34.590> short<00:01:34.920> spear<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.210> spear<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.509> he

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the short spear and the spear that he

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.359 
the short spear and the spear that he
shows<00:01:37.020> being<00:01:37.350> used<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> actually<00:01:37.920> only<00:01:38.280> about

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
shows being used is actually only about

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.960 
shows being used is actually only about
as<00:01:39.299> tall<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.009> say<00:01:41.250> six<00:01:41.549> six

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
as tall as here so you know say six six

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.280 
as tall as here so you know say six six
feet<00:01:42.210> or<00:01:42.570> probably<00:01:43.259> less<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.770> his<00:01:43.920> case<00:01:44.189> um<00:01:45.290> so

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
feet or probably less in his case um so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380 
feet or probably less in his case um so
there<00:01:47.070> was<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> short<00:01:47.490> spear<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.270> was<00:01:48.360> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
there was a short spear and there was a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.990 
there was a short spear and there was a
long<00:01:48.600> spear<00:01:49.520> what's<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> difference

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
long spear what's the difference

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.240 
long spear what's the difference
generally<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.570> seems<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.899> short<00:01:52.200> Spears<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
generally it seems that short Spears and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
of course is the pole axe so you could

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.620 
of course is the pole axe so you could

course it's a relatively short weapon so
you<00:02:58.570> want<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.840> be<00:02:58.959> able<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.200> turn<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.340> around
