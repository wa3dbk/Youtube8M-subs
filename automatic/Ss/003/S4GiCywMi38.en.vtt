00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:25.389 
will go over the wrinkles so there's the

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:27.629 
will go over the wrinkles so there's the
two<00:01:25.539> different<00:01:25.869> variations<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.499> cheek<00:01:27.340> and

two different variations of cheek and
cheekbone<00:01:28.569> the<00:01:29.159> next<00:01:30.159> way<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.729> apply<00:01:31.029> it<00:01:31.090> in

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
cheekbone the next way is to apply it in

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.289 
cheekbone the next way is to apply it in
a<00:01:31.899> straight<00:01:32.319> line<00:01:32.619> across<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.819> face<00:01:34.029> you're

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
gonna go horizontally with this this is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.440 
gonna go horizontally with this this is
gives<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.840> illusion<00:01:38.139> of<00:01:38.499> it<00:01:39.459> can<00:01:39.670> widen<00:01:40.270> a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
gives the illusion of it can widen a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.080 
gives the illusion of it can widen a
very<00:01:40.749> very<00:01:41.020> narrow<00:01:41.289> face<00:01:41.740> it's<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.579> very<00:01:42.759> subtle

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090

of<00:01:47.349> hint<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.799> color<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.700> you've<00:01:48.819> just<00:01:48.999> been

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
of hint of color that you've just been

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.699 
of hint of color that you've just been
out<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.509> Sun<00:01:49.779> but<00:01:50.109> we'll<00:01:50.289> show<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:50.590> that

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
out of the Sun but we'll show you that

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:51.779 
out of the Sun but we'll show you that
in<00:01:50.889> a<00:01:51.189> second

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
in a second

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.529 
in a second
so<00:01:52.179> this<00:01:52.359> widens<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.959> face<00:01:53.169> ever<00:01:53.499> so<00:01:53.740> slightly

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
so this widens the face ever so slightly

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.120 
so this widens the face ever so slightly
the<00:01:55.539> next<00:01:55.840> way<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.259> this<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.859> one<00:01:57.009> of<00:01:57.039> my

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
the next way and this is one of my

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.819 
the next way and this is one of my
favorites<00:01:57.609> is<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:58.029> apply<00:01:58.179> it<00:01:58.299> just<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.740> the

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
favorites is to apply it just to the

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.059 
favorites is to apply it just to the
cheekbone<00:02:00.249> area<00:02:00.279> in<00:02:00.939> an<00:02:01.719> arc<00:02:02.079> as<00:02:02.439> you<00:02:02.679> can<00:02:02.829> see

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
cheekbone area in an arc as you can see

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.669 
cheekbone area in an arc as you can see
and<00:02:03.310> then<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.849> temple<00:02:04.359> side<00:02:04.810> this<00:02:05.439> gives

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
and then to the temple side this gives

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.190 
and then to the temple side this gives
the<00:02:05.799> illusion<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.489> a<00:02:06.999> very<00:02:07.179> lifted<00:02:07.630> face<00:02:07.899> it's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the illusion of a very lifted face it's

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.570 
the illusion of a very lifted face it's
one<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.470> my<00:02:08.530> favourite<00:02:08.950> ways<00:02:09.069> of<00:02:09.340> applying

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
one of my favourite ways of applying

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.970 
one of my favourite ways of applying
blush<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.239> then<00:02:10.780> I'm<00:02:10.869> gonna<00:02:11.080> go<00:02:11.230> over<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.800> with

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
blush and then I'm gonna go over it with

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.670 
blush and then I'm gonna go over it with
a<00:02:12.040> buffing<00:02:12.520> brush<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:13.450> blend<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.440> is

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
a buffing brush to blend that in this is

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.230 
a buffing brush to blend that in this is
great<00:02:14.980> if<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.340> want<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.730> give<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.000> illusion

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
great if you want to give the illusion

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.850 
great if you want to give the illusion
that<00:02:16.600> you've<00:02:16.720> been<00:02:16.840> out<00:02:16.960> in<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> Sun<00:02:17.470> because

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
that you've been out in the Sun because

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.600 
that you've been out in the Sun because
you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.550 
you
a<00:02:18.640> tiny<00:02:19.060> hint<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.450> sunburn<00:02:19.960> when<00:02:20.170> used<00:02:20.380> with<00:02:20.530> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
a tiny hint of sunburn when used with a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.220 
a tiny hint of sunburn when used with a
red<00:02:20.800> blush<00:02:21.130> over<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> bronzer<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.450> really<00:02:23.050> like

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
red blush over a bronzer I really like

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.990 
red blush over a bronzer I really like
this<00:02:23.470> way<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.950> very<00:02:24.000> old-fashioned

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
this way it's a very old-fashioned

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.210 
this way it's a very old-fashioned
technique<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.440> still<00:02:26.800> tend<00:02:27.070> to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
technique but one that I still tend to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.700 
technique but one that I still tend to
favor<00:02:27.460> I'll<00:02:27.790> be<00:02:27.910> honest<00:02:28.180> with<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.680> make<00:02:29.680> sure

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
favor I'll be honest with you make sure

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.280 
favor I'll be honest with you make sure
that<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.130> blend<00:02:30.250> everything<00:02:30.490> in<00:02:30.820> really<00:02:31.060> well

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that you blend everything in really well

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.580 
that you blend everything in really well
there<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.380> go<00:02:32.790> okay

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
there you go okay

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.460 
there you go okay
this<00:02:35.590> way<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.700> apply<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.090> straight<00:02:37.450> down<00:02:37.900> and

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
this way you apply it straight down and

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.020 
this way you apply it straight down and
you're<00:02:38.770> going<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> go<00:02:39.100> with<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.370> blush<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.850> a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
you're going to go with the blush in a

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.030 
you're going to go with the blush in a
downward<00:02:40.570> motion<00:02:40.810> don't<00:02:41.260> smile<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.860> this

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
downward motion don't smile with this

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.830 
downward motion don't smile with this
you're<00:02:42.250> applying<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:42.640> just<00:02:42.850> underneath<00:02:43.210> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
you're applying it just underneath the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.020 
you're applying it just underneath the
kind<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.320> outside<00:02:44.950> portion<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.580> eye<00:02:45.610> and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
kind of outside portion of the eye and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.390 
kind of outside portion of the eye and
blending<00:02:46.780> down<00:02:46.990> this<00:02:47.620> can<00:02:47.920> give<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.250> illusion

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
blending down this can give the illusion

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.710 
blending down this can give the illusion
of<00:02:49.740> widening<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.950> very<00:02:51.280> very<00:02:51.520> narrow<00:02:51.760> face<00:02:52.180> so

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
of widening a very very narrow face so

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.290 
of widening a very very narrow face so
it's<00:02:52.900> one<00:02:53.110> way<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.320> doing<00:02:53.770> this<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:55.060> make<00:02:55.270> sure

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
it's one way of doing this and make sure

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.400 
it's one way of doing this and make sure
that<00:02:55.600> when<00:02:55.750> you've<00:02:55.870> done<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.380> then

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
that when you've done that you then

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.930 
that when you've done that you then
blend<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:56.920> out<00:02:57.040> with<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.280> separate<00:02:57.670> brush

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
blend it out with a separate brush

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.970 
blend it out with a separate brush
because<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.480> don't<00:02:58.660> want<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.440> know<00:02:59.560> downward

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
because you don't want you know downward

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.120 
because you don't want you know downward
strokes<00:03:00.310> always<00:03:00.970> blend<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.680> five

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
strokes always blend and that is five

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.280 
strokes always blend and that is five
