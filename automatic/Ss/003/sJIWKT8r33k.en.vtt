00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
on and lets it go and that's how he

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.820 
on and lets it go and that's how he
flies<00:02:19.459> which<00:02:20.459> is<00:02:20.610> cool<00:02:21.080> he<00:02:22.080> spends<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.590> lot

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
flies which is cool he spends a lot

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.110 
flies which is cool he spends a lot
you'll<00:02:23.069> see<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.220> lot<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.430> pictures<00:02:23.640> with<00:02:23.790> Thor

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
you'll see a lot of pictures with Thor

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.729 
you'll see a lot of pictures with Thor
because<00:02:24.599> there's<00:02:24.810> there's<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.049> strap<00:02:25.409> on<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
because there's there's a strap on the

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.500 
because there's there's a strap on the
bottom<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.129> handle<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.549> he<00:02:26.909> spins<00:02:27.299> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
bottom of the handle and he spins it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.910 
bottom of the handle and he spins it
which<00:02:27.659> is<00:02:27.780> kind<00:02:28.049> of<00:02:28.170> strange<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.650> wouldn't

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
which is kind of strange you wouldn't

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.320 
which is kind of strange you wouldn't
think<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.159> would<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.519> how<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> hammer<00:02:29.909> is<00:02:30.090> used

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
think that would be how a hammer is used

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.530 
think that would be how a hammer is used
but<00:02:30.930> he<00:02:31.049> does<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.440> quite<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.709> bit<00:02:32.420> or<00:02:33.420> I'll

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
but he does that quite a bit or I'll

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.650 
but he does that quite a bit or I'll
spin<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.840> like<00:02:33.870> over<00:02:34.260> his<00:02:34.379> head<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:36.239> there's<00:02:36.599> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
spin it like over his head it there's a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.180 
spin it like over his head it there's a
lot<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.930> covers<00:02:37.349> with<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.709> spinning<00:02:38.099> his

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
lot of covers with for spinning his

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.839 
lot of covers with for spinning his
hammer<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.560> said<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.860> don't<00:02:41.129> know<00:02:41.519> for

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
hammer and like I said I don't know for

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.369 
hammer and like I said I don't know for
sure<00:02:41.879> if<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.360> gives<00:02:42.480> him<00:02:42.629> filthiest<00:02:42.989> Thunder

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
sure if it gives him filthiest Thunder

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.110 
sure if it gives him filthiest Thunder
powers<00:02:43.739> but<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.790> believe<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.480> does<00:02:45.659> um<00:02:47.120> because

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
powers but I believe it does um because

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.270 
powers but I believe it does um because
i'm<00:02:48.269> not<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> huge<00:02:48.599> floor<00:02:48.900> fan<00:02:49.079> but<00:02:49.230> uh<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.769> i<00:02:49.950> do
