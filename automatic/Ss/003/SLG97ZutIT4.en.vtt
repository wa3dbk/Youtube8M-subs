00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.800
 of a military plane and catch the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.780

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.850
 three medals you know we have to take out 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.400
 the gold obviously and we have to 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.710

 remember that you use social networks 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.760
 and the channel is very important so that 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.200
 learn about each video facing the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.149
