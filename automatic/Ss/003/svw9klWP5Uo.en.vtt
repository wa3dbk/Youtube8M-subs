00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.650
 in this rum and this map makes it not 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.219
 I played like five centuries basically 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.219
 are you going to shoot or not 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.410
 and this map really did not do it 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.599
 played millennia or so much that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.970
 will create the world of truth like this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.430
 the dimension in which we live I 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.870
 I still did not play this be good no 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.950
 I played it before it was created better 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.390
 said when I turn on gender I'm 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.920
 saying when he arrived razor dale cane 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.850
 see if we manage to win I have five 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.460
 miserable blocks 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.719
 I believe that with these 50 blocks for very 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.719
 miserable that it is I believe that my age 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.950
 to get here look he gives me to 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.350
 get to call him 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.840
 wanda I was burned that I 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.329
 I fried the flipo a color not 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.480
 burned but but but I know that I find 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.640
 something incredible is incredible to admire 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.399
 and analyze scientifically because I 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.880
 I die that I die that I die 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.880
 what did 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.890
 In view of guys sometimes I have a 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.890
 small problem 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.580
 is the shaqiri cow or the tripods 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.210
 several times 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.210
 Well, it appears to us that this man 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.159
 we want to put it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.200
 from here below we have advantage guys 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.540
 really from here below we have 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.820
 advantage 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 Be careful with your parents a lot of 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.590
 chew 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.590
 there 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.030
 the limit is touched 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.890
 good indeed that this happens 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.880
 incredibly madryn and as we have 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.900
 played with the death limit in a 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.900
 play really death 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.920
 but I'm very sorry for you several 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.290
 how to make a real team 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.040
 so he would have me put a block for 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.040
 jump position 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.489
 very important very important to me 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.640
 daily life 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.540
 it is therefore put by uruguay of a 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.790
 there's the moon team and I think it's 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.680
 rather than because the lava is worth 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.290
 because I had not caught for my fault 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:01.010
 we have it quite hungry of rock and 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.010
 I think that rock I'm so 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.830
 and now the big question of where 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.069
 cojones came out would be ethical 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.959
 and I have because the roses really 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.630
 it does not contain another swear, it also prevented 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.860
 always always does not always know is 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.569
 a word that is quite strong 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.330
 because it always means you always know 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.550
 one hundred percent because I have none 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.840
 date 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:33.489
 because if I do not stay, we are not 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.489
 we are not here to fight for an eye 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.510
 I do not know why 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.409
 it's good this very strange thing sometimes 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.620
 you fall the world fell down here up 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.620
 already 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.100
 together not please people people 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.990
 I mean, I think we can confirm what 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:09.800
 that just happened here and a little bit 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.940
 of pineapple broken islands dissipating 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.920
 I'm freaking out too much in this 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.250
 really kind game really good 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.470
 we have two blocks we do not get to 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.959
 miracle this guy is a kamikaze this 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.840
 uncle is breaking everything basically like this 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.840
 that God makes fixed defense bridge 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.900
 good 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.460
 I do not get out of here 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.170
 it gives me what my heart stops 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.170
 something in plan that I stay grated 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.700
 the nÃ stic or today I saw everything together today 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.280
 everything comes together 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.150
 also in another kamikaze look what you knew 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.740
 damn hacker come for your house 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.520
 first if you pass for offered by 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.520
 fucking hackers 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:08.080
 totally that they do not have this that when 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.249
 you hit it back or when it hits you 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.439
 someone because you back up 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.520
 contrary to which is stuck then 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.469
 because hackers do not have it 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.029
 so much so that you do not either 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:18.270
 another kamikaze do not skip me plans anymore 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.270
 crazy 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:30.980
 and he went on to shoot a little before 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.300
 food 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.040
 this part has been a bit is already all 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.910
 You have to say everything, you have to admit it 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.460
 because I have hurt now being there and 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.790
 there we have a pretty hard team 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.790
 mind 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.080
 hop 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:01.520

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.220
 to do this the truth that 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.090
 what do you think they are really 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.910
 complicated thing 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.610
 nigga with everything 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.650
 you have to admit that nothing says that at 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:22.040
 final lie and everything 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.620
 on top of this while here you have to 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.790
 take advantage of the technique of dismissal that 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.479
 look you have to try to endure here 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.479

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.189
 Pring removes removes removes removes 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.189
 we remove the hips 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.119
 we must take advantage of the confusion 

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:42.159
 clueless we have had under a titan and 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:44.259

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.179
 sausage is a hot dog is every 

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:54.179
 Once we have tightened 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.450
 OK 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.450
 the technique is going to be 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:10.259
 m 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.050
