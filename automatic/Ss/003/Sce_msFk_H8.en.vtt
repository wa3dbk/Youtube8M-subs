about<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.270> third<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> weight

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.670 

okay<00:01:09.250> now<00:01:09.910> in<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.450> bottom<00:01:10.900> right<00:01:11.290> hand<00:01:11.320> corner

okay now in the bottom right hand corner

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.370 
okay now in the bottom right hand corner
of<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.670> square<00:01:14.550> draw<00:01:15.930> you're<00:01:16.930> going<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.200> draw

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
of the square draw you're going to draw

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.540 
of the square draw you're going to draw
a<00:01:17.530> triangle<00:01:17.920> but<00:01:18.700> it's<00:01:19.120> going<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.540> be<00:01:20.550> it's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
a triangle but it's going to be it's

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.820 
a triangle but it's going to be it's
going<00:01:21.760> to<00:01:21.850> have<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.210> ninety<00:01:22.690> degree<00:01:22.870> angle<00:01:23.620> in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
going to have a ninety degree angle in

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.140 
going to have a ninety degree angle in
the<00:01:24.280> corner<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:24.880> dry<00:01:25.660> backwards<00:01:26.230> L<00:01:26.500> in<00:01:27.430> the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
the corner so dry backwards L in the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.850 
the corner so dry backwards L in the
right<00:01:28.330> right<00:01:28.990> hand<00:01:29.170> corner<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:31.860> connect

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
right right hand corner and then connect

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.760 
right right hand corner and then connect
the<00:01:33.160> top<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.580> bottom<00:01:33.910> on<00:01:34.270> an<00:01:34.420> angle<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.680> it

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
the top and bottom on an angle so it

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.910 
the top and bottom on an angle so it
makes<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:36.040> triangle<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:40.630> two<00:01:41.020> sides

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
makes a triangle and on your two sides

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.730 
makes a triangle and on your two sides
that<00:01:42.220> made<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.610> ninety<00:01:42.970> degree<00:01:43.000> angle<00:01:43.740> inside

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
that made the ninety degree angle inside

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.170 
that made the ninety degree angle inside
on<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.850> bottom<00:01:46.270> edge<00:01:47.130> put<00:01:48.130> inside<00:01:48.790> the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
on the bottom edge put inside the

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:57.510 
on the bottom edge put inside the
triangle<00:01:49.420> draw<00:01:50.320> three<00:01:50.920> stars<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:57.190> let's

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
triangle draw three stars so let's

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.280 
triangle draw three stars so let's
compare

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.880 

so<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:07.650> you<00:02:07.860> reflect<00:02:08.990> if<00:02:09.990> each<00:02:10.320> of<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.679> can

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so if you reflect if each of you can

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.260 
so if you reflect if each of you can
reflect<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.520> what<00:02:11.760> some<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.240> challenges

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
reflect on what some of the challenges

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.270 
reflect on what some of the challenges
were<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.410> both<00:02:13.980> giving<00:02:14.370> directions<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.200> in

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
were in both giving directions and in

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.500 
were in both giving directions and in
listening<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.460> directions<00:02:17.610> when<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.240> can't

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
listening to directions when you can't

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:50.030 
listening to directions when you can't
ask<00:02:18.780> questions<00:02:40.700> circle<00:02:42.680> okay<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.650> guess<00:02:49.830> I

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
ask questions circle okay and I guess I

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.780 
ask questions circle okay and I guess I
wasn't<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.810> wasn't<00:02:51.810> clear<00:02:52.110> about<00:02:52.430> whether<00:02:53.430> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
wasn't I wasn't clear about whether the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.120 
wasn't I wasn't clear about whether the
will<00:02:54.390> obviously<00:02:54.630> whether<00:02:54.989> they're<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
will obviously whether they're the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.470 
will obviously whether they're the
shapes<00:02:56.370> were<00:02:56.520> actually<00:02:56.790> connected<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
shapes were actually connected to the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.180 
shapes were actually connected to the
outside<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.110> box<00:02:58.350> or<00:02:58.680> if<00:02:58.770> they<00:02:58.860> were<00:02:58.920> within

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
outside the box or if they were within

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.630 
outside the box or if they were within
it<00:02:59.489> I<00:03:00.590> should<00:03:01.590> have<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.830> look<00:03:02.010> now<00:03:02.220> looking<00:03:02.580> at

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
it I should have a look now looking at

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
it I should have a look now looking at
yours<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.880> realize<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.180> should<00:03:03.330> have<00:03:03.420> been<00:03:03.510> more

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
yours I realize I should have been more

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.780 
yours I realize I should have been more
clear<00:03:03.780> about<00:03:04.590> that

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.699 

and<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:10.540> should<00:03:10.720> have<00:03:10.750> also<00:03:10.989> looking<00:03:11.439> at<00:03:11.530> yours

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
and I should have also looking at yours

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.110 
and I should have also looking at yours
and<00:03:11.920> comparing<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.549> one<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.849> should<00:03:13.030> have

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
and comparing this one I should have

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.699 
and comparing this one I should have
told<00:03:13.269> us<00:03:13.360> because<00:03:13.689> I<00:03:13.780> told<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.079> on<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.470> one

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
told us because I told you on this one

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.050 
told us because I told you on this one
but<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.010> didn't<00:03:15.340> tell<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.640> here<00:03:15.909> which

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
but I didn't tell you here which

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:25.100 
but I didn't tell you here which
direction<00:03:17.849> yeah

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110

from<00:03:26.110> your<00:03:26.260> perspective<00:03:26.620> what<00:03:26.980> did<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.519> feel

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
from your perspective what did you feel

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.880 
from your perspective what did you feel
was<00:03:27.879> challenging<00:03:29.430> um

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
was challenging um

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.300 
was challenging um
just<00:03:32.890> finding<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.879> right<00:03:34.000> words<00:03:34.420> without

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
just finding the right words without

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.410 
just finding the right words without
well<00:03:36.310> because<00:03:36.670> for<00:03:36.879> one<00:03:36.970> thing<00:03:37.000> with<00:03:37.269> the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
well because for one thing with the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.319 
well because for one thing with the
triangle<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.290> couldn't<00:03:38.680> remember<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.370> name<00:03:40.150> of

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
triangle I couldn't remember the name of

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:48.539 
triangle I couldn't remember the name of
that<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:45.760> wanted<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.780> use<00:03:46.989> my<00:03:47.400> hands<00:03:48.400> like

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
that and I wanted to use my hands like

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.369 
that and I wanted to use my hands like
as<00:03:48.760> I'm<00:03:48.970> talking<00:03:49.359> about<00:03:49.569> and<00:03:49.810> doing<00:03:50.049> an<00:03:50.139> air

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
as I'm talking about and doing an air

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.149 
as I'm talking about and doing an air
drying<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:52.540> so<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.139> was<00:03:53.260> hard<00:03:53.500> not<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:54.010> do

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
drying and so that it was hard not to do

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.119 
drying and so that it was hard not to do
that<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.519> yeah<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.049> would<00:03:56.200> think<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.590> like

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
that and yeah like I would think of like

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.009 
that and yeah like I would think of like
talking<00:03:57.849> about<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.120> direction<00:03:58.269> of<00:03:58.750> certain

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
talking about the direction of certain

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.839 
talking about the direction of certain
things<00:03:59.049> I<00:03:59.500> would<00:03:59.920> only<00:04:00.129> think<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.459> doing<00:04:00.609> that

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
things I would only think of doing that

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.119 
things I would only think of doing that
half<00:04:01.090> way<00:04:01.239> through<00:04:01.269> me<00:04:01.569> Tory's<00:04:01.840> finished<00:04:02.129> part

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
half way through me Tory's finished part

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.759 
half way through me Tory's finished part
of<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.340> drawing<00:04:03.609> and<00:04:03.879> and<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.450> probably<00:04:05.319> doing

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
of the drawing and and so probably doing

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:06.869 
of the drawing and and so probably doing
it<00:04:05.829> again<00:04:06.069> it<00:04:06.190> would<00:04:06.280> be<00:04:06.340> different<00:04:06.819> because

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
it again it would be different because

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.490 
it again it would be different because
there<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.359> could<00:04:07.629> think<00:04:07.780> about<00:04:07.900> those<00:04:08.260> things

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
there I could think about those things

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.399 
there I could think about those things
now<00:04:08.680> but<00:04:08.859> it's<00:04:09.310> challenging<00:04:09.909> I<00:04:10.389> think<00:04:10.930> if<00:04:11.260> it

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
now but it's challenging I think if it

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.140 
now but it's challenging I think if it
was<00:04:11.500> another<00:04:12.069> language<00:04:12.310> other<00:04:12.639> than<00:04:12.730> English

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
was another language other than English

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.970 
was another language other than English
for<00:04:13.359> me<00:04:13.450> especially<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.989> would<00:04:14.079> be<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.709> lot<00:04:14.859> of

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
for me especially it would be a lot of

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.150 
for me especially it would be a lot of
circumlocution<00:04:15.910> trying<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.329> figure<00:04:16.900> out<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
circumlocution trying to figure out the

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.670 
circumlocution trying to figure out the
best<00:04:18.340> way<00:04:18.579> of<00:04:18.609> trying<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.120> tell<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:20.049> how<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.440> do

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
best way of trying to tell you how to do

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.670 
best way of trying to tell you how to do
it<00:04:22.949> so<00:04:23.949> this<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.699> obviously<00:04:25.120> an<00:04:26.050> activity<00:04:26.470> for

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
it so this is obviously an activity for

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.409 
it so this is obviously an activity for
more<00:04:27.010> advanced<00:04:27.340> second<00:04:27.729> language<00:04:28.060> learners

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
more advanced second language learners

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.050 
more advanced second language learners
but<00:04:28.750> it's<00:04:29.289> also<00:04:29.500> an<00:04:29.770> activity<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.550> helps<00:04:30.820> you

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
but it's also an activity that helps you

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.390 
but it's also an activity that helps you
as<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.180> teacher<00:04:31.860> become<00:04:32.860> aware<00:04:33.130> of<00:04:33.190> the

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
as a teacher become aware of the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.520 
as a teacher become aware of the
importance<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.780> instructions<00:04:35.349> that<00:04:35.410> you

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
importance of the instructions that you

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.029 
importance of the instructions that you
give<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.270> when<00:04:37.270> you<00:04:37.479> take<00:04:37.810> away<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:38.800> ability

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
give and when you take away that ability

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.300 
give and when you take away that ability
to<00:04:39.580> move<00:04:39.729> your<00:04:39.789> hands<00:04:40.389> or<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:41.260> see<00:04:41.650> what<00:04:42.160> the

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
to move your hands or to see what the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
to move your hands or to see what the
students<00:04:42.729> are<00:04:42.880> doing<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.960> have<00:04:44.320> less

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
students are doing you have less

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.900 
students are doing you have less
information<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.930> correct<00:04:47.590> or<00:04:47.949> clarify<00:04:48.610> and

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
information to correct or clarify and

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.469 
information to correct or clarify and
can<00:04:49.389> only<00:04:49.630> rely<00:04:50.080> on<00:04:50.110> yourself<00:04:50.729> however<00:04:51.729> even

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
can only rely on yourself however even

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.529 
can only rely on yourself however even
if<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:53.500> have<00:04:53.740> access<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.789> your

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
if you have access to that your

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.300 
if you have access to that your
instructions<00:04:56.169> can<00:04:56.409> still<00:04:56.650> be<00:04:56.770> interpreted

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
instructions can still be interpreted

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.000 
instructions can still be interpreted
differently<00:04:57.340> by<00:04:57.909> different<00:04:58.270> people<00:04:58.830> if<00:04:59.830> we

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
differently by different people if we

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.920 
differently by different people if we
were<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.340> do<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.699> same<00:05:00.970> activity<00:05:01.659> and<00:05:01.780> we<00:05:01.870> were

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
were to do the same activity and we were

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.350 
were to do the same activity and we were
to<00:05:02.020> have<00:05:02.199> another<00:05:02.590> student<00:05:03.070> here<00:05:03.610> but<00:05:04.210> you

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
to have another student here but you

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.689 
to have another student here but you
could<00:05:04.539> still<00:05:04.810> be<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.080> teacher<00:05:05.320> we<00:05:06.250> would<00:05:06.430> find

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
could still be the teacher we would find

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.060 
could still be the teacher we would find
that<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:06.909> would<00:05:07.030> probably<00:05:07.780> already<00:05:08.440> do<00:05:09.039> a

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
that you would probably already do a

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.610 
that you would probably already do a
better<00:05:09.340> job<00:05:09.430> or<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.599> better<00:05:10.870> job<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.380> more

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
better job or a better job a more

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.180 
better job or a better job a more
efficient<00:05:12.370> job<00:05:12.760> that<00:05:13.449> shows<00:05:13.960> how<00:05:14.620> something

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
efficient job that shows how something

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.450 
efficient job that shows how something
that<00:05:15.669> you<00:05:15.789> do<00:05:15.909> the<00:05:16.060> first<00:05:16.389> time<00:05:16.750> is<00:05:17.050> not<00:05:17.740> likely

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
that you do the first time is not likely

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.110 
that you do the first time is not likely
to<00:05:18.940> meet<00:05:19.210> with<00:05:19.479> just<00:05:20.320> everything<00:05:20.979> running

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
to meet with just everything running

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.689 
to meet with just everything running
as<00:05:22.180> a<00:05:22.659> teacher<00:05:23.169> to<00:05:23.860> expand<00:05:24.340> your<00:05:24.460> repertoire

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
as a teacher to expand your repertoire

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.080 
as a teacher to expand your repertoire
you<00:05:25.419> have<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.319> be<00:05:26.439> prepared<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:27.159> try<00:05:27.849> new

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
you have to be prepared to try new

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.839 
you have to be prepared to try new
activities<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.900> you<00:05:29.469> have<00:05:29.740> to<00:05:29.919> expect<00:05:30.520> that

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
activities and you have to expect that

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.749 
activities and you have to expect that
the<00:05:31.389> first<00:05:31.689> time<00:05:32.110> will<00:05:32.740> not<00:05:33.099> work<00:05:33.490> perfectly

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
the first time will not work perfectly

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.029 
the first time will not work perfectly
no<00:05:34.599> matter<00:05:34.960> how<00:05:35.259> well<00:05:35.530> you've<00:05:35.740> thought<00:05:35.979> it

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
no matter how well you've thought it

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.580 
no matter how well you've thought it
through<00:05:36.210> but<00:05:37.210> once<00:05:37.449> you<00:05:37.719> duck<00:05:37.960> you've<00:05:38.199> done<00:05:38.439> it

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
through but once you duck you've done it

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.670 
through but once you duck you've done it
two<00:05:38.889> or<00:05:38.919> three<00:05:39.159> times<00:05:39.639> as<00:05:40.060> a<00:05:40.210> teacher<00:05:40.599> it<00:05:41.409> will
