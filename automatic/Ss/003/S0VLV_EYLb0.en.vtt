00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.610
 How's everybody 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:34.720
 we have new question winners of weight 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:38.050
 they really work we are going to give 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.670
 weight gainers really work 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:45.700
 this is the mail that they tell us and go 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.120
 like any supplement because I mentioned 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.750
 in another video of if it really was 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.760
 necessary supplements and the answer 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 easier or simpler 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.830
 what not but what are you going to provide 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.050
 very much life really the 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.290
 supplements make your life a lot more 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.390
 easy then now the question is yes 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.050
 the winners of the weight function well yes 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.890
 yes they work because there are some I think that 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.200
 in weight cattle is divided into two 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.810
 some that come loaded really in 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.440
 calories really is that sugar in a 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.950
 big boat and there are others that really 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.170
 they bring 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.560
 so to speak a very good contribution in 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.149
 calories 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.350
 but they also bring protein they bring a 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:43.659
 important amino acids branch then yes 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.899
 there are two types of weight cattle 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.450
 will depend a lot on the physical state in 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.659
 the one that you find many the truth 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.549
 that are beginning to suffer 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.250
 You could say that very thin wines 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.280
 which are very tall amorphous 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.370
 a skin and so totally and that really 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.990
 I want some eyes still something that wants its 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:09.810
 body to another level then a 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.090
 excellent option would be a a winner of 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.910
 weight but that is a little more loaded 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.830
 in calories not so much a weight winner 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.870
 that is loaded in amino acids in 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.390
 protein 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.000
 putting what today someone who is very 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.069
 very thin a bastard you say whore 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.730
 HuixtÃ¡n mother bones 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.819
 will require more more calories 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.670
 that someone who is good if he is thin 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:45.379
 but not in the bones and there are 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.319
 fat thin so to speak that it 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.080
 can say thin pigs and others 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.970
 that are very very thin make a 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.760
 corner or whether you really see is 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.819
 this one that advances to break if sneeze 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.530
 so 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:06.560
 if I would go depending on the body 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.380
 yes I am very very very thin a channel of 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.220
 weight that has a higher calorie intake 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.830
 how to distinguish them because they are basically 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.450
 the pinches consists lots so that 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.750
 they say super plus or be Latin to such 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.690
 the true plus also has a very 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.590
 very big served is more today too 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.870
 they're using sacks that's the way 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.290
 differential because they are going to have more 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.500
 calories so if the dirty ones or 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.230
 you're going to climb dirty with those coast 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.260
 batches 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.200
 that if you buy a boat in a boat, 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.750
 bring you a weight winner so 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.950
 say it more link because it comes in the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.400
 more more good protein brings it back to 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.549
 repeat better amino acid weapon and not 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.470
 so many calories even if you see it achieve 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.879
 the sack in the boat the sack is 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.840
 say this 1200 calories or 800 I do not know 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.989
 how many calories 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.489
 so if for a person a bastard 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.769
 that is very very thin I better 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.949
 first option would be a sack like that 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.949
 fucking costal of cyrus more bastard 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.560
 for one that is not that is comics 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.330
 neither chubby but is thin be 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.240
 we really have the arms 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.370
 placid they do not have chest but it is 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.320
 pig then it would be a winner of 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.490
 weight 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:44.040
 but the one of the boat not the one of the sack 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:47.160
 so now in the sack and the 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.030
 pot work they 're going to work from 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.460
 according to the diet that you take when 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.360
 some carry arrives to buy a winner 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:01.470
 of weight the first thing that gives you is a uterus 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.890
 of hunger really works for you 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:10.170
 it forces you to eat more and more and 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:12.360
 more that I think is a click of the 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:16.050
 weight gainers are really make you 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.600
 eat and eat and eat and eat because without 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.030
 that weight gain the truth you could not 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.620
 you're going to have a very small stomach so 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.870
 same that you are slim is going to have this 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.010
 very small then yes you know is that 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.530
 I want to eat all the pinches 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.390
 calories from a binge you will not be able to 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.730
 many times all the diarrhea has 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.400
 won whistle or it really is not going to give you 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.440
 appetite this will awaken 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.870
 appetite I think this is the first 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.580
 you actually click a check of 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.000
 that really the winners of weight is 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.010
 a weight winner really if you're going to 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.800
 success make you gain weight is going to be 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.100
 They take a lot of desire to swim 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.100
 eat 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.360
 now on if the supplement if going to 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.780
 work because it works if a 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.820
 a person who already has time let's say 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.889
 a definition stage or a diet of 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:11.050
 maintenance and they had their protein 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:13.720
 isolated and you give a month to try the 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.750
 weight loss prosthesis forgiveness goes to 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.960
 gain weight but if you are not going to see it 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.320
 defined as when he was taking his 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.570
 protein is then isolated or if 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.060
 that extra calorie contribution that is if 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:31.830
 It really exists if the winner works 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.830
 of weight then 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.300
 roughly speaking if the 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.719
 supplement 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.879
 alone there will be no results if 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.800
 you want to take nothing else as 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:46.620
 really a salvation that all 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.050
 get out of the weight without exercise and 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.620
 without a diet to raise your intake 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.300
 of calories will not work but if it 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.909
 combine with the exercise and if 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.009
 combine with a very good diet you're going to 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:00.810
 have excellent results not only 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:04.770
 if you are a beginner if you are intermediate 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:07.860
 and you want to gain weight a winner of 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:10.259
 staff is excellent or if you want a 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.240
 expert a weight winner if you 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:16.199
 you find stagnant I think it's a 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.539
 excellent solution then if they work 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:20.520
 the winners of weights and if the 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.919
 supplement but you also have to 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.099
 help you will be life much more 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:29.129
 easy but if you also give of you 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:31.620
 then big traits the winner of 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:35.539
 weight if it's going to work, I'll tell you 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.539
 all the options you need to know 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.270
