00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.740 
chugging it maybe not that'd be cool
every<00:02:39.230> phone<00:02:39.500> should<00:02:39.799> have<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.359> inside<00:02:41.359> with

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
every phone should have this inside with

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.910 
every phone should have this inside with
small<00:02:42.140> projector<00:02:42.820> maybe<00:02:43.820> it'll<00:02:44.030> happen<00:02:44.150> soon

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
small projector maybe it'll happen soon

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.720 
small projector maybe it'll happen soon
it's<00:02:45.920> been<00:02:46.070> like<00:02:46.250> something<00:02:46.579> I've<00:02:46.700> been

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
it's been like something I've been

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.729 
it's been like something I've been
hoping<00:02:47.060> for<00:02:47.239> for<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:47.840> five<00:02:48.200> six<00:02:48.470> seven<00:02:48.709> years

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
hoping for for like five six seven years

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.300 
hoping for for like five six seven years
to<00:02:48.980> see<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.280> really<00:02:50.000> working<00:02:50.180> smoothly

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
to see this really working smoothly

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.729 
to see this really working smoothly
so<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> guess<00:02:52.489> IR<00:02:52.760> there's<00:02:52.970> no<00:02:53.090> need<00:02:53.239> for<00:02:53.269> a

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
so I guess IR there's no need for a

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.640 
so I guess IR there's no need for a
sensor<00:02:54.739> down<00:02:54.890> here<00:02:55.190> it's<00:02:55.340> just<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.760> up<00:02:56.000> here

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
sensor down here it's just in up here

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.980 
sensor down here it's just in up here
sensor<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:57.769> there
