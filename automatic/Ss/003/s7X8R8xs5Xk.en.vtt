00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
what separate but i think that will do

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.750 
what separate but i think that will do
the<00:02:18.510> same<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.070> hold<00:02:20.070> other<00:02:20.250> clubs<00:02:20.580> do

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the same that hold other clubs do

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.860 
the same that hold other clubs do
probably<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> normal<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:24.510> i

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
probably and this is a normal but i

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.949 
probably and this is a normal but i
think<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:25.560> 2012<00:02:26.690> connecticut<00:02:27.690> there<00:02:27.840> is

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
think that in 2012 connecticut there is

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.390 
think that in 2012 connecticut there is
one<00:02:28.200> player<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.770> camera<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:32.100> happen

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
one player that camera and can happen
