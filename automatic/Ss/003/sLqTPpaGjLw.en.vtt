00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
seamlessly my life before Serato was

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.740 
seamlessly my life before Serato was
bleak<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.530> times<00:01:37.530> were<00:01:37.620> tough<00:01:38.360> man<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
bleak when times were tough man it was a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.900 
bleak when times were tough man it was a
lot<00:01:39.960> sweaty<00:01:40.230> er<00:01:40.350> carry<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.010> records<00:01:41.340> room<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
lot sweaty er carry and records room so

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.570 
lot sweaty er carry and records room so
it's<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.570> kind<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.050> freed<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:43.770> DJ

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
it's really kind of freed up my DJ

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.610 
it's really kind of freed up my DJ
because<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:45.150> like<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.900> kind<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.170> play<00:01:46.260> lots<00:01:46.530> of

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
because I like to kind of play lots of

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.400 
because I like to kind of play lots of
different<00:01:46.680> things<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.810> prior<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.840> Serato<00:01:49.290> I

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
different things so prior to Serato I

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.740 
different things so prior to Serato I
would<00:01:49.650> have<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.980> take<00:01:50.850> massive<00:01:51.150> bags<00:01:51.480> because

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
would have to take massive bags because

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.910 
would have to take massive bags because
I<00:01:51.810> didn't<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.230> where<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:52.740> gonna

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I didn't really know where I was gonna

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.530 
I didn't really know where I was gonna
what<00:01:53.310> direction<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:53.940> gonna<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.300> in<00:01:54.420> because

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
what direction I was gonna go in because

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.750 
what direction I was gonna go in because
I<00:01:54.720> didn't<00:01:54.900> really<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.440> one<00:01:55.620> thing<00:01:55.860> made

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
I didn't really just do one thing made

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.450 
I didn't really just do one thing made
the<00:01:56.880> whole<00:01:57.030> DJ<00:01:57.390> process<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:58.830> kind<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.160> fluid

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the whole DJ process more kind of fluid

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.190 
the whole DJ process more kind of fluid
for<00:01:59.670> me<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.970> can<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.450> jump<00:02:00.600> around<00:02:00.930> quickly

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
for me I can really jump around quickly
