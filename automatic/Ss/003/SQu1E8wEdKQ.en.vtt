but it hasn't really built any more
muscle<00:00:47.010> okay<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.609> you'll<00:00:47.879> drop<00:00:48.059> off<00:00:48.269> some<00:00:48.539> fat

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
muscle okay so you'll drop off some fat

but<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.530> you're<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.769> getting<00:00:50.069> enough<00:00:50.280> energy

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
but if you're not getting enough energy

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.250 
but if you're not getting enough energy
to<00:00:50.670> support<00:00:51.120> building<00:00:51.569> new<00:00:51.659> muscle<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.199> if

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
to support building new muscle and if

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.020 
to support building new muscle and if
you're<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:52.469> getting<00:00:52.679> enough<00:00:52.949> protein<00:00:53.159> to

support<00:00:54.420> building<00:00:54.809> new<00:00:54.929> muscle<00:00:55.280> then<00:00:56.280> guess

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
support building new muscle then guess

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.639 
support building new muscle then guess
what<00:00:57.239> you're<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:58.019> build<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.319> new<00:00:58.350> muscle

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
what you're not gonna build a new muscle

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.410 
what you're not gonna build a new muscle
okay<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.359> nutrition<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.079> paramount<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
okay so nutrition is paramount and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.490 
okay so nutrition is paramount and
you're<00:01:03.420> gonna<00:01:03.539> learn<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> lot<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> more<00:01:04.260> about

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
