up I'm not ending here and so it's

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.740 
up I'm not ending here and so it's
really<00:03:34.860> really<00:03:35.400> hard<00:03:35.790> for<00:03:36.030> me<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.480> get<00:03:36.630> an

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
really really hard for me to get an

based here if I try to do it from
sitting<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:43.980> California<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.170> think<00:03:46.170> you

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
sitting in California so I think you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.580 
sitting in California so I think you
need<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.370> closer<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:48.090> these<00:03:48.239> markets<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.049> a
