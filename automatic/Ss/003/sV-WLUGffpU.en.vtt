a<00:04:52.780> number<00:04:53.080> of<00:04:53.170> albums<00:04:53.350> you<00:04:53.620> sell<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:55.090> think<00:04:55.720> it's

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
a number of albums you sell I think it's

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.290

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.830 
and from the artistic community from my

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
perspective I think it's more kind of

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.380

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
has longevity and isn't just the kind of

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.490 
has longevity and isn't just the kind of
a<00:05:06.220> one-hit<00:05:06.880> wonder<00:05:06.910> going<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.420> do<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.810> mean<00:05:08.350> I
