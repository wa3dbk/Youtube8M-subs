00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.190 
there's the up for floor and then
there's<00:01:49.130> down<00:01:49.310> here<00:01:49.819> and<00:01:50.329> down<00:01:50.959> here<00:01:50.990> I

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
there's down here and down here I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.690 
there's down here and down here I
believe<00:01:51.319> there's<00:01:51.619> traps<00:01:52.039> and<00:01:52.310> stuff<00:01:52.520> but

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
believe there's traps and stuff but

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.839 
believe there's traps and stuff but
there's<00:01:52.819> three<00:01:52.969> of<00:01:53.119> these<00:01:53.179> and<00:01:53.419> I<00:01:53.450> think<00:01:53.630> it's

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
there's three of these and I think it's

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:58.120 
there's three of these and I think it's
i'm<00:01:55.849> retarded<00:01:56.529> let's<00:01:57.529> see<00:01:57.649> if<00:01:57.709> i<00:01:57.770> can<00:01:57.889> find

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
i'm retarded let's see if i can find

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.680 
i'm retarded let's see if i can find
this<00:01:58.310> quickly

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
this quickly

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.560 
this quickly
they're<00:02:00.610> all<00:02:01.610> right<00:02:01.760> let's<00:02:01.940> see<00:02:02.060> if<00:02:02.120> I<00:02:02.180> can<00:02:02.210> do

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
they're all right let's see if I can do

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.480 
they're all right let's see if I can do
this<00:02:02.600> boom<00:02:03.190> boom<00:02:04.240> did<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.420> did<00:02:05.870> that<00:02:05.900> work<00:02:06.490> it

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
this boom boom did that did that work it
