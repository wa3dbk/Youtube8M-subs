that quite easily I know that's the
cartridge<00:02:38.900> filled<00:02:39.140> what<00:02:39.830> we<00:02:39.920> need<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.160> do<00:02:40.250> next

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
cartridge filled what we need to do next

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.550 
cartridge filled what we need to do next
is<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:40.790> need<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.030> change<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.480> chip<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.530> chip

is we need to change the chip the chip
is<00:02:43.010> good<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.489> resetting<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.300> amount<00:02:44.480> of

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
is good for resetting the amount of

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.210 
is good for resetting the amount of
copies<00:02:44.989> of<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.230> cartridge<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.620> can<00:02:45.830> do<00:02:45.950> and

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
copies of the cartridge you can do and

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.390 
copies of the cartridge you can do and
marking<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.760> as<00:02:46.850> fun<00:02:47.150> as<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.040> see<00:02:49.250> from

look<00:03:08.030> at<00:03:08.630> how<00:03:08.870> its<00:03:09.049> placed<00:03:09.320> because<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.769> need

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
look at how its placed because you need

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.949 
look at how its placed because you need

take out the spring be careful that it

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.530 
take out the spring be careful that it
doesn't<00:03:17.720> fly<00:03:18.080> over<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.530> Bears<00:03:19.239> put<00:03:20.239> them<00:03:20.420> on

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
doesn't fly over the Bears put them on

doesn't fly over the Bears put them on
the<00:03:20.600> table<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.110> they<00:03:21.590> were<00:03:21.620> going<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.950> push

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
the table and they were going to push

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:33.630 
the table and they were going to push
the<00:03:22.370> chip<00:03:22.580> out<00:03:22.760> from<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.900> front<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.470> back

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.800 

gently<00:03:34.630> does<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:37.740> and<00:03:39.300> positive<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.630> that's

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
gently does it and positive and that's

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.690 
gently does it and positive and that's
it<00:03:41.080> as<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.500> can<00:03:41.620> see<00:03:41.770> the<00:03:41.980> chip<00:03:42.190> just<00:03:42.370> slides

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
it as you can see the chip just slides

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.150 
it as you can see the chip just slides
out<00:03:43.350> okay<00:03:44.350> now<00:03:44.380> we're<00:03:44.590> going<00:03:44.710> to<00:03:44.800> get<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.040> new

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
out okay now we're going to get the new

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
out okay now we're going to get the new
chip<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:46.120> comes<00:03:46.360> with<00:03:46.540> our<00:03:46.570> refill<00:03:46.990> kits

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
chip that comes with our refill kits

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.790 
chip that comes with our refill kits
I'm<00:03:49.180> probably<00:03:49.420> exactly<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.350> same<00:03:50.560> as<00:03:50.710> the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
I'm probably exactly the same as the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.620 
I'm probably exactly the same as the
other<00:03:50.950> one<00:03:53.700> pushing<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.820> in<00:03:54.940> from<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.270> back<00:03:55.420> to

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
other one pushing it in from the back to

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.990 
other one pushing it in from the back to
the<00:03:55.660> front<00:03:55.950> touch<00:03:56.950> down<00:03:57.190> very<00:03:57.460> gently<00:03:57.550> with

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
the front touch down very gently with

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.250 
the front touch down very gently with
the<00:03:58.030> screwdriver<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:58.780> that's<00:03:58.960> in<00:03:59.080> place<00:03:59.290> now

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
the screwdriver and that's in place now

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.390 
the screwdriver and that's in place now
we're<00:04:02.260> going<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.530> take<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.830> spring<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.250> put

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
we're going to take the spring and put

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:14.970 
we're going to take the spring and put
it<00:04:03.490> back<00:04:03.700> where<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:03.970> was<00:04:08.310> like<00:04:09.310> so

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.009 

the<00:04:15.550> tricky<00:04:15.880> part<00:04:15.910> of<00:04:16.209> pot<00:04:16.419> in<00:04:16.450> this<00:04:16.630> bagging

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
the tricky part of pot in this bagging

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.830 
the tricky part of pot in this bagging
is<00:04:17.139> making<00:04:17.470> sure<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.859> spring<00:04:18.130> goes<00:04:18.419> onto<00:04:19.419> that

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
is making sure the spring goes onto that

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.930 
is making sure the spring goes onto that
plastic<00:04:20.470> piece<00:04:20.500> there<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.280> see<00:04:21.609> it

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
plastic piece there I see it

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.510 
plastic piece there I see it
yeah<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.960> spring<00:04:23.290> goes<00:04:23.440> on<00:04:23.590> there<00:04:26.220> you<00:04:27.220> push

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
yeah the spring goes on there you push

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:37.230 
yeah the spring goes on there you push
up<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.810> housing<00:04:29.200> clips<00:04:29.470> into<00:04:29.800> place<00:04:36.240> just

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
up and the housing clips into place just

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.060 
up and the housing clips into place just
make<00:04:37.419> sure<00:04:37.570> it's<00:04:37.720> in<00:04:37.840> part<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.200> clips<00:04:38.919> in

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
make sure it's in part it clips in

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.320 
make sure it's in part it clips in
properly<00:04:39.580> that<00:04:39.730> there's<00:04:39.880> a<00:04:39.940> wee<00:04:40.120> bit<00:04:40.240> of

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
properly that there's a wee bit of

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.170 
properly that there's a wee bit of
movement<00:04:40.780> in<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:42.520> can<00:04:42.669> feel<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.000> spring

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
movement in it you can feel the spring

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.550 
movement in it you can feel the spring
moving<00:04:43.630> up<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:43.870> down<00:04:44.020> when<00:04:44.169> you<00:04:44.290> move<00:04:44.440> the
