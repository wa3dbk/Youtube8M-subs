believe are I think also 30 seconds or
one<00:02:48.510> minute<00:02:48.780> I'm<00:02:48.870> not<00:02:49.080> exactly<00:02:49.560> sure<00:02:49.800> but<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
one minute I'm not exactly sure but the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.000 
one minute I'm not exactly sure but the
only<00:02:51.060> downside<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:51.990> there<00:02:52.410> are<00:02:52.680> moths

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
can't happen but it's less likely it

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.940 
can't happen but it's less likely it
happen<00:05:18.570> since<00:05:18.780> no<00:05:19.050> one<00:05:19.230> really<00:05:19.500> goes<00:05:19.650> over
