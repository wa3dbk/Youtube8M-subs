00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.660
 the hotel was in the Kleinwalsertal 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.619
 very cordial "I have never been so often late on the way 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:12.329
 Fifteenth of October 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.719
 Sincerely everyone knows Gunther 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.369
 the leaves are falling everything is all colorful 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.169
 as soon as you're not in front of you 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.899
 the softwoods currently sees Temptation at 4 5 degrees so very fresh 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.009
 and Mintal 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.730
 on top of the mountain will be 2000 liters 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.999
 can the frost 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.129
 But I hope that up there, the sun sells the frost and even a 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.490
 will take a bit longer on this page 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.120
 the picture here 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.850
 and on the way through the mountain and valley we can already see that 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.080
 the resurgent full glory ahead of us comes pretty sleepy for 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.540
 Perrier at 10 o'clock in the morning the mountain and led 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.700
 that's a pretty cold one hoping for the last big deal 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.640
 this year 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.890
 but the view of the midsummer costs time and spares 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.180
 This is going to be a very nice day again today 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.180
 Nasic that is not fantastic 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.500
 the view into the Kleinwalsertal it is now shortly before 11 o'clock but the water 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.250
 up here on the street in the city 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.890
 1600 meters altitude is still frozen 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.370
 that's what he's supposed to come out with in the factory 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.460
 and percent the temperature rises only slowly 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.380
 and I also have to appear once a year 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.860
 yes and maybe it could have been wrong but still get a bit of sun 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.189
 The earlier one reached relatively quickly about three quarters of an hour 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.890
 it needs to open up here they just have to thread together 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.470
 and here you have a beautiful view over 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.040
 the Austrian 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.190
 and here you can see no background 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.360
 the driver's license would have been the view to the valley was also on the other side 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.190
 Towards the bathroom 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.410
 Take everything seriously 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.790
 the top of the mountain peaks 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.790
 the most beautiful value or early settler ski resort 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.439
 tomorrow evening 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.439
 Sunday at the latest is snowy 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.370
 that is already the third extraterrestrial 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.089
 because who has often encountered on the hike 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.089
 So there is the extraterrestrial I have never dared years 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:25.599
 that his radiant is probably not yet cured but what she is talkative 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.829
 So far, the SPD wants in the city 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.089
 Euro 6 which football club 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.199
 FC Bayern 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.209
 the hacktivist of itself I'm afraid 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.149
 I would be happy for him 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:41.219
 Valora 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.239
 VACANDO handrail not everything yes massive 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.739
 b 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.739
 Yes 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.239
 Stop the sun the fog slowly creeps up out of the valley 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.759
 on the heights 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.449
 as you can see very nice here 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.509
 I pick up every tax 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.509
 the resistance is still supposed to be 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.449
 Ad I decided to go back to Tadic because he was so 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:22.239
 lying in the sun that was such a good idea will put her out right away 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.239
 when the fog is so slightly obscure the sun 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.999
 but still Kundus - and radiate through eternal so a little longer 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:35.359
 but for that that is more beautiful than the other the first increase in the shade in the 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.709
 January 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.750
 Bunga Bunga Bunga Bunga Bunga Bunga Bunga Picture from the nothing did not turn up 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:45.489
 to take 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.129
 the next album on nothing is currently in high demand 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.299
 40 meters is estimated to be 50 meters maximum approx 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:56.529
 and the temperature is pretty 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.590
 We had fallen fast on the top of the hut in the sun still t-shirt weather 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.009
 as long as you have set yourself a bit sheltered from the wind 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.689
 and here you need treasures on the wrong gloves the temperature is 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.709
 so around the freezing point romance then now wants the quasi conclusion of my 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.559
 hike 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.989
 she wants to close immediately in one of the plots 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.439
 been profound 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.929
 "We close almost all after 20 minutes
