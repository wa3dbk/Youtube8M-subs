that you'll actually be under the map on

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
that you'll actually be under the map on
an<00:01:54.899> underground<00:01:55.409> platform<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.640> from<00:01:56.939> there

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
an underground platform I'm from there

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.300 
an underground platform I'm from there
to<00:01:57.270> simply<00:01:57.689> drive<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.170> car<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
to simply drive your car over to the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.340 
to simply drive your car over to the
sort<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.610> hole<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> platform

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
sort of hole is actually on the platform

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
sort of hole is actually on the platform
all<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.920> hours<00:02:01.950> before<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.549> did<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
all the hours before I did to it so

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.730 
all the hours before I did to it so
won't<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.140> hard<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.439> find<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
won't be like really hard to find the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
won't be like really hard to find the
tool<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.490> yeah<00:02:05.610> from<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.149> simply<00:02:06.509> drive

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
tool so yeah from there to simply drive

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.449 
tool so yeah from there to simply drive
off<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.200> slowly<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.280> don't

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
off as slowly as you can so you don't

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.419 
off as slowly as you can so you don't
really<00:02:08.580> move<00:02:08.879> around

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
really move around

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.559 
really move around
you're<00:02:09.519> falling<00:02:09.700> through<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.060> hole<00:02:10.329> and

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
you're falling through the hole and

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.449 
you're falling through the hole and
hopefully<00:02:11.319> if<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.650> actually<00:02:12.010> lined<00:02:12.219> it<00:02:12.370> up

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
hopefully if you actually lined it up

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.800 
hopefully if you actually lined it up
all<00:02:12.700> right<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:13.000> should<00:02:13.090> actually<00:02:13.359> fall

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
all right you should actually fall

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.660 
all right you should actually fall
inside<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.439> your<00:02:14.590> garage<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.400> course<00:02:15.579> this

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
inside of your garage and of course this

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.970 
inside of your garage and of course this
may<00:02:15.939> take<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.239> few<00:02:16.359> tries<00:02:16.599> and<00:02:17.170> if<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.590> do<00:02:17.769> mess

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
may take a few tries and if you do mess

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.039 
may take a few tries and if you do mess
up<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.250> just<00:02:18.400> spawn<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.659> center<00:02:19.989> of

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
up you just spawn like in the center of

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.959 
up you just spawn like in the center of
the<00:02:20.200> map<00:02:20.409> and<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:20.709> simply<00:02:21.189> just<00:02:21.489> like<00:02:21.670> cold

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
the map and just simply just like cold

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.479 
the map and just simply just like cold
why<00:02:22.209> or<00:02:22.450> triangle<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.590> respawn<00:02:24.010> again<00:02:24.040> and

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
why or triangle to respawn again and

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.280 
why or triangle to respawn again and
just<00:02:24.670> like<00:02:24.819> try<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.510> actually<00:02:25.719> fall<00:02:26.139> through

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
just like try to actually fall through

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.569 
just like try to actually fall through
the<00:02:26.409> hole<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.739> land<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.159> carriage

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
the hole so you land in the carriage

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.429 
the hole so you land in the carriage
okay<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.090> once<00:02:28.389> you've<00:02:28.510> landed<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:29.079> the<00:02:29.200> guard

actually happen to you guys if you are
in<00:02:51.849> next<00:02:52.120> gen<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:52.720> can<00:02:52.870> just<00:02:53.019> go<00:02:53.139> into<00:02:53.319> first

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
in next gen you can just go into first

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.720 
in next gen you can just go into first
person<00:02:53.739> mode<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.189> you'll<00:02:54.280> be<00:02:54.370> able<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.579> see

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
person mode and you'll be able to see

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.640 
person mode and you'll be able to see
everything<00:02:55.000> fine<00:02:55.510> just<00:02:56.079> hop<00:02:56.200> inside<00:02:56.469> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
everything fine just hop inside the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.170 
everything fine just hop inside the
rusty<00:02:56.980> rebel<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.489> everything<00:02:57.849> will<00:02:58.000> load<00:02:58.150> up

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
rusty rebel and everything will load up

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.149 
rusty rebel and everything will load up
because<00:02:59.049> if<00:02:59.200> you're<00:02:59.349> on<00:02:59.409> last<00:02:59.650> gen<00:02:59.769> you<00:03:00.040> just

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
because if you're on last gen you just

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.860 
because if you're on last gen you just
wanna<00:03:00.310> hopping<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:00.909> blue<00:03:01.209> circle<00:03:01.689> and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
wanna hopping to the blue circle and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.869 
wanna hopping to the blue circle and
just<00:03:01.900> find<00:03:02.439> where<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:02.650> rusty<00:03:03.159> rebel<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.609> and

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
just find where that rusty rebel is and

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.940 
just find where that rusty rebel is and
just<00:03:04.000> walk<00:03:04.299> over<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.409> the<00:03:05.530> same<00:03:05.739> rule

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
just walk over to it and the same rule

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.470 
just walk over to it and the same rule
applies<00:03:06.280> once<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.669> in<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.939> everything<00:03:07.209> will

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
applies once it in it everything will
