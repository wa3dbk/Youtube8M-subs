00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
there's less breakage so it's not

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.710 
there's less breakage so it's not
necessarily<00:02:29.310> making<00:02:30.000> your<00:02:30.180> hair<00:02:30.330> grow<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:30.600> at

your<00:02:30.840> retaining<00:02:31.200> length<00:02:31.560> because<00:02:31.950> your<00:02:32.700> hair

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
your retaining length because your hair

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.210 
your retaining length because your hair
is<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.150> breaking<00:02:33.690> as<00:02:33.810> much<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.709> when<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.010> have

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
is a breaking as much and when you have

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.890 
is a breaking as much and when you have
split<00:02:35.580> ends<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.030> don't<00:02:36.209> get<00:02:36.360> rid<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.750> them

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
split ends and you don't get rid of them

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.490 
split ends and you don't get rid of them
the<00:02:37.500> split<00:02:38.250> travels<00:02:38.820> up<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.270> hair<00:02:39.570> shaft<00:02:39.600> to

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the split travels up the hair shaft to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.730 
the split travels up the hair shaft to
number<00:02:41.040> four<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.820> easy<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.270> detangle<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:43.050> kid

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
number four it's easy to detangle I kid

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.500 
number four it's easy to detangle I kid
you<00:02:43.770> not<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.400> not<00:02:44.670> like<00:02:44.730> detangling<00:02:45.420> is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
you not it's not like detangling is

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.020 
you not it's not like detangling is
easier<00:02:45.840> because<00:02:45.990> my<00:02:46.350> ends<00:02:46.980> are<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.700> know<00:02:47.820> all

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
easier because my ends are you know all
