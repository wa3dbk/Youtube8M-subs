00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.250
 but myself 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.369

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:29.110

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.640
 and the truth 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.129
 the truth 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.129
 but one day 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.990
 military 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.660
 and from the entrance 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.660
 in the afternoon 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.250
 ah 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.250
 for all 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.650
 no no no no 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.650
 and so much 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:24.020
 for the one who knows knows what there is 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.020
 or not 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.390
 do not 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.759
 no matter you jump or sheathing 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.479
 able to stop from my wind dance of 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.479
 she 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.070
 has ejected my fragments 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.890
 If I want to hear, it's better to take advantage 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.280
 while the field is weak but nothing 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.280
 have 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.080
 and it's true 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.080
 That man is capable 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.969
 and in enough assets to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.969
 face more 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.740
 hello how dare who manipulates the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.130
 winds 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.430
 what a pleasure it gives me you still remember me 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.670
 all right 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.640
 put your hand away from the sword I have not come 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.160
 to face you they called and 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.670
 you want to make an exchange 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.440
 and exchange should know very well what it is 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.870
 this 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.200
 they are fragments of the chicÃ³n pearl and 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.840
 They can be yours but in return 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.670
 I want to finish with nothing to say 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.670
 released from the hands of that subject 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.500
 and the wind of betrayal breaks loose 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.350
 you have enough power to achieve it 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.280
 you will also gain the fragments that swim 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.280
 Cuba has been gathering 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.330
 using your powers you will get a life 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.410
 more fun you think you will betray 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.870
 Aragon 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.830
 do not think I love obeying their 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.100
 odious orders 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.050
 what do you say is omar you accept my treatment 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.720
 I assure you will not regret 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.360
 I'm sorry to say that I do not have any 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.910
 interest in the pearl of chicon if 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.650
 you want to be free use those fragments 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:03.230
 for the destruction of your creator 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.390
 you are afraid of nothing 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.620
 what I want to say is that I do not have the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.620
 obligation to help you 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.400
 If you're not ready to do it alone 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.370
 better not ever betray him 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.329
 I knew you were a coward yet you 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.329
 do you call a man 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.580
 you are a fool 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.430
 the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.289
 I love you, you think that woman 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.330
 I thought I would use it as a shield to 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.580
 betray his master because it is a 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.219
 ungrateful does not know who you are with 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.979
 getting in if it's an extension of the 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.800
 detestable nothing the lord by his hand 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.770
 he's very strong he does not need to kill her for 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.050
 achieve what you want for the 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.789
 manipulator of the winds you will dare 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.060
 to use the power of those two fragments 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.979
 to defeat anything that does not matter what 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.979
 happen the are my not interested 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:09.429
 we do not have to spend nice, it's time to 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.429
 go 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.880
 I forget it 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.700
 sir they called her she is not found 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.750
 alone but that woman felt sad 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.750
 because he did not have anyone 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.570
 let's add or what we will do for dinner 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.570
 from this night 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Y 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.510
 thank you very much with your attentions 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.550
 ceased to feel that terrible everything not 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:59.280
 Pay attention to that poor devil or 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:02.350
 if I did not hurt your cave scram 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.870
 mad rabid 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.760
 what the hell is wrong with you, you forgot 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.040
 still with that ordinary appearance 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.920
 what right do you come to demand of me if 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.780
 you have the least advantage I'm not here 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.780
 because I like that you want to fight 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.500
 hear they do not think to recover the 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.500
 fragments that were 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.830
 because you have to come with us not 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.450
 bother those are my fragments and not 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.850
 I'm going to give them to a beast like 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:40.380
 you mean they capture or return 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.300
 to the castle not the strangest thing is that the 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.860
 presence of the fragments is 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.090
 moving away more and more from the field of 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.090
 energy that I create nothing 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.710
 or help solve 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.340
 kabul is an extension of aragon it 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.919
 supposes that he obeys his orders 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.370
 here work escaped with the fragments 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.900
 which is very feasible does not seem strange to you 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.260
 and lou either also what the field of 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.260
 Energy 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.900
 you know why you and kodak located the 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.000
 castle with your nose the reason is that 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.830
 the field is fading ie 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.220
 the supernatural powers of nothing that is 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.220
 they have weakened 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.550
 they have weakened 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.660
 so it also has a part 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.490
 human remember that it was the union of a 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.890
 evil madonna thief and an enclosure 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.080
 with a huge amount of monsters 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.270
 qaeda told us that the lady is a 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.070
 man half demon as well and many 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.990
 they already lose their powers in the nights of 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.110
 new moon there are days when the essence of 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.880
 nara q weakens a bit 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.540
 you mean nothing that also has 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.540
 a weak point
