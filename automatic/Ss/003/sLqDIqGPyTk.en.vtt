of<00:01:56.400> changes<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:56.910> on<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.690> run<00:01:57.900> well<00:01:58.230> what<00:01:58.380> we

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
of changes on on the run well what we

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.170 
of changes on on the run well what we
did<00:01:58.620> is<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.220> look<00:01:59.340> right<00:01:59.520> over<00:01:59.550> there<00:01:59.880> it

did is if you look right over there it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.820 
did is if you look right over there it
was<00:02:00.330> just<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.600> plain<00:02:00.840> wall<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.620> going
