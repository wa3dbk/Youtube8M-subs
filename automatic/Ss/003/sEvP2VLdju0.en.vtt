hello<00:00:06.680> my<00:00:07.580> name<00:00:07.760> is<00:00:07.790> hands<00:00:08.120> and

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
hello my name is hands and

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.850 
hello my name is hands and
on<00:00:10.450> a<00:00:10.630> discovery<00:00:11.350> 300tdi<00:00:13.110> rather<00:00:14.110> exting<00:00:14.650> is

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
on a discovery 300tdi rather exting is

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.410 
on a discovery 300tdi rather exting is
to<00:00:15.010> take<00:00:15.190> off<00:00:15.340> the<00:00:15.460> viscous<00:00:15.790> fan<00:00:15.970> coupling

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
to take off the viscous fan coupling

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.810 
to take off the viscous fan coupling
bear<00:00:17.320> in<00:00:17.440> mind<00:00:17.619> it's<00:00:17.800> a<00:00:17.890> left-hand<00:00:18.280> thread<00:00:18.580> and

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
bear in mind it's a left-hand thread and

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.460 
bear in mind it's a left-hand thread and
we<00:00:18.939> use<00:00:19.119> in<00:00:19.270> a<00:00:19.330> correct<00:00:19.740> fan<00:00:20.740> coupling<00:00:21.160> spanner

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
we use in a correct fan coupling spanner

we use in a correct fan coupling spanner
span<00:00:23.470> run<00:00:23.680> and<00:00:23.890> we<00:00:24.189> might<00:00:24.369> have<00:00:24.520> to<00:00:24.640> shock<00:00:24.849> it

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
span run and we might have to shock it

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.260 
span run and we might have to shock it
with<00:00:25.150> a<00:00:25.180> hammer<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:27.160> make<00:00:27.189> sure<00:00:27.579> it<00:00:27.700> comes<00:00:28.000> off

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
with a hammer to make sure it comes off

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.960 
with a hammer to make sure it comes off
oh<00:00:28.570> there<00:00:29.380> it<00:00:29.470> goes<00:00:29.619> and<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:33.340> have<00:00:33.460> now<00:00:33.640> got<00:00:33.820> it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
oh there it goes and we have now got it

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:45.209 
oh there it goes and we have now got it
loose<00:00:34.150> we<00:00:34.450> can<00:00:34.480> spin<00:00:35.470> off<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.739> replace<00:00:45.039> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
if the fan off might be a bit stuck this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.880 
if the fan off might be a bit stuck this
one<00:01:17.100> needs<00:01:17.340> prying<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:21.590> carefully<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> pry

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
one needs prying up carefully the pry

one needs prying up carefully the pry
bar<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.700> lift<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> down<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:27.060> fit<00:01:27.209> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
bar we can just lift it down to fit the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.620 
bar we can just lift it down to fit the
new<00:01:27.420> fan<00:01:27.929> coupling<00:01:28.380> I'm<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
new fan coupling I'm just going to do a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.010 
new fan coupling I'm just going to do a
reverse<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.579> clicking<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> off<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.149> we've

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
reverse of clicking it off and we've

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.080 
reverse of clicking it off and we've
supplied<00:01:34.289> new<00:01:34.409> bolts<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.100> these<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.789> shall

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
supplied new bolts with these so I shall

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.120 
supplied new bolts with these so I shall
use<00:01:36.240> those<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.659> well

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.130 

fit<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> four<00:01:41.369> bolts<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.119> tighten<00:01:42.329> them<00:01:42.509> up

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.359 

now<00:01:46.140> we've<00:01:46.349> tightened<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.009> all<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> bolts

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
now we've tightened up all the bolts

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.969 
now we've tightened up all the bolts
it's<00:01:47.819> ready<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.239> refitting<00:01:48.770> notice<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it's ready for refitting notice that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.690 
it's ready for refitting notice that
this<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> left<00:01:50.610> hand<00:01:50.819> thread<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:52.700> lower

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
this is the left hand thread so we lower

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.919 
this is the left hand thread so we lower
it<00:01:53.789> into<00:01:53.970> position<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:57.500> screw<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.619> on

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
it into position and screw it on

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.080 
it into position and screw it on
counterclockwise<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:02.610> quite<00:02:02.819> fiddly

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
counterclockwise it's quite fiddly

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.499 
counterclockwise it's quite fiddly

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
on we can spin it up all the way up

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.440 
on we can spin it up all the way up
cleat<00:02:11.400> stops<00:02:12.530> just<00:02:13.530> hang<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.829> up<00:02:14.420> got<00:02:15.420> the

spanner<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:17.760> don't<00:02:17.970> need<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.269> tighten<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.630> too

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
spanner we don't need to tighten it too

spanner we don't need to tighten it too
much<00:02:19.310> but<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.519> nip<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.819> up<00:02:21.739> enough<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:22.859> that

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:22.889 
much but just nip it up enough so that

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.270 
much but just nip it up enough so that
it<00:02:23.069> just<00:02:23.250> starts<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.670> move<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.690> pulley<00:02:24.870> and

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
it just starts to move on the pulley and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.819 
it just starts to move on the pulley and
that's<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.459> fitted
