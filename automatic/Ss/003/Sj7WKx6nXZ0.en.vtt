00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
okay so I've opened up PHP my admin' so

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.300 
okay so I've opened up PHP my admin' so
we're<00:00:03.780> going<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> be<00:00:04.080> years<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.560> administering

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
we're going to be years of administering

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.400 
we're going to be years of administering
our<00:00:05.520> database<00:00:06.029> let's<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> look<00:00:07.140> at<00:00:07.259> what

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
our database let's have a look at what

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.589 
our database let's have a look at what
we've<00:00:07.589> already<00:00:07.859> got<00:00:08.130> stored<00:00:08.639> now<00:00:09.240> your

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
we've already got stored now your

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.759 
we've already got stored now your
database<00:00:09.990> could<00:00:10.139> obviously<00:00:10.380> be<00:00:10.590> different

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
database could obviously be different

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.930 
database could obviously be different
you<00:00:11.130> could<00:00:11.309> be<00:00:11.400> using<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.730> for<00:00:11.880> different

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
you could be using it for different

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.010 
you could be using it for different
purposes<00:00:12.630> mine<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.679> basic<00:00:14.519> login<00:00:15.020> database

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
purposes mine is a basic login database

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.960 
purposes mine is a basic login database
so<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.770> information<00:00:17.430> that's<00:00:17.580> stored<00:00:17.670> about

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
so this information that's stored about

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.000 
so this information that's stored about
users<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> help<00:00:18.930> us<00:00:19.050> log<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.410> now

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
users is going to help us log in now

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.500 
users is going to help us log in now
that's<00:00:20.130> irrelevant<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:21.000> we've<00:00:21.240> got<00:00:21.420> an

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
that's irrelevant for now we've got an

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.679 
that's irrelevant for now we've got an
ID<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:22.109> six<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.769> Alex<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.400> an<00:00:23.730> ID<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.240> seven

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
ID of six for Alex and an ID of seven

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.529 
ID of six for Alex and an ID of seven
for<00:00:24.840> Dale<00:00:25.080> now<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> unique

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
for Dale now this is a unique

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.089 
for Dale now this is a unique
incrementing<00:00:27.539> value<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.769> could<00:00:28.920> now

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
incrementing value so what we could now

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.970 
incrementing value so what we could now
do<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.460> modify<00:00:29.789> our<00:00:30.060> generate<00:00:30.480> PHP<00:00:31.230> file<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
do is modify our generate PHP file to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.940 
do is modify our generate PHP file to
take<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.610> user's<00:00:33.210> ID<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.770> that's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
take in a user's ID and what that's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.139 
take in a user's ID and what that's
going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.730> return

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
going to do is it's going to return

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.619 
going to do is it's going to return
their<00:00:36.450> email<00:00:36.870> address<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:39.450> by

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
their email address as we have just by

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.080 
their email address as we have just by
typing<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.340> let's<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.850> close

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
typing it in here so let's just close

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.340 
typing it in here so let's just close
the<00:00:42.360> source<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.899> first<00:00:46.050> thing<00:00:46.260> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the source on here so the first thing we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.990 
the source on here so the first thing we
need<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.770> connect<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> our<00:00:47.340> database<00:00:47.489> so

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
need to do is connect to our database so

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.850 
need to do is connect to our database so
let's<00:00:48.180> go<00:00:48.360> ahead<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.079> quickly<00:00:49.530> connect

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
let's go ahead and just quickly connect

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.930 
let's go ahead and just quickly connect
to<00:00:49.980> our<00:00:50.100> database<00:00:51.829> we're<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> say<00:00:53.160> MySQL

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to our database we're going to say MySQL

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.600 
to our database we're going to say MySQL
connect<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> very<00:00:55.710> rough<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.370> don't

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
connect now this is very rough so don't

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.750 
connect now this is very rough so don't
follow<00:00:56.850> my<00:00:57.270> example<00:00:57.920> in<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.160> sense<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
follow my example in this sense and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.220 
follow my example in this sense and
there<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.210> another<00:01:00.420> tutorial<00:01:01.079> about

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there is another tutorial about

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.030 
there is another tutorial about
connecting<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.250> database<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.690> root<00:01:04.040> MySQL

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
connecting to a database so root MySQL

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.000 
connecting to a database so root MySQL
select<00:01:06.830> dB

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
select dB

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.200 
select dB
so<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.520> we're<00:01:08.670> doing<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> we're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so what we're doing now is we're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.940 
so what we're doing now is we're
selecting<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> database<00:01:10.320> which<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.710> believe

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
selecting the database which I believe

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.530 
selecting the database which I believe
is<00:01:11.100> called<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:13.040> underscore<00:01:14.040> database<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
is called a underscore database so a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.310 
is called a underscore database so a
underscore<00:01:16.790> database<00:01:17.790> now<00:01:18.630> let's<00:01:18.810> perform<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
underscore database now let's perform a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.789 
underscore database now let's perform a
query<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.330> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:21.960> MySQL

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
query and this is going to be MySQL

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.710 
query and this is going to be MySQL
query<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.020> say<00:01:25.229> select<00:01:26.479> email<00:01:27.479> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
query and we can say select email so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
query and we can say select email so
we're<00:01:27.840> selecting<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.320> email<00:01:28.350> field<00:01:29.159> which<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
we're selecting the email field which is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.230 
we're selecting the email field which is
here<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> select<00:01:32.790> email<00:01:33.530> from<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:36.630> our

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
here so select email from so what our

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.969 
here so select email from so what our
our<00:01:39.240> tables<00:01:39.659> called<00:01:39.869> oops<00:01:40.170> sorry<00:01:40.380> our<00:01:40.619> tables

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
our tables called oops sorry our tables

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.670 
our tables called oops sorry our tables
called<00:01:41.130> users<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.360> let's<00:01:42.570> select<00:01:42.840> email<00:01:43.380> from

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
called users so let's select email from

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.560 
called users so let's select email from
users

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.469 

we're<00:01:48.070> ID<00:01:50.590> equals<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:51.979> we<00:01:52.729> want<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.090> specify

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
we're ID equals and we want to specify

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.060 
we're ID equals and we want to specify
the<00:01:53.810> ID<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.810> user<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.409> that's<00:01:57.860> going<00:01:58.010> to

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
the ID of the user and that's going to

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.410 
the ID of the user and that's going to
be<00:01:58.190> taken<00:01:58.610> in<00:01:58.760> let's<00:01:59.180> copy<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.409> paste<00:02:00.530> this<00:02:01.420> up

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
be taken in let's copy and paste this up

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.499 
be taken in let's copy and paste this up
here<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.960> query<00:02:06.409> equals<00:02:07.070> MySQL<00:02:07.820> query<00:02:08.060> select

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
here so query equals MySQL query select

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.110 
here so query equals MySQL query select
now<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.500> ID<00:02:09.770> here<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.310> going<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.489> be<00:02:10.700> we'll

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
now so that ID here is going to be we'll

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.270 
now so that ID here is going to be we'll
just<00:02:11.300> call<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.510> ID<00:02:11.780> for<00:02:12.230> now<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.590> what<00:02:13.160> I'm

going to do is add some just some
security<00:02:15.260> on<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:15.890> I'm<00:02:15.980> going<00:02:16.700> to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
security on to this so I'm going to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.780 
security on to this so I'm going to
enclose<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:18.020> in<00:02:18.230> my<00:02:18.500> MySQL<00:02:19.040> real<00:02:19.730> escape

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
enclose this in my MySQL real escape

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.620 
enclose this in my MySQL real escape
string<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:22.340> help<00:02:23.300> prevent<00:02:23.739> SQL<00:02:24.739> injection

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
string to help prevent SQL injection

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.530 
string to help prevent SQL injection
okay<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.739> set<00:02:28.070> get<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.330> time

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
okay so if is set get and this time

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.009 
okay so if is set get and this time
we're<00:02:29.660> going<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.810> get<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.290> value<00:02:30.709> ID<00:02:31.100> and

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
we're going to get the value ID and

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.979 
we're going to get the value ID and
we're<00:02:33.019> now<00:02:33.260> going<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.560> say<00:02:33.800> ID<00:02:34.510> equals<00:02:35.510> dollar

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
we're now going to say ID equals dollar

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.300 
we're now going to say ID equals dollar
underscore<00:02:36.440> get<00:02:37.360> ID<00:02:38.360> so<00:02:39.200> now<00:02:39.470> let's<00:02:39.709> let<00:02:40.220> me

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
underscore get ID so now let's let me

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.590 
underscore get ID so now let's let me
briefly<00:02:40.640> take<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:40.940> through<00:02:41.209> what<00:02:41.330> I've<00:02:41.420> done

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600

for an ID input the idea is going to

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.539 
for an ID input the idea is going to
equal<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.709> input<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.190> we've<00:02:55.310> specified

equal the input that we've specified

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.360 
equal the input that we've specified
using<00:02:56.239> our<00:02:56.360> get<00:02:56.630> otherwise<00:02:57.410> email<00:02:58.070> is<00:02:58.220> going

using our get otherwise email is going

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.300 
using our get otherwise email is going
to<00:02:58.430> say<00:02:58.579> no<00:02:58.820> email<00:02:59.120> specified<00:02:59.690> once<00:03:00.049> again<00:03:00.500> so

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
to say no email specified once again so

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.039 
to say no email specified once again so
down<00:03:01.519> here<00:03:01.820> what<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.120> can<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.390> is<00:03:02.480> perform<00:03:02.900> our

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
down here what we can do is perform our

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.020 
down here what we can do is perform our
query<00:03:03.380> which<00:03:03.620> we've<00:03:03.829> performed<00:03:04.430> now<00:03:04.970> we

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
query which we've performed now we

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.449 
query which we've performed now we
should<00:03:05.360> retrieve<00:03:05.810> some<00:03:06.049> information<00:03:06.170> back<00:03:06.890> so

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
should retrieve some information back so

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.120 
should retrieve some information back so
I'm<00:03:07.579> going<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.790> say<00:03:08.000> query<00:03:08.450> result<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.440> equal

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
I'm going to say query result is equal

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.330 
I'm going to say query result is equal
to<00:03:11.530> MySQL<00:03:13.780> result<00:03:14.780> now<00:03:15.440> we<00:03:15.470> can<00:03:15.709> specify<00:03:15.980> the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
to MySQL result now we can specify the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.870 
to MySQL result now we can specify the
query<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.060> we<00:03:17.299> executed<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:19.489> we<00:03:19.610> can<00:03:19.730> also

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
query that we executed and we can also

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.390 
query that we executed and we can also
specify<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.989> row<00:03:21.350> which<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.620> going<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:21.950> be<00:03:22.040> 0

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
specify the row which is going to be 0

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.490 
specify the row which is going to be 0
because<00:03:22.640> we're<00:03:23.329> only<00:03:23.480> going<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.750> retrieve<00:03:24.140> one

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
because we're only going to retrieve one

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.770 
because we're only going to retrieve one
row<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:25.010> then<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.640> field<00:03:25.910> here<00:03:26.329> so<00:03:26.600> that's

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
row and then the field here so that's

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.410 
row and then the field here so that's
going<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.230> be<00:03:27.380> email<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.940> query<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.299> we

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
going to be email so the query that we

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.319 
going to be email so the query that we
performed<00:03:30.049> here<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.950> row<00:03:31.730> which<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.150> going<00:03:32.269> to

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
performed here the row which is going to

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.390 
performed here the row which is going to
be<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.570> 0<00:03:33.049> row<00:03:33.350> which<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.739> only<00:03:34.040> row

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
be the 0 row which is the only row

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.150 
be the 0 row which is the only row
that's<00:03:34.609> been<00:03:34.730> returned<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.390> email<00:03:36.140> there<00:03:36.410> so

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
that's been returned and email there so

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.069 
that's been returned and email there so
what<00:03:37.670> we<00:03:37.760> could<00:03:37.910> do<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.209> have<00:03:38.420> checks<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.900> here

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
what we could do is have checks in here

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.990 
what we could do is have checks in here
to<00:03:39.230> check<00:03:39.470> if<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:39.859> exists<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:40.579> if<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.790> ID

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
to check if this exists so if the ID

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.960 
to check if this exists so if the ID
exists<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:42.220> suppose<00:03:43.220> we<00:03:43.340> could<00:03:43.459> quickly<00:03:43.730> do

therefore<00:04:25.289> now<00:04:25.500> what's<00:04:25.740> going<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:25.949> happen<00:04:26.009> is

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
therefore now what's going to happen is

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.400 
therefore now what's going to happen is
our<00:04:26.460> script<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.060> going<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.300> run<00:04:27.509> as<00:04:27.750> normal<00:04:28.259> so

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
our script is going to run as normal so

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.050 
our script is going to run as normal so
let's<00:04:28.979> go<00:04:29.100> through<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:29.400> again<00:04:29.669> just<00:04:29.729> so<00:04:30.000> you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
let's go through this again just so you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.300 
let's go through this again just so you
make<00:04:30.300> sure<00:04:30.330> you<00:04:30.570> entirely<00:04:31.229> understand<00:04:31.770> we're

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
checking if this ID value which we

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.760 
checking if this ID value which we
previously<00:04:38.789> had<00:04:39.479> let's<00:04:40.380> go<00:04:40.500> back<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.740> our

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
source we previously had as email equals

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.330 
source we previously had as email equals
this<00:04:44.220> will<00:04:44.430> now<00:04:44.580> read<00:04:44.850> ID<00:04:45.510> equals<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.740> then

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
this will now read ID equals and then

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.450 
this will now read ID equals and then
we're<00:04:47.460> going<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.610> specify<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.060> specific<00:04:48.630> ID

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
we're going to specify a specific ID

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.520 
we're going to specify a specific ID
then<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.610> ID<00:04:50.820> variable<00:04:51.570> here<00:04:52.080> is<00:04:52.110> equal<00:04:52.470> to

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
then the ID variable here is equal to

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.920 
then the ID variable here is equal to
what<00:04:52.800> we've<00:04:52.949> specified<00:04:53.449> otherwise<00:04:54.449> email

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
what we've specified otherwise email

equals no more specified as we did

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.430 
equals no more specified as we did
before<00:04:56.759> now<00:04:57.750> what<00:04:58.020> we're<00:04:58.199> doing<00:04:58.229> is

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
before now what we're doing is

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.860 
before now what we're doing is
performing<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.759> query<00:05:01.940> in<00:05:02.940> fact<00:05:03.630> we're<00:05:03.780> going

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
performing a query in fact we're going

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.110 
performing a query in fact we're going
to<00:05:03.930> perform<00:05:04.110> this<00:05:04.500> query<00:05:04.889> here<00:05:05.599> inside<00:05:06.860> here

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
to perform this query here inside here

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.180 
to perform this query here inside here
because<00:05:09.120> otherwise<00:05:09.449> there's<00:05:10.289> no<00:05:10.530> need<00:05:10.770> to

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
because otherwise there's no need to

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.100 
because otherwise there's no need to
continue<00:05:12.949> and<00:05:13.949> we'll<00:05:14.430> change<00:05:14.669> this<00:05:14.849> to<00:05:14.909> no<00:05:15.120> IDs

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
continue and we'll change this to no IDs

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.990 
continue and we'll change this to no IDs
specified<00:05:16.500> so<00:05:16.889> sorry<00:05:17.099> if<00:05:17.220> that's<00:05:17.340> confused<00:05:17.849> to

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
specified so sorry if that's confused to

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.879 
specified so sorry if that's confused to
let's<00:05:18.210> bring<00:05:18.389> this<00:05:18.539> down<00:05:18.599> to<00:05:18.750> make<00:05:18.960> make<00:05:19.710> it<00:05:19.830> a

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
let's bring this down to make make it a

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.430 
let's bring this down to make make it a
bit<00:05:20.010> easier<00:05:20.310> to<00:05:20.340> read<00:05:20.580> so<00:05:21.210> if<00:05:21.479> if<00:05:21.690> we<00:05:21.960> have<00:05:22.139> set

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
bit easier to read so if if we have set

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.469 
bit easier to read so if if we have set
this<00:05:22.560> ID<00:05:22.800> thing<00:05:23.159> then<00:05:23.340> we<00:05:23.460> complete<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.090> query

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
this ID thing then we complete a query

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.680 
this ID thing then we complete a query
so<00:05:25.110> query<00:05:25.409> is<00:05:25.710> selecting<00:05:26.370> email<00:05:26.940> selecting

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
so query is selecting email selecting

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.950 
so query is selecting email selecting
one<00:05:27.870> field<00:05:28.229> from<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:29.070> users<00:05:29.550> table<00:05:29.849> where<00:05:30.810> our

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449

see if we returned with the correct
error<00:06:24.910> you'll<00:06:25.840> see<00:06:26.020> no<00:06:26.260> ID<00:06:26.560> specified<00:06:27.310> so<00:06:27.970> now

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
error you'll see no ID specified so now

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.410 
error you'll see no ID specified so now
let's<00:06:28.390> go<00:06:28.570> in<00:06:28.690> and<00:06:28.870> say<00:06:29.080> ID<00:06:29.440> equals<00:06:30.370> now<00:06:30.970> the<00:06:31.030> ID

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
let's go in and say ID equals now the ID

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.600 
let's go in and say ID equals now the ID
that<00:06:31.780> we<00:06:31.870> have<00:06:32.080> in<00:06:32.200> the<00:06:32.290> database<00:06:32.770> the<00:06:33.100> two<00:06:33.310> IDs

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
that we have in the database the two IDs

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.670 
that we have in the database the two IDs
we<00:06:33.790> have<00:06:33.910> six<00:06:34.210> and<00:06:34.330> seven<00:06:34.780> so<00:06:35.290> let's<00:06:35.320> specify

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
we have six and seven so let's specify

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.980 
we have six and seven so let's specify
this<00:06:36.070> to<00:06:36.220> 10<00:06:36.550> because<00:06:36.850> that<00:06:37.090> doesn't<00:06:37.390> exist<00:06:37.720> so

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
this to 10 because that doesn't exist so

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.080 
this to 10 because that doesn't exist so
he<00:06:38.470> should<00:06:38.770> when<00:06:39.160> we<00:06:39.310> refresh<00:06:39.790> our<00:06:40.060> page

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
he should when we refresh our page

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.370 
he should when we refresh our page
retrieve<00:06:41.080> the<00:06:41.230> result<00:06:41.850> saying<00:06:42.850> that<00:06:43.060> we<00:06:43.380> the

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
retrieve the result saying that we the

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.500 
retrieve the result saying that we the
idea<00:06:44.680> is<00:06:44.740> not<00:06:44.830> being<00:06:45.040> found

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
idea is not being found

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.630 
idea is not being found
so<00:06:46.510> ID<00:06:46.720> not<00:06:47.020> found<00:06:47.260> so<00:06:47.560> that's<00:06:48.070> fine<00:06:48.340> it<00:06:48.490> works

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
so ID not found so that's fine it works

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.060 
so ID not found so that's fine it works
now<00:06:49.600> let's<00:06:49.780> go<00:06:49.900> back<00:06:50.050> and<00:06:50.230> do<00:06:50.290> it<00:06:50.410> sensibly<00:06:50.590> so

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
now let's go back and do it sensibly so

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.190 
now let's go back and do it sensibly so
we<00:06:51.190> can<00:06:51.310> say<00:06:51.430> six<00:06:51.820> now<00:06:52.420> what<00:06:52.630> this<00:06:52.780> should<00:06:52.990> now

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
we can say six now what this should now

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.470 
we can say six now what this should now
do<00:06:53.260> is<00:06:53.620> retrieve<00:06:54.040> the<00:06:54.400> email<00:06:54.790> address<00:06:55.060> of<00:06:55.090> user

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.480 
do is retrieve the email address of user

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.010 
do is retrieve the email address of user
6<00:06:55.930> and<00:06:56.320> that<00:06:56.800> is<00:06:57.010> Alex<00:06:57.430> at<00:06:57.670> some<00:06:58.030> domain<00:06:58.450> comm

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
6 and that is Alex at some domain comm

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.840 
6 and that is Alex at some domain comm
so<00:06:59.890> let's<00:07:00.190> go<00:07:00.460> over<00:07:00.670> to<00:07:01.090> our<00:07:01.120> page<00:07:01.660> and<00:07:01.990> refresh

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
so let's go over to our page and refresh

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.720 
so let's go over to our page and refresh
and<00:07:03.850> we<00:07:04.180> retrieve<00:07:04.600> Alex<00:07:05.080> at<00:07:05.230> some<00:07:05.470> domain.com

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
and we retrieve Alex at some domain.com

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.430 
and we retrieve Alex at some domain.com
so<00:07:07.090> not<00:07:07.240> only<00:07:07.270> we're<00:07:07.630> converting<00:07:07.960> this<00:07:08.260> to

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 
so not only we're converting this to

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.920 
so not only we're converting this to
text<00:07:08.710> we're<00:07:08.950> securely<00:07:09.490> doing<00:07:09.940> it<00:07:10.090> because<00:07:10.690> now

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
text we're securely doing it because now

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.110 
text we're securely doing it because now
if<00:07:11.050> we<00:07:11.200> look<00:07:11.350> at<00:07:11.440> our<00:07:11.530> page<00:07:11.710> source<00:07:12.070> the<00:07:12.610> email

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
if we look at our page source the email

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.570 
if we look at our page source the email
address<00:07:13.450> doesn't<00:07:13.810> exist<00:07:13.960> anywhere<00:07:14.920> in<00:07:15.190> this

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
address doesn't exist anywhere in this

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.230 
address doesn't exist anywhere in this
code<00:07:16.000> okay<00:07:16.780> so<00:07:17.410> our<00:07:18.250> bots<00:07:18.580> are<00:07:18.760> going<00:07:18.910> to<00:07:18.970> find

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 
code okay so our bots are going to find

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.230 
code okay so our bots are going to find
it<00:07:19.360> harder<00:07:19.780> to<00:07:19.810> pick<00:07:20.140> up<00:07:20.320> a<00:07:20.520> plain<00:07:21.520> text<00:07:21.790> email

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
it harder to pick up a plain text email

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.840 
it harder to pick up a plain text email
value<00:07:22.630> so<00:07:23.110> let's<00:07:23.290> just<00:07:23.440> try<00:07:23.590> it<00:07:23.680> with<00:07:24.160> seven

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:24.850 
value so let's just try it with seven

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.910 
value so let's just try it with seven
which<00:07:25.030> is<00:07:25.060> Dale's<00:07:25.480> email<00:07:25.990> address<00:07:26.260> and<00:07:26.500> then

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:26.920 
which is Dale's email address and then

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.130 
which is Dale's email address and then
the<00:07:26.950> tutorial<00:07:27.610> will<00:07:27.940> be<00:07:27.970> over<00:07:28.420> so<00:07:28.990> let's

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.140 
the tutorial will be over so let's

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.780 
the tutorial will be over so let's
refresh<00:07:29.320> and<00:07:29.830> you<00:07:29.890> can<00:07:29.920> see<00:07:30.070> that's<00:07:30.310> changed

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
refresh and you can see that's changed

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.790 
refresh and you can see that's changed
to<00:07:30.880> Dale<00:07:31.150> at<00:07:31.690> some<00:07:32.050> domain.com

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
to Dale at some domain.com

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.680 
to Dale at some domain.com
so<00:07:33.490> that's<00:07:33.670> a<00:07:33.760> little<00:07:33.910> bit<00:07:34.090> about<00:07:34.300> why<00:07:34.630> you

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:34.690 
so that's a little bit about why you

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.990 
so that's a little bit about why you
should<00:07:35.110> use<00:07:35.830> this<00:07:36.010> method<00:07:36.400> as<00:07:36.520> much<00:07:36.820> as

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 
should use this method as much as

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.090 
should use this method as much as
possible<00:07:37.180> and<00:07:37.630> a<00:07:38.170> really<00:07:38.440> quick<00:07:38.710> and<00:07:38.830> easy<00:07:38.890> way

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.100 
possible and a really quick and easy way

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.780 
possible and a really quick and easy way
to<00:07:39.280> do<00:07:39.580> it<00:07:40.590> play<00:07:41.590> around<00:07:41.620> with<00:07:41.950> a<00:07:42.010> code<00:07:42.280> make<00:07:42.640> it

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:42.790 
to do it play around with a code make it

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.470 
to do it play around with a code make it
your<00:07:42.940> own<00:07:43.090> change<00:07:43.870> colors<00:07:44.290> change<00:07:44.590> font<00:07:44.890> sizes

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:45.480 
your own change colors change font sizes

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.210 
your own change colors change font sizes
and<00:07:46.480> I<00:07:46.990> wish<00:07:47.290> you<00:07:47.440> the<00:07:47.590> best<00:07:47.620> of<00:07:47.920> luck<00:07:48.160> with

and I wish you the best of luck with
creating<00:07:49.210> this<00:07:49.390> and<00:07:49.690> because<00:07:50.380> our<00:07:50.530> functions

creating this and because our functions

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.780 
creating this and because our functions
do<00:07:52.000> get<00:07:52.270> a<00:07:52.300> bit<00:07:52.510> tricky
