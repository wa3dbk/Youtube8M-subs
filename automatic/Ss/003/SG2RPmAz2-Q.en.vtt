adding hair to both sections twisting

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.589 
adding hair to both sections twisting
them<00:02:17.370> then<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.579> twist<00:02:18.849> that<00:02:19.090> strand<00:02:19.420> under

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
them then you twist that strand under

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.509

you're<00:02:58.840> twisting<00:02:59.230> both<00:02:59.410> strands<00:02:59.740> away<00:02:59.950> from

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
you're twisting both strands away from

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.160 
you're twisting both strands away from
your<00:03:00.280> face<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.790> pointing<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.810> front<00:03:02.050> one

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
twisting all the way to the end so you

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.780 
twisting all the way to the end so you
have<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.580> good<00:03:06.790> tension<00:03:07.060> on<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.690> braid<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:09.340> I'm

have a good tension on the braid and I'm

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.030 
have a good tension on the braid and I'm
just<00:03:09.970> going<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.240> finish<00:03:10.780> that<00:03:11.140> up<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.620> then

time and I'm going to tie off the end of

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.790 
time and I'm going to tie off the end of
that<00:03:18.010> braid<00:03:18.870> then<00:03:19.870> I'm<00:03:20.020> going<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.290> repeat<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
that braid then I'm going to repeat the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.500 
that braid then I'm going to repeat the
same<00:03:21.010> process<00:03:21.610> on<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.910> other<00:03:22.090> side<00:03:22.360> of<00:03:22.390> my

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
same process on the other side of my

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.210 
same process on the other side of my
head<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.930> I'll<00:03:23.290> explain<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.770> again<00:03:23.830> for<00:03:24.130> you

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
head and I'll explain it again for you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.220 
head and I'll explain it again for you
guys<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.390> always<00:03:25.600> start<00:03:25.900> with<00:03:25.990> two

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
guys so you always start with two

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.140 
guys so you always start with two
sections<00:03:26.680> for<00:03:26.890> rope<00:03:27.070> braid<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.520> you<00:03:27.940> twist

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
sections for rope braid and you twist

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.390 
sections for rope braid and you twist
both<00:03:28.390> strands<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.930> same<00:03:29.200> way<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.650> then<00:03:30.280> you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
both strands the same way and then you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.570 
both strands the same way and then you
put<00:03:30.640> one<00:03:30.970> underneath<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.990> other<00:03:32.080> one<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:33.310> kind

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
put one underneath the other one it kind

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.510 
put one underneath the other one it kind
of<00:03:33.610> depends<00:03:34.060> on<00:03:34.620> I<00:03:35.620> think<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.010> can<00:03:36.190> do<00:03:36.340> them<00:03:36.430> on

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
of depends on I think you can do them on

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.940 
of depends on I think you can do them on
the<00:03:36.610> other<00:03:36.790> way<00:03:36.970> but<00:03:37.300> I<00:03:37.330> usually<00:03:37.540> just<00:03:37.810> do<00:03:38.260> both

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
the other way but I usually just do both

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.570 
the other way but I usually just do both
away<00:03:39.220> from<00:03:39.250> my<00:03:39.670> face<00:03:39.940> when<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.170> do<00:03:42.130> rope<00:03:42.340> braids

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
away from my face when I do rope braids

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.720 
away from my face when I do rope braids
right<00:03:42.820> by<00:03:43.000> my<00:03:43.150> face<00:03:43.740> and<00:03:44.740> remember<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.520> always

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
right by my face and remember to always

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.640 
right by my face and remember to always
put<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.330> front<00:03:46.690> one<00:03:46.840> underneath<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.470> back

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
put the front one underneath the back

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.030 
put the front one underneath the back
one<00:03:47.890> as<00:03:48.390> long<00:03:49.390> as<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:49.660> kind<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:49.990> get<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.500> steps

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
one as long as you kind of get the steps

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.910 
one as long as you kind of get the steps
down<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:52.450> will<00:03:52.600> become<00:03:52.750> easy<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.410> is<00:03:53.470> very

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
down it will become easy it is very

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.820 
down it will become easy it is very
confusing<00:03:54.250> at<00:03:55.090> first<00:03:55.560> which<00:03:56.560> is<00:03:56.590> why<00:03:56.800> I

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
confusing at first which is why I

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.650 
confusing at first which is why I
recommend<00:03:57.310> maybe<00:03:57.580> if<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:58.030> haven't<00:03:58.360> done<00:03:58.450> any

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
recommend maybe if you haven't done any

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.470 
recommend maybe if you haven't done any
rope<00:03:58.900> rating<00:03:59.260> before<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.590> try<00:03:59.770> this<00:03:59.830> style

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
rope rating before you try this style

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.910 
rope rating before you try this style
definitely<00:04:01.480> don't<00:04:02.140> try<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.440> do<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.680> style

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
definitely don't try to do the style

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.050 
definitely don't try to do the style
right<00:04:03.100> before<00:04:03.400> an<00:04:03.459> event<00:04:03.550> if<00:04:03.790> you've<00:04:03.910> never

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
right before an event if you've never

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.630 
right before an event if you've never
had<00:04:04.270> any<00:04:04.420> experience<00:04:04.870> but<00:04:05.470> learn<00:04:05.800> how<00:04:06.070> to<00:04:06.130> rope

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
had any experience but learn how to rope

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.250 
had any experience but learn how to rope
braid<00:04:06.820> first<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.300> then<00:04:07.630> learn<00:04:07.840> how<00:04:07.990> to<00:04:08.050> French

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
braid first and then learn how to French

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.990 
braid first and then learn how to French
rope<00:04:08.440> braid<00:04:08.620> but<00:04:09.190> i<00:04:09.220> will<00:04:09.370> say<00:04:09.550> that<00:04:09.580> French

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
rope braid but i will say that French

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000 
rope braid but i will say that French
rope<00:04:10.240> rating<00:04:10.570> is<00:04:10.720> much<00:04:10.900> easier<00:04:11.110> on<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> smaller

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
rope rating is much easier on a smaller

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.310 
rope rating is much easier on a smaller
scale<00:04:12.310> like<00:04:12.490> this<00:04:12.550> then<00:04:13.480> trying<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.930> do<00:04:14.140> your

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
scale like this then trying to do your

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.090 
scale like this then trying to do your
whole<00:04:14.530> entire<00:04:14.680> head<00:04:15.100> it's<00:04:15.310> kind<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:15.940> hard<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.739> I

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
whole entire head it's kind of hard so I

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.039 
whole entire head it's kind of hard so I
just<00:04:18.370> incorporated<00:04:19.090> all<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.510> hair<00:04:19.690> from<00:04:19.840> that

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
just incorporated all the hair from that

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.210 
just incorporated all the hair from that
side<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.410> my<00:04:20.500> head<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:22.120> am<00:04:22.740> normal<00:04:23.740> braiding

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
side of my head and I am normal braiding

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.180 
side of my head and I am normal braiding
down<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:25.000> side<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:26.020> if<00:04:26.290> you<00:04:26.470> want<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:27.040> can

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
down this side and if you want you can

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.440 
down this side and if you want you can
just<00:04:27.250> sprayed<00:04:27.610> one<00:04:27.790> side<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.060> your<00:04:28.150> head<00:04:28.240> but<00:04:28.420> I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
just sprayed one side of your head but I

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.850 
just sprayed one side of your head but I
think<00:04:28.630> this<00:04:28.750> cell<00:04:28.990> looks<00:04:29.170> really<00:04:29.470> pretty<00:04:29.650> with

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
think this cell looks really pretty with

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.060 
think this cell looks really pretty with
both<00:04:30.040> sides<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.430> your<00:04:30.550> head<00:04:30.730> braided<00:04:31.950> so<00:04:32.950> yeah

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
both sides of your head braided so yeah

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.830 
both sides of your head braided so yeah
