 caress me and feel inside your heart 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:42.880
 that love is more than a look 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:46.000
 that the included words are not enough 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.630
 and that a kiss is nothing more than a 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.630
 emotion 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.460

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.950

 listen to your heart beating in a breeze 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.810

 with this love with this love 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.950
 the tonality in which this was recorded 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:16.319
 song by juan bau is the minor sun or 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.390
 be placing the fret capo in the 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.519
 third fret but most of 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.459
 we will not be able to sing this 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.549
 song at this height so that you can 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.620
 put the fret boss in the second in the 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.079
 first and if you still have high 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.909
 you can sing the sin capo fret good 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.349
 in this case to a post the field in the 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.150
 first fret 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.340
 that is, we are lowering a tone 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.170
 complete to the song the part of 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.500
 introduction that is repeated twice is 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.500
 is 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.209
 i 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:01.180
 and then go from the arpeggio to the thumb 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:06.120
 index and half annular index 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.120
 average index and index 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.940

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.610
 feature number 2 thumb down another 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.520

 thumb down and index up 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.670
 and in some parts you can skip the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:48.400
 last index up to give it 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:50.730
 variety this song is on the page 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.800
