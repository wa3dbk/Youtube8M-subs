yeah and I pretty advanced some of them

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.500 
yeah and I pretty advanced some of them
a<00:03:58.220> situation<00:03:58.670> some<00:03:58.819> of<00:03:58.880> them<00:03:58.970> are<00:03:59.060> practical

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
a situation some of them are practical

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.920 
a situation some of them are practical
but<00:03:59.980> by<00:04:00.980> practical<00:04:01.580> or<00:04:01.640> situational<00:04:02.270> both<00:04:02.810> the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
but by practical or situational both the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.710 
but by practical or situational both the
things<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.500> can<00:04:03.770> use<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.580> get<00:04:05.300> off<00:04:05.480> to

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
things that you can use to get off to

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.630 
things that you can use to get off to
gain<00:04:05.870> an<00:04:05.990> upper<00:04:06.050> hand

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.970 

and<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:09.630> just<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.050> just<00:04:10.080> gone<00:04:10.470> trainable<00:04:10.950> and

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
and I just I just gone trainable and

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.040 
and I just I just gone trainable and
find<00:04:11.430> situations<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:12.690> can<00:04:12.870> take

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
find situations that I can take

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.039 
find situations that I can take
advantage<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:15.209> just<00:04:15.420> try<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.660> release<00:04:15.900> it

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
advantage of and just try to release it

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.120 
advantage of and just try to release it
to<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.170> public<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.739> think<00:04:16.980> maybe<00:04:18.140> since<00:04:19.140> I've

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
to the public I think maybe since I've

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.190 
to the public I think maybe since I've
done<00:04:20.579> so<00:04:20.730> much<00:04:20.880> already<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.450> maybe<00:04:22.019> it's

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
done so much already that maybe it's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.400 
done so much already that maybe it's
time<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.350> give<00:04:22.500> back<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.120> show<00:04:24.120> people<00:04:24.410> what

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
time to give back and show people what

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.140 
time to give back and show people what
they<00:04:25.530> can<00:04:25.560> do<00:04:25.800> instead<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.400> keeping<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.970> to

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
they can do instead of keeping it to

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.620 
they can do instead of keeping it to
myself<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:28.680> think<00:04:28.919> it's<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.400> good<00:04:29.550> way<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:29.730> go

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
myself and I think it's a good way to go

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.940 
myself and I think it's a good way to go
about<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:30.870> all<00:04:31.410> right<00:04:31.530> talk<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.740> me<00:04:31.830> about

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
about it all right talk to me about

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.370 
about it all right talk to me about
