00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 and how about friends welcome 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.430
 once again we go with some news 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.440
 since windows 9 would be released in 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.360
 October 2014 and the start menu 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.759
 would be back new leaks 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.170
 point to that windows 9 will come in some 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.880
 moment of the next month of October 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.220
 bringing back one of the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.529
 strangest features of the system 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.330
 windows 9 is still on everyone's lips 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.920
 as a major update but not so 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.439
 drastic as the jump we saw between 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000
 windows 7 and windows 8 this update 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.789
 would define the changes we've already seen 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.619
 incorporated in windows 8.1 bringing 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.960
 return features that are so lacking 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.969
 make as many users in the world as 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.590
 is the famous start menu from 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.840
 beginnings of this same year have come 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.030
 talking about an upcoming update of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.239
 greater to the microsoft operating system 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.219
 that could be falling, it was expected that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 microsoft will present during the flight 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.140
 windows 9 thing that did not happen without 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.640
 But still the rumors do not stop falling 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.430
 about the next version of the system 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.989
 operative of the windows that would include 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.239
 different changes for those 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.399
 nostalgic users of windows 7 that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.769
 they received with torches the arrival of 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.050
 windows 8 a couple of years ago new 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.610
 rumors and captures 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.040
 to leaked could show that 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.840
 finally it will be like this and we will see the return 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.850
 of the acclaimed targeted functionality 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.200
 especially for the pleasure of 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.690
 windows users in mode 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.520
 desk with keyboard and mouse in their 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 beginnings windows 8 was focused almost by 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.210
 complete in the screen market 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.430
 tactile and as they would be in the present 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.140
 immediate according to redmond but the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.600
 criticisms and complaints rained on 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.570
 so Microsoft have had to 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.180
 several steps back for good or bad 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.980
 windows 9 would be a big change but not 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.140
 to the extreme as we are 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.810
 used to see between a version 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.420
 greater than windows and other some even 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.160
 they assure us that we could see it arrive as 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.250
 a free update for the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.230
 Windows 8.1 users or with a price 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.240
 almost symbolic everything to try 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.040
 amend what for many was a mistake 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.080
 although for others it was not 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.910
 be it the new windows 9 luce 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.980
 quite promising and personally 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.410
 I am sure that the famous menu of 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.360
 start will make many users 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.100
 feel like at home again 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.050
 the problem for microsoft and the 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.330
 developers is what will happen with the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.150
 applications and developers that 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.130
 they focused on 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.860
 of meeting the rumors windows 9 would be 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.260
