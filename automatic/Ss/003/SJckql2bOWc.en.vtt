00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.890
Alright!

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.629
This is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com,
I have another exciting and quick episode

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.629
for you.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.970
And this is actually how to get your figs
to ripen up a little bit faster.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.390
So you can see here I have a nice huge fig
tree, and you know I have, the majority of

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.270
the fruit are not ripening.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.279
And I do get an occasional fig ripening here
and there, but you know I want to have a nice

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.449
large meal of only figs, and I can’t do
that.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.369
I could have like one or two figs a day if
I’m lucky.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.000
But you can see on this branch, I mean we
have all these figs that are just not ripening

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.770
up, they’re still green.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.170
And you know, pretty soon we have maybe about
another 45 days, 30 to 45 days of weather

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.340
that’s conducive to the figs ripening and
then it’s going to frost and then guess

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.340
what?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.420
The figs not going to make it.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.600
And at that point when it gets too cold, the
fig tree’s going to lose all its leaves

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.910
like this they’re going to drop to the ground.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.570
So I’m either going to have to pick them
up, or they’re going to blow to my neighbor’s

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.039
house, and then also, at the end of every
year usually there’s lots of green figs

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.800
that are still on the tree that aren’t ripening
up.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.060
So then guess what?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.960
If I don’t pick them off they mold, so then
I’ve got to individually pick those off

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.140
and compost them or actually I heard you can
feed unripe figs to pigs, actually they love

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.220
them a lot.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.960
So, I mean there is a use for them, but nonetheless
the better use of the figs than the pigs or

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.040
the compost pile, my stomach right here.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.149
So we want to get these guys to ripen up a
little bit quicker.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.149
So how can you do that?

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.649
Well I’ve done some research online and
one of the ways is they say take some olive

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.860
oil and anoint your figs, because they’re
holy.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.729
Well actually wait, figs were mentioned in
the Bible.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.659
But anyways you want to put a little dab of
olive oil in the bottom of the fig.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.789
You know, some people say that works, some
people say it doesn’t work, but many people

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.159
say it may change the flavor of the figs and
I definitely don’t want to do that.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.090
So I just thought about it a little bit and
said “Hey you know what?

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.799
This tree’s going to lose all its leaves
pretty soon, so why don’t we just make it

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.890
lose its leaves earlier?”

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.930
I know when I visit Hawaii on Maui actually
on Haleakala, there’s people growing peaches

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.200
in the tropics, and they get them to ripen
up.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.010
I’m like “How does that work, how do they
do it?”

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.900
Well they force the plant to think it’s
the winter time by removing all its leaves

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.230
to get them to ripen up.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.750
So I figured “Hey, let’s do that with
the fig tree.”

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.910
So that’s what I’m doing today I’m just
cutting back some of these leaves, take it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.780
off, I mean they’re going to come off later
so I may as well take them off now.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.900
I’m also cutting some of the tip ends off.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.400
So here’s a tip end where the growth tip
is, and also a smaller fig.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.460
So what this does is because you know, and
you can see actually the fig sap dripping

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.890
out right there, and actually that stuff can
be caustic, so you don’t want to get it

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.490
on you too much.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.590
But that’s the fig sap, or that’s like
the life blood, or the blood of the fig tree.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.700
Now all this fig sap goes to the leaves, goes
to the fruits and goes to the end buds to

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.790
have them grow more.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.459
And so what happens when you cut this off,
it’s going to try to shoot out, depending,

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.400
or it’s going to try to just basically get
the fruit to ripen up.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.030
So what we’re doing is we’re just going
to clip these leaves to see if it’s going

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.030
to ripen up.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.500
But actually we don’t need to see because
about a week ago we did just that on the other

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.780
side of the tree, and we stripped it of all
the leaves.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.000
And guess what, the figs are ripening up.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.650
So let’s take a look at that next.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.590
So you could see here, this is a stripped
down fig tree, and today’s a little bit

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.420
of a windy day we’re blowing in the wind
but, when we stripped all the leaves off this

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.090
side of the tree, all these figs were all
green, well maybe two of them were kind of

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.090
turning ripe.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.040
But now you can see, we have a ripe one here,
this one here’s ripe, this one here’s

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.680
getting ripe, this one’s actually ready
to go.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.950
How can you tell if a fig’s ripe, you can
see like, on this one is unripe it’s nice

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.689
and straight but as they get ripe this actually
will bend down.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:03.260
Oh you know here’s one that’s super ripe,
check it out, I mean this one is so ripe it’s

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.319
splitting on the tree and actually I’m getting
some fruit flies.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.500
So this is the time to pick this and eat it,
and let me show you these guys, these are

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.390
brown turkey figs.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.530
Man that’s one ripe fig, could be a little
bit riper.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.210
But in any case, here’s some more ones up
here, ripening up, oh man this one’s actually

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.210
optimal.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.630
So I want to encourage you guys to pick your
figs and all your fruits when they’re at

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.750
their peak ripeness.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.090
So here’s one, nice and soft.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.910
Oh man look at that in there that’s much
better than that last one, nice and jelly.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.410
The other thing I want you guys to notice
on this side of the tree is besides all those

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.990
figs that were all green now they’re getting
some color to them.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.740
They’re starting to turn color, oh and getting
a little bit soft.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.200
So I do think that this technique has been
helpful to get my figs to ripen up now of

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.100
course, we’re 30 to 45 days away from the
frost, when there’s going to be nothing

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.100
left.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.210
Now would I do this at the beginning of the
season to get my figs to ripen up earlier?

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.210
No.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.300
These figs were already at a fairly mature
point that they just need a kick in the butt

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.240
to ripen up, and I think by trimming the ends
off and cutting all the leaves off, it’s

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.380
definitely worked.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.070
So that’s the report this time, that’s
one way you can skin a fig.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.710
I mean make your figs ripen up.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.850
So hopefully you’ve enjoyed this episode,
learning how to defoliate a fig and get them

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.850
to ripen up.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.580
Once again my name is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com,
we’ll see you next time and remember, keep

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.620
on growing.
