Stewart's<00:00:17.609> quite<00:00:17.850> an<00:00:17.940> experienced<00:00:18.510> runner

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
Stewart's quite an experienced runner

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.740 
Stewart's quite an experienced runner
he's<00:00:19.020> been<00:00:19.140> running<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.529> over<00:00:19.590> 30<00:00:19.949> years<00:00:20.750> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
he's been running for over 30 years the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.790 
he's been running for over 30 years the
first<00:00:21.960> way<00:00:22.109> we're<00:00:22.260> going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.439> look<00:00:22.529> at<00:00:22.650> today

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
first way we're going to look at today

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.740 
first way we're going to look at today
regarding<00:00:23.369> Stuart's<00:00:23.730> running<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.539> is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
regarding Stuart's running this is

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.019 
regarding Stuart's running this is
excess<00:00:25.199> lateral<00:00:25.710> movement<00:00:26.189> by<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.000> mean

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
excess lateral movement by this I mean

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.120 
excess lateral movement by this I mean
is<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> bobbing<00:00:27.900> side<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.349> side<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.859> body

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
is the bobbing side to side of this body

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.669 
is the bobbing side to side of this body
this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> very<00:00:29.789> inefficient<00:00:30.210> movement<00:00:30.960> this

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this is a very inefficient movement this

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.350 
this is a very inefficient movement this
is<00:00:31.830> actually<00:00:32.130> causing<00:00:32.309> Stewart<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> waste<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
is actually causing Stewart to waste a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.819 
is actually causing Stewart to waste a
lot<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.540> energy<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:34.350> he's<00:00:34.440> spending<00:00:34.649> his

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
lot of energy because he's spending his

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
lot of energy because he's spending his
time<00:00:34.950> bobbing<00:00:35.579> side<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.969> side<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.480> really

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
time bobbing side to side when really

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.720 
time bobbing side to side when really
should<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.230> forwards<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.340> increase<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
should be going forwards to increase the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.340 
should be going forwards to increase the
deficiency<00:00:39.300> we're<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.780> aiming<00:00:40.170> for

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
deficiency we're going to be aiming for

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380 
deficiency we're going to be aiming for
Stuart's<00:00:40.680> head<00:00:40.890> bounce<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.120> very

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
Stuart's head bounce just to be very

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.470 
Stuart's head bounce just to be very
small<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> downward<00:00:43.710> movement<00:00:44.329> if<00:00:45.329> we

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
small up and downward movement if we

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
small up and downward movement if we
start<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> work<00:00:45.930> our<00:00:46.110> way<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> look

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
start to work our way up and have a look

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.950 
start to work our way up and have a look
at<00:00:47.250> Stewart's<00:00:47.700> arms<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.480> now<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.809> how

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
at Stewart's arms we can now see how

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.389 
at Stewart's arms we can now see how
they're<00:00:49.110> rotating<00:00:49.320> right<00:00:49.980> across<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
they're rotating right across the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.310 
they're rotating right across the
midline<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.730> his<00:00:51.000> body<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> also<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
midline of his body this is also a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.139 
midline of his body this is also a
position<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.579> racing<00:00:53.940> him<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
position that's going to be racing him a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.290 
position that's going to be racing him a
lot<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> energy<00:00:55.370> if<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.489> look<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.000> from<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
lot of energy if we look at it from the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
lot of energy if we look at it from the
side<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.289> identify<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.920> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
side of what we can identify as it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.920 
side of what we can identify as it
should<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.609> actually<00:00:59.879> over-striding<00:01:00.510> when

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
should it's actually over-striding when

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
should it's actually over-striding when
he<00:01:01.050> runs<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.800> means<00:01:02.070> he's<00:01:02.250> landing<00:01:02.550> ahead

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
he runs this means he's landing ahead

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
he runs this means he's landing ahead
every<00:01:02.969> center<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.449> gravity<00:01:03.809> therefore

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
every center of gravity therefore

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
every center of gravity therefore
increasing<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> braking<00:01:05.309> forces<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.820> his

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
increasing the braking forces on his

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.640 
increasing the braking forces on his
body<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> causing<00:01:07.140> him<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> spend<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
body this is causing him to spend a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.859 
body this is causing him to spend a
longer<00:01:07.830> contact<00:01:08.250> time<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> floor<00:01:09.119> deck<00:01:09.659> or

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
longer contact time on the floor deck or

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.929 
longer contact time on the floor deck or
and<00:01:10.110> able<00:01:10.290> him<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> slow<00:01:10.740> myself<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:11.159> what

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and able him to slow myself down what

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.130 
and able him to slow myself down what
could<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.180> him<00:01:12.240> more<00:01:12.450> prone<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.720> injuring

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
could make him more prone to injuring

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.590 
could make him more prone to injuring
himself<00:01:13.350> what<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.340> also<00:01:14.520> shows<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.000> she's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
himself what this also shows that she's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.570 
himself what this also shows that she's
under<00:01:15.990> using<00:01:16.290> his<00:01:16.439> some<00:01:16.650> hamstrings<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.460> his

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
under using his some hamstrings and his

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.340 
under using his some hamstrings and his
glute<00:01:17.850> muscles<00:01:18.270> therefore<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:18.869> quadricep

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
glute muscles therefore these quadricep

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.990 
glute muscles therefore these quadricep
muscles<00:01:19.710> are<00:01:19.770> overtaking<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.790> causing

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
muscles are overtaking which is causing

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.160 
muscles are overtaking which is causing
him<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.420> over<00:01:21.780> stride

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.990 

we'll<00:01:26.530> see<00:01:26.710> in<00:01:26.830> this<00:01:26.950> second<00:01:27.369> group<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.670> clips

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
we'll see in this second group of clips

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.670 
we'll see in this second group of clips
that<00:01:28.150> we<00:01:28.390> have<00:01:28.479> now<00:01:28.630> increased<00:01:28.840> Stuart's<00:01:29.439> heel

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
that we have now increased Stuart's heel

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.380 
that we have now increased Stuart's heel
lift<00:01:29.979> this<00:01:30.250> has<00:01:30.369> increased<00:01:30.640> his<00:01:30.850> use<00:01:31.119> of<00:01:31.150> his

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
lift this has increased his use of his

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.810 
lift this has increased his use of his
hamstrings<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.110> his<00:01:32.320> glute<00:01:32.590> muscles<00:01:33.070> this<00:01:33.640> in

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
hamstrings and his glute muscles this in

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.130 
hamstrings and his glute muscles this in
turn<00:01:33.850> will<00:01:34.060> enable<00:01:34.390> him<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.630> learn<00:01:34.840> more

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
turn will enable him to learn more

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.149 
turn will enable him to learn more
underneath<00:01:35.380> his<00:01:35.649> center<00:01:36.040> of<00:01:36.070> gravity

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
underneath his center of gravity

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.020 
underneath his center of gravity
therefore<00:01:37.090> decreasing<00:01:37.540> his<00:01:38.170> over-striding

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
therefore decreasing his over-striding

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.730 
therefore decreasing his over-striding
you<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.180> see<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.509> change<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.960> Stewart's<00:01:41.380> arms

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
you can see the change in Stewart's arms

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.649 
you can see the change in Stewart's arms
that<00:01:41.830> we<00:01:41.950> have<00:01:42.070> made<00:01:42.310> he<00:01:42.789> is<00:01:42.909> now<00:01:43.090> driving<00:01:43.539> his

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
that we have made he is now driving his

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.149 
that we have made he is now driving his
arm<00:01:43.840> straight<00:01:44.200> forward<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.710> backwards<00:01:45.039> just

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
arm straight forward and backwards just

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.770 
arm straight forward and backwards just
from<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.460> shoulders<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.119> his<00:01:46.270> torso<00:01:46.539> is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
from the shoulders and his torso is

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.590 
from the shoulders and his torso is
remaining<00:01:47.140> very<00:01:47.530> stable<00:01:48.330> change<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.479> you've

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
remaining very stable change that you've

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.749 
remaining very stable change that you've
seen<00:01:49.750> shoe<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.140> mate<00:01:50.289> today<00:01:50.619> we're<00:01:51.280> only<00:01:51.399> after

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
seen shoe it mate today we're only after

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.130 
seen shoe it mate today we're only after
an<00:01:51.850> hour<00:01:52.000> session<00:01:52.450> at<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.570> running<00:01:52.869> school

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
an hour session at the running school

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.690 
an hour session at the running school
therefore<00:01:53.680> these<00:01:53.770> changes<00:01:54.280> are<00:01:54.399> not

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
therefore these changes are not

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.029 
therefore these changes are not
permanent<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.750> enable<00:01:56.049> these<00:01:56.140> changes<00:01:56.560> to

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
permanent to enable these changes to

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.770 
permanent to enable these changes to
develop<00:01:57.460> further<00:01:57.700> into<00:01:58.090> becoming<00:01:58.270> into<00:01:58.659> your

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
develop further into becoming into your

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.630 
develop further into becoming into your
natural<00:01:59.409> running<00:01:59.619> technique<00:01:59.920> what<00:02:00.399> sure<00:02:00.580> it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
natural running technique what sure it

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.889 
natural running technique what sure it
would<00:02:00.759> have<00:02:00.789> to<00:02:01.030> do<00:02:01.179> we<00:02:01.420> have<00:02:01.509> lots<00:02:01.750> of

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
would have to do we have lots of

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.660 
would have to do we have lots of
practice<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.560> also<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.979> follow<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.340> strength

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
practice and also to follow a strength

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.460 
practice and also to follow a strength
program<00:02:03.909> they<00:02:04.479> would<00:02:04.600> able<00:02:04.869> to<00:02:05.020> strengthen<00:02:05.229> up

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
program they would able to strengthen up

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.779 
program they would able to strengthen up
the<00:02:05.619> weak<00:02:05.770> areas<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.280> are<00:02:06.369> found<00:02:06.490> in<00:02:06.670> is

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
the weak areas that are found in is

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.910 
the weak areas that are found in is
running<00:02:07.060> technique<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:08.170> after<00:02:08.350> changed<00:02:08.769> your

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
running technique so after changed your

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.039 
running technique so after changed your
technique<00:02:09.340> what<00:02:09.970> we<00:02:10.090> hope<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.600> enable<00:02:10.989> you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
technique what we hope this enable you

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.210 
technique what we hope this enable you
to<00:02:11.110> do<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.500> runners<00:02:11.739> goal<00:02:11.920> would<00:02:12.040> be<00:02:12.100> to

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
to do it the runners goal would be to

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.610 
to do it the runners goal would be to
run<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.610> lot<00:02:12.850> more<00:02:12.970> efficiently<00:02:13.620> hopefully

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
run a lot more efficiently hopefully

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.259 
run a lot more efficiently hopefully
prevent<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:14.980> from<00:02:15.010> injuring<00:02:15.489> yourself<00:02:15.970> and

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
prevent you from injuring yourself and

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.130 
prevent you from injuring yourself and
in<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.569> long<00:02:16.720> run<00:02:16.780> become<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> lot<00:02:17.560> faster
