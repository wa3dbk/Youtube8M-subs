00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.509
 milk chocolate and its flair of strawberries 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.279

 more appropriate we will incorporate the 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.840
 sugar we always commit strong and sugar 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.180
 on the other hand it makes it possible to take 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.940
 more easily once the sugar 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.800

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.170
 to avoid all the lumps every 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.400
 rome subscribers there it'll just harden it's 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.390
 normal that the flour will thicken 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.170
 four yards and the apparatus of my 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.170

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.270
 this is the device then ends up a 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.490
 butter ramekin especially not hesitate 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.049

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.420
 spent him minutes in the oven and then 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.530
 the moldings and then that everything breaks 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.100
 the exit so there you hesitate so 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.070

 not too big to avoid touching 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 edges and then we end with 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:21.459
 the device and have recourse the ball of 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:26.060
 ice and so their ovens 250 degrees 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.230
