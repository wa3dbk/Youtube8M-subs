00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
is probably the controller and then the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.060 
is probably the controller and then the
bubble<00:00:19.050> wrap<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.199> then<00:00:19.470> after<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.800> probably

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
bubble wrap and then after that probably

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.040
