00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
standards you know sure we got a higher

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.980 
standards you know sure we got a higher
standard<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.119> living<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.600> also<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
standard of living but we also have a

pretty darn soon if we don't respect
them<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.080> anyway<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.070> did<00:02:49.430> manage<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.880> ramble<00:02:50.300> a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
them so anyway I did manage to ramble a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.150 
them so anyway I did manage to ramble a
bit<00:02:50.390> more<00:02:50.690> than<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:50.990> expected<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.650> for<00:02:51.980> not

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
bit more than I expected to for not

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.730 
bit more than I expected to for not
having<00:02:52.400> any<00:02:52.550> prepared<00:02:52.910> remarks<00:02:53.050> but<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.110> think

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
having any prepared remarks but I think

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.230 
having any prepared remarks but I think
it's<00:02:55.040> important<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.460> get<00:02:55.550> on<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.820> questions

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
it's important to get on to questions

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.180 
it's important to get on to questions
and<00:02:57.050> find<00:02:57.320> out<00:02:57.440> what's<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.680> your<00:02:57.890> mind

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
and find out what's on your mind

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.300 
and find out what's on your mind
so<00:02:58.430> thanks<00:02:58.850> very<00:02:59.000> much<00:02:59.120> for<00:02:59.240> listening
