00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
project is of course a glue gun and glue

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.779 
project is of course a glue gun and glue
sticks<00:00:24.990> don't<00:00:25.529> forget<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
sticks don't forget this one this is the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
sticks don't forget this one this is the
main<00:00:27.119> part<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> whole<00:00:27.720> project<00:00:28.230> okay<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
main part of the whole project okay and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.009 
main part of the whole project okay and
then<00:00:29.340> you're<00:00:29.400> also<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> need<00:00:30.240> an<00:00:30.480> old<00:00:30.720> CD

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
then you're also going to need an old CD

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.280 
then you're also going to need an old CD
or<00:00:31.380> disco<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:32.250> sort<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.360> let's<00:00:33.570> begin<00:00:33.809> all

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
or disco some sort so let's begin all

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889 
or disco some sort so let's begin all
you're<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.040> doing<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.090> DIY<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you're really doing for this DIY is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
you're really doing for this DIY is
gluing<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.410> different<00:00:37.800> textures<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.579> your

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
gluing on different textures to your

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.200 
gluing on different textures to your
disc<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:40.050> first<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> large<00:00:41.579> dot

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
disc this first one is a large dot

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
disc this first one is a large dot
texture<00:00:43.140> all<00:00:43.440> you're<00:00:43.829> doing<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.190> gluing<00:00:44.489> on

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
texture all you're doing is gluing on

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.420 
texture all you're doing is gluing on
large<00:00:45.000> dots<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> far<00:00:46.379> apart<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.890> too<00:00:47.129> far

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
large dots kind of far apart not too far

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
large dots kind of far apart not too far
but<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.789> too<00:00:48.000> close<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.620> really

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
but not too close and this is really

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250 
but not too close and this is really
good<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.340> cleaning<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:51.059> large<00:00:51.329> face<00:00:51.629> brushes

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
good for cleaning out large face brushes

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.420 
good for cleaning out large face brushes
and<00:00:52.649> brushes<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> are<00:00:54.680> much<00:00:55.680> bigger<00:00:55.920> than<00:00:56.219> an

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and brushes that are much bigger than an

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.970 
and brushes that are much bigger than an
eyeshadow<00:00:57.000> brush<00:00:57.360> basically<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.590> second

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
eyeshadow brush basically the second

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.290 
eyeshadow brush basically the second
texture<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.370> we're<00:00:59.550> doing<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> squiggly

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
texture that we're doing is a squiggly

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
texture that we're doing is a squiggly
texture<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.050> one's<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.469> good<00:01:01.710> for

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
texture this one's really good for

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.340 
texture this one's really good for
rinsing<00:01:02.370> your<00:01:02.640> brushes<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
rinsing your brushes and all you have to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.960 
rinsing your brushes and all you have to
do<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:05.010> draw<00:01:05.280> little<00:01:05.610> squiggles

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
do is you know draw little squiggles

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.929 
do is you know draw little squiggles
have<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.390> fun<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.490> just<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
have some fun with it and just kind of

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.510 
have some fun with it and just kind of
take<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.659> smaller<00:01:10.080> portion<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.860> probably

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
take up a smaller portion it's probably

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.429 
take up a smaller portion it's probably
a<00:01:11.640> smallest<00:01:12.240> area<00:01:12.450> you're<00:01:12.750> gonna<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.140> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
a smallest area you're gonna have I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
a smallest area you're gonna have I
added<00:01:14.070> some<00:01:14.220> warmth<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.700> large<00:01:14.909> dots<00:01:15.180> just

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
added some warmth a large dots just

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.630 
added some warmth a large dots just
because<00:01:15.720> they're<00:01:16.080> larger<00:01:16.470> brushes<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.580> you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
because they're larger brushes so you

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
because they're larger brushes so you
need<00:01:18.030> more<00:01:18.210> area<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.110> next<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
need more area this next one is a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.700 
need more area this next one is a
crosshatch<00:01:20.460> pattern<00:01:20.900> now<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
crosshatch pattern now we have the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
crosshatch pattern now we have the
crosshatch<00:01:23.250> pattern<00:01:23.310> which<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.360> just

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
crosshatch pattern which is just

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.420 
crosshatch pattern which is just
basically<00:01:25.229> crosshatch<00:01:26.780> lines<00:01:27.780> going

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
basically crosshatch lines going

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.679 
basically crosshatch lines going
parallel<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:29.970> other<00:01:30.210> lines<00:01:30.479> going

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
parallel and then other lines going

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.050 
parallel and then other lines going
perpendicular<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.549> perfect<00:01:32.909> for

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
perpendicular and this is perfect for

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.160 
perpendicular and this is perfect for
eyeliner<00:01:33.420> brushes<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.909> small

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
eyeliner brushes now we have a small

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.840 
eyeliner brushes now we have a small
dotted<00:01:37.170> pattern<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.979> exactly<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.549> same<00:01:38.700> as

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
dotted pattern it's exactly the same as

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.730 
dotted pattern it's exactly the same as
the<00:01:38.939> large<00:01:39.150> dots<00:01:39.450> except<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.290> much

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the large dots except for there's much

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.370 
the large dots except for there's much
smaller<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.430> closer<00:01:41.909> together<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.020> you're

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
smaller and closer together so you're

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.719 
smaller and closer together so you're
probably<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.860> fit<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> lot<00:01:44.310> more<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.640> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
probably going to fit a lot more in a

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.179 
probably going to fit a lot more in a
line<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:46.140> don't<00:01:46.320> need<00:01:46.470> as<00:01:46.649> much<00:01:46.680> space<00:01:47.130> as

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
line and you don't need as much space as

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.520 
line and you don't need as much space as
they<00:01:47.490> did<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> larger<00:01:48.360> dots<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.200> they

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
they did for the larger dots but they

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.319 
they did for the larger dots but they

now for the crosshatch you can use the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.740 
now for the crosshatch you can use the
crosshatch<00:02:34.310> for<00:02:34.579> eyeliner<00:02:35.030> brushes<00:02:35.329> and

smudger brushes and it just cleans it

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.300 
smudger brushes and it just cleans it
out<00:02:38.540> much<00:02:38.810> faster<00:02:39.110> because<00:02:39.379> generally<00:02:40.129> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
out much faster because generally the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.860 
out much faster because generally the
eyeshadow<00:02:40.670> gets<00:02:40.910> really<00:02:41.209> packed<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.750> there

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
eyeshadow gets really packed in there

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.099 
eyeshadow gets really packed in there
and<00:02:42.079> this<00:02:42.500> gets<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.860> out<00:02:42.950> really<00:02:43.730> easily<00:02:44.109> then

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
and this gets it out really easily then

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.500 
and this gets it out really easily then
for<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.560> large<00:02:45.769> dots<00:02:46.069> I'm<00:02:46.519> using<00:02:46.879> a<00:02:47.150> stippling

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
for the large dots I'm using a stippling

takes forever using this it still takes
a<00:03:02.060> long<00:03:02.239> time<00:03:02.269> but<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.260> goes<00:03:03.500> by<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:04.130> much

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250
