00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello dear viewers today 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.139
 I would like to show you how to modern 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:14.460
 laptops can be counted and flash multi 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.029
 controller on most platforms 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.859
 This is used here is a chip 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.580
 and then to b 90 cm or there 9010 edges there 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.949
 there are modifications of these multi controllers 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.560
 they have built in 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.360
 flash catch and where poured on 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.550
 factory right firmware means this 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.559
 firmware sometimes she flies the laptop 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 stopped turning on tomilin there not 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.420
 reacts to the power button here and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.340
 aside from a separate bios chip 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.340
 here for example such yes here still is 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
 firmware in this go out control and 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 means how to do it just means 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.820
 can be right on the motherboard fit 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.770
 output solder and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.220
 read the programmer and write this 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.119
 a chip but there is a simpler version there 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.159
 what programmer 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.090
 it consists of two parts it is proper 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.560
 the programmer itself is the keyboard one 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.470
 the module that allows us this 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.020
 Directly connect the programmer to the connector 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.689
 keyboard on the motherboard there 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.390
 These contacts are actually derived from flour. 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.189
 controller they are also present here in 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.369
 this connector 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.210
 so here we connect our 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.229
 keyboard module into the keyboard connector 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.329
 connect the power to the motherboard 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.090
 connect the programmer and 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.439
 can be considered to write how it looks 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 at the program level I am with you now 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.009
 I will show so we run the software 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.020
 providing that use our 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.520
 programmer 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.350
 we need to adjust it very klaviaturku 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 here in a special menu to put what 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.590
 pins match pin on clave tone 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:13.280
 connectors of this moment we flash 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:17.849
 flour controller here this boar 9012 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.750
 lpp means the conclusions that he uses 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.660
 for firmware 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:27.500
 it's 42 to so3 59 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.840
 60 and 61 62 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.590
 these conclusions they all ring the connector itself 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.760
 keyboards and to find out what's on there 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.890
 we just called them we 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.060
 With multimeters we look at the scheme if the scheme 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.849
 no then multimeter 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.840
 Well, respectively, in this window, we 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:52.319
 we expose what pins where we go 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.690
 here for example 4 pin keyboard connector 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.269
 corresponds to 60 second back multi 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.420
 controller and so similarly in this 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.420
 vidos 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.440
 we select now from the list this snavy 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.359
 Turku 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.269
 I ask this place motherboard 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.069
 forgiveness so now we can 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.880
 connect the power to the mother itself 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.880
 fee 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.380
 Here we read that multi 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.500
 the controller that we use 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.569
 this is the center of aigi it is 4 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.140
 and now we can read it let's 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.140
 we honor 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.120
 read means here we can 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.220
 see what we have here obviously 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.220
 we have some information something on 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.600
 save this file 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.740
 Well, if three microcircuit to 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.740
 make sure that it works there 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.010
 now read 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.860
 Here is the microcircuit we have clean 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.310
 there is nothing well and let's try that 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:24.860
 request files 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:24.860
 this is what we had in it was bright 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.580
 there is no give and now we read it 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:15.520
 read reviewed information about him 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.060
 written like this literally for 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.460
 5 minutes 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.030
 readable stitched valke controller 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.360
 on motherboards and thank you for 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.500
 view subscribe to our channel 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.979
 if you like this video put 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.470
 huskies 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.470
 we will be pleased with all the best
