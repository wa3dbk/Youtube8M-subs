00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello everyone I'm eduard 98 cr how do you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.970
 I hope you are good 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.740
 video I did it because so many what of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.290
 they know the suffering of making a 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.929
 video but some of you do not stop 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.460
 to say we do the videos 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.350
 rushing us and you have to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.630
 know that one strives to make this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.000
 video come out well so I've compiled 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.279
 some files of my videos so that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.109
 see that it is not easy to make a good video 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.390
 fact that effort is required 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.640
 and how these videos are just videos without 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.950
 What will I teach you what would be your 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.110
 title and I'll put the loquendo that was going to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.210
 say good this video was going to be a 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.700
 video of the Ericsson cult presence 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.550
 in gta 4 but use the the ballad of gay 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.829
 tony and how will you know in this gta put the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.170
 helicopter missile launcher that led me to 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.390
 a stupid file good as they see the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.120
 building has blue lights like the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.140
 gta san andreas farm but it will be 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.140
 this is its location 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.749
 [Music] 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.010
 well this video was going to be a short 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.200
 parody of the zombie series 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.150
 walking dead the problem was that everything was 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.820
 they entangled their lines and did not understand anything 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.009
 there were also problems with the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.820
 kayak that did not respond to what 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.770
 he sent shit what is that to help 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.080
 after that someone would come 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.540
 could save the problem was that I said 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.180
 clearly just travel you get in the car 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.149
 however just made salt dough is cracked 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.040
 then they go up then they start firing 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.320
 this city is empty because we had it 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.990
 what to do in the wire world and since the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.130
 they do not hate much yet they still followed 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.230
 delegating 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.170
 [Music] 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.730
 this video we did recently helped 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.220
 to a friend to make a video of 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.900
 skydiving by all san andreas without 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.240
 However, the place of the jump was very 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.670
 small and cost much indeed to 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.340
 friend who helped is almost power look for his 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.780
 channel in the description almost already almost 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.780
 yes or no 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:17.009
 [Music] 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.300
 then he gave me crack so I had to 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.910
 re-enter but I got a 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.800
 surprise that the server is full but 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.780
 they'll be fucking bastards when they 've 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.080
 updated the wef at least they would have 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.910
 expanded capacity fuck this video 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.800
 It was one I did when you gave me shot 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.530
 I went to the tower of saints and I 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.360
 I put the 2009 water so I would tax everything 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.610
 this was going to youtube 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.310
 mysteries of is san andreas not so 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.710
 common 2 good as you see you see all the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.930
 map but it disappears this must have been 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.520
 a climate to test the good gta 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.560
 except that's my theory 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.520
 here there were two files first the north 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.780
 flying 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.780
 and the clown does not 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.880
 second file this 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.530
 I shit on these shit crash 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.990
 this video I did a couple of 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.630
 weeks was a tutorial on how to drive 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.700
 in gta 4 however here there was a file 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.980
 tremendous since a bad turn took me to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.050
 a building that gives you 4 stars from 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.150
 search the part when they gave me not what 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.910
 I recorded because the franz had been dived 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.220
 but I did record the rest I loaded some 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.320
 cops but they gave me 6 stars like that 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.650
 that I stole a buffalo and I was able to recover 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.270
 my life and armor of pure guaba 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.610
 policemen you are the most 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.920
 stupid people in the world do not know how to chase 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.720
 nor a snail transporting a piano 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.230
 in a building with five stairs 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.210
 flats in new york 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.700
 [Music] 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.740
 after this the gta I was bujeo and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.500
 I had to restart the game as I 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.330
 I remember this easy because in that 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.370
 moment I got really mad at these 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.290
 moments always recorded everything I do 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.510
 for my next stupid video 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.580
 only that this video was after the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.130
 google weather that gave me crash so no 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:14.520
 leave me alone 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:14.520
 [Music] 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.250
 after this I was full of patience and 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.990
 restart the computer then it went back to 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.450
 try to enter to wish but I took 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.790
 another little surprise 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:33.370
 [Music] 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.100
 and it was something like that alone without the breastplate 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.530
 neither the keyboard and the mouse nor the monitor 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.020
 neither the video card nor the card 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.210
 sound or the cpu because everything sent to 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.220
 take for good ass in fact is that well 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.040
 I feel when I get angry doing a 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.720
 good video friends this was all I hope 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.730
 that have understood what it feels like 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.140
 make a video of the devil as is the what 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:05:09.309

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:09.309
