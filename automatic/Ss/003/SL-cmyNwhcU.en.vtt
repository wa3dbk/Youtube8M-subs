00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.130
 to all kids who are as you are 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.450
 watching on the channel you are watching from 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.810
 background a game that I stayed 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.580
 freaking out I did not get mad at how it was 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.590
 flipping I got the laugh 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.660
 it is that you get to see how I eat 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.550
 people are hunting and to see how you 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.250
 kill and such and that is contrary to tell you 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.410
 the jacket waiting for the jacket more 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.090
 game you know the game more jacket than 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.039
 I could find myself in this 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.900
 white two quiet do not go and put 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.670
 in the comments my mother tigers then 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.619
 well this is not I found myself with 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.109
 Much more customer jacket worth 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.670
 It's quiet, calm. 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.260
 I really enjoyed the game because 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.969
 they would camp if you have a game with 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.350
 with the people of the six who do not 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.510
 move there like a white finder 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.829
 ok I understand but good this game 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.749
 I was playing myself only from the beginning if 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.489
 it was a first cry and as it is called 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.620
 this uncle maximus did not have the emblem 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.350
 of batman looked there as highs I do not know 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.929
 what then that uncle and another more in particular 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.269
 is going to give quite a game in the game not 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.089
 I went to see until the limit leads 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.499
 came this this camper ism and good 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.850
 I bring you the game the game is 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.739
 a fucking Sixt shit at the end that I 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.540
 she got a bit of a streak but she's a whore 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.620
 shit because you're going to see the UCAM 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.390
 so that people 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.840
 in this part they kill me numerous times 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.390
 with an uncle that I think this guy is 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.970
 leave here with the peacekeeper if it is 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.770
 who are campers with knowledge with 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.300
 criteria are already true 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.430
 level and that site that just killed me 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.800
 Well now it gets there, as I have 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.300
 much resentment for I'm going back to him and 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.340
 he does not stop killing me like this all the time you see 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.410
 there it is again they are campers and 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.540
 trained that know how to position yourself 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.040
 how to position themselves and they are not 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.780
 champions that the typical ones that are 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.610
 gawking that you go down your back and you 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.230
 kill is not that the back have it 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.240
 covered with clay mos with loads of 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.830
 shock and also that they have points 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.830
 reflexes these campers that you are going to 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.500
 them and waits and they respond fast good 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.550
 after this speech the game I'm going 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.690
 to stop fund because its good is 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.150
 also from the starting one that does not have 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.340
 for nothing much much interesting thing 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.320
 simply the camper ism for example 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.270
 to the maximum is already here behind the haystack 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.490
 that kills me in the head with the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.320
 seeker whites all the time like this 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.640
 I want to comment on my plans for gta zin 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.229
 with the zombie streaming that by 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.940
 true forgiveness yesterday because he wants to do 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.250
 a streaming but as I am so extremely 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.960
 delayed me buzz in the round is that 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.990
 I have to make a fool are 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.880
 in round 35 I start slashing 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.920
 a zombie explains from what point 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.450
 reasoning has those kids in the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.950
 thirtysomething network for rafa sanz 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.690
 or my son operated on me but if you have a 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.760
 fucking ice cane that what you can 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.900
 do it perfect things so that at 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.820
 final I stay saying my mother is 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.290
 opposed by twitter or by twitter said I am 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.730
 very asshole and that's why there will be no 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.140
 There will be streaming but I still want 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.990

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.520
 the chungo in deep deep in 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.200
 depth and see what round sends 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.520
 because good if you gave me was of 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.350
 galley streaming I do not know if what 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.930
 you will know conca workshop and such with vicent 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.010
 and then we were there galley was 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.900
 trying out the improved kid that by 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.850
 true he saw it from my video good not 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.340
 I got to the top and we met a 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.350
 little here and such and in round 50 the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.120
 I miss the improved chongo that I will leave you 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.840
 the link in the description if you leave 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.670
 seen as he killed in round 50 of a 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.530
 dolphin dais of a lying down as 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.880
 you want to call killed in round 50 and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.500
 it was really awesome I want to do 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.500
 a streaming to see what round 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.570
 could kill that and also comparing 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.190
 with those with the effects they produce 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.540
 other canes but when I deviated 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.550
 I'll do that later on 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.560
 streaming I wait before Tuesday because 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.010
 go out gta 5 and now I'm going to comment on the 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.650
 plans 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.360
 I have for that game gta 5 the great game 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.519
 of the year without a doubt my call of duty ni 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.230
 cocks me I do not have a single gta 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.329
 I know him from playing in the houses of 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.030
 friends of parties the cock and such but 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.769
 is the game that is that you have to have it 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.120
 here he does not like gta seriously with the 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.879
 freedom that game has with the app 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.709
 with the gigantism of the map that goes to 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.140
 have people 7 to 5 who already think there 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.690
 a photo out there in fact you see gta the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.319
 map of gta 4 superimposed on the map 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.049
 of gta 5 and you can flip three days that 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.540
 game that to have it leaves this Tuesday marks 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.890
 the 17th and the stores I tried to 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.930
 done get it here in a store 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.480
 a town I live here in a little village 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.000
 of murcia and they do not release it or 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.329
 wanting because if he finds out rockstar or 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.859
 the distributor of this gta 5 that what 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.510
 has sold before and on top of everything 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.190
 I start to say what I bought in 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.239
 such a store I do not know what's got balls up 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.620
 close the store 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.019
 well I do not know to what extreme but a 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.970
 fine that is carried and good to have by 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.400
 course that game gamestop all these 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.500
 big ones are not going to let go as much as a 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.360
 day before and has it reserved what 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.250
 they will release but but let's go more is very 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.560
 difficult because gta said for example 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.850
 and I know that he wants it on his day of departure 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.920
 it's a juice that has been developing 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.570
 many many years has required a lot 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.790
 effort a lot of work and they do not want 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.460
 now people ask to have it before their 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.050
 date of departure and mixed point of the gta 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.090
 5 well I think it's already obvious that 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.800
 I want to catch him but we go from his 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.530
 departure date right I've decided 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.660
 recently because I'm self pending 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.580
 of call of duty tal but pussy gta 5 is 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.800
 that you have to have it and play with friends and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.300
 all that is the dick then I do not have 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.360
 nor reserved I hope that when I go to 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.330
 buy it if I do not save it so I can 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.450
 buy it even then and well that's what I 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.950
 I will buy and plans that I have a room already 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.360
 I've thought about huarte urgently is to spend 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.370
 the whole game but let's go there 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.160
 videos have until terminated the 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.130
 until it comes out until the fuck comes 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.730
 with his uncle this 15 would be an authentic 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.740
 madness 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.590
 I guess I better play with 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.050
 friends with prodigy with flash here that no 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.150
 I know with people who have the gta 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.260
 iv well then we will record exams 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.960
 We'll take some laughs 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.030
 added that I will also go to that Thursday 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.760
 it's going to be amazing how much 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.250
 vehicles of shares of things of 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.600
 of the map is that the secrets to be 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.860
 awesome kids 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.660
 then I know maybe it gives me 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.090
 go up doing the assholes in a 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.830
 giant airplane cremonte 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.050
 what I get the boss I do not have 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.610
 really nothing planned a guard 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.440
 I tell you almost certainly that I'm not going to 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.449
 do because the whole campaign is done 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.770
 the history of that I can whole and in addition 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.710
 I think there are three characters and you can 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.300
 do with each one would be an authentic 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.580
 more than enough and crazy so I 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.139
 to go improvising I'm going to catch that 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.790
 safe 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.199
 improvising on the fly that if not 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.940
 I know what if I feel like climbing 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.949
 making them clean in a helicopter and 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.830
 climbing up a skyscraper and throwing me 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:13.550
 with the parachute or the jetpack or I do not know 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.650
 what else will I upload another thing is that gta 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.050
 They are well known for their 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.580
 innumerable tricks that if you give a 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.860
 combination with the fucking phone and you 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.360
 a tree comes out a lamborghini from the sky 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.250
 that if I do not know that you get a motorbike 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.560
 water that if you get a helicopter there and 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.639
 that gives you a lot of fun 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.530
 really has never followed a gta from 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.479
 the beginning but I'm interested to see how 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.820
 if the tricks are already from a 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.039
 principle if people are going them goes 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.330
 guessing I do not know if you can tell me that 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.620
 the truth I would appreciate it because I 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.720
 I'm curious if the tricks go to 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.789
 be from the first day or little by little 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.860
 people are going to discover them with 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:48.249
 combinations so well I think that 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.139
 you can upload gta 5 from the beginning 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:52.029
 to youtube although good they commented to me 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.469
 something that was copyrighted or I do not know what 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:54.879
 but I think so and also with the 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:57.369
 promotion that we will give you all 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:59.739
 youtubers is going to be foolish 

00:06:57.369 --> 00:07:00.849
 live it the rise of this game as well as 

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:02.469
 of people, I hope you liked it 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:04.659

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:06.429
 leave in the comments if you know if it 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:07.839
 you will be able to go up gta 5 with total 

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:10.149
 freedom from your departure date to 

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:12.399

 zombie streaming moments I have 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:17.289
 sorry yesterday for not uploading the videos but 

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:19.149

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:20.799

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.719
