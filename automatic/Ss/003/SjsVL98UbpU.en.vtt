light<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.949> packs<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.580> thousand<00:00:24.119> lumens

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
light and this packs a thousand lumens

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.519 
light and this packs a thousand lumens
of<00:00:25.519> powerful<00:00:26.519> light<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.900> see<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
of powerful light we can see we have a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.970 
of powerful light we can see we have a
tactical<00:00:29.160> bezel<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> front<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
tactical bezel here on the front and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.180 
tactical bezel here on the front and
yeah<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.969> runs<00:00:33.300> off<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> 118<00:00:34.410> 650

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
yeah this is it runs off a 118 650

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.660 
yeah this is it runs off a 118 650
battery<00:00:35.610> otherwise<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.899> use<00:00:36.930> two<00:00:37.640> cr123

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
battery otherwise you can use two cr123

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.869 
battery otherwise you can use two cr123
and<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.469> has<00:00:40.649> five<00:00:41.100> different<00:00:41.460> modes

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and this is it has five different modes

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.930 
and this is it has five different modes
we<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.930> everything<00:00:43.680> ranging<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.309> 1000

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
we have everything ranging from 1000

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.610 
we have everything ranging from 1000
lumens<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.539> said<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.289> max

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
lumens like I said that is the max

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.850 
lumens like I said that is the max
output<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.149> 350<00:00:48.870> lumens<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.680> two

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
output then we have 350 lumens at two

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.510 
output then we have 350 lumens at two
hours<00:00:50.070> 60<00:00:50.820> lumens<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.390> 12<00:00:51.660> hours<00:00:51.920> 10<00:00:52.920> lumens<00:00:53.160> at

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
hours 60 lumens at 12 hours 10 lumens at

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.529 
hours 60 lumens at 12 hours 10 lumens at
60<00:00:53.879> hours<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.510> point<00:00:54.840> five<00:00:55.170> lumens<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:56.539> 360

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
60 hours and point five lumens at 360

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.580 
60 hours and point five lumens at 360
hours<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.140> also<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.980> strobe<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.590> this

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
hours and we also have a strobe so this

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.280 
hours and we also have a strobe so this
reminds<00:01:02.100> me<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.370> lot<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.000> old<00:01:03.390> light<00:01:03.660> s30

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
reminds me a lot of the old light s30

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.410 
reminds me a lot of the old light s30
our<00:01:04.530> baton<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.250> actually<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.180> right

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
our baton and actually have that right

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
our baton and actually have that right
here<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.960> there's<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> few<00:01:07.439> things<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.830> are

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
here but there's a few things that are

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.520 
here but there's a few things that are
different<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.880> bezel<00:01:09.420> here<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.049> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
different like the bezel here and you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.100 
different like the bezel here and you
can<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> couple<00:01:11.490> more<00:01:11.729> heat<00:01:12.689> sinks

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
can see we have a couple more heat sinks

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
can see we have a couple more heat sinks
kind<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> front<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.970> also

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
kind of up here on the front and also

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.499 
kind of up here on the front and also
the<00:01:15.750> around<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.619> side<00:01:16.950> switch<00:01:17.280> actually<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the around this side switch actually the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.179 
the around this side switch actually the
m1<00:01:18.810> x<00:01:18.960> striker<00:01:19.259> has<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:20.780> tail<00:01:21.920> clicker<00:01:22.920> right

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
m1 x striker has a tail clicker right

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.370 
m1 x striker has a tail clicker right
there<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> ole<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.270> 30<00:01:24.720> our<00:01:24.900> baton<00:01:25.170> does

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
there and the ole is 30 our baton does

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.010 
there and the ole is 30 our baton does
not<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.369> they've<00:01:26.520> also<00:01:26.820> kind<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.509> did<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
not but they've also kind of did like a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.230 
not but they've also kind of did like a
stealth<00:01:28.470> mode<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.770> call<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.759> black

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
stealth mode I call it but it's black

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.100 
stealth mode I call it but it's black
bezel<00:01:30.720> around<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.530> actual<00:01:32.360> side<00:01:33.360> switch<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
bezel around the actual side switch so

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
bezel around the actual side switch so
that's<00:01:34.380> basically<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.950> difference<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.490> in

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that's basically the difference is in

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.899 
that's basically the difference is in
the<00:01:35.729> ole<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.240> 30<00:01:36.479> our<00:01:36.659> baton<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.079> also<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
the ole is 30 our baton is also a

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.780 
the ole is 30 our baton is also a
thousand<00:01:38.909> lumen<00:01:39.329> light<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:40.140> well<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.070> there's

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
thousand lumen light as well so there's

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.440 
thousand lumen light as well so there's
a<00:01:41.880> good<00:01:42.150> size<00:01:42.659> comparison<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.610> let's<00:01:45.329> talk

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
a good size comparison so but let's talk

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810 
a good size comparison so but let's talk
about<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.869> m1<00:01:46.350> X<00:01:46.530> striker<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.369> said<00:01:47.640> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
about the m1 X striker like I said it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.990 
about the m1 X striker like I said it
does<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.799> tail<00:01:49.799> switch<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.850> can

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
does have a tail switch here and we can

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.170 
does have a tail switch here and we can
do<00:01:51.149> momentary<00:01:51.810> or<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:53.369> fully<00:01:53.670> click<00:01:54.000> on

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
do momentary or we can do fully click on

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.990 
do momentary or we can do fully click on
now<00:01:54.450> once<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.780> fully<00:01:55.020> click<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:56.399> use<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
now once we fully click on we use the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.660 
now once we fully click on we use the
sight<00:01:57.420> switch<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.020> go<00:01:58.350> through<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
sight switch here to go through the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.429 
sight switch here to go through the
different<00:01:59.939> modes<00:02:00.390> now<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:01.110> thing<00:02:01.259> you'll

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
different modes now one thing you'll

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.859 
different modes now one thing you'll
notice<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:02.159> only<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.880> four<00:02:03.149> modes<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.659> see

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
notice I only have four modes there see

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.619 
notice I only have four modes there see
I<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.399> believe<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.129> mode<00:02:08.129> 5<00:02:09.000> so

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
I have the I believe it is a mode 5 so

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.820 
I have the I believe it is a mode 5 so
no<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.379> mode

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
no this is mode

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.690 
no this is mode
4<00:02:11.280> I'm<00:02:11.520> sorry<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.030> 10<00:02:12.360> lumens<00:02:12.540> right<00:02:12.900> here

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
4 I'm sorry this is 10 lumens right here

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.089 
4 I'm sorry this is 10 lumens right here
and<00:02:13.760> then<00:02:13.849> we<00:02:13.940> go<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.180> 60<00:02:14.810> lumens<00:02:15.050> then<00:02:15.470> 350

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
and then we go to 60 lumens then 350

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.880 
and then we go to 60 lumens then 350
lumens<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.760> then<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.330> thousand<00:02:17.959> lumens<00:02:18.080> now

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
lumens and then a thousand lumens now

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.589 
lumens and then a thousand lumens now
there's<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.310> few<00:02:19.550> things<00:02:19.819> I<00:02:19.940> wanted<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.269> cover

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
there's a few things I wanted to cover

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.690 
there's a few things I wanted to cover
first<00:02:21.290> we'll<00:02:21.590> talk<00:02:21.769> about<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.069> thousand<00:02:22.580> lumens

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
first we'll talk about a thousand lumens

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.869 
first we'll talk about a thousand lumens
when<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.780> thousand<00:02:24.530> lumens

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
when you have this on a thousand lumens

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.040 
when you have this on a thousand lumens
this<00:02:25.879> will<00:02:26.060> actually<00:02:26.209> it<00:02:26.569> stays<00:02:26.810> up<00:02:26.959> a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
this will actually it stays up a

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.750 
this will actually it stays up a
thousand<00:02:27.500> lumens<00:02:27.590> for<00:02:27.860> five<00:02:28.190> minutes

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
thousand lumens for five minutes

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.660 
thousand lumens for five minutes
and<00:02:28.879> then<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.480> will<00:02:29.690> drop<00:02:30.140> okay<00:02:31.099> because<00:02:31.310> the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
and then it will drop okay because the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.479 
and then it will drop okay because the
heat<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.000> things<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.390> will<00:02:32.510> drop<00:02:32.900> down<00:02:33.200> to

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
heat and things that will drop down to

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.880 
heat and things that will drop down to
550<00:02:34.489> lumens<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.120> stay<00:02:35.810> there<00:02:35.989> for<00:02:36.260> 55<00:02:36.680> minutes

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
550 lumens and stay there for 55 minutes

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.650 
550 lumens and stay there for 55 minutes
and<00:02:37.160> then<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.340> will<00:02:37.430> hum<00:02:37.580> gradually<00:02:38.269> just<00:02:38.480> kind

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
and then it will hum gradually just kind

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.710 
and then it will hum gradually just kind
of<00:02:38.840> fade<00:02:39.500> off<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.950> battery<00:02:40.370> will<00:02:40.670> die<00:02:40.940> but

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
of fade off and the battery will die but

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.690 
of fade off and the battery will die but
so<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.590> wanted<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.950> explain<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.310> how<00:02:43.640> the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
so I wanted to explain that how the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.910 
so I wanted to explain that how the
thousand<00:02:44.569> lumens<00:02:44.660> works<00:02:45.080> but<00:02:45.319> if<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.560> wanted

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
thousand lumens works but if you wanted

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.550 
thousand lumens works but if you wanted
to<00:02:46.069> put<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.519> into<00:02:46.819> moonlight<00:02:47.660> mode<00:02:47.930> you

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
to put this into moonlight mode you

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.140 
to put this into moonlight mode you
would<00:02:48.650> hold<00:02:48.890> down<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.280> side<00:02:49.519> switch<00:02:49.730> as<00:02:50.120> you

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
would hold down the side switch as you

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.900 
would hold down the side switch as you
turn<00:02:50.569> on<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.620> tail<00:02:51.829> cap<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.730> probably

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
turn on the tail cap and you probably

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.900 
turn on the tail cap and you probably
can't<00:02:53.180> see<00:02:53.299> it's<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.630> very<00:02:54.459> low<00:02:55.459> light<00:02:55.730> it's

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
can't see it's a very low light it's

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.360 
can't see it's a very low light it's
only<00:02:56.030> 0.5<00:02:56.720> lumens<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.500> that's<00:02:58.040> how<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.250> would

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
only 0.5 lumens but that's how you would

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.860 
only 0.5 lumens but that's how you would
do<00:02:58.640> this<00:02:58.790> now<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.120> does<00:02:59.299> have<00:02:59.329> built-in

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
do this now this does have built-in

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.850 
do this now this does have built-in
memory<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.890> once<00:03:01.069> again<00:03:01.220> how<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:01.640> turned<00:03:02.030> on<00:03:02.299> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
memory so once again how I turned on the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.110 
memory so once again how I turned on the
moonlight<00:03:03.860> I<00:03:04.040> would<00:03:04.190> hold<00:03:04.400> down<00:03:04.610> on<00:03:04.849> the<00:03:04.940> side

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
moonlight I would hold down on the side

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.870 
moonlight I would hold down on the side
switch<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.690> then<00:03:06.260> push<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.950> tail<00:03:07.160> light<00:03:07.400> or

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
switch and then push the tail light or

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.390 
switch and then push the tail light or
the<00:03:08.209> tail<00:03:08.810> cap<00:03:09.079> switch<00:03:09.440> there<00:03:09.680> now<00:03:10.130> like<00:03:10.310> I

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
the tail cap switch there now like I

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.949 
the tail cap switch there now like I
said<00:03:10.459> this<00:03:10.640> has<00:03:10.790> memory<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.450> can<00:03:11.630> turn<00:03:11.840> it

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
said this has memory so I can turn it

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.569 
said this has memory so I can turn it
back<00:03:11.989> off<00:03:12.319> and<00:03:12.620> when<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.799> turn<00:03:13.010> it<00:03:13.069> back<00:03:13.250> on<00:03:13.400> it

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
back off and when I turn it back on it

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.940 
back off and when I turn it back on it
will<00:03:13.610> have<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.150> moonlight<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.989> we<00:03:15.680> can<00:03:15.799> go

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
will have the moonlight on and we can go

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.009 
will have the moonlight on and we can go
through<00:03:15.980> now<00:03:16.459> you'll<00:03:16.790> see<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.840> very

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
through now you'll see this is the very

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.539 
through now you'll see this is the very
first<00:03:18.260> mode<00:03:18.590> will<00:03:18.739> go<00:03:18.859> through<00:03:19.069> five<00:03:19.280> modes

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
first mode will go through five modes

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.340 
first mode will go through five modes
right<00:03:19.760> now<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.720> there<00:03:23.989> is<00:03:24.170> all<00:03:24.470> five<00:03:24.799> modes<00:03:25.130> and

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
right now so there is all five modes and

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.660 
right now so there is all five modes and
like<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.440> said<00:03:27.650> when<00:03:27.859> we<00:03:27.889> turn<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.310> off<00:03:28.430> let's

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
like I said when we turn it off let's

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.120 
like I said when we turn it off let's
say<00:03:28.760> we<00:03:28.880> have<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.180> mode<00:03:29.420> three<00:03:29.720> here<00:03:30.130> turn

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
say we have it on mode three here turn

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.970 
say we have it on mode three here turn
it<00:03:31.250> off<00:03:31.400> turn<00:03:31.819> it<00:03:31.850> back<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.590> we're<00:03:33.590> good<00:03:33.859> to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
it off turn it back on and we're good to

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.550 
it off turn it back on and we're good to
go<00:03:34.010> we're<00:03:34.370> still<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:34.910> mode<00:03:35.090> three<00:03:35.450> now<00:03:35.989> another

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
go we're still on mode three now another

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.559 
go we're still on mode three now another
thing<00:03:36.680> we<00:03:37.160> do<00:03:37.280> have<00:03:37.459> momentary<00:03:38.000> like<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:38.329> said

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
thing we do have momentary like I said

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.849 
thing we do have momentary like I said
on<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.049> tail<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:40.450> we<00:03:41.450> can<00:03:41.630> also<00:03:41.870> if<00:03:42.260> we<00:03:42.440> double

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
on the tail and we can also if we double

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.150 
on the tail and we can also if we double
press<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:43.400> will<00:03:43.519> go<00:03:43.639> straight<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:44.030> high<00:03:45.160> okay

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
press it will go straight to high okay

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.270 
press it will go straight to high okay
so<00:03:46.220> now<00:03:46.519> we<00:03:46.579> have<00:03:46.700> high<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.920> also<00:03:48.920> we<00:03:49.100> can

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
so now we have high and also we can

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.809 
so now we have high and also we can
press<00:03:49.670> three<00:03:50.090> times<00:03:50.389> and<00:03:51.250> we'll<00:03:52.250> get<00:03:52.400> strobe

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
press three times and we'll get strobe

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.330 
press three times and we'll get strobe
and<00:03:53.200> that's<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.319> thousand<00:03:54.769> lumens<00:03:54.859> strobe

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
and that's a thousand lumens strobe

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.819 
and that's a thousand lumens strobe
right<00:03:55.579> there<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.060> also<00:03:56.780> we<00:03:57.079> can<00:03:57.260> access<00:03:57.470> the

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
right there and also we can access the

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.920 
right there and also we can access the
strobe<00:03:58.160> say<00:03:58.459> if<00:03:58.519> it's<00:03:58.700> on<00:03:58.940> we<00:03:59.269> just<00:03:59.480> hold<00:03:59.660> down

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
strobe say if it's on we just hold down

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.250 
strobe say if it's on we just hold down
the<00:04:00.109> side<00:04:00.319> switch<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:01.660> boom<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:03.019> have<00:04:03.109> the

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
the side switch and boom you have the

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.699 
the side switch and boom you have the
strobe<00:04:03.560> again<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:05.480> let's<00:04:05.660> go<00:04:05.900> ahead<00:04:05.989> this<00:04:06.440> does

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
strobe again so let's go ahead this does
