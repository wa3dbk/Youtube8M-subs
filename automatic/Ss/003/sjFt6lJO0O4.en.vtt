usually what's happening is there some

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.390 
usually what's happening is there some
partitioning<00:01:17.470> problems<00:01:17.890> there<00:01:18.100> they're

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
partitioning problems there they're

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.250 
partitioning problems there they're
getting<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:18.760> little<00:01:18.940> bit<00:01:19.030> more<00:01:19.300> glucose<00:01:19.750> pushed

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
getting a little bit more glucose pushed

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.070 
getting a little bit more glucose pushed
into<00:01:20.440> their<00:01:20.620> fat<00:01:20.830> cells<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.840> type<00:01:23.050> of

into their fat cells and this type of

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.100 
into their fat cells and this type of
product<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:24.460> help<00:01:24.490> with<00:01:24.970> that<00:01:25.120> it<00:01:25.870> can

the<00:01:29.980> muscle<00:01:30.340> cells<00:01:30.610> so<00:01:31.540> what<00:01:32.260> I<00:01:32.290> like<00:01:32.590> for

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
the muscle cells so what I like for

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.000 
the muscle cells so what I like for
people<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:33.100> do<00:01:33.280> in<00:01:33.370> that<00:01:33.460> situation<00:01:33.520> is<00:01:34.620> take<00:01:35.620> a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
people to do in that situation is take a

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.350 
people to do in that situation is take a
serving<00:01:36.610> of<00:01:36.820> this<00:01:36.970> which<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.300> two<00:01:38.170> capsules<00:01:38.710> in

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
serving of this which is two capsules in

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.210 
serving of this which is two capsules in
meals<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.659> are<00:01:40.720> can<00:01:41.620> that<00:01:41.860> are<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.010> little

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
meals that are can that are a little

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.980 
meals that are can that are a little
higher<00:01:42.490> in<00:01:42.610> carbohydrates<00:01:42.750> away<00:01:43.750> from

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
higher in carbohydrates away from

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.260 
higher in carbohydrates away from
training<00:01:44.290> that's<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.710> key<00:01:44.860> distinction<00:01:45.280> away

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
training that's the key distinction away

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.050 
training that's the key distinction away
from<00:01:46.479> draining<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.530> let's<00:01:47.740> say<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:47.950> train<00:01:48.310> in

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
from draining so let's say you train in

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.880 
from draining so let's say you train in
the<00:01:49.120> middle<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.479> day<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.810> would<00:01:50.770> have

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
the middle of the day I would have

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.620 
the middle of the day I would have
someone<00:01:51.280> have<00:01:51.549> some<00:01:51.729> carbohydrates<00:01:52.360> in<00:01:52.540> the

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
someone have some carbohydrates in the

can eat an unlimited amount of carbs etc
that's<00:02:20.340> not<00:02:20.520> true<00:02:20.760> that's<00:02:20.940> what<00:02:21.150> I'm<00:02:21.240> saying

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that's not true that's what I'm saying

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.330 
that's not true that's what I'm saying
that's<00:02:21.780> not<00:02:21.960> what<00:02:22.080> I'm<00:02:22.170> saying<00:02:22.200> what<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.190> am

that's not what I'm saying what I am

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.130 
that's not what I'm saying what I am
saying<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.090> you'll<00:02:24.450> partition<00:02:25.050> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
saying is that you'll partition the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.160 
saying is that you'll partition the
glucose<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.620> little<00:02:25.860> better<00:02:26.990> now<00:02:27.990> you're

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
glucose a little better now you're

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.480 
glucose a little better now you're
probably<00:02:28.350> wondering<00:02:28.770> well<00:02:28.920> why<00:02:29.190> didn't<00:02:29.430> you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
probably wondering well why didn't you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.390 
probably wondering well why didn't you
say<00:02:29.570> around<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.720> workout<00:02:31.280> around<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
say around the workout around the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.760 
say around the workout around the
workout<00:02:32.840> there's<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.900> lot<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.530> things

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
workout there's a lot of things

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.530 
workout there's a lot of things
happening<00:02:35.220> physiologically<00:02:35.550> just<00:02:36.330> as<00:02:36.510> a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
happening physiologically just as a

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.720 
happening physiologically just as a
result<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.110> training<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.770> will<00:02:38.610> help

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
result of training that will help

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.270 
result of training that will help
partition<00:02:39.510> nutrients<00:02:40.050> better<00:02:40.350> without<00:02:41.220> any

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
partition nutrients better without any

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.670 
partition nutrients better without any
supplements<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.780> get<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.350> from<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
supplements you get just from the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.950 
supplements you get just from the
mechanical<00:02:44.310> tension<00:02:44.760> from<00:02:45.150> weight<00:02:45.600> training

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
mechanical tension from weight training

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.290 
mechanical tension from weight training
itself<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:47.040> partition<00:02:47.640> nutrients<00:02:48.150> better

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
itself you partition nutrients better

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.810 
itself you partition nutrients better
also<00:02:49.230> when<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.500> eat<00:02:49.650> your<00:02:49.860> carbohydrates

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
also when you eat your carbohydrates

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.330 
also when you eat your carbohydrates
around<00:02:51.360> training<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:53.070> know<00:02:53.160> your

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
around training you you know your

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.370 
around training you you know your
pancreas<00:02:53.730> will<00:02:53.910> produce<00:02:54.180> insulin<00:02:54.480> and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
pancreas will produce insulin and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.130 
pancreas will produce insulin and
insulin<00:02:55.800> actually<00:02:56.780> attaches<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.810> insulin

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
insulin actually attaches to insulin

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.810 
insulin actually attaches to insulin
receptors<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.830> lets<00:02:59.010> more<00:02:59.160> glucose<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.730> your

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
receptors and lets more glucose in your

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.940 
receptors and lets more glucose in your
muscle<00:03:00.180> cell<00:03:00.330> then<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.320> what<00:03:01.470> we<00:03:01.590> want<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.860> do

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
muscle cell then so what we want to do

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.230 
muscle cell then so what we want to do
for<00:03:02.130> those<00:03:02.280> folks<00:03:02.580> who<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.970> little<00:03:03.120> bit

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
for those folks who have a little bit

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.420 
for those folks who have a little bit
more<00:03:03.480> stubborn<00:03:03.720> bodies<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.770> start<00:03:05.070> working

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
more stubborn bodies you start working

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.250 
more stubborn bodies you start working
away<00:03:05.820> from<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.330> training<00:03:06.540> time<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.840> let<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
away from that training time and let the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.199 
away from that training time and let the
training<00:03:07.650> time

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
training time

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.520 
training time
push<00:03:09.209> push<00:03:09.630> glucose<00:03:10.050> where<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.290> needs<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.470> go

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
push push glucose where it needs to go

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.780 
push push glucose where it needs to go
then<00:03:10.950> now<00:03:11.930> let's<00:03:12.930> say<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> good<00:03:14.580> body

like insulin mimickers okay so you're

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.650 
like insulin mimickers okay so you're
drinking<00:03:41.519> your<00:03:41.640> interim<00:03:41.970> d<00:03:42.120> you're<00:03:42.450> putting

take it away from training with carb
meals<00:04:09.560> now<00:04:10.560> women<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.459> would<00:04:11.730> say<00:04:11.880> just<00:04:12.060> cut<00:04:12.330> the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
meals now women I would say just cut the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.920 
meals now women I would say just cut the
dose<00:04:12.630> in<00:04:12.840> half<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:13.799> instead<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.220> taking<00:04:14.930> a

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
dose in half and so instead of taking a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.960 
dose in half and so instead of taking a
full<00:04:16.530> serving<00:04:16.919> which<00:04:17.040> is<00:04:17.160> two<00:04:17.310> caps<00:04:17.549> just<00:04:17.790> take

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
full serving which is two caps just take

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.180 
full serving which is two caps just take

some women tolerate carbs really well in

some women tolerate carbs really well in
that<00:04:24.810> case<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:25.380> go<00:04:25.470> ahead<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.740> take<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.890> up

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
that case just go ahead and take it up

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.719 
that case just go ahead and take it up
to<00:04:26.479> one<00:04:27.479> full<00:04:27.720> serving<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:29.430> other<00:04:29.550> thing

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
can I take this year-round

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
you to do that I prefer people to take

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.770 
you to do that I prefer people to take
this<00:04:39.080> for<00:04:39.440> four<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.710> six<00:04:39.950> weeks<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.520> then<00:04:41.480> stop

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
this for four to six weeks and then stop

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.560 
this for four to six weeks and then stop
taking<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.320> for<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.530> couple<00:04:42.650> weeks<00:04:43.360> based<00:04:44.360> on

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
taking it for a couple weeks based on

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.960 
taking it for a couple weeks based on
what<00:04:44.750> I've<00:04:44.870> seen<00:04:44.900> with<00:04:45.440> insulin<00:04:46.430> mimic<00:04:46.790> or

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
what I've seen with insulin mimic or

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.080 
what I've seen with insulin mimic or
glucose<00:04:47.630> disposal<00:04:48.170> type<00:04:48.350> products<00:04:48.830> it<00:04:49.280> seems

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
glucose disposal type products it seems

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.000 
glucose disposal type products it seems
like<00:04:50.300> they<00:04:50.480> work<00:04:50.690> fantastic<00:04:51.500> for<00:04:51.650> about<00:04:51.800> four

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
like they work fantastic for about four

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.250 
like they work fantastic for about four
to<00:04:52.070> six<00:04:52.190> weeks<00:04:52.510> then<00:04:53.510> you<00:04:53.630> kind<00:04:53.810> of<00:04:53.900> lose<00:04:54.020> their

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
to six weeks then you kind of lose their

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.850 
to six weeks then you kind of lose their
effect<00:04:54.590> so<00:04:55.460> there<00:04:56.330> are<00:04:56.480> I<00:04:56.510> do<00:04:57.110> believe<00:04:57.620> that

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
effect so there are I do believe that

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.620 
effect so there are I do believe that
your<00:04:58.010> best<00:04:58.160> effect<00:04:58.520> is<00:04:58.700> going<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:58.940> be<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.420> take

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
your best effect is going to be to take

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.270 
your best effect is going to be to take
a<00:04:59.660> little<00:04:59.960> two-week<00:05:00.320> break<00:05:00.500> after<00:05:00.920> every<00:05:01.100> four

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
a little two-week break after every four

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.570 
a little two-week break after every four
to<00:05:01.370> six<00:05:01.580> weeks<00:05:02.680> that's<00:05:03.680> my<00:05:03.950> honest<00:05:04.100> opinion<00:05:04.490> on

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
to six weeks that's my honest opinion on

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.650 
to six weeks that's my honest opinion on
that<00:05:04.730> so<00:05:06.430> what<00:05:07.430> about<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.240> amount<00:05:08.540> of

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
that so what about the the amount of

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.760 
that so what about the the amount of
carbs<00:05:08.930> I<00:05:09.050> mentioned<00:05:09.410> that<00:05:09.500> a<00:05:09.530> little<00:05:09.680> bit

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
carbs I mentioned that a little bit

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.760 
carbs I mentioned that a little bit
earlier<00:05:10.180> for<00:05:11.180> guys<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:11.720> know<00:05:11.840> if<00:05:11.990> you<00:05:12.140> have<00:05:12.350> I

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
earlier for guys you know if you have I

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.560 
earlier for guys you know if you have I
kind<00:05:13.370> of<00:05:13.400> like<00:05:13.580> this<00:05:13.760> general<00:05:14.120> rule<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.330> any

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
kind of like this general rule of any

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.210 
kind of like this general rule of any
time<00:05:14.840> you're<00:05:15.020> around<00:05:15.200> fifty<00:05:15.560> carbs<00:05:15.920> forty

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
time you're around fifty carbs forty

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.000 
time you're around fifty carbs forty
fifty<00:05:16.460> carbs<00:05:16.760> use<00:05:16.910> of<00:05:17.060> serving<00:05:17.680> women<00:05:18.680> you

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
fifty carbs use of serving women you

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.760 
fifty carbs use of serving women you
know<00:05:19.130> 2025<00:05:19.550> carbs<00:05:20.360> use<00:05:20.510> half<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.720> serving<00:05:21.020> one

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
know 2025 carbs use half a serving one

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.650 
know 2025 carbs use half a serving one
capsule<00:05:22.280> that's<00:05:22.670> just<00:05:23.030> kind<00:05:23.270> of<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.450> general

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
capsule that's just kind of the general

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.640 
capsule that's just kind of the general
ratio<00:05:24.260> that<00:05:24.470> I<00:05:24.560> like<00:05:24.820> another<00:05:25.820> really<00:05:26.270> cool

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
ratio that I like another really cool

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.190 
ratio that I like another really cool
way<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.680> use<00:05:27.980> this<00:05:28.160> is<00:05:28.430> with<00:05:29.330> refeed<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.020> cheat

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
way to use this is with refeed and cheat

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.940 
way to use this is with refeed and cheat
meals<00:05:30.520> and<00:05:31.720> those<00:05:32.720> meals<00:05:32.990> depending<00:05:33.800> on<00:05:33.860> how

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
meals and those meals depending on how

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.970 
meals and those meals depending on how
many<00:05:34.010> pancakes<00:05:34.340> you<00:05:34.670> eat<00:05:35.530> will<00:05:36.530> typically<00:05:36.890> be

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
many pancakes you eat will typically be

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.860 
many pancakes you eat will typically be
much<00:05:37.400> much<00:05:37.640> higher<00:05:37.820> in<00:05:37.940> carbs<00:05:38.300> so<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.570> tell

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
much much higher in carbs so I tell

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.620 
much much higher in carbs so I tell
people<00:05:39.140> go<00:05:39.230> ahead<00:05:39.410> and<00:05:39.530> take<00:05:39.650> two<00:05:39.770> servings

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
people go ahead and take two servings

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.420 
people go ahead and take two servings
and<00:05:41.630> it's<00:05:41.870> really<00:05:42.170> neat<00:05:42.410> because<00:05:42.590> you<00:05:42.830> wake<00:05:43.250> up

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
and it's really neat because you wake up

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.890 
and it's really neat because you wake up
the<00:05:43.520> next<00:05:43.640> day<00:05:43.820> and<00:05:44.060> you're<00:05:44.150> already<00:05:44.450> kind<00:05:44.780> of

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
the next day and you're already kind of

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.530 
the next day and you're already kind of
full<00:05:45.170> from<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.500> glucose<00:05:46.010> or<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.150> like<00:05:47.330> the

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
full from the glucose or the like the

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.000 
full from the glucose or the like the
glucose<00:05:47.870> is<00:05:48.020> converted<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.410> glycogen<00:05:48.590> you're

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
glucose is converted to glycogen you're

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.980 
glucose is converted to glycogen you're
already<00:05:49.130> get<00:05:49.310> this<00:05:49.490> nice<00:05:49.820> full<00:05:50.420> muscle<00:05:50.810> and

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
already get this nice full muscle and

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.510 
already get this nice full muscle and
this<00:05:51.110> just<00:05:51.380> enhances<00:05:51.830> our<00:05:51.980> process<00:05:52.370> even<00:05:52.700> more

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
this just enhances our process even more

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.690 
this just enhances our process even more
so<00:05:55.520> that's<00:05:55.700> another<00:05:55.970> just<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.570> good<00:05:57.200> good<00:05:57.800> good

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
so that's another just a good good good

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.940 
so that's another just a good good good
way<00:05:58.850> to<00:05:58.910> use<00:05:59.060> a<00:05:59.090> supplement<00:05:59.690> and<00:06:00.290> speaking<00:06:00.890> of

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
way to use a supplement and speaking of

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.330 
way to use a supplement and speaking of
that<00:06:01.040> so<00:06:01.370> what<00:06:01.850> should<00:06:01.970> you<00:06:02.120> expect<00:06:03.340> generally

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
that so what should you expect generally

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.950 
that so what should you expect generally
speaking<00:06:04.610> you're<00:06:05.300> going<00:06:05.420> to<00:06:05.660> get<00:06:05.750> a<00:06:05.780> little

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
speaking you're going to get a little

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.420 
speaking you're going to get a little
bit<00:06:06.140> leaner<00:06:06.320> we're<00:06:06.740> after<00:06:06.830> a<00:06:07.010> better<00:06:07.160> body

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
bit leaner we're after a better body

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.890 
bit leaner we're after a better body
composition<00:06:07.760> right<00:06:08.150> you<00:06:08.390> so<00:06:08.570> you<00:06:08.660> just<00:06:08.690> have

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
composition right you so you just have

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.960 
composition right you so you just have
an<00:06:08.990> improvement<00:06:09.320> in<00:06:09.500> body<00:06:09.650> composition<00:06:09.980> if

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
an improvement in body composition if

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.750 
an improvement in body composition if
you're<00:06:11.330> driving<00:06:12.050> glucose<00:06:13.040> out<00:06:13.430> of<00:06:13.490> here<00:06:13.670> but

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
you're driving glucose out of here but

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.040 
you're driving glucose out of here but
if<00:06:13.850> you're<00:06:13.940> clearing<00:06:14.240> it<00:06:14.420> more<00:06:14.600> effectively

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
if you're clearing it more effectively

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.300 
if you're clearing it more effectively
out<00:06:15.260> of<00:06:15.380> your<00:06:15.470> blood<00:06:15.620> and<00:06:15.740> into<00:06:15.890> your<00:06:16.010> muscle

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
out of your blood and into your muscle

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.760 
out of your blood and into your muscle
you<00:06:16.940> should<00:06:17.120> also<00:06:17.270> have<00:06:17.390> better<00:06:17.630> pumps<00:06:18.020> so

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
you should also have better pumps so

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.130 
you should also have better pumps so
when<00:06:19.250> you<00:06:19.340> go<00:06:19.490> in<00:06:19.640> to<00:06:19.670> train<00:06:20.060> you<00:06:20.930> should

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
when you go in to train you should

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.690 
when you go in to train you should
notice<00:06:21.440> that<00:06:21.560> you<00:06:21.680> have<00:06:21.770> better<00:06:21.980> pumps<00:06:22.370> in

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
notice that you have better pumps in

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.760 
notice that you have better pumps in
addition<00:06:23.570> to<00:06:23.690> kind<00:06:23.900> of<00:06:23.960> that<00:06:24.080> aesthetic<00:06:24.290> you

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
addition to kind of that aesthetic you

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.860 
addition to kind of that aesthetic you
look<00:06:24.980> leaner<00:06:25.190> you're<00:06:25.700> getting<00:06:25.970> leaner<00:06:26.150> so

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
look leaner you're getting leaner so

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.060 
look leaner you're getting leaner so
that's<00:06:27.050> what<00:06:27.230> you<00:06:27.350> expect<00:06:27.440> it's<00:06:27.890> not<00:06:28.040> a

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
that's what you expect it's not a

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.380 
that's what you expect it's not a
stimulant<00:06:28.460> you<00:06:28.820> shouldn't<00:06:29.120> feel<00:06:29.240> like<00:06:29.270> you

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
stimulant you shouldn't feel like you

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.770 
stimulant you shouldn't feel like you
have<00:06:29.690> you<00:06:30.650> know<00:06:30.800> this<00:06:31.280> hyper<00:06:31.760> aggressive<00:06:32.060> mode

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
have you know this hyper aggressive mode

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
have you know this hyper aggressive mode
or<00:06:32.900> anything<00:06:33.020> like<00:06:33.230> that<00:06:33.290> that's<00:06:33.560> not<00:06:33.680> what

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
or anything like that that's not what

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.220 
or anything like that that's not what
this<00:06:33.860> sub<00:06:34.040> one<00:06:34.220> does<00:06:34.430> but<00:06:35.420> you<00:06:35.720> should<00:06:35.990> get

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
this sub one does but you should get

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.350 
this sub one does but you should get
better<00:06:36.890> pumps<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:37.610> you<00:06:37.640> should<00:06:37.910> you<00:06:38.330> should

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
better pumps and you should you should

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.880 
better pumps and you should you should
just<00:06:38.840> you<00:06:39.200> should<00:06:39.230> and<00:06:39.500> it<00:06:39.590> shouldn't<00:06:39.830> take

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
just you should and it shouldn't take

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.280 
just you should and it shouldn't take
long<00:06:40.010> within<00:06:40.910> a<00:06:41.090> couple<00:06:41.270> days<00:06:41.510> you<00:06:41.870> should<00:06:41.930> see

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
long within a couple days you should see

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.690 
long within a couple days you should see
you<00:06:42.380> should<00:06:42.560> feel<00:06:42.830> actually<00:06:43.220> feel<00:06:43.400> pumps

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
you should feel actually feel pumps

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.010 
you should feel actually feel pumps
getting<00:06:43.940> a<00:06:44.000> little<00:06:44.210> bit<00:06:44.330> more<00:06:44.480> intense

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
getting a little bit more intense

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.540 
getting a little bit more intense
so<00:06:45.650> that's<00:06:46.640> a<00:06:46.970> partition<00:06:47.600> MV<00:06:47.870> 101<00:06:48.460> there<00:06:49.460> you

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
so that's a partition MV 101 there you

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.600 
so that's a partition MV 101 there you
go<00:06:49.730> enjoy<00:06:50.030> it
