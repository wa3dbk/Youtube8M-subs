00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
triple tap on the shift key to either

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340 
triple tap on the shift key to either
enable<00:01:35.460> or<00:01:35.790> disable<00:01:36.030> swipe<00:01:36.659> selection<00:01:37.170> so

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
enable or disable swipe selection so

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.020 
enable or disable swipe selection so
we'll<00:01:37.500> toggle<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.130> give<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we'll toggle that on and give that a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.440 
we'll toggle that on and give that a
shot<00:01:39.329> also<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> swipe<00:01:41.250> area<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.000> by

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
shot also you have a swipe area so by

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.420 
shot also you have a swipe area so by
default<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.170> set<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> entire<00:01:44.040> keyboard

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
default it's set to the entire keyboard

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
default it's set to the entire keyboard
you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.970> change<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.750> everything<00:01:46.290> but

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you can change this to everything but

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.520 
you can change this to everything but
the<00:01:46.619> spacebar<00:01:47.250> or<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> spacebar<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the spacebar or just the spacebar and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.840 
the spacebar or just the spacebar and
I'll<00:01:49.619> show<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.829> how<00:01:49.920> effective<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.490> on

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
I'll show you how effective this is on

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.630 
I'll show you how effective this is on
the<00:01:51.390> iPhone<00:01:51.600> as<00:01:52.020> well<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> iPad<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.399> let's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the iPhone as well as the iPad so let's

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.700 
the iPhone as well as the iPad so let's
jump<00:01:53.909> back<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.630> down<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> have

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
jump back here and down here you have

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.260 
jump back here and down here you have
these<00:01:55.860> sensitivity<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.969> change<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
these sensitivity so you can change the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.060 
these sensitivity so you can change the
sensitivity<00:01:57.869> from<00:01:58.290> either<00:01:58.530> normal<00:01:58.920> or

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
sensitivity from either normal or

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.090 
sensitivity from either normal or
reduced<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.899> basically<00:02:01.290> means<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.860> it's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
reduced so this basically means if it's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.260 
reduced so this basically means if it's
on<00:02:02.250> normal<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:02.820> you're<00:02:02.939> gonna<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
on normal then you're gonna have to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.139 
on normal then you're gonna have to
swipe<00:02:03.630> more<00:02:04.170> across<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.310> cover<00:02:05.820> more<00:02:06.090> ground

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
swipe more across to cover more ground

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.419 
swipe more across to cover more ground
if<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.200> set<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.439> reduced<00:02:08.039> then

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
if you have it set to reduced then

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.800 
if you have it set to reduced then
you're<00:02:08.520> gonna<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.879> cover<00:02:09.060> less<00:02:09.509> ground

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you're gonna have to cover less ground

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.979 
you're gonna have to cover less ground
to<00:02:10.349> move<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.770> cursor<00:02:11.099> more<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.690> let's<00:02:12.900> go

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
to move the cursor more and so let's go

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.910 
to move the cursor more and so let's go
ahead<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.170> put<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.349> on

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
ahead and put that on

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.190 
ahead and put that on
reduced<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.910> go<00:02:15.180> down<00:02:15.330> here<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.540> swipe<00:02:15.870> speed

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
reduced and go down here to swipe speed

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.110 
reduced and go down here to swipe speed
and<00:02:16.410> swipe<00:02:16.920> speed<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.550> change<00:02:17.849> how

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
and swipe speed is going to change how

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.540 
and swipe speed is going to change how
fast<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.569> cursor<00:02:18.930> moves<00:02:19.200> as<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.950> swipe<00:02:20.250> so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
fast the cursor moves as you swipe so

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.130 
fast the cursor moves as you swipe so
there's<00:02:20.790> actually<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.150> few<00:02:21.599> options<00:02:21.959> here<00:02:22.020> you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
there's actually a few options here you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.220 
there's actually a few options here you
have<00:02:22.500> slowest<00:02:23.069> slower<00:02:23.760> normal<00:02:24.420> faster<00:02:24.989> and

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
have slowest slower normal faster and

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.130 
have slowest slower normal faster and
fastest<00:02:25.830> I'm<00:02:26.220> actually<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.730> fan<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.300> faster<00:02:27.840> so

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
fastest I'm actually a fan of faster so

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.110 
fastest I'm actually a fan of faster so
we're<00:02:28.290> gonna<00:02:28.410> try<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.160> down<00:02:29.700> here<00:02:30.000> we

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
we're gonna try that and down here we

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.479 
we're gonna try that and down here we
have<00:02:30.150> three<00:02:30.660> finger<00:02:30.989> swipe<00:02:31.319> so<00:02:32.069> what<00:02:32.370> this

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
have three finger swipe so what this

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.190 
have three finger swipe so what this
allows<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.060> do<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.330> actually<00:02:33.660> swipe<00:02:33.959> with

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
allows you to do is actually swipe with

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.930 
allows you to do is actually swipe with
three<00:02:34.470> fingers<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.069> move<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.520> beginning

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
three fingers to move to the beginning

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.120 
three fingers to move to the beginning
or<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.150> end<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.750> document<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.860> doesn't

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
or the end of a document now it doesn't

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.250 
or the end of a document now it doesn't
really<00:02:38.220> translate<00:02:38.550> well<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.450> iPhone<00:02:40.019> but

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
really translate well on the iPhone but

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.259 
really translate well on the iPhone but
you<00:02:40.410> can<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:41.069> really<00:02:41.550> well<00:02:41.700> on<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.940> iPad

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
you can do this really well on the iPad

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.089 
you can do this really well on the iPad
and<00:02:42.420> I'm<00:02:42.480> gonna<00:02:42.630> show<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.900> all<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.709> stuff<00:02:43.950> on

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
and I'm gonna show you all this stuff on

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.729 
and I'm gonna show you all this stuff on
the<00:02:44.130> iPad<00:02:44.519> as<00:02:44.700> well<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.599> let's<00:02:45.870> jump<00:02:46.170> back<00:02:46.260> here

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the iPad as well so let's jump back here

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.390 
the iPad as well so let's jump back here
and<00:02:46.920> now<00:02:47.100> we're<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.640> check<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:49.400> what

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
and now we're going to check out what

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.610 
and now we're going to check out what
we've<00:02:50.550> changed<00:02:50.970> here<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.900> first<00:02:52.170> off<00:02:52.380> we

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
we've changed here so first off we

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.229 
we've changed here so first off we
changed<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.220> where<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.459> can<00:02:53.580> only<00:02:53.880> swipe

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
changed it to where we can only swipe

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.449 
changed it to where we can only swipe
across<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.840> spacebar<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.160> see<00:02:56.340> it

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
across the spacebar so you can see it

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.130 
across the spacebar so you can see it
works<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.880> spacebar<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:57.600> if<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:57.780> do<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.019> up

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
works on the spacebar but if we do it up

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.199 
works on the spacebar but if we do it up
here<00:02:58.310> absolutely<00:02:59.310> nothing's<00:02:59.670> working

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
here absolutely nothing's working

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.080 
here absolutely nothing's working
now<00:03:00.900> let's<00:03:01.200> delete<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.040> now<00:03:02.100> let's<00:03:02.910> say

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
now let's delete that and now let's say

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.759 
now let's delete that and now let's say
we<00:03:03.239> wanted<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.540> use<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.870> three<00:03:04.110> finger<00:03:04.440> swipe

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
we wanted to use the three finger swipe

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.390 
we wanted to use the three finger swipe
in<00:03:05.010> order<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:06.680> go<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.920> beginning<00:03:08.069> of<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
in order to go to the beginning of the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.960 
in order to go to the beginning of the
document

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
document

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.270 
document
so<00:03:09.269> let's<00:03:09.510> try<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.580> as<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.819> see

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
so let's try that and as you can see

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.530 
so let's try that and as you can see
doesn't<00:03:14.280> work<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.580> well<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> iPhone

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
doesn't work that well on the iPhone

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.180 
doesn't work that well on the iPhone
basically<00:03:16.049> just<00:03:16.260> hitting<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.620> bunch<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.980> keys

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
basically just hitting a bunch of keys

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.660 
basically just hitting a bunch of keys
and<00:03:17.430> not<00:03:17.819> working<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.420> well<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:19.410> this<00:03:20.280> so

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
and not working really well for this so

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.810 
and not working really well for this so
let's<00:03:20.940> go<00:03:21.239> ahead<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.540> delete<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:23.310> also

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
let's go ahead and delete that and also

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.030 
let's go ahead and delete that and also
if<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.000> swipe<00:03:24.239> across<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.049> see<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.890> we

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
if I swipe across you can see that we

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.370 
if I swipe across you can see that we
have<00:03:26.220> quite<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.609> bit<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.060> coverage<00:03:27.390> there<00:03:27.840> with

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
have quite a bit of coverage there with

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.140 
have quite a bit of coverage there with
just<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.890> little<00:03:29.130> amount<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:29.609> swipe<00:03:29.880> just

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
just a little amount of swipe just

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.270 
just a little amount of swipe just
because<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.450> have<00:03:30.690> reduced<00:03:31.170> on<00:03:31.410> as<00:03:31.620> well<00:03:32.100> as

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
because I have reduced on as well as

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.009 
because I have reduced on as well as
faster<00:03:32.640> scrolling<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:33.540> it's<00:03:33.690> gonna<00:03:33.780> cover

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
faster scrolling so it's gonna cover

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.050 
faster scrolling so it's gonna cover
more<00:03:34.230> ground<00:03:34.290> as<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:35.310> scroll<00:03:35.579> across<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
more ground as I scroll across the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.000 
more ground as I scroll across the
keyboard<00:03:36.269> now<00:03:36.989> if<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.170> triple<00:03:37.470> tap<00:03:37.650> on<00:03:37.829> the

can get a whole lot more coverage on the
iPad<00:04:20.070> rather<00:04:20.729> than<00:04:21.000> on<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.450> iPhone<00:04:21.989> so<00:04:22.680> it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
iPad rather than on the iPhone so it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.320 
iPad rather than on the iPhone so it
actually<00:04:23.099> works<00:04:23.280> really<00:04:23.370> well<00:04:23.729> for<00:04:23.789> these<00:04:24.120> two

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
actually works really well for these two

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.360 
actually works really well for these two
features<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.050> obviously<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.010> bigger

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
features and obviously you have a bigger

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.180 
features and obviously you have a bigger
keyboard

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
keyboard

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.920 
keyboard
the<00:04:27.310> iPad<00:04:27.730> so<00:04:27.970> it's<00:04:28.090> gonna<00:04:28.180> work<00:04:28.390> really<00:04:28.660> well

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930

when swiping across and it's going to

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.160

allow<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.240> cover<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:31.570> whole<00:04:31.810> lot<00:04:31.990> more

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170
