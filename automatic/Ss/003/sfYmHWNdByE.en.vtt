00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hello, I'm coming today with a super 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.940
 novelty that is this inspired makeup 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.429
 in the showcases to anger 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.000
 Who does not know the wonderful music there? 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.800
 of the Bolshoi theater is a makeup 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.869
 inspiration then we enjoy 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 some photos of her to play the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.140
 makeup and I'm going to tell 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.580
 you today 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.900
 so this is what I hope you like 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.900
 enjoy and go there 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.739
 who watched another make-up video 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.390
 You already know how to prepare the skin. 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.649
 I make the same video in this video 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.289
 so I put it real quick here 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.370
 this beginning I start with a base one 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.370
 straight top brush 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:10.470
 I'll come with the corrective 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:16.799
 Triangles spreads with a brush and 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.330
 then I pick my finger right there I 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.820
 I come with a powder to give that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:28.920
 ensure in the makeup leave the skin 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:38.460
 make the contour of the face with the powder 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:42.320
 easy tan on forehead also on 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.320
 nose to give the one that's dead 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.640
 the eyebrow I do with a shadow 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.440
 and with the bevelled brush equal to the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.920
 another video has also already watched 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.920
 You know 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.960
 now the coolest part of the eyes with 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:21.350
 a white shadow and with the same finger 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:35.180
 I wait across my eyelid underneath 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:38.510
 eyebrow at all ipod with brush 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.340
 there to tidy up a set and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.340
 always a blur 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.940
 with black apis I'll mark the concave 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.930
 This part does not have to be perfect, it's just 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.570
 to get a sense of where 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:03.220
 concave feature makeup 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.220
 her is the well marked conca 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:20.750
 then with a black shadow and this 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.750
 smoking brush I 'm going to smoke a lot 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:31.950
 in short, we even have to try 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:49.799
 make this marking the softest 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:52.110
 possible to type a gradient and then 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:04:00.390
 you can go back there with the white shade to 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:03.569
 give that stuff and then we'll go 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.030
 pass the white shadow under the eye 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.959
 but it is not inside the eye it is underneath is 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.709
 on the skin to give that light that is 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.709
 enhanced 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.740
 then we will do the same thing to 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.350
 people made in the concave with pencils people 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.270
 will mark that trace below but 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.890
 You're just supposed to get a sense of where 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.720
 will get the dear black 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.200
 it comes with a bevelled brush the same 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.110
 eyebrow with a black shadow 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.740
 sneaks leaves you a guide 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.280
 Back there, I 'm going to give you a tidy 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.280
 White 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.449
 there we go to the outline 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.850
 this is an easy eyeliner pen makes the 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.280
 the eyeliner kitten and there in 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:05.820
 kitten that almost joins with the 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.820
 black shadow with marking the cable 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.259
 my eyelashes are not 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.090
 Before I glued my eyelashes, I 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:22.389
 My mash children pass by 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:35.470
 natural to give that organized ae 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:41.139
 I glued my eyelashes and then I 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:45.210
 mascara and step enough to stick the 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.210
 natural eyelashes on false eyelashes 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:01.300
 false bottom also gives a little twist 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:06.400
 It's funny that I used this makeup alone. 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:09.280
 two-tone black and white album now 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.360
 was domineering to give a glow not in the 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.360
 willow skin 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:29.380
 Then I'll come with a plus xii step there 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.390
 more or less where we did the 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.390
 contour just above the contour 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:42.450
 and there the button always before passing 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.450
 lipstick does not like to pass mouth base 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.760
 This lipstick is matt so I always like it 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.100
 spending a gloss so why not 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.440
 I like them to be so dry and in makeup. 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.260
 it's also very bright button button 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.740
 she uses 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.360
 and this is our final result 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.940
 I hope you liked it. 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.700
 forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:13.440
 If you liked a jewel and that's it. 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.440
 One kiss and see you next time.
