scale venom maybe that slows him down

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.380 
scale venom maybe that slows him down
and<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> still<00:01:35.189> cannot<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.640> him<00:01:35.790> off<00:01:35.880> me<00:01:36.090> see<00:01:36.360> I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and it still cannot get him off me see I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
and it still cannot get him off me see I
thought<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.140> almost<00:01:37.650> had<00:01:37.979> him<00:01:38.040> dropped

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
thought here I almost had him dropped

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.149 
thought here I almost had him dropped
popping<00:01:39.390> dual<00:01:39.659> pistols<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.290> him<00:01:40.439> with<00:01:41.009> my

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
popping dual pistols on him with my

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.280 
popping dual pistols on him with my
Venom's<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.850> nope<00:01:42.090> he's<00:01:42.450> got<00:01:42.659> he's<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> warrior

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
Venom's but nope he's got he's a warrior

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.190 
Venom's but nope he's got he's a warrior
so<00:01:43.500> he's<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> ton<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> Defense<00:01:44.960> 'days<00:01:45.960> him<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
so he's got a ton of Defense 'days him a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
so he's got a ton of Defense 'days him a
couple<00:01:46.409> times<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.799> think<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.130> my<00:01:47.420> number<00:01:48.420> 4

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
couple times I think that's my number 4

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.370 
couple times I think that's my number 4
pistol<00:01:49.140> skill<00:01:49.409> there<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:51.630> try<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> stop<00:01:52.350> him

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
pistol skill there to try and stop him

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.990 
pistol skill there to try and stop him
from<00:01:52.560> using<00:01:52.829> skills<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.520> putting<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> hurt

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
from using skills and putting the hurt

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.819 
from using skills and putting the hurt
on<00:01:54.119> me<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.450> every<00:01:54.780> time<00:01:54.810> he<00:01:54.990> locks<00:01:55.290> me<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> get

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
on me but every time he locks me I get

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.490 
on me but every time he locks me I get
into<00:01:56.009> serious<00:01:56.219> trouble<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.700> mean<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.500> just

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
into serious trouble I mean it just

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.649 
into serious trouble I mean it just
impossible<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:02:00.210> that's<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
impossible and then I think that's the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.120 
impossible and then I think that's the
friendly<00:02:01.140> Mesmer<00:02:01.500> there<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.829> bought<00:02:01.950> me<00:02:02.070> a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
friendly Mesmer there that bought me a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.650 
friendly Mesmer there that bought me a
little<00:02:02.159> bit<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.490> time<00:02:02.640> I'm<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:02.850> sure

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.990 

looks<00:02:06.660> like<00:02:06.870> that<00:02:07.320> fell<00:02:07.620> often<00:02:07.980> see<00:02:08.430> I<00:02:08.640> thought

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
looks like that fell often see I thought

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.490 
looks like that fell often see I thought
I<00:02:09.060> was<00:02:09.270> gonna<00:02:09.390> drop<00:02:09.660> him<00:02:09.869> right<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.380> guy

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
I was gonna drop him right here that guy

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.480 
I was gonna drop him right here that guy
is<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.890> low<00:02:11.070> but<00:02:11.280> he<00:02:11.310> pops<00:02:11.610> off<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.850> heel<00:02:13.490> man

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
is so low but he pops off the heel man

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.820 
is so low but he pops off the heel man
