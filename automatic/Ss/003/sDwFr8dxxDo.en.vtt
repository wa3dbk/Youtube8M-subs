00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.190
 good morning everyone here I do not know that here 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.709
 today we are going to learn how to make an effect shot in photoshop 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:09.729
 let's see photos or 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.879
 adobe photoshop elements 7 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.160
 tenor version 7 points 0 can use any photoshop because really 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.070
 anyone does not matter 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.970
 comes to be expanding and friend mae programs as they can never watch mentoring 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.880
 from kimi magic bar 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.160
 yes then what we avoid good as lic pictures ap and kurt image 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.630
 well this little pixeled ahead to his short another image 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.260
 perez ben amics that female is a tripod but I can do whatever they want 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.760
 was in being shooting from a computer wizard 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.620
 from their eyes not to their children not but good of what they want basically 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.540
 maybe it is not noticeable but in that tutorial we are not going to put much lighting 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.310
 maybe we are a little 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.309
 what happens is that this photo 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.329
 they took them when I picked up a tripod like that on purpose 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.880
 and answer hand I'm catching 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.570
 a the other side 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.930
 so 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.220
 it seems that they study illuminating a lot 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.220
 but it's important let's swift others 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 we wait for the somoza team to load the chart 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.840
 I recommend that you put search and boo new and everything else 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.490
 holy bay its image 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.900
 aam horns of a video that is trying to destroy many days ago 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.610
 and if they answer that day go check it out because it's like being a 3d good in faster 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.760
 efe this is the part as you see them 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.000
 of what the church 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.750
 take this image and with 13 for this act right click copy 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.250
 and this if we are lucky photoshop is going to be the measures that 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.040
 we need as in here choosing your properties what you want 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 I already like to have transparent background regev mode 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 i do not save with the way we wanted but it does not matter 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.350
 paste some image 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.389
 a new layer 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.599
 or simply 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.699
 let's take 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.349
 we drag and drop 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.790
 well there will be a new one so we are in that need this what happens 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.750
 is that I have I have this nexus bar and no longer postpone images there 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.459
 because it is saved and in the bar 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.089
 but it does not matter 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:28.859
 evans usero av control 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.099
 Controls and pj 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.900
 and look how they can see they create a trap under the bottom if it shoots 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.930
 because the field does not work with funds we do not like 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:43.569
 well and with more control we can advance libertÃ© if indeed 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.619
 it's such a good resolution of the subject 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.399
 now let's go av 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.449
 bouvier 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:54.469
 and we look in images to what is called mazuz read 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:02.289
 or simply lopera 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.770
 after we already have the dirtiest here you can see 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.440
 the name in Spain 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.070
 according to the translator, it includes the one of espoz and ccoo bud 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.249
 but I do not think that many things disappear when it is completed 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.249
 but they take very many very many very many 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:21.729
 and in this case with your loved ones a submachine gun 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:25.089
 it looks really good little can keep looking because there are many in 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.529
 true chelsea 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.309
 epistles 70 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.769
 you can not copy image 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.870
 in smata last we are going to paste this margin with control b 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.399
 and well we have not chosen this wand or anything like that 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.269
 so simply 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.489
 do that in extreme in 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.899
 it will look 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.279
 no borders sent brazil 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:52.369
 Uncommon in people 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.869
 we are simply going to look for it so that it has the same number as in our hands 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.239
 when check and how we see it is here 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.449
 well and then let's go to the layers themselves 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.280
 and we click on normal and with our arrows 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.949
 let's go down 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.099
 one by one 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.369
 until you find 1 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.249
 what for example she is getting closer to the one we want 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.409
 there more and more 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.409
 click nothing against one that you do not like look at him 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.079
 but so one that is 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.090
 it seems to me that I passed 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.439
 let me see 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.629
 this 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:33.189
 per hundred on exposure limiting all that exists clear darker 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:39.179
 clarify another color more either one of the two displace or one of the three 

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:42.529
 and look up well in the light copdarum this illuminated touch 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.599
 and they are coming these are the Japanese 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.029
 very easy to do this 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:51.860
 and if you want to help a little 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.860
 to those who do not leave the country covered 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.370
 we choose here 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.400
 what only expose 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.870
 soda change our prick 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.909
 and let's not say to the control z 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:05.939
 drive 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.589
 the girl moss a bit the pitcher with less 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.589
 we can not guess 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.900
 of tomes goalkeeper the photo that I take 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.620
 percent 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.620
 dayz everything else is much darker 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.830
 but anyway, they want to continue clarifying 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.370
 can circulate to touch the wall 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.790
 they can do it with a man 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.790
 blurred 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.259
 Incidents Chile continues to use the effects we are doing 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.779
 I can recommend some 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.240
 for example 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.499
 p we act aerial a bell over this 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:57.639
 and put filter 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.189
 play 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:01.619
 flash 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:04.339
 percent of the embers in the layer 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:06.939
 our our most suffer 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.979
 interprets Robert Coello and here we have different flashes than his opponents 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.860
 in the bottom 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.860
 famous teacher very much the brightness 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.869
 perched with different types of spotlights 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.860
 police linear 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.849
 stays 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.529
 and ocher tones 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.869
 it gives a bad effect because I made a mistake kapanga capo 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.319
 but there is another one brings out the final result 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.740
 how can they look pretty good 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.279
 and he has not 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.639
 nothing to envy to photos very worked on this 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.199
 and you can simply perfect these k 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.650
 would obviously like to not be much longer this happen 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.379
 I think this happens to them what is happening to me is eta 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.080
 of this ruin your last feat completely so go testing all 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.800
 own but you know the most important thing that ever 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.749
 what is the most hostile 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:11.300
 well I hope that the pse the tevez sextet
