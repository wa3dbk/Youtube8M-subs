 one side is a familiar dish of patties with 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.279
 the other side of the unusual components and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.020
 so let's get down to cooking 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.939
 sardine cutlet 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 first we need a jar 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.000
 sardines themselves in their own juice 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:32.399
 be sure to drain and fill all then 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.550
 sardines laid out bowl for mixing 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.710
 whether in a bowl as you like and meat 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.649
 must be separated from the bones 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.450
 generally honestly in canned food 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.129
 the bones are soft enough and not 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.360
 be sure to take out but as they say 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.289
 to clear your conscience 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.570
 do this procedure now with 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.270
 using a fork, the fish needs size 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.149
 we got this kind of fish mass 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.549
 which i put aside honestly 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.470
 saying you can not necessarily use 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.659
 sardines can use any 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.040
 canned fish is important to draw 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.890
 boil without adding salt in two 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.830
 liters of water rice surely give 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.860
