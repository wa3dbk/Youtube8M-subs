version<00:00:55.130> of<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.640> much<00:00:56.390> bigger<00:00:56.960> one<00:00:57.350> but<00:00:57.530> it

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
version of the much bigger one but it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.910 
version of the much bigger one but it
still<00:00:57.860> works<00:00:58.070> pretty<00:00:58.280> well<00:00:58.400> and<00:00:58.960> there<00:00:59.960> are<00:01:00.140> 10

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
and shoot them through a small slot here

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.200 
and shoot them through a small slot here
that's<00:01:36.440> in<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.710> middle<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:37.220> board<00:01:37.520> now

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
that's in the middle of the board now

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.090 
that's in the middle of the board now
usually<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.200> best<00:01:39.350> way<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.560> shoot<00:01:39.770> me<00:01:39.920> just

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
usually the best way to shoot me just

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.250 
usually the best way to shoot me just
straight<00:01:40.370> across<00:01:40.670> like<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.720> if<00:01:41.990> they<00:01:42.110> go

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
straight across like that and if they go

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.870 
straight across like that and if they go
halfway<00:01:42.500> through<00:01:42.830> you<00:01:42.979> can<00:01:43.250> try<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:43.610> shoot

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
halfway through you can try to shoot

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.149 
halfway through you can try to shoot
them<00:01:44.000> through<00:01:44.299> diagonally<00:01:45.200> or<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.890> can<00:01:46.010> try

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
them through diagonally or you can try

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.130 
them through diagonally or you can try
and<00:01:46.280> bounce<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.150> it<00:01:47.270> bounces<00:01:47.420> off<00:01:47.900> and

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
and bounce it so that it bounces off and

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.500 
and bounce it so that it bounces off and
comes<00:01:48.350> through<00:01:48.590> here<00:01:48.950> but<00:01:49.760> once<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.299> game

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
comes through here but once the game

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.750 
comes through here but once the game
begins<00:01:50.680> you<00:01:51.680> just<00:01:51.860> start<00:01:52.010> shooting<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.490> back

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
begins you just start shooting it back

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.550 
begins you just start shooting it back
and<00:01:53.000> forth<00:01:53.240> as<00:01:53.390> fast<00:01:53.420> as<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.810> can<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:54.409> let<00:01:54.530> me
