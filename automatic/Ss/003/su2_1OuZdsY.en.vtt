hey<00:00:01.230> guys<00:00:01.469> today<00:00:01.949> I'm<00:00:02.070> at<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.250> base<00:00:02.399> of<00:00:02.550> a

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hey guys today I'm at the base of a

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.480 
hey guys today I'm at the base of a
harvester<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:04.100> you<00:00:05.100> know<00:00:05.190> what's<00:00:05.370> special

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
harvester and you know what's special

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.849 
harvester and you know what's special
today<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.810> bottom<00:00:07.170> door<00:00:07.319> on<00:00:07.589> the

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
today is that the bottom door on the

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.100 
today is that the bottom door on the
harvester<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.370> open<00:00:08.730> now<00:00:09.540> usually<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.960> is

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
harvester is open now usually this is

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.140 
harvester is open now usually this is
closed<00:00:10.410> because<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:11.219> has<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.550> be<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.059> it

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
closed because it has to be so that it

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.370 
closed because it has to be so that it
doesn't<00:00:12.389> come<00:00:12.450> out<00:00:12.570> but

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
doesn't come out but

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.140 
doesn't come out but
today<00:00:15.010> it's<00:00:15.160> open<00:00:15.400> because<00:00:15.550> the<00:00:15.760> harvesters

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
today it's open because the harvesters

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.710 
today it's open because the harvesters
are<00:00:16.270> empty<00:00:16.540> we've<00:00:16.900> read<00:00:17.080> it<00:00:17.200> completely<00:00:18.360> now

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
are empty we've read it completely now

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.390 
are empty we've read it completely now
I<00:00:19.750> must<00:00:20.110> stick<00:00:20.230> the<00:00:20.320> camera<00:00:20.590> up<00:00:20.650> inside<00:00:20.950> so<00:00:21.340> you

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
I must stick the camera up inside so you

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.240 
I must stick the camera up inside so you
can<00:00:21.670> see<00:00:22.090> what's<00:00:22.390> up<00:00:22.690> at<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.050> top<00:00:23.290> I<00:00:23.590> would

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
can see what's up at the top I would

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.330 
can see what's up at the top I would
show<00:00:24.580> you<00:00:24.640> what's<00:00:24.850> at<00:00:24.940> the<00:00:25.029> bottom<00:00:25.360> but<00:00:25.900> I

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
show you what's at the bottom but I

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.779 
show you what's at the bottom but I
can't<00:00:27.340> I<00:00:28.200> can't<00:00:29.200> get

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
can't I can't get

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.670 
can't I can't get
into<00:00:31.480> there<00:00:31.630> where<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.960> camera<00:00:32.230> can<00:00:32.259> pick<00:00:32.529> it

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
into there where the camera can pick it

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.799 
into there where the camera can pick it
up<00:00:32.770> because<00:00:33.399> it's<00:00:33.670> really<00:00:33.880> dark<00:00:34.000> in<00:00:34.210> there<00:00:34.300> the

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
up because it's really dark in there the

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.930 
up because it's really dark in there the
camera<00:00:34.989> can't<00:00:35.320> pick<00:00:35.380> up<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.680> little<00:00:35.890> light<00:00:36.010> so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
camera can't pick up a little light so

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.639 
camera can't pick up a little light so
I'm<00:00:37.540> gonna<00:00:37.629> stick<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.960> camera<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.379> you<00:00:38.470> can

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
I'm gonna stick the camera and you can

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:47.729 
I'm gonna stick the camera and you can
kind<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.070> see<00:00:39.250> for<00:00:39.400> yourself<00:00:44.489> now<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:47.440> those

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
kind of see for yourself now what those

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.490 
kind of see for yourself now what those
two<00:00:48.010> holes<00:00:48.220> you<00:00:48.400> see<00:00:48.610> are<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:50.080> two<00:00:50.230> doors<00:00:50.410> on

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
two holes you see are the two doors on

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.579 
two holes you see are the two doors on
the<00:00:50.650> top<00:00:50.830> of<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.040> harvester<00:00:52.019> and<00:00:53.019> the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
the top of the harvester and the

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.530 
the top of the harvester and the
secondary<00:00:53.949> door<00:00:54.220> towards<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:55.059> bottom<00:00:55.269> of<00:00:55.480> the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
secondary door towards the bottom of the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.610 
secondary door towards the bottom of the
screen<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:57.100> or<00:00:58.170> opening<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.290> before<00:00:59.559> you

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
screen that or opening it before you

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.200 
screen that or opening it before you
open<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.890> top<00:01:00.070> door<00:01:00.280> just<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.790> relieve<00:01:01.030> any

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
open the top door just to relieve any

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:12.270 
open the top door just to relieve any
pressure<00:01:04.020> zoom<00:01:05.020> in<00:01:09.270> all<00:01:10.270> right<00:01:10.979> now<00:01:11.979> you<00:01:12.039> see

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
pressure zoom in all right now you see

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.940 
pressure zoom in all right now you see
those<00:01:12.430> kind<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:12.700> two<00:01:13.530> deflated<00:01:14.530> things<00:01:14.770> on

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
those kind of two deflated things on

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.670 
those kind of two deflated things on
each<00:01:15.100> side<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.490> middle<00:01:16.090> door<00:01:16.530> those<00:01:17.530> would

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
each side of the middle door those would

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.400 
each side of the middle door those would
be<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.920> air<00:01:18.220> bags<00:01:18.550> that<00:01:19.149> help<00:01:19.720> relieve<00:01:20.259> any

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
be the air bags that help relieve any

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.380 
be the air bags that help relieve any
pressure<00:01:20.800> for<00:01:21.160> when<00:01:21.250> you<00:01:21.340> might<00:01:21.550> feed<00:01:21.789> out<00:01:21.940> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
pressure for when you might feed out and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.810 
pressure for when you might feed out and
the<00:01:22.570> air<00:01:22.929> can't<00:01:23.200> escape

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the air can't escape

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.850 
the air can't escape
so<00:01:24.820> basically<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:25.840> keeps<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.259> harvester<00:01:26.679> from

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
so basically it keeps the harvester from

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.520 
so basically it keeps the harvester from
collapsing<00:01:27.280> in<00:01:27.399> on<00:01:27.460> itself<00:01:27.520> by<00:01:28.179> letting<00:01:28.530> more

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
collapsing in on itself by letting more

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.340 
collapsing in on itself by letting more
air<00:01:29.940> inside<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.000> bags<00:01:31.300> but<00:01:31.690> not<00:01:31.840> actually

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
air inside the bags but not actually

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.160 
air inside the bags but not actually
more<00:01:32.649> air<00:01:32.800> into<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.160> purpose<00:01:33.899> now<00:01:34.899> if<00:01:35.020> i<00:01:35.140> zoom

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
more air into the purpose now if i zoom

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.480 
more air into the purpose now if i zoom
in<00:01:36.330> and<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.450> see<00:01:37.660> those<00:01:37.840> two<00:01:38.170> kind<00:01:38.619> of<00:01:38.740> things

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
in and you see those two kind of things

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.100 
in and you see those two kind of things
extending<00:01:40.060> from<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.330> middle<00:01:40.599> out<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
extending from the middle out to the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.359 
extending from the middle out to the
bags<00:01:41.819> those<00:01:42.819> would<00:01:43.119> be<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:43.270> lines<00:01:43.509> for

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
bags those would be the lines for

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.139 
bags those would be the lines for
picking<00:01:45.369> up<00:01:45.459> the<00:01:45.580> bags<00:01:45.729> for<00:01:45.970> when<00:01:46.060> you're

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
picking up the bags for when you're

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.109 
picking up the bags for when you're
getting<00:01:46.239> the<00:01:46.390> harvester<00:01:46.780> full<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.700> way

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.460 

when<00:01:52.119> you're<00:01:52.239> filling<00:01:52.450> hit<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.929> hay<00:01:53.140> doesn't

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
when you're filling hit the hay doesn't

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.219 
when you're filling hit the hay doesn't
cover<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.190> bags<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:55.360> when<00:01:55.899> you<00:01:55.989> start

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
cover the bags and when you start

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.960 
cover the bags and when you start
feeding<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:57.009> hay<00:01:57.130> we'll<00:01:57.310> pull<00:01:57.489> the<00:01:57.550> bags<00:01:57.759> down

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
feeding the hay we'll pull the bags down

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.969 
feeding the hay we'll pull the bags down
then<00:01:58.209> I'll<00:01:58.330> rip<00:01:58.539> them<00:01:58.660> off<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.709> then<00:01:59.830> you<00:01:59.890> have

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
then I'll rip them off and then you have

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.979 
then I'll rip them off and then you have
to<00:02:00.130> replace<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.489> bags<00:02:00.700> which<00:02:01.060> might<00:02:01.420> cost<00:02:01.840> a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:01.989 
to replace the bags which might cost a

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:07.930 
to replace the bags which might cost a
couple<00:02:02.080> thousand<00:02:02.500> dollars

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.140 

and<00:02:09.319> that's<00:02:10.319> basically<00:02:10.619> about<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.550> that's<00:02:11.849> in

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and that's basically about it that's in

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.080 
and that's basically about it that's in
the<00:02:12.239> harvester<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.290> see<00:02:13.790> around<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
the harvester but you can see around the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
from here but if I got at the top and I

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.520 
from here but if I got at the top and I
look<00:02:23.190> down<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.019> was<00:02:25.170> really<00:02:25.319> high

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
look down you think it was really high

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.309 
look down you think it was really high
and<00:02:26.150> at<00:02:27.150> some<00:02:27.390> point<00:02:27.629> I<00:02:27.750> might<00:02:27.870> combine<00:02:28.110> this

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
and at some point I might combine this

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.110
