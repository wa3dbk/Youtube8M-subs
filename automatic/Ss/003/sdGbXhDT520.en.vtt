00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
you like a little bit of an edge against

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.700 
you like a little bit of an edge against
his<00:00:57.570> new<00:00:57.750> routines<00:00:58.050> who<00:00:58.199> haven't<00:00:58.469> been<00:00:58.500> used

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
his new routines who haven't been used

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.569 
his new routines who haven't been used
to<00:00:58.800> playing<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.190> all<00:01:00.379> wall<00:01:01.379> fixed<00:01:02.070> analyze

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
to playing like all wall fixed analyze

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.640 
to playing like all wall fixed analyze
right<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.719> allows<00:01:03.960> teams<00:01:04.350> day

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
right right I that allows teams day

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190 
right right I that allows teams day
still<00:01:05.189> script<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.060> 10<00:01:06.330> hours<00:01:06.360> their

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
still script for like 10 hours their

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.399 
still script for like 10 hours their
first<00:01:07.619> Emma's<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:09.270> okay<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
first Emma's it is there okay but the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.960 
first Emma's it is there okay but the
difference<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.010> they're<00:01:11.490> not<00:01:11.640> used<00:01:11.880> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
difference is that they're not used to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.780 
difference is that they're not used to
play<00:01:12.150> us<00:01:12.330> off<00:01:12.510> their<00:01:13.080> game<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.979> multiple

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
play us off their game for multiple

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.170 
play us off their game for multiple
hours<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.900> something<00:01:16.049> different

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
hours and that's something different

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.760 
hours and that's something different
huge<00:01:18.180> advantage<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.619> can

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
huge advantage but it's one that you can

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.260 
huge advantage but it's one that you can
still<00:01:19.950> point<00:01:20.100> out<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.580> what<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.790> even

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
