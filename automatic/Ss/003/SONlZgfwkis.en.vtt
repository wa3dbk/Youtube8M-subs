cable system I just quickly want to show

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.540 
cable system I just quickly want to show
you<00:00:18.849> how<00:00:19.390> to<00:00:19.480> retention<00:00:20.079> your<00:00:20.499> balustrade<00:00:21.369> or

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
pool fence if and when that's required

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.460 
pool fence if and when that's required
it's<00:00:24.880> an<00:00:24.999> easy<00:00:25.179> task<00:00:25.539> and<00:00:26.019> it<00:00:26.140> should<00:00:26.319> only

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
it's an easy task and it should only

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.889 
it's an easy task and it should only
take<00:00:26.619> a<00:00:26.890> few<00:00:27.159> minutes<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:28.149> retention<00:00:28.569> an

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:28.899 
take a few minutes to retention an

take a few minutes to retention an
average-sized<00:00:29.439> job<00:00:31.439> after<00:00:32.439> your<00:00:32.559> valise<00:00:32.920> try

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
average-sized job after your valise try

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.040 
average-sized job after your valise try
to<00:00:33.160> pull<00:00:33.489> fence<00:00:33.760> has<00:00:34.000> first<00:00:34.329> been<00:00:34.510> installed

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
to pull fence has first been installed

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.410 
to pull fence has first been installed
that<00:00:35.620> will<00:00:35.680> tend<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.370> settle<00:00:36.640> into<00:00:37.059> its<00:00:37.180> new

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
that will tend to settle into its new

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.380 
that will tend to settle into its new
environment<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:38.350> it<00:00:39.250> can<00:00:39.489> lose<00:00:39.699> tension<00:00:40.120> in

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
environment and it can lose tension in

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.479 
environment and it can lose tension in
this<00:00:40.539> time<00:00:40.840> so<00:00:41.350> it's<00:00:41.469> a<00:00:41.530> good<00:00:41.679> idea<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:42.100> check

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
this time so it's a good idea to check

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.880 
this time so it's a good idea to check
it<00:00:42.640> around<00:00:43.179> about<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.449> month<00:00:43.809> after<00:00:44.079> initial

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
it around about a month after initial

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.369 
it around about a month after initial
installation<00:00:45.219> and<00:00:45.789> then<00:00:46.269> again<00:00:46.600> annually

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
installation and then again annually

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.700 
installation and then again annually
after<00:00:47.530> that<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.600> important<00:00:50.109> to<00:00:50.230> know<00:00:50.410> that

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
after that it's important to know that

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.250 
after that it's important to know that
even<00:00:51.370> if<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.640> system<00:00:51.850> does<00:00:52.300> lose<00:00:52.719> a<00:00:52.749> bit<00:00:53.140> of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
even if the system does lose a bit of

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.889 
even if the system does lose a bit of
tension<00:00:53.469> it's<00:00:53.949> still<00:00:54.309> entirely<00:00:54.760> safe<00:00:55.269> it's

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
tension it's still entirely safe it's

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.319 
tension it's still entirely safe it's
just<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.469> for<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.949> comply<00:00:57.550> to<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.910> building

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
just that for to comply to the building

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.349 
just that for to comply to the building
code<00:00:58.359> it<00:00:58.749> must<00:00:58.960> be<00:00:59.199> a<00:00:59.230> specific<00:00:59.890> tension<00:01:00.359> we've

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
code it must be a specific tension we've

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.110 
code it must be a specific tension we've
developed<00:01:01.809> a<00:01:01.870> tension<00:01:02.289> tester<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.940> this

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
developed a tension tester and with this

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.300 
developed a tension tester and with this
you<00:01:04.360> can<00:01:04.510> easily<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.170> quickly<00:01:05.320> test<00:01:06.100> with

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
you can easily and quickly test with

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.310 
you can easily and quickly test with
your<00:01:06.490> ballast<00:01:06.850> Rodney's<00:01:07.270> retention<00:01:07.990> and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
your ballast Rodney's retention and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.600 
your ballast Rodney's retention and
that's<00:01:08.680> what<00:01:08.830> I'm<00:01:08.920> going<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.130> show<00:01:09.280> you<00:01:09.340> how<00:01:09.550> to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
that's what I'm going to show you how to

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.860 
that's what I'm going to show you how to
do<00:01:09.820> next<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.760> way<00:01:12.910> we<00:01:13.060> use<00:01:13.300> this<00:01:13.570> tension

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
do next the way we use this tension

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.050 
do next the way we use this tension
tester<00:01:14.470> is<00:01:15.220> we've<00:01:15.400> got<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.610> put<00:01:15.760> it<00:01:15.880> through

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
tester is we've got to put it through

and<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.400> lower<00:01:21.610> rail<00:01:22.980> which<00:01:23.980> is<00:01:24.130> round<00:01:24.370> about

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
and the lower rail which is round about

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.810 
and the lower rail which is round about
there<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:26.380> put<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.740> through<00:01:26.770> between<00:01:27.700> the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
there we put it through between the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.160 
there we put it through between the
wires<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:29.130> pull<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.280> back<00:01:30.490> toward<00:01:30.940> us<00:01:31.170> until

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
wires and pull it back toward us until

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.800 
wires and pull it back toward us until
the<00:01:32.290> wires<00:01:32.560> click<00:01:33.070> into<00:01:33.760> these<00:01:33.940> slots<00:01:34.300> at<00:01:34.720> the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
back of the tension tester so what we're

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.260 
back of the tension tester so what we're
looking<00:01:37.870> for<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.100> see<00:01:39.460> what<00:01:39.670> these<00:01:39.850> flats

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
looking for is to see what these flats

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.380 
looking for is to see what these flats
do<00:01:40.570> if<00:01:41.530> they<00:01:41.770> come<00:01:41.980> together<00:01:42.220> as<00:01:42.700> they<00:01:43.090> are<00:01:43.120> in

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
do if they come together as they are in

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.050 
do if they come together as they are in
this<00:01:43.540> case<00:01:43.870> that<00:01:44.680> means<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.070> tensions<00:01:45.580> okay

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
this case that means the tensions okay

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.500 
this case that means the tensions okay
and<00:01:46.360> we<00:01:46.870> don't<00:01:47.080> need<00:01:47.230> to<00:01:47.290> do<00:01:47.590> anything<00:01:48.510> however

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
and we don't need to do anything however

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.470 
and we don't need to do anything however
in<00:01:49.720> some<00:01:49.960> cases<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.470> might<00:01:50.770> be<00:01:51.010> that<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:52.210> flats

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
in some cases it might be that the flats

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.450 
in some cases it might be that the flats
do<00:01:52.690> not<00:01:52.840> come<00:01:53.110> together<00:01:53.260> and<00:01:53.710> that's<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.250> sign

do not come together and that's a sign

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.240 
do not come together and that's a sign
that<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.760> does<00:01:54.970> need<00:01:55.240> retention<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:57.100> way

retention<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.319> system<00:02:20.739> what<00:02:21.069> we<00:02:21.190> need<00:02:21.340> is<00:02:21.519> a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
retention the system what we need is a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.180 
retention the system what we need is a
17<00:02:22.209> millimeter<00:02:22.480> socket<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:24.129> a<00:02:24.190> ratchet<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.980> put

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
17 millimeter socket on a ratchet we put

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.259 
17 millimeter socket on a ratchet we put
that<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.530> bolt<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.690> give<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:33.090> few<00:02:34.090> turns

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
that on the bolt and give it a few turns

00:02:34.269 --> 00:03:00.089 
that on the bolt and give it a few turns
and<00:02:55.560> now<00:02:56.560> we<00:02:56.620> just<00:02:56.890> check<00:02:58.200> once<00:02:59.200> again<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.920> we

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
and now we just check once again and we

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.699 
and now we just check once again and we
can<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.610> flats<00:03:00.849> come<00:03:01.150> together<00:03:01.709> which

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
can see the flats come together which

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.180 
can see the flats come together which
means<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.160> tension<00:03:03.549> is<00:03:03.670> good<00:03:05.069> when<00:03:06.069> it<00:03:06.160> comes

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
means the tension is good when it comes

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.190 
means the tension is good when it comes
to<00:03:06.579> tensioning<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:07.209> checking<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.690> tension<00:03:08.079> in

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
to tensioning or checking the tension in

the<00:03:08.319> pool<00:03:08.560> gate<00:03:08.799> it's<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.549> different<00:03:09.910> system<00:03:10.090> we

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the pool gate it's a different system we

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.449 
the pool gate it's a different system we
use<00:03:10.690> that's<00:03:11.200> because<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.980> top<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.370> bottom

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
use that's because the top and bottom

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.759 
use that's because the top and bottom
rails<00:03:12.790> can't<00:03:13.360> spread<00:03:13.810> because<00:03:14.200> they're<00:03:14.410> fixed

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
rails can't spread because they're fixed

rails can't spread because they're fixed
by<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:14.980> timber<00:03:15.280> Stiles<00:03:15.880> on<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.150> side<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:17.110> what

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
by the timber Stiles on the side so what

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.620 
by the timber Stiles on the side so what
we're<00:03:17.410> doing<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.739> pool<00:03:17.950> gate<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.609> we<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:19.329> run

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
we're doing the pool gate is we just run

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.379 
we're doing the pool gate is we just run
the<00:03:20.049> cable<00:03:20.440> back<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.859> forth<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.400> then<00:03:22.120> we<00:03:22.209> use

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
the cable back and forth and then we use

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.590 
the cable back and forth and then we use
an<00:03:22.510> inline<00:03:22.690> tensioner<00:03:23.880> at<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.030> bottom<00:03:25.359> hunt

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
an inline tensioner at the bottom hunt

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.039 
an inline tensioner at the bottom hunt
where<00:03:26.470> my<00:03:26.590> finger<00:03:26.950> is<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:28.510> same<00:03:28.720> on<00:03:28.900> this

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
where my finger is and the same on this

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.910 
where my finger is and the same on this
side<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.730> if<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.690> system<00:03:32.049> needs<00:03:32.260> tensioning

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
side so if the system needs tensioning

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.550 
side so if the system needs tensioning
which<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.549> one<00:03:33.790> does<00:03:34.019> we'll<00:03:35.019> see<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.319> metal

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
which this one does we'll see that metal

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.860 
which this one does we'll see that metal
ones<00:03:35.829> a<00:03:35.980> bit<00:03:36.160> loose<00:03:36.340> we've<00:03:36.940> got<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.269> chase<00:03:37.630> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
ones a bit loose we've got to chase the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.030 
ones a bit loose we've got to chase the
tension<00:03:38.260> back<00:03:38.560> from<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:39.430> side<00:03:39.730> back<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:41.290> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
tension back from this side back to the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.110 
tension back from this side back to the
end<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.489> inline<00:03:42.819> tensioner<00:03:48.120> that's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
end of the inline tensioner that's

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.390 
end of the inline tensioner that's
pretty<00:03:49.389> good<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.500> can<00:03:50.620> see<00:03:50.680> how<00:03:51.040> that

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
pretty good and you can see how that

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.240 
pretty good and you can see how that
one's<00:03:51.639> gone<00:03:52.000> really<00:03:52.329> loose<00:03:52.720> now<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.440> then

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
one's gone really loose now and then

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.140 
one's gone really loose now and then
with<00:03:54.819> our<00:03:54.850> socket<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:57.280> then<00:03:57.489> we<00:03:57.609> take<00:03:57.849> up<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
with our socket and then we take up the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.809 
with our socket and then we take up the
slack<00:03:58.420> in<00:03:58.630> that<00:03:58.810> last<00:03:59.109> run<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.500> cable<00:04:00.099> by

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
slack in that last run of cable by

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.759 
slack in that last run of cable by
turning<00:04:01.269> or<00:04:01.660> undoing<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.290> bolt<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.650> an

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
turning or undoing the bolt in an

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.280 
turning or undoing the bolt in an
anti-clockwise<00:04:03.180> direction

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.350 

you<00:04:08.290> can<00:04:08.500> see<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.920> tensions<00:04:09.790> come<00:04:10.030> up<00:04:10.209> now<00:04:12.360> we

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
you can see that tensions come up now we

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.640 
you can see that tensions come up now we
check<00:04:13.629> with<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> gauge<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.150> flats<00:04:16.650> come

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
check with the gauge and the flats come

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.949 
check with the gauge and the flats come
together<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:20.260> that's<00:04:20.410> all<00:04:20.680> good
