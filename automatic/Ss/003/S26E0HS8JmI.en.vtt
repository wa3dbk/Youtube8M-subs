walking<00:03:47.040> poles<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.640> another<00:03:47.880> way<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.090> do<00:03:48.330> that

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
walking poles is another way to do that

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.870 
walking poles is another way to do that
we<00:03:49.290> don't<00:03:49.320> recommend<00:03:49.860> using<00:03:50.250> wrist<00:03:50.670> weights

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
we don't recommend using wrist weights

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.640 
we don't recommend using wrist weights
because<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.420> can<00:03:51.600> lead<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.930> more<00:03:52.140> injuries

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
because that can lead to more injuries

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.830 
because that can lead to more injuries
so<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.850> other<00:03:54.000> methods<00:03:54.390> are<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> little<00:03:54.600> bit

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
so the other methods are a little bit

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.320 
so the other methods are a little bit
more<00:03:54.959> effective<00:03:55.410> how<00:03:56.100> about<00:03:56.310> some<00:03:56.910> people<00:03:57.120> you

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
more effective how about some people you

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.630 
more effective how about some people you
go<00:03:57.420> walk<00:03:57.600> with<00:03:57.780> dumbbells<00:03:58.310> yeah<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.550> a

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
go walk with dumbbells yeah it's a

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.699 
go walk with dumbbells yeah it's a
little<00:03:59.850> dangerous<00:04:00.030> yeah<00:04:00.510> we<00:04:00.720> recommend<00:04:01.350> yeah

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
little dangerous yeah we recommend yeah

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.020 
little dangerous yeah we recommend yeah
we<00:04:02.010> don't<00:04:02.130> recommend<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.580> because<00:04:02.760> it

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
we don't recommend that because it

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.520 
we don't recommend that because it
throws<00:04:03.209> off<00:04:03.390> your<00:04:03.450> center<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.870> gravity<00:04:03.959> and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
throws off your center of gravity and

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.220 
throws off your center of gravity and
