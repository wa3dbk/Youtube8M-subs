00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.930
 hello for me it's a pleasure to have you from 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.970
 back today we will learn something that I am 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.279
 sure you will love it and will be the basis 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.439
 for incredible creations just 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.169
 we will need normal washable markers 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.270
 and a piece of plastic bag we can 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:31.390
 turn our template of something like 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.390
 this with a very simple technique to this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.970
 we started with the basic technique that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 is to move the marker so 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.160
 continues in the same direction which 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 will allow the tone to dry when 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.850
 see uniform 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.309
 with the previous technique I will paint the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.309
 mountains and flowers 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.270
 now let's paint a portion of the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.430
 plastic with dark blue then we paint 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.470
 on top of him with light blue and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.840
 finally we apply it on the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.870
 paper trying to get away from the stroke 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.880
 initial see how the tone is degraded is 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.340
 an incredible and very easy technique 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.830
 achieve you should only try not to rotate the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.830
 marker as this damages the effect 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.020
 For the appearance of water, 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.210
 apply the previous tone but with 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.360
 different intensities and in different 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.360
 senses 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.880
 for the meadow combine the green and black 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.370
 this to generate different tones and the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.530
 Once shadows you can mix all kinds 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.870
 of colors however the tone that is 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.760
 Apply base on the plastic should 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.880
 be the darkest of those you want 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.940
 combine for example now use the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.390
 yellow and I should leave the color as a base 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.390
 green 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.369
 and we finished the meadow with some 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.080
 yellow lines we prepare them for 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.080
 continue with our project today 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.810
 we go to the vines that have 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.760
 stems and leaves so we will use of 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.979
 base the black and various shades of 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.979
 green to create a more real effect 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.420
 try to use a dark green for the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.249
 stem and one lighter for the leaves 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.249
 these will stand out better 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.840
 Y 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.090
 we finished with our dragon friend and with 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.769
 he will mix red and yellow for the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.660
 horns while for the body 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.849
 we will use green and yellow in 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.849
 different senses and intensities 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.170
 and 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.709
 and 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.079
 Y 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.450
 and 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.159
 I hope you have fun practicing this 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.010
 technique at home achieving every time
