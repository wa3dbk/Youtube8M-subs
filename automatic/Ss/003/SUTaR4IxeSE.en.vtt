00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.710
 the polder old people's home already more than 25 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.259
 years they are in operation and serve the 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.220
 flood protection 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:26.950
 right here lives a flying jewel 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.169
 the kingfisher the symbol for untouched 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.930
 nature and not just one 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.350
 here are 13 couples 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.600
 this otherwise too rare birds to the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 rivers that have been regulated and installed 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.489
 he almost disappeared 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:51.600
 why are the polders so attractive for 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.100
 the kingfisher 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.409
 it's the old river loop and 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.930
 the old Rhine poor who put it on 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:02.559
 They not only offer food but also 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.080
 all steep banks of volumes in this 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:11.320
 he digs his brut tube up to one 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.330
 meter deep but here in the polder can do that 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.080
 water suddenly and suddenly 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.080
 increase 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:23.229
 Many animals have to save themselves or 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.229
 climb at least higher 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.420
 But what does that mean for the kingfisher? 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.240
 In the murky water he can barely 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.750
 sometimes even his breed becomes fish 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.250
 tube is flooded mostly that 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.970
 flood already after a few days 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.860
 over again when the breed is over 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.869
 flood could have been destroyed 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.869
 Kingfishers start over again 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.750
 a kingfisher couple creates up to three 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.479
 breed in the year with mostly seven boys 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.020
 Losses can be easily compensated 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.020
 become 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.440
 Here, the water unfolds its power 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.690
 it can destroy or shape 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.800
 for the kingfisher, she creates the sun 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.800
 important hatcheries 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.650
 the dynamics of the water is the reason 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.880
 for the success of the kingfisher in 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.880
 flood retention areas
