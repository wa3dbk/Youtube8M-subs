really<00:00:26.400> how<00:00:26.609> much<00:00:26.820> Aero<00:00:27.119> matters<00:00:27.599> between

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
really how much Aero matters between

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.679 
really how much Aero matters between
these<00:00:28.050> three<00:00:28.260> bikes<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:29.279> started<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> TT

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
these three bikes we started with a TT

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.959 
these three bikes we started with a TT
bike<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.619> how<00:00:31.769> air<00:00:31.949> was<00:00:32.160> by<00:00:32.309> itself<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
bike to see how air was by itself and to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.389 
bike to see how air was by itself and to
do<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.390> would<00:00:33.510> take<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.989> 20<00:00:34.860> second<00:00:35.190> sample

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
do this we would take a 20 second sample

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.299 
do this we would take a 20 second sample
at<00:00:35.820> 0<00:00:36.480> degrees<00:00:36.719> off<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.770> rotate<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
at 0 degrees off and then rotate out to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.250 
at 0 degrees off and then rotate out to
15<00:00:38.670> degrees<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.270> bring<00:00:39.480> come<00:00:39.750> back<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> zero

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
15 degrees and bring come back to zero

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.200 
15 degrees and bring come back to zero
in<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> half<00:00:40.800> degree<00:00:41.100> increments<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
in two and a half degree increments and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.790 
in two and a half degree increments and
we<00:00:42.360> rotated<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> negative<00:00:43.260> 15<00:00:43.559> degrees

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
we rotated out to negative 15 degrees

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.380 
we rotated out to negative 15 degrees
and<00:00:43.829> brought<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> back<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.520> zero<00:00:44.760> again<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and brought it back to zero again and to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.660 
and brought it back to zero again and to
not<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.230> increment<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:47.520> each

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
not to get an increment and at each

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.340 
not to get an increment and at each
angle<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.090> would<00:00:48.210> take<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.600> measurements<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
angle we would take two measurements and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
angle we would take two measurements and
we<00:00:49.680> performed<00:00:50.100> each<00:00:50.309> series<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.940> data

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
we performed each series of data

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
we performed each series of data
collection<00:00:51.300> twice<00:00:51.829> after<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.100> would

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
collection twice after that we would

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.279 
collection twice after that we would
then<00:00:53.340> throw<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> rider<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> bike<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:55.079> see

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
then throw a rider on the bike to see

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.500 
then throw a rider on the bike to see
how<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.399> rider<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.789> able<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> interact<00:00:57.390> with

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
how a rider was able to interact with

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
how a rider was able to interact with
this<00:00:57.780> frame<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:58.829> we're<00:00:58.949> able<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> see

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
this frame and so what we're able to see

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.970 
this frame and so what we're able to see
is<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> TT<00:01:00.030> bike<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.840> by<00:01:01.050> itself<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
is that the TT bike was by itself the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
is that the TT bike was by itself the
fastest<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.699> three<00:01:02.910> bikes<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.840> also

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
fastest of all three bikes and it also

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
fastest of all three bikes and it also
had<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> double<00:01:04.830> whammy<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> sense<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
had a double whammy in the sense that it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.120 
had a double whammy in the sense that it
allowed<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> rider<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.080> achieve<00:01:07.770> more<00:01:07.979> arrow

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
allowed the rider to achieve more arrow

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.640 
allowed the rider to achieve more arrow
positions<00:01:08.610> while<00:01:08.850> he<00:01:08.939> was<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> bike<00:01:09.650> next

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
positions while he was on the bike next

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.649 
positions while he was on the bike next
with<00:01:10.740> our<00:01:10.830> rode<00:01:11.070> arrow<00:01:11.520> bike<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.360> were<00:01:12.450> able<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
with our rode arrow bike we were able to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.330 
with our rode arrow bike we were able to
test<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> same<00:01:13.229> protocol<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.040> early

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
test the same protocol and see how early

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.609 
test the same protocol and see how early
it<00:01:14.430> was<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.909> again<00:01:15.420> put<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> rider<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
it was and again put a rider on it to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.109 
it was and again put a rider on it to
see<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:16.830> he<00:01:16.890> looked<00:01:17.100> before<00:01:17.130> him<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.970> was

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
see how he looked before him this was

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
see how he looked before him this was
followed<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> standard<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.200> bike<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
followed up with a standard go bike to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:29.070 
followed up with a standard go bike to
perform<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> same<00:01:20.640> protocol

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.080 

save<00:01:29.410> our<00:01:29.830> souls

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.580 

so<00:01:37.090> we're<00:01:37.270> faster<00:01:37.750> one<00:01:37.900> of<00:01:37.990> our<00:01:38.080> slogans<00:01:38.500> is

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
so we're faster one of our slogans is

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.590 
so we're faster one of our slogans is
faster<00:01:38.950> from<00:01:39.100> start<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.460> finish<00:01:39.490> with<00:01:40.330> all<00:01:40.480> the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
faster from start to finish with all the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.390 
faster from start to finish with all the
huge<00:01:40.870> gains<00:01:41.050> and<00:01:41.290> manufacturers<00:01:41.860> are<00:01:42.010> making

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
huge gains and manufacturers are making

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.580 
huge gains and manufacturers are making
in<00:01:42.660> optimizing<00:01:43.660> their<00:01:43.960> frames<00:01:44.200> and

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
in optimizing their frames and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.740 
in optimizing their frames and
components<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.400> a<00:01:45.490> bike<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:46.180> is<00:01:46.240> important<00:01:46.660> for

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
components of a bike it is important for

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.600 
components of a bike it is important for
a<00:01:46.810> rider<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.200> also<00:01:47.560> be<00:01:47.650> able<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.860> optimize

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
a rider to also be able to optimize

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.030 
a rider to also be able to optimize
their<00:01:48.850> gains<00:01:49.090> on<00:01:49.330> those<00:01:49.630> bikes<00:01:49.870> and<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.890> we

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
their gains on those bikes and so we

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.160 
their gains on those bikes and so we
encourage<00:01:51.160> here<00:01:51.610> at<00:01:51.700> faster<00:01:52.120> is<00:01:52.240> for<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.600> rider

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
encourage here at faster is for a rider

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.200
