else's but the point of this video is
going<00:00:25.789> to<00:00:25.970> be<00:00:26.119> showing<00:00:27.050> what<00:00:27.259> you<00:00:27.410> can<00:00:27.560> draw

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
going to be showing what you can draw

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.570 
going to be showing what you can draw
grow<00:00:28.420> based<00:00:29.420> on<00:00:29.570> your<00:00:29.660> environment<00:00:30.170> and<00:00:30.580> what

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
grow based on your environment and what

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.520 
grow based on your environment and what
you<00:00:31.730> can<00:00:31.910> get<00:00:32.119> out<00:00:32.330> of<00:00:32.360> you<00:00:32.930> know<00:00:33.020> basically<00:00:33.380> a

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
you can get out of you know basically a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.220 
you can get out of you know basically a
very<00:00:33.920> little<00:00:34.130> input<00:00:34.360> we<00:00:35.360> live<00:00:35.510> in<00:00:35.600> an<00:00:35.690> area<00:00:35.870> in

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
very little input we live in an area in

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.529 
very little input we live in an area in
southern<00:00:36.590> Arizona<00:00:36.950> where<00:00:37.210> rain<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:38.239> our

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
southern Arizona where rain is our

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.930 
southern Arizona where rain is our
primary<00:00:39.020> source<00:00:39.200> of<00:00:39.379> water<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:39.710> we<00:00:40.129> get<00:00:40.309> 12<00:00:40.700> to

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
primary source of water and we get 12 to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.660 
primary source of water and we get 12 to
13<00:00:41.390> inches<00:00:42.320> maybe<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.920> little<00:00:43.100> more<00:00:43.280> maybe<00:00:43.520> a

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
13 inches maybe a little more maybe a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.000 
13 inches maybe a little more maybe a
little<00:00:43.820> less<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.210> year<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.469> we're<00:00:45.680> able<00:00:45.920> to

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
little less a year and we're able to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.160 
little less a year and we're able to
grow<00:00:46.190> this<00:00:46.489> fruit<00:00:46.850> tree<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.750> one<00:00:47.960> over

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
grow this fruit tree and that one over

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.479 
grow this fruit tree and that one over
there<00:00:48.289> this<00:00:49.219> apple<00:00:49.699> and<00:00:49.940> two<00:00:50.539> palm<00:00:50.840> trees

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
there this apple and two palm trees

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.479 
there this apple and two palm trees
primarily<00:00:52.489> off<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:52.940> grey<00:00:53.480> water<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.489> rain

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
primarily off of grey water and rain

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.930 
primarily off of grey water and rain
water<00:00:55.719> so<00:00:57.039> what<00:00:58.039> it<00:00:58.160> gets<00:00:58.280> through<00:00:58.579> mostly

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
water so what it gets through mostly

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.580 
water so what it gets through mostly
here<00:00:59.120> is<00:00:59.210> just<00:00:59.420> gray<00:00:59.629> water<00:00:59.870> it's<00:01:00.079> a<00:01:00.170> wasted

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
here is just gray water it's a wasted

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.250 
here is just gray water it's a wasted

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
source that most people you know it just

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.840 
source that most people you know it just
goes<00:01:03.559> into<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.859> ground<00:01:04.010> or<00:01:04.280> somewhere<00:01:04.820> else

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
goes into the ground or somewhere else

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.450 
goes into the ground or somewhere else
well<00:01:05.600> at<00:01:06.050> least<00:01:06.290> for<00:01:06.470> us<00:01:06.620> before<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.130> goes<00:01:07.250> into

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
well at least for us before it goes into

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.820 
well at least for us before it goes into
the<00:01:07.580> ground<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:08.869> goes<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.259> the<00:01:09.350> fruit<00:01:09.560> trees

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
the ground it goes to the fruit trees

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.359 
the ground it goes to the fruit trees
and<00:01:10.070> some<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.790> our<00:01:10.909> landscape<00:01:11.240> plants<00:01:12.369> super

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
closer view of these these trees because

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.719 
closer view of these these trees because
these<00:01:38.810> are<00:01:39.020> these<00:01:39.590> are<00:01:39.649> grown<00:01:40.070> just<00:01:40.340> off<00:01:40.549> of

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
these are these are grown just off of

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.569 
these are these are grown just off of
gray<00:01:40.909> water<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:42.079> rain<00:01:42.560> water<00:01:42.590> obviously<00:01:43.490> if

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
gray water and a rain water obviously if

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.300 
gray water and a rain water obviously if
you've<00:01:43.729> seen<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.930> fruit<00:01:45.380> tree<00:01:45.680> Swale

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
you've seen the the fruit tree Swale

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.100 
you've seen the the fruit tree Swale
that<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:46.700> built<00:01:47.000> above<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.450> garden<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:47.840> collect

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
that I built above the garden to collect

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.620 
that I built above the garden to collect
a<00:01:48.200> little<00:01:48.320> extra<00:01:49.219> rain<00:01:49.430> water<00:01:49.670> these<00:01:50.270> do<00:01:50.450> get

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
a little extra rain water these do get

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.709 
a little extra rain water these do get
water<00:01:50.840> from<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.680> extra<00:01:52.040> rain<00:01:52.219> water<00:01:52.460> too<00:01:52.790> but

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
water from that extra rain water too but

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.690 
water from that extra rain water too but
other<00:01:54.350> than<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.619> it's<00:01:55.009> it's<00:01:55.369> pretty<00:01:55.610> much

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
other than that it's it's pretty much

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.190 
other than that it's it's pretty much
all<00:01:55.880> grey<00:01:56.119> water<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.570> I<00:01:56.600> think<00:01:56.659> it's<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.020> good

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
all grey water and I think it's a good

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.679 
all grey water and I think it's a good
example<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.890> especially<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:59.030> folks<00:01:59.299> in<00:01:59.479> dry

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
example of especially you folks in dry

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.709 
example of especially you folks in dry
environments<00:02:00.290> what<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.920> can<00:02:01.130> do<00:02:01.689> with<00:02:02.689> a

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
environments what you can do with a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.499 
environments what you can do with a
little<00:02:03.049> extra<00:02:03.289> wasted<00:02:03.950> water<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:05.210> if<00:02:05.360> you're

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
little extra wasted water and if you're

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.480 
little extra wasted water and if you're
