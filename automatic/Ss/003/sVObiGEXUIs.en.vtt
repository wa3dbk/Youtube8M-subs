00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:14.260
 hello friends we have a comment on 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.869
 the channel has touched me so much i thought i should 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.590
 talk on this topic a man says 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.949
 here is michael how are you there beautiful there 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.100
 sky is blue 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.970
 green ears here we all like it 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.029
 faded 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:36.069
 and there fields are faded and villages 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:39.879
 crooked and in general all this I want 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:44.109
 say that's what i'm when young younger 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.809
 was loved by service ochkom in the company 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.749
 good mean there stomp we all all 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.670
 Moscow region proceeded I even studied in 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:56.100
 school city ​​instructors city 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.379
 hiking and so on and here 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.139
 competitions participated in sports 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:08.259
 orientation night there we ran 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:11.289
 nights and why we tell that here in 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:14.560
 this here is faded as they say nature 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.070
 has its charm yes that's how u 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.420
 Pushkin's sad time to charm 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.509
 these energy man is associated with 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.450
 place of birth 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.610
 energetically you cannot change it 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:37.200
 give us and our design such 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.200
 that we are associated with the place of birth therefore 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.200
 I honestly don't even know for example 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.690
 a place like where I would like more there 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.780
 spend a vacation or take a walk there and so 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.900
 further than for example the suburbs 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.530
 if it were not for this I'm sorry people 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.690
 who live there and who like that 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.180
 I do not want that to come and and 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.380
 I do not want to be there and deal 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.479
 with this whole system which is 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.330
 is a product of this society 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.390
 but however in terms of the bushes there 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.610
 rivers and so on I would rather not another 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.480
 dreamed never honest that is here for 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.900
 me the middle lane is just like 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.269
 the ultimate measure is to carry pleasure in 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.100
 being there doesn't mean I'm not 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.970
 I can have fun there let's say 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.239
 from such a landscape like there south bank 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.080
 Crimea or there Mexico or Canada or there 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.790
 Alaska for goodness sake I am happy 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.519
 traveling and enjoying what I see 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:50.400
 but again by design by birth by 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.920
 power place well what are you 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.159
 i would i so i days i wouldn't even 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.599
 faded call it not faded but 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.610
 in its own way it is our muscles 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.890
 the mouse was born there we raised there 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.709
 I grew up I have never been and 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.069
 Bertom in the Kalmyk steppes I do not know how 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:12.359
 I would take but for example I was in 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:17.299
 the wilderness of arizona and and in it hellish 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:22.140
 and I have an incredible vibration there 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.970
 such places I will just be there 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.079
 born and before we grew up something like that 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.950
 so very mine 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.129
 and I want to go there on a horse there and 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.280
 to jump 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.530
 but but it's so speculative I never 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.480
 did not live there so far and on horseback not 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.170
 galloping and there such as here it is 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.599
 some kind 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.810
 just about any vibration that is, as a click 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.319
 we say 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.530
 thats but 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.909
 what I want to say is simple 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.760
 momentary honest here if there is such 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:58.099
 feeling that there are palms and azure 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.749
 coast and here let's say the snow is 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.840
 snow is so cool at all i'm not i'm not 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:05.609
 I know when I lived in Moscow 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.319
 you understand that this is a big city and that 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:13.530
 for example, even winter, it is not very comfortable 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.069
 for life because winter is when it melts 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.549
 snow 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:21.299
 Especially when you flush it 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.400
 you are still in the subway I went meters wet inside 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.250
 when you go to the metro station there 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.210
 is a liquid mash and so on, that is 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.410
 as if in a big city, winter is uncomfortable but 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:38.690
 for example, I remember that we are recent years 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.250
 drove often means there is not in the south on 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.380
 Southeast of Moscow there in that direction 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.479
 for trinity there was such a village 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.070
 village as it is called Mikhailovskaya 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:57.300
 the place was called and there was to think that 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.159
 forests torito base features in general since 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.139
 I worked vocational education system 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.810
 there was some kind of institution 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.940
 vocational education systems and there in winter 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.270
 it was just possible to go 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.659
 there for a week and so we rode with 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.669
 child and there are skis and everything like that 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:19.789
 Beauty that's when we went skiing on 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:23.580
 Moscow forest coniferous and hoisted such 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:26.759
 spruce snow covered you go skiing 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.889
 and and snow so on 1 just whether 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:35.039
 breeze tone than there him and he is a friend so 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:38.729
 Crumbles and again and I have not been since 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.740
 this forest I was not well of course here 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.650
 mountains is yes there is also a Christmas tree too 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.380
 snow is very similar terrain but mountain 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.530
 so here we are practically not in this 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.460
 a couple of times i'm i want to say i'm at 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.169
 The beauty of life is not seen more than ever 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.270
 it's not because other places are not like that 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.510
 beautiful but because this is ours 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.210
 vibrations then our frequencies this is on this 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:09.870
 place is our place of birth and this is ours 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:13.110
 a bond that looks like no way to go and 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.330
 in fact, and our children who are there 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.310
 they were also born from this can not 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.560
 can leave before even if they are in Russian 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.450
 it does not say bypassing anyway it's yours 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.270
 this one is sitting there with you and so on 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.110
 so 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.350
 I would kind of advise more carefully what 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:34.250
 whether 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:36.680
 treat here and no matter how you deny yourself 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.560
 myself inside myself now i would i 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.810
 so said it must be so so carefully 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.850
 relate here not only in nature 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.890
 who are there around us but but to yourself 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.560
 because this part of us is nature 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.120
 it's a part of us and we are like us because 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.280
 that we were born and there was this one 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.440
 nature and even if we don't like it 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.360
 it doesn't matter to us even as a mother with 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.130
 dad you may have some kind of conflict 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.290
 with their parents but still you would like 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.449
 products carry them together 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:06.689
 activity therefore 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:10.469
 I can because I know how far 

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:12.180
 i just see snow let me not 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:14.219
 worries that when the snow melts there 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.889
 will be there dogs walked all winter and 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:21.569
 now she's upstairs so i'm i 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:24.680
 Of course I remember that beautiful snow 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:27.449
 fluffy and there are fir paws and so on 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.960
 maybe I have more such roses 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:32.129
 memories anyway so well 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.699
 such considerations 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:34.699
 is happy
