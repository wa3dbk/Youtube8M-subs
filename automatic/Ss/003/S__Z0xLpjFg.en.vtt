00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.819
 I'll explain in this video what 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.940
 consists of the surgical operation for 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.190
 treat a tendinopathy to a break of the 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.030
 tendon of supraspinatus or cuff 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.030
 shoulder rotator 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.980
 but explain with this anatomical model 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.220
 here we have the clavicle 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.230
 this would be the scapula the shoulder 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.509
 vulgarly called shoulder blade scapula 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.029
 also and we have here the humerus and the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.700
 mobility of the humerus when we move the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.460
 arm agree this this set 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.980
 anatomical is moved by a series of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 muscles and tendons the most important the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.850
 rotator cuff and these of esteban and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 tornador there is a part called 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.100
 supraspinatus which is peeking out 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.510
 this cultural as you see there the finger is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.850
 the one that goes to the lateral part of the humerus 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.220
 and when that tendon pulls the number 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 it ascends upwards a lot from this 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.270
 tendon can be broken by different 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.790
 motives can not be broken and 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.470
 cracking like an old cloth 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.860
 a rope left out broke little to 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.460
 little what the operation is about is 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.790
 sew the one to make a sewn to the bone and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.020
 Sometimes it has very positive results 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.659
 even before it usually combines with the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.070
 filing of this area of the chrom and me that is 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.110
 an area of him 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.840
 of the scapula the crom jones the magnet 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.880
 trim so that when the number turn 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.340
 from above the clash between the insertion 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.520
 where it is inserted into the tendon bone 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.580
 of its painful and the own acromion that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.530
 bead bear is made whether or not there is 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.360
 or as delayed as possible 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.759
 agreement because many times it 's done that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.710
 responsible for the tendon being 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.259
 go cattle working that constant friction 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 of the tendon with the acromion makes the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.790
 tendon goes down and go losing 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.170
 life and go smashing everything 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.649
 the whole operation is from the consell the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.289
 tendon if necessary and to file is 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.229
 acromion so that there is more space for 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.509
 the passage of the tendon and that would be the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.890
 operation and sometimes it's a pressure like 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.060
 I believe that every day with better 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.289
 results 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.750
 santi with other copies so the 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.509
 recovery starts a few days 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 after the operation I think I should 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.480
 do this operation as long as 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.150
 treatment has been tried 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.739
 conservative and we have talked that what 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.650
 will try is that this mobility of 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.209
 shoulder is correct that is rise of the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.670
 every humerus that makes it collide 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.020
 the crom jon is not there 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.810
 for that what the revelations deal with 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.700
 of compensating the shoulder muscles that 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.760
 work in an optimal way so that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.480
 there is that friction and massage that what 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.900
 try to revitalize to generate 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.180
 blood supply that tendon so that it 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.530
 Take resistance and give your 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.300
 message that is called massage through or 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.910
 deep of filias there are others 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.010
 treatments with a shock that 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.080
 what they are trying to do is to irrigate the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.690
 tendon and I also complement you this 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.489
 information telling you that many times 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.410
 the most in use of this mobility of the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.060
 shoulder comes through that decompensation of 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.440
 the micros of the shoulder as I said and 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.980
 is unbalanced muscular comes 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.750
 often due to cervical problems 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.940
 cervical blocks that cause that 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.130
 muscle work badly and in turn these 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.130
 Cervical blockages very often 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.350
 come by stress are a medicine 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.239
 Eastern when stress is channeled to 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.220
 through the liver the problem is going to give 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.230
 problems will be somatized through 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.239
 right cervical and when 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.040
 somatizes through the stomach will give 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.650
 problems at the level of the cervical area 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.580
 Left therefore treating the 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.040
 liver or the state 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.190
 with medicinal plants with a correct 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.290
 feeding with visceral osteopathy or 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.670
 with two vertebral blocks what 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.490
 let's get it is that mobility 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.880
 of the shoulder is corrected and if we get to 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.350
 time we can avoid the operation in 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.240
 any case all this information 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.320
 about this type of shoulder pathology 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.810
 natural treatments exercises 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.950
 statewide food is all this 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.710
 information as I tell you you have it here 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.710
 in this your online physiotherapy portal
