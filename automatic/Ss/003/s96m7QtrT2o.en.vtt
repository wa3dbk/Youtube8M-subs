00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.160
 greeting and hammering for all ripples 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.160
 in hummer in a review of the skins and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.830
 modes for minecraft 17 2 is a new 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.080
 abandoned mode version advanced in 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.360
 ships of which he did a review already 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.359
 many months and how has this new 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.850
 version I decided to make this video already 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.279
 that differs a lot from the previous one and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.340
 The craft and so on are completely 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.010
 different in this case does not work with 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.390
 solar light like the previous one but 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.090
 works with coal 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.250
 sting chips are steam ships and like 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.350
 You see, I have here the craft of the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230
 different pieces that we need 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.809
 On the one hand we need two engines that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.469
 are these here are made with ingots 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.239
 of iron and a piston in the center is a 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.789
 skull very basic but good for whom 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.510
 do not know how the piston is made here 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.579
 I have the wood board fret up 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.739
 rock here on the sides and also to the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.480
 sides down an iron ingot here 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.570
 in the center and a rest 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.900
 Well, we need two engines with 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.980
 the ingots and the piston and once that 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.440
 we have two engines 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.820
 we will also need the globe 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.030
 balloon as you see is very easy to do 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.250
 with leather and with two strings on 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.960
 old version there were colorful balloons 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.900
 but in this no but good is not 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.120
 that makes a big difference and then 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.100
 the main kraft is this one that I saw 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.930
 here very important that you do not 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.470
 confuse since what is needed here 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.450
 down is a wooden boat 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.090
 the ropes would be put in the four 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 corners the two engines on the sides 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.750
 an oven in the center to receive the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.880
 obviously coal and the balloon up but 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.270
 Well, when we have all that, we're going to 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.030
 to be able to put the dirigible balloon here with 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.700
 coal here you have another you can 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.980
 load so much coal or charcoal if 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.010
 press shift and right click it 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.540
 we put the coal as you can see what 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.030
 important is to always have charcoal 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.860
 above because if we do not have coal it's not going 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.860
 to fly another of the things that have 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.200
 changed are the controls as he said 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.660
 on the page you had to use the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.030
 space to fly up and the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.010
 left control I think it was for 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.040
 descend but I have seen that the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.650
 Controls are different ws is used 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.990
 of to direct the directions I'm going to 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.690
 put better here in this vision 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.460
 here you see how I'm always looking 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.590
 note that the front part of the 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.620
 that has the lever and then for 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.250
 turn on and defend we will use the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.960
 the number 8 and 2 are never used 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.490
 it will work exactly like a 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.920
 dirigible balloon so if we give to 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.360
 turn on will ascend all the time 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.700
 while we did not give demos what 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.430
 opposite to descend we have to 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.280
 press the are keyboards 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.159
 As you can see, it descends maximum if we give it 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.969
 to 8 again ascend to keep them 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:08.700
 in the position we press the classic art 5 and 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:11.430
 it keeps us at the same height as 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.889
 you see are 8 on 5 and 2 here by 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.550
 example in the water you will see that it is not 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.100
 sinks 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.650
 but we can go here for the water with 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.980
 the balloon and then ascend with the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.780
 key 8 ascend when we want and as 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.390
 I already said the 5 key to keep the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.310
 position plus the 5 key also serves 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.950
 to attack always attack the address 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.800
 in a straight line if we go for example 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.170
 looking towards here I pressed the 5 key 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.080
 As you can see, it is to throw the arrows 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.130
 you see is attacking there where I'm going 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.599
 pointing is throwing the arrows good 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.120
 with the shift we would not go down from the 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.250
 aircraft as if it were a horse yes 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.540
 be careful that if you are in the mode 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.100
 creative, obviously, you are silent and 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.520
 this as you see it would go down a little bit to 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.010
 little until you finish touching the ground 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.640
 well then the other one that you can create the 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.190
 another object is this one here steamboat is 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.430
 a steam boat is made just like the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.190
 normal boat with uve tables and 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.290
 an iron ingot in the center there 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.040
 confusion is that there are people who 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.750
 believe that the crafter of this here 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.870
 you need the steam boat and it's not a 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.540
 normal boat very important that too 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.520
 as I said also the controls 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.190
 that are different and we are going to see this 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.530
 boat is a little book because if it 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.620
 we put on the floor we can move 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.600
 to descend but can not climb towards 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.390
 above 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.740
 well it's just a motorboat 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.190
 here you are going to see her 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.750
 the truth that I was curious we can go 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.400
 with her and obviously we move a lot 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:00.069
 faster than with a normal boat you see 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.509
 how we run it much faster and 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:06.910
 also if we have a bow we can attack 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:10.849
 also but for example let's take out 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.279
 here they will give us that chicken 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:17.060
 with circle we hit that arresting look 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:19.430
 we have killed and now you have seen 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.770
 as I say this is an aggregate is a boat 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:26.330
 of steam that 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.610
 extra plus the airship that also 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.169
 it works with steam and before I get 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.710
 forget as you can see by pressing the key 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:37.220
 r we can see open the inventory of the 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.199
 dirigible balloon ship here we can 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.050
 charge the fuel that as I said 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.270
 is coal or charcoal accesses as 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.430
 goes the consumption here we can load the 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.190
 arrows and here we can have for 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.349
 inventory we have for 12 holes in case 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.569
 we want to save objects you see that 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:55.940
 we can save what we want now 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.409
 we go with the installation as always 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.840
 let's do the installation from scratch 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.180
 the first thing would be to go here to percentage 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.190
 app data percentage we 're going to the 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.840
 minecraft folder and I'm going to change it 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.930
 the name to do an installation 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.479
 clean the following we have to execute 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.150
 the minecraft launcher you already know 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.789
 be normal minecraft the premium or the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.620
 dark lvp the installation is going to be done in 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.090
 the same route and now we have to 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.550
 select here the version that we are going to 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.380
 install in this case I'm going to choose 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.660
 release 17 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.660
 We give you to save and we give you to install 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:35.340
 once fully seated it runs 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:37.770
 the game and we have to close it 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.290
 now let's install force me as 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.680
 I have now 172 I will install the last 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:46.380
 recommended version of forced 172 which is 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.510
 the 1024 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.639
 we give you right click to open with java 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.280
 platform 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:55.499
 this is the installation route either the 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.129
 customer prize or giving that the pp well 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:07:00.709
 that I give to accept 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:03.569
 we are again and now we are going back 

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:05.610
 to again run the game 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.089
 we have to select the profile here 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.089
 the forge 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:15.650
 and we check that it is selected in 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:18.590
 that version the release 172 force 1024 will 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.529
 we give again to the play and then what 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.289
 we close 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:25.659
 and now let's leave the sting without mode 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:28.659
 that we have it here all the links 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:31.029
 until the description we extract them as 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:33.789
 you see a hard dot file and now what 

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:34.539
 we copy we go to users name of 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:37.509
 user 

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:41.820
 afp data roaming point minecraft 

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:43.890
 We enter here by bus and we stick it 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:47.320
 here we run once again the 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:49.600
 minecraft we give to the play 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.720
 and here we see how you see those of
