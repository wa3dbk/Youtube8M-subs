give an additional strength to the unit

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.470 
give an additional strength to the unit
we<00:03:24.530> also<00:03:24.680> take<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.190> one<00:03:25.400> step<00:03:25.670> further<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.090> we

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
we also take it one step further and we

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.660 
we also take it one step further and we
