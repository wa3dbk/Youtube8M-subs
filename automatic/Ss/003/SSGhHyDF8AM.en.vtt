00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
glossy glass-like material in cinema 4d

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.240 
glossy glass-like material in cinema 4d
but<00:00:15.200> you're<00:00:15.320> gonna<00:00:15.440> be<00:00:15.530> making<00:00:15.680> us<00:00:15.950> something

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
but you're gonna be making us something

like this it's kind of you know with the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.870 
like this it's kind of you know with the
shadows<00:00:18.890> and<00:00:19.010> everything<00:00:19.070> I<00:00:19.369> have<00:00:19.490> added<00:00:19.670> that

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
shadows and everything I have added that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.609 
shadows and everything I have added that
later<00:00:20.119> but<00:00:20.420> it's<00:00:20.630> going<00:00:20.869> to<00:00:20.930> be<00:00:21.140> like<00:00:21.349> that

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.430 
later but it's going to be like that
nice<00:00:21.800> reflectivity<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:22.900> that<00:00:23.900> nice<00:00:24.110> little

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
nice reflectivity and that nice little

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.680 
nice reflectivity and that nice little
glow<00:00:24.710> so<00:00:25.340> let's<00:00:25.490> get<00:00:25.610> started<00:00:25.940> I'm<00:00:26.270> going<00:00:26.600> to

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 
glow so let's get started I'm going to

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.840 
glow so let's get started I'm going to
delete<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.170> material<00:00:27.590> and<00:00:27.800> we're<00:00:28.670> going<00:00:28.789> to

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
delete the material and we're going to

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.820 
delete the material and we're going to
start<00:00:29.119> from<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.390> scratch<00:00:29.480> so<00:00:29.960> we<00:00:30.710> have

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
start from the scratch so we have

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.010 
start from the scratch so we have
something<00:00:31.100> that's<00:00:31.310> kind<00:00:31.910> of<00:00:32.090> boring<00:00:32.629> and<00:00:32.870> you

looks fine then we're going to go down
and<00:01:04.850> select<00:01:05.119> reflection<00:01:05.869> check<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.770> mark

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
and select reflection check that mark

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.100 
and select reflection check that mark
and<00:01:07.190> for<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.149> brightness<00:01:08.570> we're<00:01:08.810> going<00:01:09.020> to

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
and for the brightness we're going to

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.699 
and for the brightness we're going to
turn<00:01:09.289> the<00:01:09.380> brightness<00:01:09.590> down<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:10.190> 20%<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.709> then

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:12.709 
turn the brightness down to 20% and then

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:14.050 
turn the brightness down to 20% and then
for<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:12.979> texture<00:01:13.369> you're<00:01:13.610> going<00:01:13.789> to<00:01:13.850> hit<00:01:13.970> this

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
for the texture you're going to hit this

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.100 
for the texture you're going to hit this
little<00:01:14.330> arrow<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:14.780> go<00:01:15.560> down<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.920> Fresno<00:01:16.399> and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
little arrow and go down to Fresno and

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.990 
little arrow and go down to Fresno and
then<00:01:18.110> turn<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.590> mixed<00:01:19.190> strength<00:01:19.429> down<00:01:19.700> also

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
then turn that mixed strength down also

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.380 
then turn that mixed strength down also
to<00:01:20.240> 20%<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.060> can<00:01:23.060> play<00:01:23.179> with<00:01:23.330> the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
to 20% and you can play with the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.449 
to 20% and you can play with the
blurriness<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:24.020> I'm<00:01:24.530> going<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:24.890> put<00:01:25.009> around<00:01:25.250> 10

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
blurriness I I'm going to put around 10

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.760 
blurriness I I'm going to put around 10
just<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.119> make<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.300> look<00:01:26.539> just<00:01:26.780> a<00:01:27.530> little<00:01:27.619> bit

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
just to make it look just a little bit

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.800 
just to make it look just a little bit
fuzzier<00:01:28.190> just<00:01:29.090> give<00:01:29.240> that<00:01:29.390> nice<00:01:29.569> little

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
fuzzier just give that nice little

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.680 
fuzzier just give that nice little
effect<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.440> then<00:01:31.250> then<00:01:31.369> up<00:01:31.520> finally<00:01:32.509> I'm

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
effect and then then up finally I'm

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.350 
effect and then then up finally I'm
going<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.080> go<00:01:33.200> down<00:01:33.349> to<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.590> glow<00:01:34.119> check<00:01:35.119> that

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
going to go down to the glow check that

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.809 
going to go down to the glow check that
and<00:01:35.660> that<00:01:36.410> is<00:01:36.590> way<00:01:36.860> too<00:01:36.920> bright<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:37.369> what<00:01:37.729> we're

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
and that is way too bright so what we're

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.370 
and that is way too bright so what we're
going<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:37.970> do<00:01:38.179> is<00:01:38.420> I'm<00:01:38.599> going<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.780> take<00:01:39.020> both<00:01:39.319> of

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
going to do is I'm going to take both of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.040 
going to do is I'm going to take both of
these<00:01:39.619> down<00:01:40.270> I'm<00:01:41.270> going<00:01:41.569> to<00:01:41.660> take<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.840> first

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
these down I'm going to take the first

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.010 
these down I'm going to take the first
one<00:01:42.200> down<00:01:42.349> to<00:01:42.530> 10<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.479> then<00:01:44.479> I'm<00:01:44.660> going<00:01:44.869> to

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
one down to 10 and then I'm going to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.190 
one down to 10 and then I'm going to
take<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.590> second<00:01:46.099> one<00:01:46.130> down<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:47.270> about<00:01:47.479> 50%

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
take the second one down to about 50%

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.370 
take the second one down to about 50%
and<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.320> gives<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:50.740> nice<00:01:50.920> little<00:01:51.159> sheen<00:01:51.580> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and that gives it a nice little sheen of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.789 
and that gives it a nice little sheen of
glossiness<00:01:53.380> at<00:01:53.619> it<00:01:54.220> as<00:01:54.400> well<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.650> just<00:01:56.650> let<00:01:56.740> me

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
glossiness at it as well so just let me

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.999 
glossiness at it as well so just let me
