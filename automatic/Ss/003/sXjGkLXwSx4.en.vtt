is a bait that I've used a lot in the

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.639 
is a bait that I've used a lot in the
last<00:01:37.420> couple<00:01:37.569> years<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.229> always<00:01:38.350> call<00:01:38.619> it

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
last couple years and I always call it

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.380 
last couple years and I always call it
kind<00:01:38.829> of<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:39.009> power<00:01:39.249> finesse<00:01:39.700> technique<00:01:40.179> and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
kind of a power finesse technique and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.209 
kind of a power finesse technique and
it's<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:40.960> little<00:01:41.170> bit<00:01:41.289> bigger<00:01:41.499> bulkier<00:01:41.979> worm

bigger fish than you would on a smaller
more<00:03:03.590> slender<00:03:03.890> worm<00:03:04.160> but<00:03:04.580> yet<00:03:04.730> it's<00:03:04.850> still<00:03:04.910> a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
more slender worm but yet it's still a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.700 
more slender worm but yet it's still a
good<00:03:05.450> finesse<00:03:05.750> presentation<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.410> still<00:03:06.560> has

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
good finesse presentation it still has

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.440 
good finesse presentation it still has

up there better than most hits one thing
I<00:03:54.320> really<00:03:54.620> don't<00:03:54.830> like<00:03:54.950> about<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.250> head<00:03:55.490> is<00:03:55.640> a

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
I really don't like about a head is a

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.670 
I really don't like about a head is a
screw<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.150> screw<00:03:56.510> in<00:03:57.020> worm<00:03:57.290> where<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.560> keeps

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
screw a screw in worm where it keeps

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.500 
screw a screw in worm where it keeps
your<00:03:57.890> worm<00:03:58.070> on<00:03:58.310> there<00:03:58.520> like<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.940> screw<00:03:59.300> on<00:03:59.330> the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
your worm on there like a screw on the

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.600 
your worm on there like a screw on the
head<00:03:59.690> I<00:03:59.870> like<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.260> worm<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.680> slides<00:04:01.040> up<00:04:01.250> on<00:04:01.460> the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
head I like a worm that slides up on the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.490 
head I like a worm that slides up on the
shank<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.060> hook<00:04:02.270> regardless<00:04:03.110> what<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.410> is

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
shank of the hook regardless what it is

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.080 
shank of the hook regardless what it is
I<00:04:03.560> want<00:04:03.710> to<00:04:03.740> slide<00:04:04.040> up<00:04:04.250> there<00:04:04.400> what<00:04:04.640> that<00:04:04.670> does

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
I want to slide up there what that does

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.540 
I want to slide up there what that does
it<00:04:05.360> creates<00:04:05.660> a<00:04:06.170> bow<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.560> your<00:04:06.710> worm<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.160> gets

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
it creates a bow in your worm and gets

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.160 
it creates a bow in your worm and gets
that<00:04:07.730> spiraling<00:04:08.330> fall<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.660> makes<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.960> shaky

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
that spiraling fall that makes a shaky

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.110 
that spiraling fall that makes a shaky
it's<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:09.590> effective<00:04:09.860> and<00:04:10.700> throwing<00:04:11.030> on<00:04:11.060> a

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
it's so effective and throwing on a

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.970 
it's so effective and throwing on a
shaky<00:04:11.360> head<00:04:11.540> on<00:04:11.660> a<00:04:11.720> spinning<00:04:12.080> rod<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.440> really

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
shaky head on a spinning rod I really

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.340 
shaky head on a spinning rod I really
like<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.220> braided<00:04:14.060> line<00:04:14.270> with<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.540> fluorocarbon

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
like a braided line with a fluorocarbon

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.590 
like a braided line with a fluorocarbon
leader<00:04:15.740> I<00:04:16.070> use<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.520> eight<00:04:16.820> pound<00:04:17.090> diameter

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
leader I use a eight pound diameter

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.440 
leader I use a eight pound diameter
tough<00:04:17.810> line<00:04:18.049> XP<00:04:18.500> with<00:04:19.040> most<00:04:19.640> often<00:04:20.120> eight

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
tough line XP with most often eight

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.450 
tough line XP with most often eight
pound<00:04:20.750> gamma<00:04:21.020> fluorocarbon<00:04:21.770> leader<00:04:21.890> and<00:04:22.190> the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
pound gamma fluorocarbon leader and the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.010 
pound gamma fluorocarbon leader and the
reason<00:04:22.820> for<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.630> end<00:04:23.750> up<00:04:23.810> with<00:04:23.930> the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
reason for that is you end up with the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.170 
reason for that is you end up with the
same<00:04:24.169> amount<00:04:24.410> of<00:04:24.470> stretch

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
same amount of stretch

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.249 
same amount of stretch
a<00:04:25.210> lot<00:04:25.360> of<00:04:25.449> times<00:04:25.600> with<00:04:25.720> flight<00:04:25.900> line<00:04:26.080> people

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
a lot of times with flight line people

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:27.689 
a lot of times with flight line people
have<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.500> problem<00:04:26.770> braking<00:04:27.100> fish<00:04:27.280> off<00:04:27.520> they

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
have a problem braking fish off they

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.279 
have a problem braking fish off they
want<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:27.940> set<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.240> hook<00:04:28.360> harder<00:04:29.020> when<00:04:29.169> they're

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
want to set the hook harder when they're

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.510 
want to set the hook harder when they're
way<00:04:29.410> out<00:04:29.440> there<00:04:29.830> too<00:04:30.070> hard<00:04:30.250> when<00:04:30.400> they're

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
way out there too hard when they're

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.249 
way out there too hard when they're
close<00:04:30.699> to<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.910> boat<00:04:31.060> brake<00:04:31.300> fish<00:04:31.509> off<00:04:31.750> here

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
close to the boat brake fish off here

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.900 
close to the boat brake fish off here
it's<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:32.650> consistent<00:04:32.889> same<00:04:33.669> amount<00:04:33.850> of

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
it's so consistent same amount of

it's so consistent same amount of

amount of stretch your hook sets are
always<00:04:38.770> consistent<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:39.580> also<00:04:40.210> your

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
always consistent and also your

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.850 
always consistent and also your
sensitivities<00:04:41.050> there<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.410> can<00:04:41.560> feel<00:04:41.740> with

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
sensitivities there you can feel with

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.860 
sensitivities there you can feel with

going<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.460> be<00:04:45.550> able<00:04:45.759> to<00:04:45.820> feel<00:04:46.030> just<00:04:46.360> as<00:04:46.509> much<00:04:46.690> if

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
going to be able to feel just as much if

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.629 
going to be able to feel just as much if
you're<00:04:47.050> fishing<00:04:47.680> really<00:04:47.949> close<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.460> boat

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
you're fishing really close to the boat

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.040 
you're fishing really close to the boat

amount of sensitivity and you're going

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.080 
amount of sensitivity and you're going
to<00:04:53.500> catch<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:53.740> lot<00:04:53.770> more<00:04:53.889> fish<00:04:54.190> not<00:04:54.699> only<00:04:54.940> for

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
to catch a lot more fish not only for

to catch a lot more fish not only for
the<00:04:55.180> reason<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:55.449> feeling<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.750> fish<00:04:55.960> you're

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
the reason to feeling the fish you're

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.659

going<00:04:56.440> to<00:04:56.530> feel<00:04:56.680> a<00:04:56.710> lot<00:04:56.949> more<00:04:57.009> what's<00:04:57.430> on<00:04:57.580> the

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
going to feel a lot more what's on the

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.700 
going to feel a lot more what's on the
bottom<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.120> end<00:04:58.240> up<00:04:58.360> feeling<00:04:58.539> rocks<00:04:59.199> trees

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
bottom you end up feeling rocks trees

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.680 
bottom you end up feeling rocks trees
whatever<00:05:00.039> it<00:05:00.310> is<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.940> know<00:05:01.150> what's<00:05:01.360> there<00:05:01.539> you

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
whatever it is you know what's there you

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.629 
whatever it is you know what's there you
get<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.840> better<00:05:02.020> feel<00:05:02.259> for<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.500> bottom<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:02.949> in

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
get a better feel for the bottom and in

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.790 
get a better feel for the bottom and in
turn<00:05:03.849> you<00:05:03.970> catch<00:05:04.120> more<00:05:04.300> fish<00:05:04.509> the<00:05:05.289> shaky<00:05:05.650> head

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
turn you catch more fish the shaky head

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.430 
turn you catch more fish the shaky head
on<00:05:05.919> a<00:05:05.949> spinning<00:05:06.550> rod<00:05:06.699> has<00:05:06.880> really<00:05:07.660> been<00:05:08.259> good

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
on a spinning rod has really been good

other baits but you're fishing a little
more<00:05:40.240> aggressively<00:05:40.720> it's<00:05:40.930> not<00:05:41.080> always<00:05:41.260> on

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
more aggressively it's not always on

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.409 
more aggressively it's not always on
points<00:05:41.919> always<00:05:42.430> dragging<00:05:42.699> on<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:42.970> bottom<00:05:43.270> a

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
lot of times it's fishing it down the

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.740 
lot of times it's fishing it down the
bank<00:05:45.130> and<00:05:45.310> cover<00:05:45.460> in<00:05:45.610> water<00:05:45.789> almost<00:05:46.389> swimmin

I'll<00:05:48.580> lift<00:05:48.760> it<00:05:48.940> up<00:05:49.060> and<00:05:49.180> it'll<00:05:49.389> just<00:05:49.510> glide

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
I'll lift it up and it'll just glide

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.149
