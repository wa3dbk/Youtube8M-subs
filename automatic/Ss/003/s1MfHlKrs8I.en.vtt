I<00:00:31.080> got<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.769> because<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.250> has<00:00:32.279> these

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
is also known I think probably most

commonly<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.710> boba<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:42.090> for<00:00:42.300> those<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
commonly as boba so for those of you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.459 
commonly as boba so for those of you
that<00:00:42.750> don't<00:00:42.809> know<00:00:42.960> boba

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469

it's these dark spheres at the bottom

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840 
it's these dark spheres at the bottom
there<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.860> they<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:46.920> made<00:00:47.100> from<00:00:47.250> tapioca

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
there and they are made from tapioca

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.670 
there and they are made from tapioca
starch<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.329> they're<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> size<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680

I<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.699> drink<00:00:54.000> with<00:00:54.149> these<00:00:54.270> large

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
I think the drink with these large

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.049 
I think the drink with these large
tapioca<00:00:55.199> balls<00:00:55.460> originated<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.640> Taiwan<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
tapioca balls originated in Taiwan I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.569 
tapioca balls originated in Taiwan I
think<00:00:57.420> sometime<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> 80s<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.980> has<00:00:59.129> taken

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
think sometime in the 80s but has taken

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.310 
think sometime in the 80s but has taken
over<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.120> world<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.629> think<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.140> find

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
over the world so I think you can find

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.590 
over the world so I think you can find
them<00:01:01.500> pretty<00:01:01.800> much<00:01:01.829> everywhere<00:01:02.600> really

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
them pretty much everywhere really

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.440 
them pretty much everywhere really
popular<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.610> these<00:01:05.820> tapioca

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
popular and you can get these tapioca

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.640 
popular and you can get these tapioca
balls<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.930> been<00:01:07.049> cooked<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
balls that have been cooked and have a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.880 
balls that have been cooked and have a
really<00:01:07.860> chewy<00:01:08.369> gelatinous<00:01:09.180> texture<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
really chewy gelatinous texture and you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
really chewy gelatinous texture and you
can<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.189> them<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> dozens<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.689> varieties

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
can have them in a dozens of varieties

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.499 
can have them in a dozens of varieties
of<00:01:13.140> drinks<00:01:14.070> though<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> original

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
of drinks though I think the original

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.230 
of drinks though I think the original
flavor<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.869> milk<00:01:16.140> tea<00:01:16.430> which<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.640> always<00:01:18.030> get
