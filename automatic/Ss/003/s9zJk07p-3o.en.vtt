 this video the update of the 1600 euro 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.849
 gaming computers april 2015 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.920
 as a processor an Intel Core i7 5820 came 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.460
 with 6 x 33 gigahertz 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.949
 he has a turbo day of 3.6 gigahertz 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.750
 140 watts tdp took a km that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.250
 indicates he has a free multiplier 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.590
 So overclock and free 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.439
 hyperthreading that there every channel 2 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.910
 swertz as a theoretical 12 kern it 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.740
 is one of the best processors for 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.540
 gamble and the gamer should be the next 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.219
 four to six years loose enough 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.040
 if you get too weak you can do it yes 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.180
 overclock as cpu cooler the big white 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.489
 oak 33 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.719
 it is a very big and strong cpu 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.969
 cooler and with him you can the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.730
 Processor then delivers files as 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.860
 mainboard the ice hogs 99 extremely much 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.399
 with the intellekt 99 chip set 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 it has usb 3 as a 380 of the four ram benches 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.230
 iis express 3.0 a 2 slot a 7.1 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.920
 sound chip and ameropa 02 ps 24 x usb2 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.040
 once external sata four times usb 3 one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.110
 LAN jack and jack 5 35 mm as well as 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.880
 trust link for the sound chip as 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.189
 memory 16 gb from crucial ddr4 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.170
 2133 and 10 15 10 quite okay it is a 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.600
 something will be possible in the channel 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.939
 operate mode and 16 gb are for the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.560
 enough for next couple of years 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:32.040
 as ssd a 256 gb cuddly mx 100 it 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.869
 is a fast ssd and 256gb you have 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.240
 the operating system all programs and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.250
 a few games as hdd one 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.659
 terabyte of toshiba it's one 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.220
 above-average fast hard disk 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.530
 and a terabyte are for most 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.390
 then suffice among you as 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.149
 graphics card which is 4gb 4nr 9 290xs 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.700
 an overclocked version of the admonished 290 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.619
 nevertheless, she needs a lot of 1990 iks 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.750
 relationships not too much current and 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.700
 It is quite quiet with it you should then 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.140
 almost all current games on 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.540
 the highest settings liquid 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.369
 can play as power supply the antec 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.799
 with 550 watts 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.720
 It has 80 plus gold which save energy 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.039
 has been doing cable management since what is doing there 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.380
 You can take the wires off you 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.960
 does not need and 550 watts are 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.570
 the pc more than enough then another dvd 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.630
 burner from samsung and as housing that 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.370
 Rector design art may the 2 it is a 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.140
 elegant housing with a lot of space 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.880
 of course also a founder for components 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.490
 decide for yourself which one you accept 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.140
 wanted to be optional pc not yourself 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.380
 can also assemble him for 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.670
 26 euro 90 let that be 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.770
 it then synonymous with the video 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.390
 if the video is about two months 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.250
 ask the description look up there 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.440
 the respective link click the so 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.280
 completely new version until then
