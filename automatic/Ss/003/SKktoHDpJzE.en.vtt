00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hello youtube is the movie alias hannah 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.290
 tivi and we are here in crossfire me 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.090
 I thought Philip you maximum one 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.710
 little crossfire comments because that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.540
 is just pretty cool on this 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.679
 new channel because crossfire I moved 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.900
 really time like I am actually 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.000
 now player and so on and did 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.859
 I also like space at the moment 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.240
 I just do not feel like it because of me 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.189
 I'm always from the school management 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.960
 broken and everything and then I can not 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.820
 record and so what did I think 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 you always say crossfire everyone 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.099
 Day always the Libyan house in a few 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.030
 points away and then you have to too 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.800
 maybe make videos about it because 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.559
 i really like to do that with people in the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.219
 moment to share my gameplays 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.420
 maybe I'll make a decoration too 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.530
 I do not even know that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.420
 look how I'll do it 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 now comes here first the comments 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.120
 which had the gameplay the same and that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.340
 actually not so bad is up 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.200
 list with the tg 21 and which today 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.879
 also will go yes I have one 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.530
 a little bit looked over on youtube whether it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.360
 here already there are comments 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.230
 crossfire and I have 10,000 for it 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.340
 results when I put in German 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.800
 14,100 results or something 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.290
 most are kakÃ¡ so there are too 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.479
 good, of course, is always clear 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.270
 most of them are possible in pairs like this 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.250
 Eight years old, eight years old 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.380
 Children, I mean , broke down here 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.990
 and then somehow shit with that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.640
 headset or the microphone that really 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.780
 is no longer reasonable we have 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.580
 thought philipp the maxxi just times 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.320
 just the hand I'm not 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.320
 the pro if this in this area 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 Year make comments and so what 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.400
 I can comment very well and something 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.270
 have good and very good head play freely 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.159
 thought philipp max eyth once something like that 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.810
 Well, well , we are here on tears 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.159
 with the sniper with the new sniper the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 for a few weeks now 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.009
 available is the tlg 21 90 the whole 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.509
 piece costs 60,000 the thing and is one 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.829
 not very cool because I have to say so 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.380
 I can only recommend the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.270
 bought a team because I just got a new one 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.369
 account also had crossfire europe 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.399
 we are here and there I am 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.060
 thought there may be times t 21 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.560
 Section 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.600
 and I really have to say that I am 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.700
 positively never surprised by the new one 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.079
 Thought I thought the awm is that 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.240
 best and the best is a few 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.349
 So this world are celebrating this fund 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.520
 Of course , no, he likes to do 20 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.480
 the awm in my opinion actually 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.849
 exceeded 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.220
 she has less recall according to the data 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.930
 I do not notice anything but it is a 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.849
 a little quiet hand so that's right 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.349
 if you shoot and you later luxury 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.060
 not as bad as the a wm 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.340
 Diarra had led back what 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.330
 already what is not here as it is 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.769
 a bit easier in my opinion 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.849
 after so at least it seems to me and 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.140
 if it seems to me that way I am 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.450
 a bit lighter think 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.799
 me and somehow now have for the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.230
 already a bit faster now 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.239
 she pulls out her magazine do you think so 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.099
 here once hewed on it 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.120
 reload and say that's it 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.340
 actually pretty cool 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.870
 unfortunately only five shot in the magazine but 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.819
 well it's a gp weapon if you can 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.799
 Of course , what better wants must be here 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.400
 pay money that's clear that is 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.959
 always such a crossfire 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.440
 free-to-play title, you know that yourself 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.700
 You can not communicate without money 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.290
 Survive correctly while I think 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.730
 that the gp weapons are completely sufficient 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.530
 But some people really mean 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.670
 pretty much everything was with me earlier 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.870
 Also, I really have a lot of money 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.209
 spent for the shit but 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.769
 no longer is second 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.940
 order now and then but I have the 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.530
 character can for example even 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.569
 nothing spent because that's easy 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.069
 it's time to make it happen 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.510
 is also still moderate at the time 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.250
 a little bit more because of my whole 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.989
 buddies with gambling the whole clan here 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.430
 is always at the start my whole it comes 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.150
 it clear a clear yes if 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.680
 clear to them is, of course, can you 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.950
 a nice unlimited means the thing 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.480
 I can put in the description and 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.370
 also the music rather the the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.130
 description set because that listens here 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.750
 yes I wanted to say because this is the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.200
 are danger kids white ribbon and the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.650
 really make a few months 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.540
 music on youtube and are as good as 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.139
 have four songs and they are all so 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.090
 the hammer 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.739
 which one can use so well for 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.299
 any elz or montes or what 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.799
 I know 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.970
 and you can use it freely here 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.769
 youtube if you bought it 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.790
 naturally and simply link the band 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.079
 and then everything is fine if you 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.349
 also look at everyone 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.340
 so the ag 21 years if we 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.620
 want to come to you again this 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.030
 simply cool I can really recommend 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.030
 it makes fun with her to move closer together 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.889
 and everything so beautiful and everything and there 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.699
 Everything is great that was already from 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:13.319
 Gameplay Crossfire Rivers is already out 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:16.229
 unfortunately the match I'm in the middle of it 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.489
 controlled and therefore it is not so 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.320
 long but it does not matter I have 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.500
 that tells what I wanted that was there 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.500
 native of hyper and I tell new items
