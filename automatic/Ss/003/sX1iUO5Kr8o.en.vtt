00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.279
 So today we look at two topics 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.900
 to 1 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.759
 what for the usa two drivers and that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.170
 different and cylinder and how to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.690
 which recognizes that there were four 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.930
 different and currently the topic times 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.600
 still a small addition and that the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.310
 position of the rear wheel current topic 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.310
 would like to add 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.880
 Hello dear football friends and Jurassic 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.240
 first of all the different ones 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.900
 cylinder of r2 and k 50. So today 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:00.640
 something for the skiers, so to speak 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.960
 sr2 has your ban or 50 and that gives 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.100
 there are different versions for that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.300
 so to speak, there are differences 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:15.250
 on the one hand, the first version for the sa2 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.260
 who then has 15 ps then there's the the 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.430
 second version then installed 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.909
 he has 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.789
 18 ps and then there is the version 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.490
 So the k 50 lakes in principle 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:34.670
 similar to have 21 ps and 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.610
 22 ps and they come recognize me 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.590
 have shown here to oil the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.289
 intake So we see here that this 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.369
 occasion on the cylinder at the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.110
 different sa2 ak 50 listen to each other 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.789
 distinguish 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.780
 and they are shown here with 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.459
 so measured this first version with 125th 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.569
 So ps had this form so this 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:03.560
 elongated shape with 20 mm wide and 75 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.259
 millimeters in height 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.399
 I have that in real life as well that's it 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.229
 yes, this cylinder 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.730
 there you can see the inlet so this 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:17.480
 round shape and so what a 15 ps to 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.829
 alleviate so this second version which they 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.910
 it's about that way down here 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.620
 to see such a jag 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.200
 otherwise it is a bit wider 23 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.510
 mm and 7 mm high that they in 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.400
 about here 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:40.310
 this is a cylinder that has this shape 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:43.910
 or clipping with this striking nose 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.420
 So that's a 180 ps cylinder 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.069
 the second version of the sr 2 installed 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.109
 has been 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.829
 and in this country also used at the bak 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.019
 50 It looks like we have the inlet 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.720
 in this form have that means on the 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.650
 opposite side 10 mm on the right side 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.910
 12 millimeters and those ready 22 5 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.420
 So that's a 50 inches with 21 ps 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.400
 Unfortunately, I do not have it there because of it 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.260
 this race is then still one 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.579
 bit more powerful yes and then 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.720
 there is still the last version as 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.579
 second version for the 50's looks like that 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.769
 from being here, so to speak, in the 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.569
 difference to the first version then the 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.030
 are 19 larger inlet and below 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:34.700
 just installed so hurdles 12 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.609
 millimeter and he has said as at 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.620
 comand aps and there when the 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.349
 for example , the better two bread 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.709
 with the right carburetor then he goes 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.719
 Of course, very good 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.400
 yes, who else maybe even raw 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.700
 second was about it as I was very much 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.310
 interested in the last version of 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.439
 can contact me so that you 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.000
 interesting things yes as I said 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.250
 of course you could over it now 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.590
 think okay now you have this 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.959
 cylinder and you almost the inlet now 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.099
 accordingly to the one on the 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.449
 size waits and then has 23 ps the 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.280
 Of course, this is not the case 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.980
 Of course it is not enough for the cars 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.019
 also have to adapt in the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.410
 channels or mouse there are something 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.660
 otherwise So just to detect detection 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.340
 one can get involved with these different ones 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.849
 then recognize or recognize very easily 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.750
 which cylinder client insures well 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.800
 yes as I said in the synonymous not exactly 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.840
 often represented if you go there again 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.599
 a good war is that too 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.610
 actually a good thing 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.419
 and as I said last in the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.880
 execution 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:49.270
 I would be very interested in that 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.270
 next topic 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.710
 second theme there should be times around 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.900
 Rear wheel of s 1 50 go and that 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.440
 Thank you for the contribution of 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.630
 our youtube are elena and that 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.430
 Dana was described as having this 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.540
 rear wheel if that's too far forward 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.040
 is that then with the help of something 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.700
 longer chain the whole then after 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.190
 So back gets that those who said 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.650
 then further back and then that would 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.140
 So hinterrad be somewhat centered 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.760
 Of course this is only optically good solution 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.700
 you have to be careful that you 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.630
 Certain things are also observed 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.260
 There are also a few others 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.450
 stuff 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.210
 So if you back this after 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.820
 front l was rubbish back then pushes 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.260
 he will continue with the nemo after 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.660
 moved back and then would, so to speak 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.280
 because the chain would be longer 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.920
 then these children also a little further 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.930
 go down because of this takeaway 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.400
 pressed the chain up in the 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.040
 Conversely, if I continue the wheel 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.630
 would move forward then would 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.750
 this larger taker lead to it 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.900
 that the chain comes up a bit and 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.910
 then in a higher position 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.970
 why is that as important as this one? 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.620
 wheel moves back then comes the 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.650
 chain down a bit 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.600
 if then this mz shock absorber 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.640
 has built that chain then 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.380
 for example, on the swingarm 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.460
 so it fits on the 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.380
 swing grinder, that's a bit 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.230
 longer runs because you have to, of course 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.300
 so watch this wheel then 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.340
 centered so get in such a 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.290
 position wants to bring that chain 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.050
 also accordingly does not remain that 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.430
 you have to pay attention to kidnappers enduro 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.930
 he might then drive one 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.530
 shorter translation ahead for the 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.120
 terrain that so much that this chain 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.070
 third will express a smaller the 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.750
 chain also commented down again 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.520
 is this swim coach 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.980
 pose problems and the chain 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.310
 that's why it drags for enduro riders 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.450
 small tip then this has try 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.980
 as far forward as possible 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.790
 get that chain up 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.050
 and just look that you maybe 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:05.390
 So a bigger puzzle goes 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.730
 bigger is always a little puzzle 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.880
 All you have to do is chain eight 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:13.450
 do not give that then as I said 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.910
 easily that as an important reference for 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.320
 so this action as I said what in 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.300
 bring a middle position 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.310
 visually very nice but as I said with 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.919
 Watch the chain a little bit that he does 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.390
 who writes and for the hofer has the 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.520
 then maybe a pulley 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.050
 or also which constructions 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.390
 then want to do without it as I said 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.270
 Pay attention that the offender with grind 

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:37.630
 the from as far forward as possible 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:40.840
 good as a small note 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:42.950
 if he asks again or hints 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.590
 any topic requests then how 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:48.910
 said to use the comment feature and 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.910
 otherwise nice day
