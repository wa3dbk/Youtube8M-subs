00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.280
 so welcome to the adh 2014 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.929
 I therefore have the opportunity with that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.610
 few minutes what you have time here 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.910
 now to present the novelties that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.039
 so here we put on the adh first on the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.140
 our injectors different in actors 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.420
 which we have here present ourselves 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.330
 so the closures section whether it is then 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.920
 with GPS at the control or not here 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.019
 we presented our gases not earth 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.000
 and called so logical 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.340
 and behind this you can also with a 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.680
 sense that other possibility again 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.329
 on the same models but with 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.149
 the lifting of the elements 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.760
 so that we can then see one here 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.289
 So here also GPS driven with 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.600
 flow meter and so here the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.100
 elements therefore also get rid of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.500
 the ground so that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 GPS controlled as another 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.969
 so present something new during 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.090
 adha is writing and so have it 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.699
 in four meters 5 meters and 6 meters and 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.470
 run from 60 so quite high speed 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.270
 capacity 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.189
 the machine does have a certain weight 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.630
 so that's why we are required to 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.549
 to go to the larger tanks 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.960
 only for weight distribution 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.670
 so they really write that we call the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.799
 eaten stars that scan in south new 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.210
 have presented octavia 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.009
 so on this machine on the multi action 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.420
 just as well have the closures section 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.850
 mounted on that therefore can not with 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 those pink off grabs so the novelties 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.390
 she thing with the second system 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.740
 so also during work 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.600
 to close sections 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.600
 so that is above the crowd action 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.180
 also always in the section 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.260
 closures therefore have the assembly here 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.760
 on the ball and I oops 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.350
 so here we go to work with is fine 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.150
 for the see here 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.910
 so press hose is fine so be able to close 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.730
 also exists in so an idea sexy 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.370
 closure or all that headland so the 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.900
 complete machine can play 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.880
 So right file on the hose is fine so 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.450
 we are now here change on this barre 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.570
 winters 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.700
 here it is about a new machine 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.160
 present new ones in different 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.360
 versions so our scarif lex 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.830
 so here they have model differences 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.280
 over these 6 groups we otherwise 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.750
 5 and rows of two ships and revol 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.040
 especially the combination with a 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.800
 sowing machine 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.280
 a date has spent the last two years is 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.530
 proven 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.030
 demos also appeared in the Netherlands 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.260
 have happened in the son he proved 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.060
 this machine very well 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.200
 arrives to sow so in so 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.680
 do n't expect anything from this machine either 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.260
 leaving in this fall and overall 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.020
 because many are sown to me after years 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.580
 so this is an arm machine build to 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.830
 expect outdoor cooking in this 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.120
 year still so he is is caliph series with 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.770
 cremation samsung 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.270
 we look forward to seeing you at full potential 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.080
 here at our booth 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.550
 for example, so these count 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.750
 details in detail again 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.310
 can present 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.310
 so thanks and we hope to see you 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.190
 i lived see more videos make sure to
