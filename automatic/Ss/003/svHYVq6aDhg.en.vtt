shank of the hook and then wrap our

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.450 
shank of the hook and then wrap our

thread back toward the bend of the hook

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.090 
thread back toward the bend of the hook
securing<00:01:31.180> all<00:01:31.330> that<00:01:31.600> material<00:01:32.049> down<00:01:32.229> also

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
securing all that material down also

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.120 
securing all that material down also
keep<00:01:33.310> in<00:01:33.430> mind<00:01:33.460> that<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.390> EP<00:01:34.840> fibers<00:01:35.320> come<00:01:35.920> in

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
keep in mind that the EP fibers come in

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.580 
keep in mind that the EP fibers come in
many<00:01:36.729> different<00:01:36.850> colors<00:01:37.590> simply

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
many different colors simply

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.919 
many different colors simply
substituting<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.909> color<00:01:40.149> with<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.720> color

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
substituting the color with the color

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.540 
substituting the color with the color
that<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.289> desire<00:01:41.619> will<00:01:41.979> change<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.399> entire

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
that you desire will change the entire

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.779 
that you desire will change the entire
fly<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.380> our<00:01:44.530> next<00:01:44.710> step<00:01:45.009> for<00:01:45.280> our<00:01:45.310> fly<00:01:45.580> is

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
fly and so our next step for our fly is

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.719 
fly and so our next step for our fly is
to<00:01:45.970> pull<00:01:46.179> back<00:01:46.390> on<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:47.140> EP<00:01:47.470> fibers<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.100> simply

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
to pull back on the EP fibers and simply

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.300 
to pull back on the EP fibers and simply
trim<00:01:49.060> away<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.630> upper<00:01:50.110> portion<00:01:50.709> creating<00:01:51.280> a

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
trim away the upper portion creating a

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.840 
trim away the upper portion creating a
nice<00:01:51.729> taper<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.619> body<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.159> fly<00:01:54.520> back

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
nice taper to the body of the fly back

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.270 
nice taper to the body of the fly back
down<00:01:55.149> to<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.479> tail<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:55.950> once<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.159> is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
down to the tail and once that is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.930 
down to the tail and once that is
complete<00:01:57.670> invert<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.509> hook

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.780 

and<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:02.200> with<00:02:02.410> your<00:02:02.590> hook<00:02:02.770> inverted<00:02:03.310> we're

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
and now with your hook inverted we're

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.730 
and now with your hook inverted we're
gonna<00:02:03.880> repeat<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.330> same<00:02:04.720> process<00:02:04.780> by<00:02:05.530> adding

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
gonna repeat that same process by adding

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.609 
gonna repeat that same process by adding
the<00:02:06.040> EP<00:02:06.460> fibers<00:02:06.910> on<00:02:07.090> only<00:02:07.690> this<00:02:08.050> time<00:02:08.290> with<00:02:08.500> the

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
the EP fibers on only this time with the

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.010 
the EP fibers on only this time with the
under<00:02:08.979> body<00:02:09.160> we<00:02:09.729> are<00:02:09.760> going<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.240> use<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.660> white

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
under body we are going to use a white

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.710 
under body we are going to use a white
color

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.600 

you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.590 

and<00:02:23.870> when<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.020> all<00:02:25.260> nice<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.530> secure<00:02:26.600> take

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
and when that's all nice and secure take

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.080 
and when that's all nice and secure take
your<00:02:27.780> hook<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.250> flip<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.400> back<00:02:29.520> over

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.740 

our<00:02:34.470> next<00:02:35.470> step<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.459> gather<00:02:36.610> about<00:02:37.090> 10<00:02:37.450> or

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
our next step is to gather about 10 or

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.380 
our next step is to gather about 10 or
so<00:02:38.110> peacock<00:02:38.920> curls<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.580> then<00:02:39.819> secure<00:02:40.269> them

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
so peacock curls and then secure them

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.540 
so peacock curls and then secure them
down<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.900> top<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.860> shank<00:02:42.129> of<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.310> hook

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
down on top of the shank of the hook

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.950 
down on top of the shank of the hook
creating<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.629> nice<00:02:43.840> back<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.830> our<00:02:44.950> fly

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.650 

and<00:02:50.310> once<00:02:51.310> they're<00:02:51.490> nice<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.670> secure<00:02:52.000> snip

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
and once they're nice and secure snip

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.590 
and once they're nice and secure snip
off<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.020> excess<00:02:53.820> now<00:02:54.820> take<00:02:55.090> your<00:02:55.270> thread<00:02:55.540> and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
off the excess now take your thread and

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.000 
off the excess now take your thread and
wrap<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.050> around<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.380> shank<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.800> hook

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
wrap it around the shank of the hook

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.860 
wrap it around the shank of the hook
creating<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.670> nice<00:02:57.850> taper<00:02:58.270> between<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
creating a nice taper between the

creating a nice taper between the
material<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.400> shank<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.850> hook<00:03:02.580> next

now<00:05:01.330> we're<00:05:01.570> going<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.750> take<00:05:01.930> our<00:05:02.110> thread<00:05:02.380> and

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
now we're going to take our thread and

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.730 
now we're going to take our thread and
build<00:05:03.009> up<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.280> head<00:05:03.460> once<00:05:03.759> more<00:05:04.289> covering<00:05:05.289> all

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
build up the head once more covering all

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.520 
build up the head once more covering all

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
of the red crystal flash so that we're

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.560 
of the red crystal flash so that we're
left<00:05:08.830> behind<00:05:09.310> with<00:05:09.789> a<00:05:09.820> nice<00:05:10.180> white<00:05:10.900> head<00:05:11.470> and
