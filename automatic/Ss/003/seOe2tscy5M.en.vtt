00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.589
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.260
 today I'm coming back for a review 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.940
 on a bluff urban decay happy no 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.490
 it's not carnival waltz it's not 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.970
 not spent per month I was strong but 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.039
 the feminine palette that presents itself 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 like these and that has become one of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.420
 my essentials in this moment 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.460
 I use all the time it's a 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.090
 pallet which is on sale at sephora en 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:37.079
 exclusivity as always at the price of 35 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.309
 here is the beast magnificence and 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.910
 beauty of the thing 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.789
 so lighthouse and a gloss for the modest 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.309
 sum of 35 euros other than I do a 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.850
 good telemarketing speaker sifar and a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.930
 gloss for the modest sum of 35 euros 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.930
 so I wanted to go back closer 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:04.379
 here you have so waters edge this 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 who gave up his metal gains which is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.780
 in the next-gen palette a hijack and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.549
 lost which are all colors are 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.710
 all satin colors apart from what 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.060
 m where there are micro species 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.240
 glitter but it comes out completely 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.799
 at the math on the on the skin I'm going 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.630
 do you whatever the flagship idea 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.110
 to make you more aware 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.450
 of the beauty of these wonders and I 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.640
 so let's start with bordello which is 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.930
 here and the cardoons very funny first 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.380
 I find because bordello I find 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.220
 it's very funny but it's a detail and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:47.880
 which is a species of purplish pink a 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.630
 little pink parma and is therefore satin 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.710
 without glitter then 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.600
 we have what is me who is here and who 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.460
 is a Belgian mat what is enough 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.869
 smart in a satin palette 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.479
 to make light touches it is worth 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.250
 better to have a math so a beige matt 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.260
 simple and then we have ac dc which 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:20.370

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.640
