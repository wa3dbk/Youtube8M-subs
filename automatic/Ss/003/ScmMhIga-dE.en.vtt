00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.070
 the silver 110 130 range is appreciated in the 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.670
 agricultural world for versatility and for 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.860
 field agility in the tractor business 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.750
 handy and comfortable with a great 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.239
 power weight ratio is a motor 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.360
 indefatigable to the characteristics 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.250
 peculiar of silver 110 130 is added 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.270
 an important device that simplifies 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.760
 the work of the driver 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.449
 increases productivity and facilitates the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.820
 Tractor control is the reverse king 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.470
 hydraulic with electronic management that 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.630
 minimizing driver gestures 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.700
 provides with great fluidity to 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.170
 reverse the direction of travel avoiding in 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.170
 practice the use of the clutch 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.910
 the only command required is the lever in 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.920
 ergonomic position and under the steering wheel 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.990
 without operating the pedal section just 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.399
 a simple movement to leave and the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.140
 electronic system modulates 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.470
 automatically the pressure in the 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.270
 chamber of the hydraulic section the clutch 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.789
 gradual eliminates tears and jolts 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.570
 also because it is regulated according to the 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:33.799
 loading also the gear change takes place 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.990
 without operating the clutch pedal le 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.940
 maneuvers and therefore the work is continuous 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.970
 because it is possible to reverse the sense of 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.530
 driving even under load in the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.420
 silage and handling 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.159
 the frequent actions of 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.110
 reversal take place thus in the 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.180
 maximum comfort, speed and effectiveness 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.009
 with always fluid movements e 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.240
 progressive 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.549
 already at a speed of ten kilometers 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.409
 times you can reverse the sense of 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.329
 gear saving time and the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.479
 electronics precision provides for 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.640
 the rest of the drivers can concentrate better 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.299
 on your work that becomes more 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.310
 effective and productive this system of 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.599
 management and control presents among the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.190
 others also the advantage of 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.560
 safeguard all mechanical organs 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.980
 transmission prolonging in fact 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.170
 the life of the tractor like the two 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.790
 multi-disc clutches in oil bath one 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.290
 for each direction of travel that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.470
 guarantee longer life e 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.840
 reliability contactor stationary but with 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.030
 engine running does not need to be disengaged 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.940
 the gear but just move the lever in 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.920
 position of valuable company and company 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.410
 the hydraulic inversion reverses all 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.440
 marches proving irreplaceable too 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.780
 in other working conditions on 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.430
 hilly terrain to make an example there 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.769
 possibility to reverse the sense of 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.989
 gear under load of no solution 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.940
 of continuity allows rapid maneuvers and 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.519
 casual impossible with i 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.569
 traditional in people even if the 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.000
 sloping tractor 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.090
 the inversion is rapid and the resumption of 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.920
 progressive gear to make it again 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.459
 more immediate control of the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.980
 situation 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.989
 a display shows with LED lights 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.880
 the state of the inverse king and of the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.880
 speed ag the selected shift 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.930
 silver 110 130 with hydraulic reverse shuttle 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.930
 under load the job changes direction
