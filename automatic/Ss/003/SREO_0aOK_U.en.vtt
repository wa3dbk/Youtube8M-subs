 built up at that time 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.989

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.500
 the sharp sword was a kid's toy 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.350
 against that I actually 1410 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.589

 overwhelming 20,000 lithuania and poland

 before he had finished his troops 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.929
 but had as knights happens to it are
