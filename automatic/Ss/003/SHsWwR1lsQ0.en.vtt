00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.490
 no no of course here is uncle jo 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.640
 I extend a warm welcome 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.000
 revered ladies and gentlemen to a new 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 great follow group and knows nothing 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.840
 cool to give I have something uncool 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.760
 is worried then too bad is yes 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.300
 nice but it is not so big this time 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.000
 how else is it only in 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.960
 quotes only a game of the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 year edition by though by batman arkham 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.790
 city and this game of the year edition 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.040
 These are in the past 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.870
 years of fashion 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.430
 because still playing very, very rarely on 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.469
 completely published at the beginning 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.550
 but still more turns to 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.860
 still swinging a bit 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.590
 and at some point it is complete with 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.890
 all patches and not really 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.860
 no matter we do now just anyway 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.540
 then take a look 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.080
 The cover already packed the system 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.270
 with an incredible number of information so 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 that from the actual artwork 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.560
 not much to see, too 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.090
 maybe there is a reversible cover in it 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.770
 because mona was cool is a wendecover 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.110
 I really do not know it now 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.330
 we find out how cool water is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.430
 But what is in it anyway 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.799
 various codes for additional content to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.740
 example here of Harley Quinn 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:38.009
 tree human harley quinn 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.380
 I know you come from Harlequin 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.000
 Do not kidding from aldi too 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.750
 to be like a harlequin and in there 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.229
 should 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.250
 on bonus content the harley quinn / 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.969
 package the cat woman robin bundle perg 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.399
 nightwing bundle pkk city skills 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:03.540
 challenge map pack so every pack 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.399
 to unpack and here is natural 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.080
 asked again the banquet pocket knife 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.850
 specifically pocketknife 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.100
 that can only operate the uncle jo without 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.560
 to tailor and I do it 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.560
 just brutal top right across 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.930
 has worked the last cameraman 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.730
 So we do not follow it 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.100
 have sent to the last cameraman 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.360
 died this time not so infinitely 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.420
 I already long no longer no 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.420
 seal to open very much like that 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.730
 they once again the starting what so and in there 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.890
 that sounds first no place for 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.690
 sticking on well starts well but good 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.510
 You can be very casual here again 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.020
 a hook it is extra for that 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.670
 made to scroll two dvds 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:13.370
 Look at one of them is probably the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.019
 play and on the other also so 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.269
 no idea that he is on it now 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:24.800
 it is nothing, or he is 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:26.360
 something is now city ​​I think so 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.220
 you can easily find out by 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.450
 one but it lodges in the xbox only 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.410
 such a theory so and now must first 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.440
 let's see where the short not 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.380
 what they show that are no co2 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.640
 there you have to enter codes 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.739
 oh well maybe that's already free 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.070
 switched on this second dvd 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.290
 that could of course be so here 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.050
 2 Maybe that's with the addition 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.600
 receive 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.120
 that would actually be a lot 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.340
 more practical than I thought 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.770
 good but the instructions are not good 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.230
 good look at the x 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.120
 there was saved game of the year 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.650
 edition because you really wait that 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.830
 everything to see it play 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.630
 There is health information in there 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.640
 Note how xbox works live 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.710
 what the little fly seen as just 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.160
 I think you can not do it 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.580
 see 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.780
 in the video but she was really there if that 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.840
 now came out of the pack 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.610
 we'll never find out well that 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.680
 it is positive about this manual 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.200
 no paper clip more violent one on it 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.590
 can taste the hereby can not 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:58.660
 so happen and now the final 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:05:01.630
 test how cool boarders are pretty white 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.030
 vest I think so well that was it 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.360
 batman arkham city game of the year 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.720
 edition and we see each other if you 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:14.280
