00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
question and the first one of you need

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.350 
question and the first one of you need
to<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.170> very<00:01:49.409> careful<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.460> how<00:01:50.670> hard<00:01:51.060> you

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to be very careful with how hard you

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.880 
to be very careful with how hard you
push<00:01:51.600> yourself<00:01:52.049> when<00:01:52.259> you're<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.680> calorie

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
push yourself when you're in a calorie

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.039 
push yourself when you're in a calorie
deficit<00:01:53.579> all<00:01:54.299> right<00:01:54.479> next<00:01:54.720> question

strictly speaking doing Durance athletes

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.249 
strictly speaking doing Durance athletes
require<00:01:59.969> rest<00:02:00.270> days<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> same<00:02:00.960> way<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
require rest days in the same way that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.440 
require rest days in the same way that
strength<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.649> based<00:02:01.920> athletes<00:02:02.399> do<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.329> have

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
mentioned in a recent video that the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.830 
mentioned in a recent video that the
human<00:02:05.340> body<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.640> more<00:02:06.000> adapted<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.420> endurance

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
human body is more adapted to endurance

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.960 
human body is more adapted to endurance
training<00:02:06.930> requires<00:02:07.439> more<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.819> more

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
training requires more of it so as more

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.400 
training requires more of it so as more
and<00:02:09.179> less<00:02:09.330> rust

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and less rust

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
and less rust
an<00:02:10.770> adequate<00:02:11.400> alaric<00:02:12.240> intake<00:02:13.820> it's<00:02:14.820> not<00:02:15.000> that

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
an adequate alaric intake it's not that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.610 
an adequate alaric intake it's not that
you<00:02:15.240> necessarily<00:02:15.330> need<00:02:15.810> more<00:02:16.140> rest<00:02:16.380> I've

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
you necessarily need more rest I've

beyond very short periods of time when

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.450 
beyond very short periods of time when
you<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> good<00:02:27.510> reason<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:28.020> do<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:29.160> it'd

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
you have a good reason to do it so it'd

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.890 
you have a good reason to do it so it'd
take<00:02:29.640> at<00:02:29.790> least<00:02:29.910> one<00:02:30.210> day<00:02:30.390> off

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
take at least one day off

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.840 
take at least one day off
for<00:02:31.380> most<00:02:31.560> people<00:02:31.740> unless<00:02:32.070> it's<00:02:32.400> very<00:02:32.610> low

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
for most people unless it's very low

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.460 
for most people unless it's very low
impact<00:02:33.180> like<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.600> don't<00:02:33.660> take<00:02:34.050> days<00:02:34.230> off

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
impact like I don't take days off

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.710 
impact like I don't take days off
because<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.220> need<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.550> extra<00:02:35.850> energy<00:02:36.030> turnover

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
because I need the extra energy turnover

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.590 
because I need the extra energy turnover
so<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:37.860> do<00:02:38.160> cardio<00:02:38.520> everyday<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.210> cardio

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
so I do do cardio everyday but my cardio

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.750 
so I do do cardio everyday but my cardio
is<00:02:39.750> very<00:02:40.020> very<00:02:40.290> low<00:02:40.440> impacts<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.100> my<00:02:41.250> bike<00:02:41.580> my

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
is very very low impacts on my bike my

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.210 
is very very low impacts on my bike my
recumbent<00:02:42.270> bike<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.630> its<00:02:42.750> low<00:02:42.900> intensity<00:02:43.350> but

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
recumbent bike in its low intensity but

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.010 
recumbent bike in its low intensity but
if<00:02:44.340> you're<00:02:44.490> doing<00:02:44.730> anything<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.720> where<00:02:45.870> you

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
if you're doing anything to where you

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.480 
if you're doing anything to where you
start<00:02:46.290> noticing<00:02:46.470> connective<00:02:47.130> tissue<00:02:47.280> even

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
start noticing connective tissue even

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.070 
start noticing connective tissue even
getting<00:02:47.820> sore<00:02:48.090> doing<00:02:48.390> your<00:02:48.510> cardio<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.990> can

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
getting sore doing your cardio you can

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.930 
getting sore doing your cardio you can
start<00:02:49.290> taking<00:02:49.380> days<00:02:49.680> off<00:02:49.860> but<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:50.670> most

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
start taking days off but for most

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.290 
start taking days off but for most
people<00:02:52.130> six<00:02:53.130> days<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> week<00:02:53.520> will<00:02:53.790> probably<00:02:54.120> cut

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
people six days a week will probably cut

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.210 
people six days a week will probably cut
it<00:02:54.330> other<00:02:54.570> than<00:02:54.780> very<00:02:55.080> very<00:02:55.440> low<00:02:55.740> intensity

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
it other than very very low intensity

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.310 
it other than very very low intensity
cardio<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.000> again<00:02:57.210> something<00:02:57.450> on<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> bike<00:02:58.080> to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
cardio and again something on a bike to

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.630 
cardio and again something on a bike to
where<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.590> know<00:02:58.800> you're<00:02:59.010> not<00:02:59.130> beating<00:02:59.520> up

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
where you know you're not beating up

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.120 
where you know you're not beating up
your<00:02:59.670> knees<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.390> your<00:03:00.570> ankles<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.920> things

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
your knees and your ankles and things

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.980 
your knees and your ankles and things
like<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:02.760> connective<00:03:03.390> tissue<00:03:03.630> and

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
like that because connective tissue and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.190 
like that because connective tissue and
joints<00:03:04.350> need<00:03:05.220> some<00:03:05.550> downtime<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.210> heal<00:03:06.420> and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
joints need some downtime to heal and

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.320 
joints need some downtime to heal and
that<00:03:08.070> should<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.430> your<00:03:08.610> biggest<00:03:08.820> concern

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
that should be your biggest concern

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.180 
that should be your biggest concern
therefore<00:03:09.720> even<00:03:09.960> your<00:03:10.110> endurance<00:03:10.470> work<00:03:10.710> is

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
therefore even your endurance work is

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.410 
therefore even your endurance work is
making<00:03:11.610> sure<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.790> they're<00:03:12.060> adequately

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
making sure that they're adequately

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.290 
making sure that they're adequately
recovered<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.410> if<00:03:13.530> they<00:03:13.680> hurt<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> bit<00:03:14.270> take<00:03:15.270> a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
recovered and if they hurt a bit take a

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.380 
recovered and if they hurt a bit take a
day<00:03:15.510> off<00:03:15.720> not<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.350> big<00:03:16.560> deal<00:03:17.060> all<00:03:18.060> right<00:03:18.090> next

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
day off not a big deal all right next

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.300 
day off not a big deal all right next
question<00:03:20.240> why<00:03:21.240> do<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.080> only<00:03:22.440> do<00:03:22.800> close<00:03:23.100> grip

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
question why do you only do close grip

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.920 
question why do you only do close grip
bench<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.670> your<00:03:23.790> training<00:03:23.970> regiment<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.750> how

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
bench in your training regiment and how

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.360 
bench in your training regiment and how
do<00:03:24.990> you<00:03:25.080> know<00:03:25.260> what<00:03:25.380> numbers<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.740> triana<00:03:26.190> meet

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
do you know what numbers of triana meet

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.980 
do you know what numbers of triana meet
if<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.580> never<00:03:26.790> do<00:03:27.000> regular<00:03:27.420> bench<00:03:27.690> I'm

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
if you never do regular bench I'm

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.390 
if you never do regular bench I'm
probably<00:03:28.320> not<00:03:28.500> gonna<00:03:28.620> bring<00:03:28.830> my<00:03:28.980> bench<00:03:29.190> out<00:03:29.370> a

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
probably not gonna bring my bench out a

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.250 
probably not gonna bring my bench out a
whole<00:03:29.730> lot<00:03:29.760> for<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.240> meet<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.690> don't<00:03:30.960> expect

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
whole lot for the meet so I don't expect

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.660 
whole lot for the meet so I don't expect
it<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.440> go<00:03:31.590> up<00:03:31.770> very<00:03:31.950> much<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.190> I'll<00:03:32.430> do<00:03:32.550> that

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
it to go up very much and I'll do that

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.650 
it to go up very much and I'll do that
as<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.940> meat<00:03:33.090> gets<00:03:33.270> closer<00:03:34.940> my<00:03:35.940> reason<00:03:36.330> for<00:03:36.360> it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
as the meat gets closer my reason for it

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.140 
as the meat gets closer my reason for it
is<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.110> just<00:03:37.170> like<00:03:37.620> other<00:03:38.220> guys<00:03:38.460> I've<00:03:38.760> noticed

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
bone structure I'll name a couple of

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.780 
bone structure I'll name a couple of
very<00:04:01.200> serious<00:04:01.440> lifters<00:04:01.920> Paul<00:04:02.190> Carter<00:04:02.610> and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
very serious lifters Paul Carter and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.540 
very serious lifters Paul Carter and
then<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.660> big<00:04:03.840> Russian<00:04:04.110> KK<00:04:05.660> both<00:04:07.550> benchpress

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
then the big Russian KK both benchpress

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.310 
then the big Russian KK both benchpress
even<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.120> competition<00:04:09.660> with<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.870> close<00:04:10.080> grip

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
even in competition with a close grip

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.500 
even in competition with a close grip
and<00:04:10.590> they<00:04:11.310> train<00:04:11.580> in<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.820> close<00:04:12.000> grip<00:04:12.240> and<00:04:12.420> they

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
and they train in a close grip and they

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.270 
and they train in a close grip and they
both<00:04:12.750> notice<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.350> it's<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:13.770> easier<00:04:14.130> they

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
both notice that it's just easier they

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.849 
both notice that it's just easier they
seem<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.730> be<00:04:14.820> less<00:04:15.090> prone<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.690> injuries<00:04:16.440> doing

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
seem to be less prone to injuries doing

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.740 
seem to be less prone to injuries doing
that<00:04:17.040> their<00:04:17.220> shoulders<00:04:17.520> feel<00:04:17.700> better

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
that their shoulders feel better

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.440 
that their shoulders feel better
their<00:04:19.400> insertions<00:04:20.400> for<00:04:20.580> their<00:04:20.700> pecs<00:04:21.120> feel

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
their insertions for their pecs feel

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.730 
their insertions for their pecs feel
better<00:04:21.720> they<00:04:21.900> don't<00:04:22.049> get<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.380> inflammation

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
better they don't get that inflammation

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.810 
better they don't get that inflammation
and<00:04:23.130> things<00:04:23.310> that<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.520> get

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
and things that you get

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.550 
and things that you get
the<00:04:23.970> wider<00:04:24.180> benching<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.780> lets<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.170> bench

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
the wider benching it lets you bench

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.670 
the wider benching it lets you bench
more<00:04:25.950> frequently<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:26.550> more<00:04:26.760> volume<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.680> so

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
more frequently in more volume and so

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.910 
more frequently in more volume and so
that's<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.010> reason<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.370> do<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.670> personally<00:04:30.920> is

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
that's the reason I do it personally is

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.770 
that's the reason I do it personally is
that<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.430> don't<00:04:32.700> get<00:04:32.820> as<00:04:32.940> much<00:04:32.970> inflammation<00:04:33.690> I

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
that I don't get as much inflammation I

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.600 
that I don't get as much inflammation I
can<00:04:33.870> get<00:04:33.990> away<00:04:34.080> with<00:04:34.260> benching<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.980> lot<00:04:35.370> more

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
can get away with benching a lot more

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.640 
can get away with benching a lot more
often<00:04:35.820> more<00:04:36.270> heavy<00:04:36.600> without<00:04:36.870> without<00:04:37.380> really

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
often more heavy without without really

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.290 
often more heavy without without really
running<00:04:37.980> into<00:04:38.160> those<00:04:38.310> recovery<00:04:38.790> issues<00:04:38.910> for

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
running into those recovery issues for

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.660 
running into those recovery issues for
things<00:04:39.510> like<00:04:39.600> my<00:04:39.780> rotator<00:04:40.140> cuffs<00:04:40.470> my<00:04:41.430> PEC

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
things like my rotator cuffs my PEC

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.400 
things like my rotator cuffs my PEC
insertions<00:04:42.240> my<00:04:42.390> shoulders<00:04:42.750> things<00:04:42.990> like<00:04:43.170> that

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
insertions my shoulders things like that

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.730 
insertions my shoulders things like that
so<00:04:44.160> that<00:04:44.310> is<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.610> reason<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:44.970> do<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.620> all<00:04:46.620> right

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
so that is the reason I do it all right

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.140 
so that is the reason I do it all right
now<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.040> that's<00:04:47.130> really<00:04:47.370> all<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.610> have<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:48.000> say

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
now so that's really all I have to say

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.070 
now so that's really all I have to say
on<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.390> today<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:48.630> hope<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.960> has<00:04:49.050> been

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080
