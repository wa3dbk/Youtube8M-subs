00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.940
 welcome people to one 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.590
 another short video here from mmo too 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.470
 and yes we are on the 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.170
 public test real with the patch 6.1 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.810
 and i want you the big sause yourself 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.090
 Introduce the title once that 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.679
 new racing game which one or 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.629
 others of you maybe already in the 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.670
 Approach the warlords on trainer 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.969
 has seen from us 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.969
 However, blizzard has the racing game yes 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.010
 heavily overworked you are seeing here now 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.690
 so small electric fences if you are exactly 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.059
 look the have the characteristics 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.479
 if you run over it you will me 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.579
 say dazed and of course 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.440
 we still have slow down in the 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.899
 action bar you see so one with the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.019
 blue arrow and if we click that 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.289
 We are the nearest ja toll 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.820
 Here's where we go now 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.200
 there fly me there automatically and 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.110
 the beautiful is we are four afterwards 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.890
 seconds immune to any damage 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.619
 or any effects of the electro 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.359
 otherwise they have the testify 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.759
 blue maki the blue mark 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.939
 now collect the green and 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.590
 back there would be the same red 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.609
 be a mark and you see here 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.770
 not so easy 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.250
 I have now realized here 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.710
 do not jump with the yes to the goal 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.179
 worked that you'll see again 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.409
 Now we have to go to the starting position 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:44.710
 return and let's see now 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.820
 you see how I confessed so yes 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.929
 The stan is then already not without 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.429
 and here again nice about the 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.630
 of course the barrel jumped 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.799
 but then taken in the air 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.319
 been admitted 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.380
 there are some new successes here 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:03.450
 highest or the best success is 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.259
 this race game in under eleven strokes 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.670
 complete and you see the top 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:12.830
 timer I have just 15 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.400
 and yes, but the three successes 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.340
 nowitzki and leadfuss within under 20 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.849
 I have reached bells and 15 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.250
 and the best as I said is eleven strokes 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.800
 and I'll try that right now 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.420
 Again I pay we look 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.360
 just do another game again 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 a lot of catch and this time 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.989
 I also work with the action button 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.120
 down with the one holding through the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.980
 start position blablabla we had 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.989
 So everything already so the game repeated 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.660
 here now more or less like 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.760
 said by clicking on the once 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.560
 jump to the banner we jump to 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.510
 nearest danner I do that 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.180
 know here far away okay 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.610
 So it gave me some range afterwards 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.090
 you can be immune for four seconds so 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.620
 also run through the fall and the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.410
 I think I have an ideal way 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.610
 not quite found 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.880
 You can also get over the water here 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.680
 do not port up as well in flight 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.549
 you can jump this to the banner 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.560
 do not use 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.459
 Only here and there do I have one again 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.690
 a few meters well done but if that's what 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.950
 I did not know 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.810
 I have definitely lost meters 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.040
 and here I should jump too 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:38.320
 pull because perfectly over the fences 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:42.400
 jumped and new chimes 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:48.300
 we already have to abbreviate c that will 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.300
 ill again saved by leaps 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.910
 yes well, now I have total here 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.570
 verkackt we are already at twelve 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.610
 bells and yes I mean it is 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.900
 not without maybe I am too 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.720
 just gone the wrong way 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.780
 the trees the branches are here after all 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.020
 somehow in the gone and now 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.810
 sometimes fast, the 114 is just as bad 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.940
 like in front of it also has a better 15 in the 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.930
 first try and yes I will do it here 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.519
 Try a little bit more 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.380
 it definitely makes a great deal 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:26.770
 drive and there will be with the patch 6.1 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.050
 be available in the dark and year market 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.620
 I'm just watching the success again 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.830
 the dark moon race in the under 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.720
 within 11 bells and yes 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.060
 that is still a goal to get to 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.280
 otherwise love could replace people 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.200
 It darkens the shape and yearends the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.690
 article with further changes new 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.150
 toys changes to the prices 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.770
 for heirlooms you can find in the video 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.910
 description I say until the next 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.910
 makes it a good autorenschaft
