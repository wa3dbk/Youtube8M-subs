00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:19.289
 the great imaginary of claudio roncoli 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.289
 it opens its space 50 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.410
 for me that artist is many things but 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.900
 mainly it is to make visible what 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.220
 invisible being very free and very 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.500
 committed to what happens 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.860
 you can not be blind and good and go to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.860
 Grow a lot 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.900
 I think the biggest trait that is 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.170
 in my work is the irony of how the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.780
 means and politics generate we want 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.280
 sell a system a very happy system 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.409
 when wheels are personal ideas of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 them so well the best is delivered the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.820
 system and have fun with that and give it to 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.670
 know for me what is indispensable for 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.070
 work is music space and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.259
 music technology because it's with me 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.330
 at all times when I paint or when 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.729
 I think even and also because I like it 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.500
 collect what you follow the space is very 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.660
 important that they were well away from 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.600
 the house of one take it as something of 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.250
 point of concentration and technology 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.020
 because good what I do that has 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.090
 a digital mix helps me a lot and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.890
 It is also connected with friends or 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.170
 with people that you get to know is very 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.630
 interesting I'm currently working 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.369
 in a project called equilibrium where 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.679
 through geometry that the only thing 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.659
 perfect that for me he achieved man and 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.820
 with old images and elements of 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.550
 I scrap the jobs above if I 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.640
 I come and mix them with typical images 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.869
 with much irony I think that my big 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.450
 longings as artists are two 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.570
 basically the first one is that I wish 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.580
 I never get bored that I always investigate and 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.410
 Do not repeat me because repeating is what 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.970
 worse than an artist or 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.020
 believe that one reaches a good point 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.570
 real never come to anything 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.160
 second instance with great desire is that 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.800
 I wish my grandchildren see the pictures in 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.960
 less museums and that when they pass they say 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.600
 look how big the grandfather offers that 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.370
 something interesting did in his life thank you 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.830
 to come and come from my workshop but now 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.830
 They have gone very well see you soon 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.780
 thanks claudio roncoli for the note and 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.440
 for letting us enter your color and 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.440
 beautiful workshop 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.950
