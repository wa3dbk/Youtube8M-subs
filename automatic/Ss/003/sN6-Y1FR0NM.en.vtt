00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 our company today the Argentine drama 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.210
 that as you see 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.460
 These batteries are made in acrylic 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.910
 which is a material that is already tested 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.480
 it's proven myself I've had material 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.640
 acrylic of famous brands and are 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.640
 materials that have a lot of sonority 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.759
 very well sharpened they give the perfect tone and 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.740
 visually they are beautiful in this case 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.830
 good the fittings are also very 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.100
 well achieved 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.710
 elton is suspended by this plate 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.220
 acrylic so the helmets do not have 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.010
 contact with the metal this gives even more 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.500
 depth the sound and the drum 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.540

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.140
 colors are very very nice batteries 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.940
 they look great on stage and they have 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.640
 combinations also in wood and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.360
 acrylic this manufacturer we value a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 very pretty drummer that sounds great and 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.280
 it must be taken into account at the time of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.870
 choose an instrument I know what 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.729

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.729

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.390
