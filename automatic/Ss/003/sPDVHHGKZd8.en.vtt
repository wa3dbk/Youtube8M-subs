00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
 this one but this example 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.960
 then people and created two why because on the other computer so I 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.670
 I'll do it again 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.139
 exactly the same manip 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.440
 but instead of the background of expectations to make george verreault do 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.429
 now 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:14.800
 deprived of his two rivals 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.089
 secondly dynatera 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.640
 and there I make 1 6000 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.599
 900 men 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.519
 5900 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.679
 6900 knows for who passes makes port to external port 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:26.599
 On the other hand 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.409
 5 907 who meet with others is to tell you that same 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.680
 software does it take him on the bench 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.510
 and you're doing a second like just now tmc 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.999
 http 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.509
 the no five something else except expectations become his loved ones tpr 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.399
 so 6800 this time 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.400
 and the other were good 5800 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.870
 the ip address and my computer so the other computer 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.540
 so to know her ashes 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.540
 like just now good configuration that all programs 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.520
 connection 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.960
 wireless connection 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.030
 you said it if in four to six on the water this will be for example four 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.030
 signs all wind for example me these people on your computer 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.900
 so what's needed here I put some fixed ideas 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.310
 important minc do it because the only one to change 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.760
 in general we have plenty of time to manipulate 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.300
 but it can change its many computers is that the backpacker who 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.610
 distributes addresses 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.100
 so we'll wait for tutorials how to put them so we all wait 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.990
 heaven 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.300
 however you did all that you set up your heart 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.770
 to tell him pass to let pass precisely 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.190
 information 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.780
 by its doors 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.650
 text 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.650
 so that's it for the party 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.810
 your antivirus to 6% also you have traveled the men of north one 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.159
 she go on the port site century where he shows how to 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.289
 to precisely to settle it must do a little like the comici it is necessary 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.930
 to adjust him say boj authorizes to take in hand 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.460
 see to connect 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.290
 so I settled here 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.490
 so I would do it exactly the same way from the beginning 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.910
 except that of the router so we have among others that we already do everything 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.189
 on the second computer 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.189
 on our computer at the expense of treatment the same thing 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.959
 cuba do not fail to configure so nothing serious 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.389
 the router but the firewall 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.159
 you can to try activism you antivirus ans for how you 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:23.619
 will 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.019
 quiet on the computers you 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.799
 activists 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.579
 we will now connect to your computer with a second is 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.509
 more open 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:34.589
 we do one of these days 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.589
 it was excessively founded both cases as we approached the stadium 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:39.909
 so I will enter the address 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.549
 of the computer I want to connect to 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.109
 so on the other computer these 192 concentric point of sale 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.680
 does anyone know why of something that networked 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.010
 if you ever want to know the computer 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.289
 so who's on the internet we're not on your zone so 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.529
 it takes aggressiveness but opacity internet 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:03.489
 for that you go 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.969
 as for diesel and you type 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.969
 address 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.739
 four aces with a little 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.049
 and you click here 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.540
 you will see you will have your respect I really do for reasons 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.459
 security 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.909
 you will have your ip address is clean 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.419
 don that will not be 192 me represents 86 points 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.720
 so much so that the portel 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.750
 to enter this meaning 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.299
 or with them 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.299
 and m after you do 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.140
 so there he will ask me the password the password 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.669
 it's the one you go to the other machine on pc 2 for example 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.129
 hello between 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.989
 the password 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.849
 I click on pocket 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.289
 and here I come meeting an interview I remember managing 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.419
 ask who takes away the country role their experts believe 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:51.889
 it's as simple as possible 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.169
 and so here I am on your computer 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.559
 you see it's relatively fluid I can go in all directions by 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:00.710
 example all the programs I really want to do everything 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.609
 and for troubleshooting it's really interesting 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.339
 you can specify how to do how belga video tutorial 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:10.559
 you can explain the person in front for thousands of kilometers 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:11.379
 how to do 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.529
 as if you were holding his mouse 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:15.439
 so it happened in geneva 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.370
 for the pursuit would have lengthened franc of tutorials precisely for them 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.959
 to make his fixed subscription idea I wanted to show the example 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.309
 so to make his idea fixed 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:25.860
 get you started 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.479
 connection 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.939
 network 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.849
 show all connections 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.580
 so if you are on the wireless network you are doing 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.180
 right click 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.199
 on properties 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.239
 here fuse health so you go internet protocol tcb iter 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.990
 you go next property here 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.840
 and see if you want us to discipline you an address automatically 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.509
 you click on the addressed ip file and following 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.520
 put 192 168 points will always be that 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.670
 and if against you put yourself the 86 or 65 year old suffering from two hundred to 90 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:05.759
 do not worry 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.930
 the subnet mask you put the same 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.930
 will pass by default you put the same missive p 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.180
 klemurs the following years base have been named here 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.460
 you do ok 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.509
 and like that, we're going to end up with a fixed idea 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.360
 then there is an advantage but there is a year to come so for example you go to 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.409
 one of your friends who is internet that gives you the tone the code to connect 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:26.259
 his home 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.180
 the head that the network will not be able to do it 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.500
 so I'm going to tell you impossible to connect you know not why so 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.500
 the anguished without being able to turn on it 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.349
 you have on login show all connections forever 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.949
 a right click and cie 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.949
 and then property 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.990
 and so here you simply change that 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.550
 it was not automatically 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.779
 and after you do ok 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.080
 nearly 150,000 people 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.559
 so here for this tutorial I hope you could get away with it 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:07.039
 which was not too complicated if you have questions do not hesitate 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.939
 not to ask it so 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.119
 by adding comments underneath not seeing in it simply 

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:14.699
 I will try to answer as simply as possible 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.360
 so we'll be on the spot soon for computer science 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.949
 Hi everybody
