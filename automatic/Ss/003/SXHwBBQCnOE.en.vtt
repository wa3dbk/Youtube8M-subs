today<00:00:13.680> now<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:13.890> are<00:00:14.070> going<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.430> start<00:00:14.670> about

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
today now we are going to start about

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.590 
today now we are going to start about
the<00:00:15.450> individual<00:00:16.320> parts<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.160> eyeball<00:00:17.600> so

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the individual parts of the eyeball so

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.290 
the individual parts of the eyeball so
initially<00:00:18.900> let<00:00:19.350> us<00:00:19.800> concentrate<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
initially let us concentrate on the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.040 
initially let us concentrate on the
cornea<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.580> particular<00:00:24.060> image<00:00:24.570> you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
cornea so in this particular image you

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.010 
cornea so in this particular image you
can<00:00:25.500> clearly<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:26.040> the<00:00:26.910> anterior<00:00:27.540> part<00:00:27.780> of<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
can clearly see the anterior part of the

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.740 
can clearly see the anterior part of the
globe<00:00:28.350> of<00:00:28.530> the<00:00:28.620> eye<00:00:28.950> is<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.640> glowing<00:00:30.120> part<00:00:30.510> is

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
globe of the eye is the glowing part is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
globe of the eye is the glowing part is
considered<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.980> cornea<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:34.110> this

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
considered as the cornea so here this

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.580 
considered as the cornea so here this
particular<00:00:35.040> cornea<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.840> transparent

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
particular cornea is the transparent

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.270 
particular cornea is the transparent
convex<00:00:38.570> anterior<00:00:39.570> portion<00:00:39.930> or<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.949> can<00:00:41.100> say

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
convex anterior portion or we can say

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.630 
convex anterior portion or we can say
the<00:00:41.489> outer<00:00:41.790> layer<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> eyeball<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:44.100> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the outer layer of the eyeball so this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
the outer layer of the eyeball so this
is<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.909> outer<00:00:45.089> layer<00:00:45.449> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.720> eyeball<00:00:46.199> which

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
is the outer layer of the eyeball which

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.320 
is the outer layer of the eyeball which
is<00:00:47.159> known<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.580> cornea<00:00:48.000> which<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
is known as the cornea which is

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.320 
is known as the cornea which is
transparent<00:00:48.900> in<00:00:49.290> nature<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.339> this<00:00:51.089> particular

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
transparent in nature so this particular

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.920 
transparent in nature so this particular
cornea<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.710> covering<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:53.699> two<00:00:53.940> main<00:00:54.180> internal

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
cornea is covering the two main internal

cornea is covering the two main internal
structures<00:00:55.470> which<00:00:55.979> are<00:00:56.100> generally<00:00:56.550> called<00:00:57.150> as

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
structures which are generally called as

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.939 
structures which are generally called as
the<00:00:58.080> iris<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.610> pupil<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the iris and the pupil so here the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.950 
the iris and the pupil so here the
anterior<00:01:02.640> portion<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.479> particular

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
cornea forms the anterior 1/6 of the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.270 
cornea forms the anterior 1/6 of the
outer<00:01:08.700> layer<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.320> continuous<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
outer layer and it's continuous with the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.639 
outer layer and it's continuous with the
sclera<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.570> sclera<00:01:12.870> which<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.260> generally

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649

sclera the sclera which is generally
known<00:01:13.829> as<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.759> white<00:01:15.030> part<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> eye

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
known as the the white part of the eye

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.200 
known as the the white part of the eye
so<00:01:17.520> posterior<00:01:18.509> lis<00:01:18.719> this<00:01:18.960> particular<00:01:19.560> cornea

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
so posterior lis this particular cornea

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
so posterior lis this particular cornea
continuous<00:01:21.210> which<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.479> X<00:01:21.659> square<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.310> is

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
continuous which is X square so this is

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.429 
continuous which is X square so this is
known<00:01:23.789> as<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.119> anterior<00:01:24.750> part<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
known as the anterior part of the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.440 
known as the anterior part of the
eyeball<00:01:25.799> which<00:01:26.219> is<00:01:26.369> generally<00:01:26.759> considered<00:01:27.149> as

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
eyeball which is generally considered as

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.520 
eyeball which is generally considered as
cornea<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.310> know<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.670> though<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.990> cornea

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
cornea so we know that though the cornea

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.730 
cornea so we know that though the cornea
is<00:01:31.829> transparent<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.659> does<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.229> appear

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
is transparent it does not appear

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.940 
is transparent it does not appear
transparent<00:01:35.659> that<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.170> appears<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
transparent that is it appears in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.459 
transparent that is it appears in
different<00:01:38.280> colors<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.539> is<00:01:39.750> such<00:01:39.929> as<00:01:40.140> blue

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
different colors that is such as blue

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.649 
different colors that is such as blue
such<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.549> green<00:01:41.990> brown<00:01:42.990> gray<00:01:43.969> black<00:01:44.969> so<00:01:45.539> these

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
such as green brown gray black so these

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.109 
such as green brown gray black so these
are<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.929> different<00:01:46.380> colors<00:01:46.740> where<00:01:47.399> cornea

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
are the different colors where cornea

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.840 
are the different colors where cornea
exactly<00:01:48.780> appears<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.429> should<00:01:50.670> not

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
exactly appears so you should not

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.649 
exactly appears so you should not
mistaken<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.929> this<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.090> exact

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
mistaken that this is not the exact

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.289 
mistaken that this is not the exact
color<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.560> cornea<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.060> see

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
color of the cornea so you can see

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.050 
color of the cornea so you can see
clearly<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.899> said<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.740> particular<00:01:59.130> cornea<00:01:59.850> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
clearly I said this particular cornea is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.260 
clearly I said this particular cornea is
called<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.950> anterior<00:02:01.950> portion<00:02:02.789> of<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
called as the anterior portion of the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.200 
called as the anterior portion of the
eyeball<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.429> immediately<00:02:05.460> Benni<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.090> this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
eyeball so immediately Benni to this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.440 
eyeball so immediately Benni to this
particular<00:02:06.600> cornea<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.450> like

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
particular cornea you can see the like

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.900 
particular cornea you can see the like
iris<00:02:10.110> okay<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.480> mainly<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.230> color<00:02:13.560> of

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
iris okay so the mainly the color of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.230 
iris okay so the mainly the color of
this<00:02:14.910> particular<00:02:15.540> iris<00:02:16.610> gives<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
this particular iris gives the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.560 
this particular iris gives the
appearance<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.980> particular<00:02:20.610> color<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
appearance of a particular color to the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.210 
appearance of a particular color to the
cornea<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.650> here

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
cornea so here

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.840 
cornea so here
this<00:02:23.700> Clara<00:02:24.030> overlaps<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.960> cornea<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.850> its

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
this Clara overlaps a cornea and its

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.300 
this Clara overlaps a cornea and its
periphery<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.690> appears<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.590> front<00:02:28.950> as<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
periphery and appears in front as a

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.170 
periphery and appears in front as a
white<00:02:30.030> portion<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.320> eye<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.000> what

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
white portion of the eye so this is what

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.730 
white portion of the eye so this is what
is<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.540> important<00:02:34.200> point<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.560> need<00:02:34.680> to

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
is the important point you need to

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.910 
is the important point you need to
remember<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.180> are<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.570> dimensions<00:02:37.560> of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
remember so what are the dimensions of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
remember so what are the dimensions of
this<00:02:38.100> particular<00:02:38.580> cornea<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.330> important

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
this particular cornea is important
