00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello friends with you moment and today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.400
 we have a special issue mehano bugs because 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.800
 Today we look at a global one 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.440
 a mechanism which is simply called a lift 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.170
 and it is based only on simple 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.850
 piston property 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.460
 We look that these properties so 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.980
 Two pistons have come forward now 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.560
 we remove the piston 2 we need to click 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.170
 lever we click we see that 2 piston 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.039
 not cleaned how to remove and he should 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 he folded 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 and then we can remove it 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.160
 properties so let's go watch the elevator 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.290
 now we are in the elevator car and 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.989
 let's see how it works click 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.600
 button and go down pay 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.489
 attention that before we start 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.469
 door movement closes i.e. all 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.840
 like a real elevator but technical 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.730
 side of this elevator at a glance 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 stagger really nothing here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.170
 complex is simply not a big fraud with 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.239
 tutors and red dust therefore 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.449
 let's start from the very beginning of the elevator 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.109
 the first thing we have to put is 4 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.960
 piston 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.780
 any way you can put them in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.790
 bury the ground but I made them on 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.270
 surface further on them we put more 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.490
 a portion of the pistons and then everything is just up 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.290
 pig squeal here with us like you 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.000
 notice there is a button behind the button 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.060
 just worth the red dust 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 that goes my way I don't know you 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.200
 You can do this way in a different way. 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.740
 I got it so she goes here 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.450
 here and comes the block behind which stands 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.490
 red torch accordingly when we 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.610
 press there button is red dust 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.409
 this red torch lights up 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.659
 overlaps and from this we already 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.350
 this red torch lights up 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.240
 which is set on against he 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.329
 feeds us this red dust 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.399
 which we have on floor 1 she 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.409
 goes here to this piston here yard 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.420
 Peter 1 with maximum delay 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.850
 and the first is just to gain 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.119
 signal because for some reason it is not 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.450
 enough I really don't remember why so here she is 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.009
 forks goes further to the rear 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.659
 piston but depending on which side 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.300
 watch again these are three loops for 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.430
 amplification signal here they are our two 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.690
 pistons here they are installed here through 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.030
 block after 1 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.680
 want attention through the block stand 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.440
 repeaters with maximum delay then 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.600
 have all the pistons on the first floor work 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.510
 with maximum delay and it goes around 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.090
 elevators here again through the block 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.190
 I draw your attention and if Peter is standing at the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.350
 whose maximum delay is all on 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.380
 this first floor we have made further 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.070
 to us, the second floor here we go 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.020
 branching also up here it is in 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.480
 In this case, we are already here as well. 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.940
 yard of Peter they are installed above 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.830
 where the pistons will come to us 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.650
 if we have pistons installed 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.810
 bottom here they advance one 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.360
 block respectively the second pistons 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.870
 fit here to this unit here not 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.390
 will fit 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.850
 means here with us as there also through 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.950
 block these repeaters stand only here 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.230
 the delay is no longer as similar 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.790
 way only these repeaters on the second 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.950
 floor that should work 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.350
 powered by these tutors 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.290
 there is such a simple construction 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.500
 here she goes here and from here 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.480
 principle, the current is taken and this lipitor 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.910
 which also belongs to the second floor 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.220
 here it is, here's the whole first floor 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.050
 that works here from this button 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.300
 but we need him to work in 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.730
 the back of that button ran 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.640
 let's see how to do it faster 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.680
 in fact, everything is just as simple here 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.440
 only now now we have an elevator 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.070
 second floor I draw your attention to 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.650
 what 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.739
 and now when he's on the second floor with us 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.400
 this red torch is burning to power those 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.530
 the pistons they keep the elevator upstairs 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.360
 accordingly what happens and when we 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.040
 click on this button red dust 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.800
 we have this 3 peter 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.720
 to amplify the signal goes goes go go 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.060
 red dust and 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.940
 comes to that block where now we have 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.459
 just aruba, this one 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.280
 main torch and when we click there 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.709
 this red torch button will overlap 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.450
 accordingly all the pistons will work 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.660
 down and our lift go down let's 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.660
 let's see it so I'll get out of the elevator all 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.090
 he overlapped yes he overlapped caught fire 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.490
 this red torch which does not give him 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.290
 burn and we should see that face here 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.000
 yes absolutely right elevator 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.940
 here now let's deal with 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.240
 doors doors really everything too 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.940
 rather simply they are powered all 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.280
 same button from me to take a signal here from 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.360
 these pistons that we have on the ground 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.770
 the floor from them we feed the wire he 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.350
 goes accordingly and 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.630
 fits here to these doors 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.870
 here are two pistons because we press 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.000
 on the button and we have to close the door 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.980
 and I draw your attention that the door is not 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.140
 there must be a repeater ie door 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.420
 must close for before we go 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.890
 this is exactly what happens the door 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.950
 closes then only we start 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.260
 the movement from above is also exactly the door 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.080
 Well powered by 100 already from repeaters 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.660
 second floor here we repeat or 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.030
 the second floor here by i'm plain 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.460
 the wire goes up here he 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.200
 meets with a block behind which stands 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.170
 red torch because the doors must 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.790
 work in reverse when she 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.850
 rehearse the door signal the other way around 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.890
 should be open well that's enough 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.960
 just and here we go is just red 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:36.300
 dust that feeds our doors that's all 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.280
 here is the whole mechanism though it looks like 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.460
 really scary we use in ourselves 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.530
 only the property as well, that in the 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.530
 this all with you was a moment goodbye
