00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
you know that on the other side of this

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.100 
you know that on the other side of this
tape<00:02:15.400> it's<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.610> wait<00:02:16.820> tape<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.690> 2<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:18.079> 1

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
tape it's a wait tape so it's a 2 in 1

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.759 
tape it's a wait tape so it's a 2 in 1
and<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:19.459> measures<00:02:20.269> how<00:02:20.750> much<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.260> animal

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
and it measures how much the animal

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.220 
and it measures how much the animal
weighs<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.459> get<00:02:22.609> these<00:02:22.760> tapes<00:02:23.209> at<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.930> feed

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
weighs you can get these tapes at a feed

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.680 
weighs you can get these tapes at a feed
store<00:02:24.500> they're<00:02:24.769> very<00:02:25.190> inexpensive<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:26.060> some

feed stores actually give them away and
it's<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.600> handy<00:02:29.959> thing<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.350> because<00:02:30.950> we<00:02:31.130> do

it's a handy thing to have because we do

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.789 
it's a handy thing to have because we do

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
yearly basis usually once a year we'll

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.210 
yearly basis usually once a year we'll
weigh<00:02:36.049> them<00:02:36.290> just<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.709> make<00:02:36.859> sure<00:02:36.890> they<00:02:37.160> stay

weigh them just to make sure they stay
steady<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.030> they're<00:02:38.180> not<00:02:38.269> gaining<00:02:38.600> while

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
steady and they're not gaining while

steady and they're not gaining while
you're<00:02:39.560> measuring<00:02:39.950> your<00:02:40.190> animal<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.730> want<00:02:41.060> to

make sure that he's standing square and

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.060 
make sure that he's standing square and
what<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.269> means<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:45.200> his<00:02:45.620> feet<00:02:45.890> are

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
what that means is all his feet are

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.280 
what that means is all his feet are
lined<00:02:46.340> up<00:02:46.549> very<00:02:46.850> like<00:02:47.359> the<00:02:47.540> back<00:02:47.780> ones<00:02:48.079> are

lined up perfect as you can stay ok now

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.680 
lined up perfect as you can stay ok now
he's<00:02:52.010> not<00:02:52.250> perfect<00:02:52.579> but<00:02:52.880> that's<00:02:52.970> pretty<00:02:53.329> close

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
he's not perfect but that's pretty close

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.020 
he's not perfect but that's pretty close

the harness and not a saddle they need

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.559 
the harness and not a saddle they need
that

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
that

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.319 
that
to<00:03:05.930> walk<00:03:06.260> good<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.829> also<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.819> doesn't<00:03:07.999> pinch

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
to walk good and also it doesn't pinch

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.629 
to walk good and also it doesn't pinch
up<00:03:08.569> there<00:03:08.900> okay<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:09.769> you<00:03:10.129> wrap<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.400> around

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
up there okay so you wrap that around

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.599 
up there okay so you wrap that around
there<00:03:11.090> it's<00:03:11.209> right<00:03:11.510> behind<00:03:11.719> the<00:03:12.049> front<00:03:12.260> legs

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
there it's right behind the front legs

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.890 
there it's right behind the front legs
because<00:03:13.609> this<00:03:13.909> is<00:03:14.120> where<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.420> belly<00:03:14.599> band

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
because this is where the belly band

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.869 
because this is where the belly band
sits<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.980> pull<00:03:16.219> it<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.549> know<00:03:16.639> you<00:03:16.700> don't

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
sits and you pull it you know you don't

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.259 
sits and you pull it you know you don't
wrench<00:03:17.359> it<00:03:17.599> tight<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:19.069> not<00:03:19.310> saggy<00:03:19.700> you

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
wrench it tight but it's not saggy you

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.420 
wrench it tight but it's not saggy you
just<00:03:20.510> pull<00:03:20.689> it<00:03:20.810> snug<00:03:20.959> nice<00:03:21.469> just<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.040> little<00:03:22.219> tug

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
just pull it snug nice just a little tug

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.289 
just pull it snug nice just a little tug
a<00:03:22.579> little<00:03:22.609> snug

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
a little snug

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.199 
a little snug
so<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.810> would<00:03:24.260> say<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:25.129> can<00:03:25.310> pull<00:03:25.639> it<00:03:25.670> tight<00:03:26.000> to

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
so I would say it I can pull it tight to

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.830 
so I would say it I can pull it tight to
48<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.340> know<00:03:28.459> not<00:03:28.790> tight<00:03:29.120> but<00:03:29.389> I<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.689> pull

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
48 so you know not tight but I can pull

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.479 
48 so you know not tight but I can pull
pretty<00:03:30.049> snug<00:03:30.379> to<00:03:30.530> 48<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.129> that's<00:03:31.310> the

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
pretty snug to 48 so that's the

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.539 
pretty snug to 48 so that's the
measurement<00:03:31.790> I'm<00:03:32.030> gonna<00:03:32.269> say<00:03:32.680> 48<00:03:33.680> because<00:03:34.219> if

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
measurement I'm gonna say 48 because if

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.429 
measurement I'm gonna say 48 because if
this<00:03:34.760> was<00:03:34.999> the<00:03:35.209> belly<00:03:35.389> band<00:03:35.659> on<00:03:35.989> him<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.379> is

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
this was the belly band on him that is

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.619 
this was the belly band on him that is
how<00:03:36.799> tight<00:03:37.099> I<00:03:37.129> would<00:03:37.459> make<00:03:37.639> it<00:03:37.819> so<00:03:38.180> doodles

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
how tight I would make it so doodles

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.759 
how tight I would make it so doodles
belly<00:03:38.930> band<00:03:39.349> measurement<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.790> 48<00:03:41.599> inches<00:03:41.769> now

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
belly band measurement is 48 inches now

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.289 
belly band measurement is 48 inches now
we're<00:03:42.980> going<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.159> be<00:03:43.310> measuring<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:44.000> length

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
we're going to be measuring the length

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.319 
we're going to be measuring the length
of<00:03:44.780> doodles<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.010> how<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:46.430> do<00:03:46.669> that<00:03:46.849> is<00:03:47.150> you

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
of doodles and how you do that is you

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.610 
of doodles and how you do that is you
measure<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.750> from<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.049> point<00:03:48.319> of<00:03:48.560> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
measure it from the point of the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.550 
measure it from the point of the
shoulder<00:03:49.359> right<00:03:50.359> there<00:03:50.659> and<00:03:51.079> if<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.379> wraps

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
shoulder right there and if it wraps

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.199 
shoulder right there and if it wraps
around<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.889> teeny<00:03:52.189> bit<00:03:52.370> that's<00:03:52.639> better<00:03:52.939> you

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
around a teeny bit that's better you

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.990 
around a teeny bit that's better you
don't<00:03:53.329> want<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.599> down<00:03:53.780> here<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> put<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:55.819> like

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
don't want it down here so put it like

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.839 
don't want it down here so put it like
just<00:03:56.299> right<00:03:56.569> there<00:03:56.870> all<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.919> way<00:03:58.069> down<00:03:58.400> and

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
right so the Hort the length of doodles

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.159 
right so the Hort the length of doodles
is<00:04:06.919> 44<00:04:07.819> inches<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.599> we're<00:04:08.750> gonna<00:04:08.840> write<00:04:09.109> that

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
is 44 inches so we're gonna write that

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.349 
is 44 inches so we're gonna write that
down<00:04:09.439> all<00:04:10.400> right<00:04:10.669> so<00:04:10.849> we're<00:04:10.970> gonna<00:04:11.030> measure

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
down all right so we're gonna measure

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.689 
down all right so we're gonna measure
for<00:04:11.629> the<00:04:11.689> headstall<00:04:12.229> and<00:04:12.620> how<00:04:12.769> we<00:04:12.829> do<00:04:13.129> that<00:04:13.159> is

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:13.699 
for the headstall and how we do that is

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.520 
for the headstall and how we do that is
you<00:04:14.000> gently<00:04:14.419> put<00:04:14.629> it<00:04:14.659> over<00:04:14.900> their<00:04:15.049> head<00:04:15.079> and

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
you're gonna measure it from the corner

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.270 
you're gonna measure it from the corner
of<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.539> mouth<00:04:17.840> side<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.530> his<00:04:18.650> mouth<00:04:18.889> over

to switch to this equine tape and we're

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.670 
to switch to this equine tape and we're
going<00:05:07.729> to<00:05:07.759> measure<00:05:07.940> how<00:05:08.360> tall<00:05:08.719> doodles<00:05:09.169> is<00:05:09.380> and
