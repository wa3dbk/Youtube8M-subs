00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.170
 and 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.630
 words accompanied me so much the matter 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.060
 that is a matter of rhyming and not putting 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.490
 point and end and not lose track I'll 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.919
 stumbling and I have not been for a long time 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.740
 I stop to breathe and to think that perhaps 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.380
 this is not so bad and that if I put on 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.090
 I go back to raise the world I do not know 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.489
 it falls short in my dreams 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.149
 while I remain the owner of 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.790
 compass the one that is part of my path to 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.070
 those who forgetfulness time with it 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.410
 I'm only friend that tells you the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.720
 truths the micro if the rhythm are my 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.120
 legs of rap parents welcomed me 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.130
 in your breast to cut age is so true 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.770
 as the expert does not usually dress with 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.020
 costume and the true message do not inhabit 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.840
 postcards only on the portals are 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.000
 even numbers such is the shit that you 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.910
 release this child that when I observe your 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.799
 model just smiled and I stop to 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.770
 think that even the shit wants 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.680
 baltasar work makes more sense 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.590
 the ability is not to give up and 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.590
 quality lives in superlatives 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.570
 dictates so many beats that I no longer 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.479
 I measure the time in seconds but without 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.359
 sounds and every time I blow it apparently 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.689
 my coconut goes crazy at nightfall 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:31.090
 drinking can no longer cleanse my soul my 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.670
 Calm is about to pale 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.429
 and every time my head in a line 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.069
 trace is to draw with certainty the 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.590
 sick stress I find myself at the same time 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.500
 terminal but the rhymes that I loose 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.689
 they have no rival my poetry became 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.659
 in a non-stop and as the time 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.239
 happens the end comes perhaps my notebook 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.979
 be my hospital or become a 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.979
 addictive drug which crystal 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.020
