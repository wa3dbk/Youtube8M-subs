00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:08.740
 the lucia stove stopped 7 years ago lands of countries of institutes worlds where the 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.160
 people spend and two women of the day for wood 5 cents a day for the 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.859
 food this because they do it 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.370
 with very low systemic efficiency 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.800
 you decide to use two dollars a day for cooking, do it with two to twenty 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.300
 cents a day 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.409
 it's a noticeable improvement not only environmentally 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.980
 but also economically because the rotating one you have left allows you to 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.840
 send for children to school in more woooow I find that in the year 600 ranks 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.070
 domestic consumption the number four case of death in the world 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.830
 the number two sectors of creation men are one, 6 billion 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.190
 people in the world who still cook this way is a system that instead of 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.010
 burn the usual stuff 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 hotel mainly normally the open fires I have to use legnano 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.530
 red 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.530
 not just before all the wood that is usually thrown away comment 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.830
 the holes that is the one that has little commercial value 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.870
 they peel them turn it into burning it but turn it into that home 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.060
 gas raccoon 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.650
 edilsitus is called iced hi can be used 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.850
 improve the terrain to combat desertification 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.320
 it's more important than 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.400
 pies neutral with the wind that is sequestrates + cv 2t what produces the dies 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.790
 avenue should be a collective 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.090
 farmers 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.920
 who now have to pay from 30 to 70 euros per ton to dispose of waste 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.750
 we don't hear any more plants burning them, we only use the shots they are 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.300
 more than enough 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.650
 a distribution group that strongly rejects these must be eliminated 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.830
 agricultural 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.400
 to people who need heating or for small communities 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.530
 how the mountain communities do telematic heating 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.150
 all heat to very low pollution the god has produced us comes 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.950
 taken up by another group that looks then arrives establishes to all 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.699
 farmers who supplied the raw materials 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:24.909
 and next year they have a product quantity improvement 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.539
 thanks to the improvement of the terrain for the addition of the traveler 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.039
 Friday organic club 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.699
 I accepted the invitation to speak today 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:42.769
 because I saw for the first time the possibility of the complete supply chain 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.489
 this group has farmers but the hight school turin boilers producers i 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.369
 Lecce dive researchers would be fantastic fair 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:58.959
 communicate together states union and also an example carried out in the world 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.469
 that a community 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.059
 who works together devours me the whole world
