kind of thing and you honestly could do

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.070 
kind of thing and you honestly could do
that<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.030> it's<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.539> cool<00:01:56.690> part<00:01:56.929> of<00:01:57.020> the

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
that so it's the cool part of the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.410 
that so it's the cool part of the
vehicle<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.470> by<00:01:57.619> having<00:01:58.009> that<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:58.490> anyway<00:01:59.210> like

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
vehicle is by having that so anyway like

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.820 
vehicle is by having that so anyway like
I<00:01:59.450> said<00:01:59.539> I<00:01:59.720> just<00:01:59.810> wanted<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.229> basically<00:02:00.410> show

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
I said I just wanted to basically show

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.950 
I said I just wanted to basically show
you<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.039> color<00:02:01.280> because<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:02.300> hadn't<00:02:02.570> seen<00:02:02.780> it

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
you the color because you hadn't seen it

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.180 
you the color because you hadn't seen it
and<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:03.259> is<00:02:03.350> what<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.590> looks<00:02:03.740> like<00:02:03.800> in<00:02:04.070> the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
and this is what it looks like in the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.669 
and this is what it looks like in the
asshole<00:02:04.310> SL<00:02:04.940> premium<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:05.659> again<00:02:05.899> these<00:02:06.470> will

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
asshole SL premium so again these will

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.290 
asshole SL premium so again these will
only<00:02:06.800> be<00:02:07.039> until<00:02:07.369> this<00:02:07.460> production<00:02:07.789> runs<00:02:08.090> out

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
only be until this production runs out

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.850 
only be until this production runs out
and<00:02:08.539> then<00:02:08.660> will<00:02:08.840> no<00:02:08.989> longer<00:02:09.200> see<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.649> package

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
and then will no longer see this package

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.590 
and then will no longer see this package
so<00:02:10.220> this<00:02:10.340> would<00:02:10.489> be<00:02:10.640> exactly<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.090> same<00:02:11.209> one<00:02:11.480> I

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
so this would be exactly the same one I

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.690 
so this would be exactly the same one I
have<00:02:11.870> only<00:02:12.080> just<00:02:12.290> in<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.530> different<00:02:12.650> color<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.640> I

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
have only just in a different color so I

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.680
