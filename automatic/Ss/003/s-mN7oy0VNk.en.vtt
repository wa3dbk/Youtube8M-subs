00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.449
 Pilates teacher in the middle in the oven 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.580
 from Milan 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.279
 today I will teach you the exercises for 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.170
 be more sexy on high heels nobody 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.570
 of us can do without high heels 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.640
 because I'm sexy and elegant walking 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.609
 but we all know it's a lot 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.770
 hard to walk on high heels e 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.470
 above all they can procure 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.390
 foot problems of pains and pains 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.940
 tips that plantar arch than to 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.000
 heel and for this we will do three exercises 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.640
 that will help us manage both the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.469
 walk that the pains that can 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.050
 procure the first exercise e 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.850
 represents a taste of the plant of the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.510
 foot then to reactivate the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.149
 circulation to make it a contraction 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.969
 of the foot of the plant of nerves 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.610
 we position ourselves with our fingers and heel 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.889
 then stand with your feet on it 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.740
 width of the hips and let's start ad 

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:10.869
 swing slightly feeling the weight 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.319
 in our body on the whole plant of 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.289
 foot 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:16.929
 after that we take a ball like 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.569
 this if you want or like this one here 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.340
 it has slightly higher spikes 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:24.399
 or a simple tennis ball 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.420
 slightly deflated and we position it 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:31.270
 under the toes of the right foot 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.590
 and we start to breathe and feel good 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.169
 the weight on both feet well 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.049
 centered and breathe five times 

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:44.020
 after that we move the ball below 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.239
 the arch of the foot and we continue again to 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.310
 breathe five times 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.169
 regardless of the fact that maybe under the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.079
 sole of the foot does a little bit more harm 

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:53.529
 because the nerves are closer to the 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.409
 skin 

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:59.409
 after that we move the ball below 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.509
 the place heel we got to do well 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.550
 with the weight of the body on all the feet 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.640
 is 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.920
 we breathe this done five times 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.500
 we move the ball and bring it back 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.790
 in front of the foot and start a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.400
 massage all the foot passing two 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.000
 or three times on each side and also on the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.950
 center 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.990
 at this point repeat everything 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.820
 exercise with the left foot 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.590
 the second exercise is targeted 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.900
 strengthening of the toes and 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.150
 of the ankle 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.710
 take an elastic band like 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.150
 this if you have it at home or 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.710
 just a towel and it 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.110
 roll up so it helps you more there 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.350
 we sit on the floor with our legs 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.300
 stretch and position the towel 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.340
 around the right foot 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.920
 exactly around the tip of the foot 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.740
 after this and inspiring we lengthen the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.440
 toe and inhaling it 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.330
 we return to the normal position 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.610
 exhaling we bend the knee and 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.940
 we bring the tip of the foot towards us 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.400
 and after that we put the length up 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.310
 toe and bring the tip back 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.930
 of the dog in the normal position e 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.959
 we resume the exercise five times 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.420
 always on the same foot done on 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.790
 right foot let's repeat all 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.620
 the five repetitions on the left foot 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.360
 the third financial year instead aims at 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.730
 strengthen the back muscles 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.959
 the musculature of the knees la 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.970
 ankle musculature 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.160
 let's take the ball back there 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.530
 served for the first exercise and the 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.600
 we position standing at 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.850
 ankles then your own vehicle at 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.980
 ankles inhaling screams a little 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.620

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.390
 shooting on only the affinity of the feet 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.600
 exhaling for a long time the knees and me 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.340
