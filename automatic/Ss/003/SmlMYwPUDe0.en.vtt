these machines okay so we're going to
start<00:00:32.910> out<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.570> top<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> machine<00:00:34.590> on

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
start out with the top of the machine on

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.750

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
compartment and if you can see over here

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.959 
compartment and if you can see over here
this<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:43.020> where<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.010> put<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> beans<00:00:44.520> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
this is just where you put the beans it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.830 
this is just where you put the beans it
has<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> burr<00:00:45.989> grinder<00:00:46.020> inside<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:48.329> grinds

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
has a burr grinder inside that grinds

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.100 
has a burr grinder inside that grinds
unevenly<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.820> it<00:00:50.820> grinds<00:00:51.239> per<00:00:51.539> cup<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.960> you're

unevenly and it grinds per cup so you're

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.510

getting the absolute freshest cup you
could<00:00:53.670> possibly<00:00:54.059> have

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
could possibly have

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
can get such features as the time of day

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.260 
can get such features as the time of day
when<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> turns<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.409> off<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:42.030> water

hardness<00:01:42.710> which<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.860> have<00:01:44.040> set<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.970> because

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
hardness which I have set to one because

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.389 
hardness which I have set to one because
I<00:01:45.479> use<00:01:45.659> distilled<00:01:46.140> water<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.189> use

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
I use distilled water if you use

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.920 
I use distilled water if you use
distilled<00:01:47.759> water<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.210> these<00:01:48.360> types<00:01:48.810> of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
distilled water in these types of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990 
distilled water in these types of
machines<00:01:49.220> they'll<00:01:50.220> last<00:01:50.430> longer<00:01:50.579> because

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
machines they'll last longer because

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.690 
machines they'll last longer because
there<00:01:51.329> won't<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.570> any<00:01:52.790> calcification<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.510 
there won't be any calcification and
just<00:01:56.700> better<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.240> life<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> machine

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
just better for the life of the machine

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.719 
just better for the life of the machine

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
could there's a switch up here you could

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
could there's a switch up here you could
decide<00:04:25.780> whether<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.200> want

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800

latte<00:04:27.129> or<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.610> cappuccino<00:04:29.190> there<00:04:30.190> we<00:04:30.400> go<00:04:30.550> I've

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
latte or a cappuccino there we go I've

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.330 
latte or a cappuccino there we go I've
selected<00:04:31.240> cappuccino<00:04:32.080> because<00:04:32.319> I<00:04:32.800> like<00:04:33.099> the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
selected cappuccino because I like the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.210 
selected cappuccino because I like the
froth<00:04:34.150> better<00:04:34.449> and<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:35.500> actually<00:04:35.860> comes<00:04:36.069> up

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
froth better and it actually comes up

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.010 
froth better and it actually comes up
hotter<00:04:36.520> for<00:04:36.849> some<00:04:37.000> reason<00:04:37.300> than<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.599> than<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
hotter for some reason than the than the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.059 
hotter for some reason than the than the
latte<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:39.400> that's<00:04:39.639> definitely<00:04:39.849> something<00:04:40.180> to

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
latte so that's definitely something to

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.219 
latte so that's definitely something to
note<00:04:42.120> moving<00:04:43.120> along<00:04:43.360> I'm<00:04:43.690> going<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.020> show<00:04:44.169> you

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
note moving along I'm going to show you

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:53.640 
note moving along I'm going to show you
the<00:04:44.409> drip<00:04:44.889> tray<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:46.750> pops<00:04:47.080> out<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.990> just

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
the drip tray this pops out and you just

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.909 
the drip tray this pops out and you just
pull<00:04:54.009> it<00:04:54.039> out<00:04:54.159> like<00:04:54.370> this<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:56.289> Machine<00:04:56.620> slides

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
pull it out like this the Machine slides

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:05.490 
pull it out like this the Machine slides
open<00:04:57.400> um<00:04:59.909> and<00:05:00.909> this<00:05:01.419> metal<00:05:01.870> thing<00:05:02.199> pops<00:05:02.469> off<00:05:04.500> so

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
open um and this metal thing pops off so

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.379 
open um and this metal thing pops off so
this<00:05:06.069> is<00:05:06.129> the<00:05:06.430> drip<00:05:06.639> tray<00:05:06.759> here<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.300> the

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
this is the drip tray here and the

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.730 
this is the drip tray here and the
inside<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.900> machine<00:05:08.169> as<00:05:08.289> well

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.219 

interesting<00:05:11.740> note<00:05:12.159> is<00:05:12.310> when<00:05:13.000> when<00:05:13.780> this<00:05:13.960> fills

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
interesting note is when when this fills

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.339 
interesting note is when when this fills
up<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.830> raht<00:05:15.039> water<00:05:15.250> reservoir<00:05:16.110> this<00:05:17.110> will

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
up the raht water reservoir this will

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.330 
up the raht water reservoir this will
float<00:05:17.650> telling<00:05:18.129> you<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:18.400> need<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:20.219> empty<00:05:21.219> the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
float telling you you need to empty the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.490 
float telling you you need to empty the
drip<00:05:21.460> tray<00:05:23.069> over<00:05:24.069> here<00:05:24.569> this<00:05:25.569> is<00:05:25.629> what<00:05:26.379> the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
drip tray over here this is what the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.010 
drip tray over here this is what the
coffee<00:05:26.710> looks<00:05:27.039> like<00:05:27.250> when<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:28.020> machine's

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
coffee looks like when the machine's

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.980 
coffee looks like when the machine's
done<00:05:29.349> grinding<00:05:30.159> the<00:05:30.250> beans<00:05:30.280> and<00:05:30.990> essentially

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
done grinding the beans and essentially

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.659 
done grinding the beans and essentially
this<00:05:32.110> is<00:05:32.169> just<00:05:32.469> garbage<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:33.069> you<00:05:33.159> throw<00:05:33.550> this

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
this is just garbage and you throw this

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.730 
this is just garbage and you throw this
out<00:05:33.849> and<00:05:34.029> maybe<00:05:34.150> clean<00:05:35.050> clean<00:05:35.469> off<00:05:35.590> the

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
out and maybe clean clean off the

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:51.570 
out and maybe clean clean off the
plastic<00:05:37.770> put<00:05:38.770> it<00:05:38.889> back<00:05:39.039> in<00:05:50.340> and<00:05:51.340> it<00:05:51.430> just

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
plastic put it back in and it just

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.869 
plastic put it back in and it just
slides<00:05:51.759> in<00:05:52.000> like<00:05:52.150> that<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:54.340> door<00:05:54.550> closes<00:05:55.440> and

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879 
slides in like that the door closes and

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.120 
slides in like that the door closes and
you're<00:05:57.879> good
