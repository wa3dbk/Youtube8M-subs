 Hello, Hello, I am Kevin. 

00:00:04.613 --> 00:00:06.185
 Welcome to Tech a Look 

00:00:06.185 --> 00:00:09.495
 Today, Kevin wants to introduce the motherboard that ASRock launched. 

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:12.986
 Its model is FM2A75M-ITX 

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:14.656
 And we can see it? 

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:21.968
 As the name suggests, FM2 means that it supports AMD's CPU pin is FM2. 

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:25.204
 Then, it has built-in A75 chipset 

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:27.828
 Finally, ITX refers to the size of this motherboard. 

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.746
 Is the size of the Mini-ITX喔

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:36.250
 OK, then let's introduce this motherboard more advanced now! 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.041
 Then Kevin opened the package. 

00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:44.480

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:10.649
 And the fastest can achieve a transmission speed of 6GB per second喔

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:18.880
 Ok, the next step is the IO baffle of the product. 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.560
 Finally, what we can see is ASROCK. 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.394

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:26.992
 Then, Kevin is more advanced to introduce this motherboard. 

00:01:26.992 --> 00:01:28.096
 Ok, what we are seeing now is 

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:32.227

00:01:32.227 --> 00:01:35.582
 Its size is the size of the Mini-ITX 

00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:39.375
 So, about 17 cm by 17 cm. 

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.204
 Ok, we can see the white place in the middle. 

00:01:41.204 --> 00:01:44.285
 Is the place where the CPU central processor is installed啰

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:50.427
 Support for AMD's central processor pin is FM2 

00:01:50.427 --> 00:01:54.457
 In terms of system memory, support for DDR3 1866 

00:01:54.457 --> 00:01:56.562
 If you turn on overclocking mode? 

00:01:56.562 --> 00:02:00.592
 Supports up to DDR3 2600 

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:03.795
 In terms of hard disk storage, we can see four gray places. 

00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:06.809
 Is where you installed your hard drive 

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:09.843

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.785
 Finally, we can see below. 

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.623
 Where is the PCIe interface card? 

00:02:19.623 --> 00:02:24.047
 Support for PCIe 2.0 16x speed 

00:02:24.047 --> 00:02:26.527
 Then, Kevin, let me introduce it to you. 

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:30.446
 The part of the input and output behind the IO 

00:02:30.446 --> 00:02:34.617
 Ok, now Kevin introduces you to the part of the motherboard IO port. 

00:02:34.617 --> 00:02:37.828
 The first thing we can see is the PS2 connection hole. 

00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:39.852
