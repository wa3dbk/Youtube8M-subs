laptop and flip it back basically the
procedure<00:00:58.359> is<00:00:58.809> pretty<00:00:59.050> simple<00:00:59.559> there<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:00.219> this

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369 
procedure is pretty simple there is this

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:02.459 
procedure is pretty simple there is this
one<00:01:00.610> score<00:01:00.940> here<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:01.600> other<00:01:01.780> screw<00:01:02.079> over<00:01:02.229> here

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
one score here and other screw over here

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.060 
one score here and other screw over here
which<00:01:02.949> needs<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.309> be<00:01:03.430> removed<00:01:03.670> after<00:01:03.879> which

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
you can remove the LED screen so we will

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.600 
you can remove the LED screen so we will
just<00:01:09.880> take<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.689> -<00:01:11.259> screwdriver<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.340> remove<00:01:12.369> the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
rudders that are there over here just

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:25.020 
rudders that are there over here just
very<00:01:15.819> slowly<00:01:16.659> remove<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.200> rudders<00:01:23.940> keep<00:01:24.940> it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:07.410 

he<00:01:56.020> starts<00:01:56.650> very<00:01:57.100> slowly<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.880> coming<00:02:07.270> out

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
he starts very slowly but coming out

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.270 
he starts very slowly but coming out
then<00:02:07.660> you<00:02:07.720> get<00:02:07.870> cracking<00:02:08.320> sound<00:02:08.649> with<00:02:08.950> every

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
then you get cracking sound with every

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.449 
then you get cracking sound with every
time<00:02:09.490> you<00:02:09.670> do<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.410> that's<00:02:11.890> absolutely<00:02:12.160> fine

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.570 

there<00:02:18.459> are<00:02:18.490> magnets<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.390> there<00:02:20.050> will<00:02:20.110> be

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
there are magnets so there will be

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.949 
there are magnets so there will be
always<00:02:21.580> trying<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.830> attract<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:25.209> metal<00:02:25.510> part

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
always trying to attract the metal part

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.280 
always trying to attract the metal part
over<00:02:26.230> here<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:26.800> one<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.459> one<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.290> keep

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
over here this one and this one so keep

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.000 
over here this one and this one so keep
this<00:02:29.470> thing<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.770> say<00:02:31.650> then<00:02:32.650> there<00:02:32.800> are<00:02:32.890> these

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
this thing I say then there are these

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.540 
this thing I say then there are these
four<00:02:33.280> screws<00:02:33.580> one<00:02:33.910> two<00:02:34.709> three<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.920> four<00:02:36.220> each

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
four screws one two three and four each

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.360 
four screws one two three and four each
you<00:02:36.700> have<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.970> remove

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.580 

until<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:45.489> done<00:02:48.269> back<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.540> also<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:50.319> follow

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
until it's done back and also to follow

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.160 
until it's done back and also to follow
and<00:02:52.200> immediately

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.820 

exposed

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
exposed

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.160 
exposed

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
so you can see the VGA cable over here

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.380 
so you can see the VGA cable over here
connecting<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.040> LED<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:05.120> need<00:03:05.270> to

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
connecting to the LED just need to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:14.710 
connecting to the LED just need to
remove<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.860> series<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.340> good<00:03:13.580> our<00:03:13.720> LED

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
remove that the series is good our LED

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.140 
remove that the series is good our LED
screen<00:03:15.140> even<00:03:15.740> there<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.160> glue<00:03:16.400> over<00:03:16.610> here<00:03:16.880> so

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
screen even there is a glue over here so

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:27.010 
screen even there is a glue over here so

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
very gently try to the level then it

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.090 
very gently try to the level then it
comes<00:03:27.260> out<00:03:28.270> now<00:03:29.270> I<00:03:29.300> need<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.570> remove<00:03:29.780> the
