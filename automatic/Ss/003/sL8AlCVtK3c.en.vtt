00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
know our yeast is really getting

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.389 
know our yeast is really getting
hydrated<00:01:01.930> it's<00:01:02.170> active<00:01:02.649> it's<00:01:02.920> ready<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.280> add

to<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.790> bread<00:01:04.030> okay<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.170> next<00:01:05.379> step<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.280> go

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
to the bread okay the next step is to go

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.260 
to the bread okay the next step is to go
ahead<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:06.729> mix<00:01:06.850> our<00:01:07.000> dry<00:01:07.060> ingredients

so for dry ingredients we or I've
already<00:01:10.869> used<00:01:10.899> our<00:01:11.170> sugar<00:01:11.409> so<00:01:11.649> we<00:01:11.679> can<00:01:11.829> put

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
already used our sugar so we can put

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.789 
already used our sugar so we can put
that<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.249> the<00:01:12.310> side<00:01:13.259> we<00:01:14.259> have<00:01:14.289> a<00:01:14.439> little<00:01:14.649> bit<00:01:14.770> of

three-quarters<00:01:50.950> of<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.219> teaspoon<00:01:51.429> of<00:01:51.939> salt<00:01:51.999> and

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.959 
three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and
if<00:01:53.439> you<00:01:53.619> go<00:01:53.740> over<00:01:54.039> that<00:01:54.069> everyone's<00:01:54.759> gonna

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
if you go over that everyone's gonna

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.010 
if you go over that everyone's gonna
know<00:01:55.060> cuz<00:01:55.479> it's<00:01:55.630> gonna<00:01:55.749> be<00:01:55.959> really<00:01:56.499> salty<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
know cuz it's gonna be really salty and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.309 
know cuz it's gonna be really salty and
finally<00:01:59.499> the<00:01:59.649> last<00:01:59.829> step<00:02:00.249> here<00:02:00.549> is<00:02:00.579> to<00:02:01.109> put<00:02:02.109> in

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
finally the last step here is to put in

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.809 
finally the last step here is to put in
shave<00:02:02.739> off<00:02:02.979> some<00:02:03.009> of<00:02:03.399> this<00:02:03.729> dried<00:02:04.090> garlic<00:02:04.450> and

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
shave off some of this dried garlic and

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.830 
shave off some of this dried garlic and
yeah<00:02:06.819> I'm<00:02:06.909> just<00:02:07.029> gonna<00:02:07.179> shave<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.509> up<00:02:07.689> I'm

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
yeah I'm just gonna shave it up I'm

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.440 
yeah I'm just gonna shave it up I'm
gonna<00:02:07.959> use<00:02:08.110> about<00:02:08.140> two<00:02:09.060> tablespoons<00:02:10.060> and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
gonna use about two tablespoons and

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.640 
gonna use about two tablespoons and
actually<00:02:10.750> it's<00:02:10.869> dried<00:02:11.080> onion<00:02:13.320> I'm<00:02:14.320> at<00:02:14.470> the

actually it's dried onion I'm at the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.750 
actually it's dried onion I'm at the
Cuisinart<00:02:15.280> here<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.960> I

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
Cuisinart here and I

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.940 
Cuisinart here and I
the<00:02:19.390> top<00:02:19.600> open<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.440> can<00:02:20.620> go<00:02:20.740> ahead<00:02:20.770> and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
the top open so that I can go ahead and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.850 
the top open so that I can go ahead and
mix<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.670> our<00:02:21.880> now<00:02:22.690> foaming<00:02:23.260> yeast<00:02:23.740> sugar

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
mix in our now foaming yeast sugar

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.280 
mix in our now foaming yeast sugar
mixture<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:25.270> I'm<00:02:25.630> gonna<00:02:25.810> go<00:02:25.960> ahead<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.200> give

mixture and I'm gonna go ahead and give

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.780 
mixture and I'm gonna go ahead and give
it<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.440> little<00:02:26.590> swish<00:02:26.920> at<00:02:27.070> this<00:02:27.250> point<00:02:27.610> just

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
it a little swish at this point just

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.660 
it a little swish at this point just
because<00:02:28.000> I'm<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.300> about<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.600> pitch<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.080> I

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
because I'm just about to pitch it I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.770 
because I'm just about to pitch it I
want<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.760> grab<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.000> all<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.390> not<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:31.510> have

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
want to grab it all and not just have

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.050 
want to grab it all and not just have
any<00:02:31.930> stuck<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> sides<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:32.980> bottom<00:02:33.100> so

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
any stuck to the sides and bottom so

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.030 
any stuck to the sides and bottom so
let's<00:02:34.300> go<00:02:34.480> ahead<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:38.410> was<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.560> few<00:02:38.830> pulses

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
let's go ahead and that was a few pulses

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:55.290 
let's go ahead and that was a few pulses
just<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.610> mix<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.910> up

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.570 

okay<00:02:55.960> finally<00:02:56.530> there's<00:02:56.740> one<00:02:56.800> last<00:02:57.220> ingredient

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
okay finally there's one last ingredient

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.300 
okay finally there's one last ingredient
it's<00:02:58.210> just<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.690> little<00:02:59.290> bit<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.470> olive<00:02:59.620> oil<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.250> I

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
it's just a little bit of olive oil so I

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.770 
it's just a little bit of olive oil so I
like<00:03:00.460> to<00:03:00.490> do<00:03:00.610> about<00:03:00.820> two<00:03:00.970> tablespoons<00:03:01.330> I

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
like to do about two tablespoons I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.730 
like to do about two tablespoons I
usually<00:03:02.050> don't<00:03:02.140> measure<00:03:02.350> it<00:03:02.530> because<00:03:02.680> it

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
usually don't measure it because it

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.110 
usually don't measure it because it
makes<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.980> mess<00:03:03.130> everything<00:03:03.460> but<00:03:03.880> so<00:03:04.060> that

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
makes it mess everything but so that

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.850 
makes it mess everything but so that
ball<00:03:04.450> texture<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:04.990> what<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.140> like<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.500> see<00:03:05.680> where

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
ball texture is what I like to see where

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.290 
ball texture is what I like to see where
it<00:03:05.950> all<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:06.280> comes<00:03:06.520> together<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.090> big

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
it all just comes together in one big

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.690 
it all just comes together in one big
ball<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:08.350> let's<00:03:08.800> go<00:03:08.950> ahead<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.280> throw<00:03:09.400> this

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
ball so let's go ahead and throw this

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.700 
ball so let's go ahead and throw this
into<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.270> fermentation<00:03:10.510> chamber<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.590> we'll

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
into the fermentation chamber and we'll

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.550 
into the fermentation chamber and we'll
come<00:03:11.950> back<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.810> about<00:03:13.810> an<00:03:13.990> hour

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
come back in about an hour

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.920 
come back in about an hour
and<00:03:14.710> letting<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.070> just<00:03:15.100> rise<00:03:15.630> here<00:03:16.630> we<00:03:16.720> are<00:03:16.750> at

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
and letting it just rise here we are at

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.420 
and letting it just rise here we are at
the<00:03:17.020> fermentation<00:03:17.620> chamber<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:18.100> can<00:03:18.250> see

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
the fermentation chamber you can see

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.940 
the fermentation chamber you can see
this<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:18.790> just<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:19.090> light<00:03:19.330> bulb<00:03:19.630> in<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.320> box<00:03:20.590> and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
this is just a light bulb in a box and

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.400 
this is just a light bulb in a box and
this<00:03:21.010> box<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.520> an<00:03:21.640> insulated<00:03:22.330> box<00:03:23.050> because<00:03:23.350> it

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
this box is an insulated box because it

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.040 
this box is an insulated box because it
used<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.590> be<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.740> wine<00:03:24.670> fridge<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.780> just

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
used to be a wine fridge so I just

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.900 
used to be a wine fridge so I just
ripped<00:03:26.620> off<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:26.800> old<00:03:27.160> electronics<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:27.790> put<00:03:27.880> a

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
ripped off the old electronics and put a

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.850 
ripped off the old electronics and put a
light<00:03:28.060> bulb<00:03:28.210> on<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.450> back<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.230> put<00:03:29.590> my<00:03:29.620> own

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
light bulb on the back and put my own

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.760 
light bulb on the back and put my own
little<00:03:30.790> controller<00:03:31.360> in<00:03:31.690> here<00:03:32.110> where<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.590> set

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
little controller in here where I set

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.250 
little controller in here where I set
the<00:03:32.890> temp<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.220> 88<00:03:33.580> degrees<00:03:33.940> so<00:03:34.780> it's<00:03:34.990> a<00:03:35.080> nice

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
the temp to 88 degrees so it's a nice

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.770 
the temp to 88 degrees so it's a nice
rise<00:03:35.830> temperature<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:38.140> put<00:03:38.980> our<00:03:39.130> whole

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
rise temperature so put our whole

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.880 
rise temperature so put our whole
Cuisinart<00:03:40.780> thing<00:03:40.990> in<00:03:41.080> here<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.260> we<00:03:41.530> will<00:03:41.620> come

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
Cuisinart thing in here and we will come

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.720 
Cuisinart thing in here and we will come
back<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.720> one<00:03:43.720> hour<00:03:44.050> after<00:03:44.590> this<00:03:45.100> has<00:03:45.280> been

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
back in one hour after this has been

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:53.010 
back in one hour after this has been
rising<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.440> can<00:03:47.560> see<00:03:47.740> better<00:03:51.780> okay<00:03:52.780> we're

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
rising so you can see better okay we're

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.270 
rising so you can see better okay we're
back<00:03:53.200> it's<00:03:53.440> been<00:03:53.620> an<00:03:53.740> hour

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
back it's been an hour

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.660 
back it's been an hour
look<00:03:54.760> at<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.030> rise<00:03:55.860> we<00:03:56.860> got<00:03:57.040> quite<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.370> bit<00:03:57.490> of

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
look at that rise we got quite a bit of

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.910 
look at that rise we got quite a bit of
air<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.930> dough<00:03:59.110> which<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.380> great<00:03:59.620> so

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
air in that dough which is great so
