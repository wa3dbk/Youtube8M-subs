 whom you already know since he is mine 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.620
 nutritionist 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.780
 Well, let's go in one of the previous ones 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.649
 video you met powerlifters 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.329
 trevor he is our nutritionist he makes 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.270
 nutrition program for me and the whole 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.220
 team farm butter trevor estimates 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.390
 how many calories I spend on training and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.640
 look how much i consume with food i 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.720
 I will tell you that it is very important that a nutritionist 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.530
 knew about the sport that you do 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.810
 since the trailer is engaged 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.980
 powerlifting his workout in many ways 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.990
 similar to our workouts so 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.370
 driver understands how much energy is needed 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.600
 in order to lift one or another weight 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:37.300
 including overhead on 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.250
 a certain number of reps on 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.080
 based on these calculations he understands 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.180
 how many calories i spend on training in 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.470
 general tass there is a burger for me a problem 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.450
 i can't eat 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.030
 both a burger i don't need much 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.530
 bread and incomprehensible sauces I need 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.520
 healthy burger from the right 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.750
 ingredients i have to make it myself 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.850
 so for me it's not easy 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.940
 but on the other hand it allows me 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.830
 look good i'm not trying to waste 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.970
 I do not drink carbonated drinks 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.770
 I drink water 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.970
 and practically do not drink juice and do not eat sugar 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.310
 bodybuilder challenge look 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.070
 in a certain way and therefore for them 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.630
 for example, diet is more important than us 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.280
 it is necessary just to hold on 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.030
 within the weight category I do not 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.220
 bodybuilder 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.780
 I can not keep a diet like this 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.830
 Bodybuilders make them exhausting 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.740
 yourself a carbohydrate-free diet 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.050
 but we can't I need energy for 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.700
 order to have explosive power so i 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.650
 could perform these movements of us 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.280
 low carb diet is very difficult 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.620
 make us more worried about what 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.650
 show scales with what we see in 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.650
 the mirror 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.690
 As for my eating habits is 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.540
 i basically eat about the same thing i 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.740
 never ate a bad meal i stood 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:16.610
 a lot of good principle is the same 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:21.020
 bad as there is bad because in this 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.580
 case, you also gain weight and me 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.750
 like the way I look now yes 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.750
 definitely like 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.560
 which is remarkable with my new so 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.410
 tell my lifestyle my energy level 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.300
 not diminished 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.580
 I just redistributed the time when 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.220
 I eat carbohydrates now I have carbohydrates 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.970
 workout and after workout I like 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.800
 wrapping my workout with carbohydrates 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.740
 which first gives me energy and and then 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.950
 makes up and despite the fact that I used to 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.780
 ate more now i feel in 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.080
 training time is much better for me 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.060
 more energy is because my 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.060
 carbohydrates are distributed around the workout 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.560
 my food consists of 5 meals in 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.660
 day I take supplements like 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.910
 vegetable powder for example for breakfast i 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.609
 I make coffee I add vegetable to it 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.040
 powder and peanut butter as source 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.380
 then mix fat and drink on the way 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.030
 to work in general, I drink coffee every morning 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.380
 But we must remember that coffee is 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.050
 short first you get 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.810
 kick and then collapse so basically 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.630
 all that contains caffeine c i get 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.640
 before work I train 1 clients and then in 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.540
 ten o'clock i have my first meal in 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.270
 which is protein 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.530
 vegetables and carbohydrates give them i train and 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.690
 as I said in one of the previous ones 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.280
 video i drink a special cocktail in 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.050
 training time which consists of 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.600
 small amount of carbohydrates 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.950
 some glutamine creatine and 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.540
 beta alanine 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.240
 and something else I donâ€™t remember now 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.930
 the day when I have training I twice 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.330
 im food and everything else cocktails 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.640
 when i finish all the workouts it 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.770
 somewhere around 6 and 7 o'clock 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.280
 whichever I finish at 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.380
 me dinner 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.780
 which has will make protein vegetables and 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.340
 carbohydrates and before bed I drink casein 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.020
 it's a protein that's slow 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.879
 digested 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.129
 even now sleep around 11 o'clock 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:31.680
 because i need to trace to 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.680
 all cleaned shut the hall and so on 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.300
 sports supplements plays an important role in 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.430
 my life since i don't have time 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.259
 to cook for five receptions 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.629
 food so i have to use 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.940
 many supplements to support your 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:53.080

 I know that I would see the case without them 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.210
 throughout the workout I sing my 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.699
 cocktail 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.090
 I do this every time I feel 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:05.620

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.969
 diet
