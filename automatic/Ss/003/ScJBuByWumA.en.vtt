 that you see that you cook well 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.050
 here we have already chopped the bacon in 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.710
 squares more or less than 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:12.250
 2 centimeters and we are going to put it 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.100
 that you suffered in your own fat what 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.950
 We put in the non-stick pan to 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.729
 medium low fire here we have already put 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.700
 melt three pieces of butter and 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.119
 while the bacon stopped cold and the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.470
 chicken is cooking let's start 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.230
 stir fry the mushrooms 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.420
 while we are preparing the others 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.420
 ingredients we are going to chop the ham in 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.690
 strips here we already have the mushrooms or 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.910
 fried we were adding them to a vessel 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.210
 big where we're going to mix everything is 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.630
 very chopped and the kitchen and is already scarce 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.430
 fried let's remove the fat 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.060
 and we are adding it here too 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.240
 while the chicken has just been cooked and 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.880
 we discard here already the chicken 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.789
 previously cooked and we disassembled and 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.640
 we add it to the other ingredients 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.130
 here we have the boiling water with 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.920
 oil and salt let's add the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.920
 dancers we have split in half 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.560
 and we are going to leave them cooking 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:40.260
 approximately about 89 minutes or until 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.240
 that are al dente here we have added 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.300
 the chicken broth which we have strained 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.820
 the tomato paste and the cream of milk 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.150
 let's mix it well so that 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.600
 mixture is homogeneous before 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.280
 add it to the other ingredients here 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.700
 to the ingredients that we already have 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.700
 previously 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.990
 cooked let's add the broth 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.800
 with the cream of milk and the pasta 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.350
 tomatoes add 2 cups of broth 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.890
 finally because as is enough 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.920
 amount we will need here what 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.500
 we are going to do is add the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.380
 noodles 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.730
 we already lower them 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.200
 we squeeze them in a piece and the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.690
 immediately do not do it to not 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.690
 lose the starch from the pasta 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.580
 we should not let the pasta soften 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.840
 much of being left al dente ie 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.210
 stay with the center a bit white here 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.010
 the ingredients are already mixed 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.980
 we wish we can add a little more 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.280
 of cream and salt is fine 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.800
 even bacon and ham have salt 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.190
 let's just add a little bit of 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.030
 pepper mix and we are ready 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.300
 to carry the refractory here already 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.370
 we have buttered a refractory and 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.370
 what we are going to do is add there 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.430
 the noodles already mixed with the sauce 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.120
 and the meats 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.610
 already here we have the spaghetti 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.800
 dancers in the refractory we are going to 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.210
 add parmesan cheese that I have 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.820
 half a cup of Parmesan cheese and we've already 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.650
 preheated the oven to 350 degrees 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.990
 centigrade 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.330
 the last thing we do is put them in the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.370
 oven until gratin that is until 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.370
 that this part of sheen is golden 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.020
 because everything is cooked and here we have 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:59.090
 removed the oven dough serve 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.090
 on a plate and is ready to eat
