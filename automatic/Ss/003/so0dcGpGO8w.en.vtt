then I could get some homework done so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.229 
then I could get some homework done so
literally<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> first<00:00:40.829> game<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> hop<00:00:41.430> into<00:00:41.820> this

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
literally the first game I hop into this

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.639 
literally the first game I hop into this
isn't<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> first<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> second

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
isn't the first one this is the second

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.190 
isn't the first one this is the second
one<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> was<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> recording<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.450> was

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
one I was a recording then but it was

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.700 
one I was a recording then but it was
slow<00:00:46.710> mo<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.270> basically<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.079> what<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> was

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
slow mo and basically this is what I was

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.520 
slow mo and basically this is what I was
everything<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.940> moving<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.690> slow<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.320> could

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
everything was moving so slow you could

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.680 
everything was moving so slow you could
spin<00:00:52.980> around<00:00:53.100> relatively<00:00:53.940> at<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> same<00:00:54.329> speed

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
spin around relatively at the same speed

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
spin around relatively at the same speed
but<00:00:55.500> everything<00:00:56.370> else<00:00:56.550> was<00:00:56.640> super<00:00:57.090> slow-mo<00:00:57.480> so

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
but everything else was super slow-mo so

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.959 
but everything else was super slow-mo so
uh<00:00:57.750> oh<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:58.980> what<00:00:59.129> isn't<00:00:59.489> fun<00:00:59.670> about

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
uh oh you know what isn't fun about

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.459 
uh oh you know what isn't fun about
walking<00:01:00.239> around<00:01:00.510> feeling<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.050> you're<00:01:01.320> on

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
walking around feeling like you're on

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.009 
walking around feeling like you're on
the<00:01:01.649> moon<00:01:01.890> again<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.910> no<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.420> isn't<00:01:03.750> moon

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the moon again like no this isn't moon

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.530 
the moon again like no this isn't moon
zombies<00:01:04.470> map<00:01:04.680> pack<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.129> come<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.330> this

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
zombies map pack like come on so this

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
zombies map pack like come on so this
was<00:01:06.689> rather<00:01:06.900> annoying<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.680> literally<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
was rather annoying so literally what it

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.910 
was rather annoying so literally what it
was<00:01:08.610> basically<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.750> wasn't<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> hacking

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
was basically it wasn't really a hacking

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.410 
was basically it wasn't really a hacking
of<00:01:11.070> individual<00:01:11.610> person<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.180> lobby

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
of individual person in one lobby

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.780 
of individual person in one lobby
essentially<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.640> these

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
essentially what it is for all these

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.480 
essentially what it is for all these
people<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.600> understand<00:01:16.340> from<00:01:17.340> what

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
people that don't understand from what

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.789 
people that don't understand from what
I've<00:01:17.640> gathered<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.930> some<00:01:19.530> sort<00:01:19.560> of

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I've gathered here is that some sort of

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
I've gathered here is that some sort of
hack<00:01:20.009> occurred<00:01:20.430> because<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> previous

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
hack occurred because of the previous

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.480 
hack occurred because of the previous
update<00:01:22.020> there<00:01:22.170> must<00:01:22.320> been<00:01:22.439> some<00:01:22.680> security

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
update there must been some security

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
update there must been some security
feature<00:01:24.090> overlooked<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.049> did<00:01:25.229> not

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
feature overlooked that they did not

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
feature overlooked that they did not
mean<00:01:25.650> oh<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:26.159> focus<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> last

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
mean oh really focus on in the last

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.510 
mean oh really focus on in the last
update<00:01:27.509> which<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.290> real<00:01:28.799> prevalent

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
update which is really a real prevalent

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.069 
update which is really a real prevalent
that<00:01:29.610> they're<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.450> pumping<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:30.960> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that they're just pumping out this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.080 
that they're just pumping out this
update<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.590> try<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.890> make<00:01:32.310> us<00:01:32.520> happy<00:01:32.909> with

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
update to try and make us happy with

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.850 
update to try and make us happy with
connection<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.810> issues<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.470> stuff<00:01:34.650> like

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
connection and issues and stuff like

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350 
connection and issues and stuff like
that<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:35.729> they've<00:01:35.880> bumped<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
that and I think they've bumped up the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.880 
that and I think they've bumped up the
strength<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.900> grenades<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.409> shotguns

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
strength of grenades and shotguns

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.120 
strength of grenades and shotguns
finally<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.579> stuff<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.979> this<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
finally and stuff like that but this is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.740 
finally and stuff like that but this is
what<00:01:41.280> happened<00:01:41.640> slow-mo<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.329> somebody<00:01:42.659> took

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
what happened slow-mo so somebody took

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
what happened slow-mo so somebody took
advantage<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.439> super<00:01:43.829> slo-mo<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
advantage of in super slo-mo and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.429 
advantage of in super slo-mo and
basically<00:01:44.729> whenever<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.240> were<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.200> lobby

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
basically whenever you were in the lobby

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.499 
basically whenever you were in the lobby
you<00:01:46.740> became<00:01:47.070> infected<00:01:47.640> quote-unquote<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
you became infected quote-unquote so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.810 
you became infected quote-unquote so
this<00:01:48.659> was<00:01:48.950> spreading<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> common<00:01:50.790> cold

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
this was spreading like the common cold

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.450 
this was spreading like the common cold
