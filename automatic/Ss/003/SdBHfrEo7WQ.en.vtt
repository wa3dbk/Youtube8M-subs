00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.610
 yes we go the game we know that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.490
 it is now the game of games we are 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 must necessarily win tomorrow 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.010
 to reach our minimum goal that we 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 keep the class 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.650
 I guess that's what the club has 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.570
 fans we all deserve the 68 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.039
 we will stay in the second league 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.740
 Here we found peace again 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.360
 Here many conversations led because it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.470
 now, of course, to arrive as well 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.540
 I handle the pressure 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.860
 as in the others but also play 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.150
 Tomorrow is something special 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.250
 we have to be very fast with good ones 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.150
 actions with safe actions with 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.530
 with the first actions that you 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.120
 we'll be able to get the audience's attention 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.360
 our side pull that someone us 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.980
 bear that we put a lot of pressure 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.550
 and life really show that the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.550
 second league are 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.789
 yes we have the doctors and the physis 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.320
 Thanks a lot, he managed that 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.810
 feels better today today has 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.460
 that's the first time it's been practiced 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.900
 is of course also a thing that that 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.040
 That Marius has been around for weeks 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.280
 chosen by and for the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.750
 team for the club there to 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.220
 disposal times say so and 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.960
 That's why he has to go tomorrow 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.220
 again see how little 90 minutes over 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.260
 the stage will not break 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.270
 do 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.890
 yes i'm assuming that it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.140
 Pushing is absolutely what we have now 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.850
 in games like Nuremberg or too 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.970
 Bookings seen as the spark 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.380
 jumped over and thereby the 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.460
 the team was of course because 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.110
 put another hand on it and yes 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.560
 this is our home game and want that 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.560
 we exploit 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.090
 I'm convinced because we're after 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.689
 this whole season with these boys 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.409
 many survived 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.210
 to have 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.189
 and who get this chance now 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.479
 we have to use because of the tsv 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.479
 belongs in the second league
