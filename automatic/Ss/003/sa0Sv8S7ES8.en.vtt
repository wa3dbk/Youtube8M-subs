download link you just download that and
the<00:03:37.860> process<00:03:38.370> will<00:03:38.519> be<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.790> exact<00:03:39.209> same<00:03:39.239> just

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
the process will be the exact same just

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.470 
the process will be the exact same just
input<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.260> same<00:03:40.530> codes<00:03:40.799> into<00:03:41.070> terminal<00:03:42.030> and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
input the same codes into terminal and

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.360 
input the same codes into terminal and
it<00:03:42.900> should<00:03:43.200> definitely<00:03:43.320> work<00:03:43.739> because<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.250> all

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
it should definitely work because it all

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.460 
it should definitely work because it all
works<00:03:44.640> through<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.970> same<00:03:45.150> way<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:46.019> yeah<00:03:46.320> so

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
works through the same way and yeah so

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.500
