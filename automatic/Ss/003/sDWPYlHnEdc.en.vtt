and I'm doing a series of my channel
called<00:00:50.370> training<00:00:50.789> 299<00:00:51.180> string<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.809> if<00:00:51.930> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
called training 299 string so if you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
called training 299 string so if you
want<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> check<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.949> sure<00:00:53.460> my

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
want to check that out I'm sure my

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.610 
want to check that out I'm sure my
channel<00:00:54.570> would<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> description

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
channel would be in the description

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.189 
channel would be in the description
below<00:00:55.739> um<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> reason<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.660> changed<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.170> name

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
below um so the reason I changed my name

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 
below um so the reason I changed my name
is<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.520> has<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.789> some<00:01:00.059> variety

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
is because there has to be some variety

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.039 
is because there has to be some variety
