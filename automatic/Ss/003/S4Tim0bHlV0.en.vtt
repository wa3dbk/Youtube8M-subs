00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
keyboard work we get stuck in our legs

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.020 
keyboard work we get stuck in our legs
from<00:05:18.440> our<00:05:18.620> lack<00:05:18.889> of<00:05:18.919> range<00:05:19.340> of<00:05:19.400> motion<00:05:19.580> in<00:05:19.909> our

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
from our lack of range of motion in our

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.580 
from our lack of range of motion in our
daily<00:05:20.210> lives<00:05:20.449> we're<00:05:20.810> sitting<00:05:20.960> in<00:05:21.139> chairs<00:05:21.380> at

daily lives we're sitting in chairs at

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.469 
daily lives we're sitting in chairs at
an<00:05:21.680> office<00:05:22.070> we<00:05:22.550> don't<00:05:22.669> get<00:05:22.880> this<00:05:23.060> kind<00:05:23.300> of

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
an office we don't get this kind of

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.870 
an office we don't get this kind of
movement<00:05:23.720> in<00:05:24.289> our<00:05:24.500> legs<00:05:24.770> now<00:05:25.039> we<00:05:25.580> think<00:05:25.699> about

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
movement in our legs now we think about

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.939 
movement in our legs now we think about
our<00:05:26.030> legs<00:05:26.300> we<00:05:26.690> very<00:05:27.349> rarely<00:05:27.440> make<00:05:27.830> the

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
our legs we very rarely make the

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.409 
our legs we very rarely make the
connection<00:05:28.280> with<00:05:28.400> our<00:05:28.430> lower<00:05:28.729> back<00:05:29.030> but<00:05:29.300> what

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
connection with our lower back but what

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.870 
connection with our lower back but what
happens<00:05:29.750> is<00:05:29.960> on<00:05:30.169> the<00:05:30.710> tops<00:05:30.979> of<00:05:31.130> our<00:05:31.250> legs<00:05:31.520> there

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
happens is on the tops of our legs there

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.610 
happens is on the tops of our legs there
is<00:05:32.120> a<00:05:32.180> group<00:05:32.630> of<00:05:32.720> muscles<00:05:32.960> called<00:05:33.440> our

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
is a group of muscles called our

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.610 
is a group of muscles called our
iliopsoas<00:05:34.520> muscle<00:05:34.729> that's<00:05:35.389> two<00:05:35.599> muscles<00:05:36.080> and

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
iliopsoas muscle that's two muscles and

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.439 
iliopsoas muscle that's two muscles and
that's<00:05:36.770> so<00:05:36.979> as<00:05:37.130> in<00:05:37.340> particular<00:05:37.490> it<00:05:37.970> starts<00:05:38.330> at

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
that's so as in particular it starts at

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.749 
that's so as in particular it starts at
the<00:05:38.539> femur<00:05:38.840> at<00:05:39.080> your<00:05:39.199> leg<00:05:39.380> going<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:40.130> crosses

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
the femur at your leg going it crosses

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.360 
the femur at your leg going it crosses
over<00:05:41.210> your<00:05:41.449> pelvis<00:05:41.900> actually<00:05:42.650> connects<00:05:43.190> to

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
over your pelvis actually connects to

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.339 
over your pelvis actually connects to
your<00:05:43.430> lower<00:05:43.669> back<00:05:43.940> so<00:05:44.630> if<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:44.870> tops<00:05:45.139> of<00:05:45.289> your

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
your lower back so if the tops of your

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.649 
your lower back so if the tops of your
legs<00:05:45.650> are<00:05:45.860> tight<00:05:46.310> it<00:05:46.880> can<00:05:47.000> actually<00:05:47.120> make<00:05:47.479> your

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
legs are tight it can actually make your

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:49.990 
legs are tight it can actually make your
lower<00:05:47.780> back<00:05:48.050> tight<00:05:48.380> and<00:05:48.680> if<00:05:49.039> the<00:05:49.220> lower<00:05:49.699> back

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
lower back tight and if the lower back

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.090 
lower back tight and if the lower back
is<00:05:50.240> restricted<00:05:50.780> in<00:05:50.870> its<00:05:50.960> range<00:05:51.169> of<00:05:51.289> motion

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
is restricted in its range of motion

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.880 
is restricted in its range of motion
very<00:05:52.250> very<00:05:52.490> easy<00:05:52.790> to<00:05:53.180> get<00:05:53.300> pain<00:05:53.600> so<00:05:54.320> what<00:05:54.800> we're

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
very very easy to get pain so what we're
