00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.380
 that you have taken with your family but 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.420
 thing that yes I think a decision that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.160
 was good that's I think a good then my 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 jeanne woman announced the advisor 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.950
 National qu'encourt seized the saw 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.280
 we really had the national party 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.129
 is here in montreal this fursday 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.570
 as risk of being decision this is the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.860
 second that was made so bad 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.010
 we had to drive I wanted 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.140
 have a decision comes from backup 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.909
 really the candle to dedougou a 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.530
 decision that we could not do yes a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.540
 months to the budget but I really had 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.640
 I'm coming here with new team 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:24.240
 but I tell myself that I 'm coming here with 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:33.119
 greece and the banks had yet 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:35.700
 I checked on google or the season 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:42.930
 well his accounts accumulated me the most of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.420
 points or even family secrets is 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.439
 what slab ips of 0 alim to discover 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.299
 the firing of the facets we knew 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.619
 not especially fast like shad but I 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.869
 think and I'm afraid when you make yourself a 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.240
 movie is 24 days on mannequins 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.220
 freeing 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.740
 when there are things that the crisis 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.909
 brood over you as by 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.320
 example I think people will surrender 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.240
 that it happens to me more often 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.159
 that in my turn so do take the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.330
 feet in the dish 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.789
 but the important thing is really like I 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.229
 have them focus and on the positive fact 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.480
 just before the resignation at the bottom that this 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.260
 many I know facets one of them 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:23.030
 what should we focus on 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:24.769
 while children went pee 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.150
 Do not haul either huh I think 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.350
 there are still limits it's the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.880
 nannies who sees there an episode in 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.069
 especially I think I was going to see me at 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.680
 both a spaghetti sauce with my 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.180
 woman h1n1 but unfortunately it takes 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.890
 him I leave in the middle of the fox 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.390
 because there was a phone and 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.799
 there is the whole story and he got 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:52.670
 developed something that needed 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:54.590
 that I'm like that's me 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.269
 page a memory anyway relatively 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.250
 for fever then the phone rings 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.980
 then studied to still the bad then 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.150
 good out but on channel to the skin 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.070
 really appreciated his hand in his side 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.900
 to be the form of a player who has not 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:12.680
 not easy to the Romanian of heavy years 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:14.150
 at sochaux is a cache not the subject and has 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.100
 suffered multiple concussions 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.350
 what does it all change in your life 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.579
 everyday but that's for sure 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.859
 change a lot of things 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:35.060
 I think between really feeling 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:37.069
 confusion at his head and was one of 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.430
 less than me but it's hot it's not 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.650
 easy 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.230
 have to see the positive is a big 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.430
 benefits of confessions and only 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.859
 regulate as we know what I am 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.750
 obliged to listen to my wife when they tell me 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.410
 blame for not doing my tasks 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.000
 household 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.180
 so I just tell you that 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.489
 when 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.659
 it's not good for my brain that I 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.659
 ask him to talk to me about nuke 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.150
 so that's all married men 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:13.450
 who have this chance there no need it 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.769
 that we do not push them enough for 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.750
 men who listened to you we will be able 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.310
 dallas he also see a steve beggin 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.650
 gilbert delorme yvon the avs 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.289
 there the legends of hockey is going to be 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.050
 impressive to be around his answers 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.729
 ok they try to go to concept 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.440
 but that's what I think is gallas 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.310
 is hot east of the coast youn is 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:42.370
 like that does not sound like friendship to condat 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:50.860
 Business France is an advantage that 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:52.870
 it's all over but I'm really unfair 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.120
 for the opening of my restaurant ilan est 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.680
 a socialist and another a project that 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.500
 my agent a cursed one that was doing 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:05.770
 together it is to sell first game 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.360
 but she's great it's still a 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.000
 I will apologize to the 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.250
 family to keep they told me to port 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.849
 did not talk to episode 6 in Cairo in this 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:26.259
 c between internet hockey at all 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.669
 it's for the Lord and imagine for 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.650
 young people it's a real advice 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.900
 precisely to help who will not miss this 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.370

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.560
