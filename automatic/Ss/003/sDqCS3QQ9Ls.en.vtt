00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.950
 good on you it's been years that in 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.640
 speak but does it really change 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.970
 Something 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.349
 oh yes yes definitely it changes 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.169
 something to eat organic 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.849
 in any case for your health I you 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.319
 grant that it is not always easy to 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.759
 make the move to go olio especially 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.960
 that in the collective unconscious we are 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.390
 persuaded that it is much more expensive 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.979
 to buy organic what is not necessarily 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.040
 the case if you go in big 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:35.320
 organic chains on the other hand the other 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.260
 the other big inhibition that we have with 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.520
 the bio is that they are not fruits 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.230
 beautifully caliber is all with the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.880
 same color and are often a little 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.770
 quirky they have weird shapes 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.630
 Finally, we still have to say that 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.640
 it's because they're healthy that does not 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.380
 are not genetically modified 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.640
 quinon who are not covered with 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.750
 pesticides that can be attacked 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.860
 precisely from time to time by 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.010
 small parasites but it's because they 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.410
 are natural in the top 3 of 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.870
 benefits to eat organic the first 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.449
 advantage is that non-organic fruits 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.920
 are covered with pesticides 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.780
 remember that an apple by 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.880
 example can undergo up to 27 treatment 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.600
 and the problem of pesticides is that 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.219
 they are big hormonal disruptors 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.080
 and who are at the origin of full full 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.700
 of disturbances 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.370
 at the level of our health we know 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.170
 today the second benefit to 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.600
 to eat organic is that organic food 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.380
 are much richer in vitamins 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.150
 and in nutrients 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.760
 for example a kiwi can contain 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.290
 up to 90% vitamin C in addition to 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.000
 same as the antioxidant content of 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.730
 organic fruits and vegetables can contain 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.380
 up to 50% more nutrients it is 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.700
 nothing is not nothing especially when we 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.800
 know that over the last fifty 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.660
 years and fruits and vegetables have lost 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.130
 a lot of their nutritional value 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.960
 for example to have the equivalent 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.930
 of an apple from the 60s 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.350
 it would take three today 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.240
 third advantage to consume bio 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.740
 first it's not that expensive if you 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.320
 have in the chains organic shops 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.500
 they will sell fruits and 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.150
 vegetables and bulk grain which 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.470
 goes down the price considerably because 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.240
 that what is expensive is the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.560
 packaging then I'll you the rope 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.090
 there are no organic shops at all 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.700
 street corners but the more you 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.830
 would consume more will be successful - 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.350
 it will be expensive and then remember too 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.850
 of something to eat organic it will avoid you 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.620
 to get sick, it will save you 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.080
 health costs more or less long 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.500
 term beyond the benefits for your 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.380
 health 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.150
 consume organic products in bulk go 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.880
 allow you to respect the planet 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.570
 limit packaging avoid 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.459
 pesticides 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.900
 it will make you healthier for you and 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.340
 better health for your planet 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.690
 I think in the current context 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.170
 it's really important to register 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.170
 in this process
