2007 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT with a 3.8
what<00:00:10.410> I'm<00:00:10.500> running<00:00:10.650> into<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.910> wobble

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
what I'm running into is a wobble

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.049 
what I'm running into is a wobble
situation<00:00:13.139> at<00:00:13.349> about<00:00:13.710> fifty<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.549> sixty<00:00:14.700> miles

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
situation at about fifty to sixty miles

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.420 
situation at about fifty to sixty miles
an<00:00:15.240> hour<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:16.650> feels<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.160> coming

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
an hour and it feels like it's coming

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.189 
an hour and it feels like it's coming
from<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.670> right<00:00:17.699> side<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> vehicle<00:00:18.420> it's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
from the right side of the vehicle it's

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.890 
from the right side of the vehicle it's
making<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.039> slight<00:00:20.340> sound<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.119> I've<00:00:21.689> pretty

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
making a slight sound and I've pretty

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.500 
making a slight sound and I've pretty
much<00:00:21.990> ruled<00:00:22.350> out<00:00:22.670> any<00:00:23.670> kind<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.180> ball-joint

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
much ruled out any kind of a ball-joint

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.310 
much ruled out any kind of a ball-joint
issue<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:26.010> strut<00:00:26.640> issue<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:27.990> it's

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
issue or a strut issue so I think it's

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.080 
issue or a strut issue so I think it's
going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.529> be<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> outer<00:00:28.920> tie<00:00:29.250> rod<00:00:29.279> end<00:00:29.760> which

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
going to be the outer tie rod end which

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.690 
going to be the outer tie rod end which
is<00:00:30.300> not<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> ordinary<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.219> they're

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
is not out of the ordinary and they're

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.520 
is not out of the ordinary and they're
not<00:00:32.820> very<00:00:32.880> expensive<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> show

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
not very expensive so I'm going to show

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.200 
not very expensive so I'm going to show
you<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.890> looks<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.550> replace<00:00:35.940> that

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
that needs to be spun off to allow this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.230 
that needs to be spun off to allow this
to<00:01:15.150> come<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.560> spindle<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.220> what<00:01:18.180> I'm

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
to come out of the spindle so what I'm

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.270 
to come out of the spindle so what I'm
going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.659> while<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> secured<00:01:19.799> I'm

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
going to do is while this is secured I'm

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.760 
going to do is while this is secured I'm
going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.820> loosen<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.390> nut<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.930> just

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
going to loosen this nut here just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.520 
going to loosen this nut here just
slightly<00:01:23.130> ever<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> slightly<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.600> then

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
slightly ever so slightly and then

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
slightly ever so slightly and then
loosen<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.759> nut<00:01:27.000> take<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> all<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.630> way<00:01:27.750> off

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
loosen this nut take it all the way off

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.940 
loosen this nut take it all the way off
and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:29.100> hammer<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.479> release<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and then hammer here to release the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.660 
and then hammer here to release the
tension<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.720> has<00:01:34.110> holding<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
tension that this has holding it in to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.230 
tension that this has holding it in to
the<00:01:35.790> spindle

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the spindle

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.969 
the spindle
so<00:01:36.479> let's<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.810> ahead<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.530> want<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
so let's go ahead and do that I want to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
so let's go ahead and do that I want to
show<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.189> basically<00:01:38.759> why<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.150> replace<00:01:39.869> tie

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
show you basically why you replace tie

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.020 
show you basically why you replace tie
rod<00:01:40.380> ends<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
rod ends and that's because you have a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.760 
rod ends and that's because you have a
wobble<00:01:42.600> whenever<00:01:43.140> you're<00:01:43.290> driving<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
wobble whenever you're driving down the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.090 
wobble whenever you're driving down the
road<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.729> wobble<00:01:45.270> may<00:01:46.049> change<00:01:46.619> whenever

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
road and that wobble may change whenever

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.190 
road and that wobble may change whenever
you're<00:01:47.399> putting<00:01:47.579> tension<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.930> steering

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you're putting tension on the steering

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929 
you're putting tension on the steering
wheel<00:01:49.320> making<00:01:49.829> your<00:01:50.100> vehicle<00:01:50.520> drift<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.909> little

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
wheel making your vehicle drift a little

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.539 
wheel making your vehicle drift a little
left<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.130> you'll<00:01:53.130> feel<00:01:53.369> it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
left or a little right you'll feel it

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.520 
left or a little right you'll feel it
possibly<00:01:53.909> wobble<00:01:54.450> more<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.320> direction

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
possibly wobble more in one direction

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
possibly wobble more in one direction
more<00:01:56.040> than<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> other<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:57.299> you're

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
more than the other and as you're

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.240 
more than the other and as you're
vehicles<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.990> down<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> road<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.070> only

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
vehicles going down the road the only

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.760 
vehicles going down the road the only
thing<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.579> keeps<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.969> from<00:02:00.689> wobbling<00:02:01.259> back

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
thing that keeps it from wobbling back

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.580 
thing that keeps it from wobbling back
and<00:02:02.040> forth<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.299> tie<00:02:03.479> rod<00:02:03.750> end<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.380> going

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and forth is the tie rod end I'm going

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.050 
and forth is the tie rod end I'm going
to<00:02:04.680> zoom<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.909> this

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
to zoom in here so you can see this

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089 
to zoom in here so you can see this
movement<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:07.170> movement<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.740> happen

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
movement the movement is going to happen

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.770 
movement the movement is going to happen
inside<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:08.940> when<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.420> move<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.319> spindle

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.400 

and<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:16.250> movement<00:02:16.520> is<00:02:16.940> all<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.300> takes<00:02:17.510> for

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
and that movement is all it takes for

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.050 
and that movement is all it takes for
you<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> high<00:02:19.070> speed<00:02:19.370> wobble<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.880> this

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
you to have a high speed wobble in this

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.780 
you to have a high speed wobble in this
case<00:02:20.300> it's<00:02:20.540> over<00:02:20.810> 60<00:02:21.200> miles<00:02:21.410> an<00:02:21.560> hour<00:02:21.620> 55<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.670> be

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
case it's over 60 miles an hour 55 to be

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.920 
case it's over 60 miles an hour 55 to be
exact<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.880> that's<00:02:26.090> what<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.330> looks<00:02:26.360> like<00:02:26.720> and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
exact so that's what it looks like and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.440 
exact so that's what it looks like and
that's<00:02:27.170> why<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.410> need<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.650> replace<00:02:28.040> them<00:02:28.450> all

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
that's why you need to replace them all

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.550 
that's why you need to replace them all
right<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.780> want<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.050> show<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.290> what<00:02:30.470> it

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
right so I want to show you what it

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.810 
right so I want to show you what it
looks<00:02:30.740> like<00:02:30.860> whenever<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.280> get<00:02:31.490> your<00:02:31.670> new

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
looks like whenever you get your new

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.550 
looks like whenever you get your new
part<00:02:32.090> it's<00:02:32.570> going<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.780> come<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.140> bag<00:02:33.290> and

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
part it's going to come in the bag and

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.080 
part it's going to come in the bag and
you're<00:02:33.650> going<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.800> get<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.980> new<00:02:34.190> nut<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.970> that's

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
you're going to get a new nut and that's

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.030 
you're going to get a new nut and that's
going<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.300> go<00:02:35.420> on<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.690> part<00:02:35.960> here<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.320> then

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
going to go on this part here and then

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.890 
going to go on this part here and then
you're<00:02:37.220> also<00:02:37.400> going<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.850> get<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.330> new<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.810> new

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
you're also going to get a new a new

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.010 
you're also going to get a new a new
zerk<00:02:39.380> fitting<00:02:39.860> or<00:02:40.010> grease<00:02:40.250> fitting<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:41.480> be

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
zerk fitting or grease fitting to be

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.760 
zerk fitting or grease fitting to be
screwed<00:02:42.350> into<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.720> tie<00:02:44.720> rod<00:02:44.930> end<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.380> have

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
screwed into the tie rod end so you have

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.710 
screwed into the tie rod end so you have
a<00:02:45.800> place<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.940> grease<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.300> over<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.570> years

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
a place to to grease it over the years

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.910 
a place to to grease it over the years
to<00:02:47.959> make<00:02:48.110> sure<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.530> doesn't<00:02:48.680> wear<00:02:48.890> out

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
to make sure that it doesn't wear out

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.370 
to make sure that it doesn't wear out
prematurely<00:02:49.720> I'm<00:02:50.720> going<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.959> show<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.140> though

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
prematurely I'm going to show you though

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.420 
prematurely I'm going to show you though
before<00:02:51.770> you<00:02:51.920> do<00:02:52.070> it

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
before you do it

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.970 
before you do it
before<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.180> screw<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.660> zerkin<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.830> may

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
before you screw that zerkin you may

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.250 
before you screw that zerkin you may
want<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.220> squirt<00:02:55.430> some<00:02:55.489> grease<00:02:55.850> up<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.209> here<00:02:56.450> so

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
want to squirt some grease up in here so

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.420 
want to squirt some grease up in here so
you<00:02:57.350> don't<00:02:57.440> have<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.739> do<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:57.920> through<00:02:58.280> that

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
you don't have to do it through that

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.010 
you don't have to do it through that
little<00:02:58.670> fitting<00:02:59.000> I'm<00:02:59.420> just<00:02:59.660> going<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.810> put

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
little fitting I'm just going to put

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.060 
little fitting I'm just going to put
some<00:03:00.170> grease<00:03:01.510> all<00:03:02.530> over<00:03:03.530> inside<00:03:03.980> here<00:03:04.600> and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
some grease all over inside here and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.400 
some grease all over inside here and
that<00:03:07.070> will<00:03:07.190> get<00:03:07.430> me<00:03:07.550> started<00:03:08.170> what<00:03:09.170> I'll<00:03:09.260> do

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
that will get me started what I'll do

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.520 
that will get me started what I'll do
then<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:09.770> put<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.400> zerk<00:03:10.580> fitting<00:03:10.940> in<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.780> I'll

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
then is put the zerk fitting in and I'll

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.890 
then is put the zerk fitting in and I'll
probably<00:03:12.739> pump<00:03:13.130> one<00:03:13.370> more<00:03:13.640> or<00:03:13.940> two<00:03:14.180> more<00:03:14.209> pumps

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
probably pump one more or two more pumps

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.990 
probably pump one more or two more pumps
of<00:03:15.020> grease<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.440> there<00:03:15.620> just<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.580> make<00:03:16.760> sure

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
of grease in there just to make sure

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.060 
of grease in there just to make sure
that<00:03:17.450> it's<00:03:17.660> forced<00:03:18.049> into<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.500> areas<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:18.860> it

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
that it's forced into the areas that it

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.670 
that it's forced into the areas that it
needs<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.430> be<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:20.930> once<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.350> is<00:03:21.530> all

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
needs to be but once this is all

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.430 
needs to be but once this is all
tightened<00:03:21.980> up<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.940> can<00:03:23.180> slide<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:23.989> back<00:03:24.170> on

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
tightened up you can slide this back on

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.020 
tightened up you can slide this back on
or<00:03:24.620> screw<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.040> back<00:03:25.250> on<00:03:25.310> just<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.820> way<00:03:25.910> it's

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
or screw this back on just the way it's

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.430 
or screw this back on just the way it's
supposed<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:26.600> insert<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.110> in<00:03:27.320> the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
supposed to and then insert this in the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.490 
supposed to and then insert this in the
spindle<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.570> tighten<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:29.600> down<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.049> you'll

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
spindle and tighten it down and you'll

you have this screwed off and backed off

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.650 
you have this screwed off and backed off
this<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.169> what<00:04:49.320> it<00:04:49.410> looks<00:04:49.590> like<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:51.600> is

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
this is what it looks like and this is

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.960 
this is what it looks like and this is
the<00:04:52.139> area<00:04:52.919> in<00:04:52.979> which<00:04:53.070> you're<00:04:53.370> going<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.639> screw

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
the area in which you're going to screw

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.780 
the area in which you're going to screw
the<00:04:54.090> new<00:04:54.240> one<00:04:54.419> on<00:04:55.250> this<00:04:56.250> is<00:04:56.460> why<00:04:56.610> it's

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
the new one on this is why it's

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.659 
the new one on this is why it's
important<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.389> barely<00:04:58.020> back<00:04:58.530> this<00:04:59.040> nut<00:04:59.340> off

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
important to barely back this nut off

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.840 
important to barely back this nut off
and<00:05:00.080> that<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.620> maintain<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.490> correct

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
and that is to maintain the correct

and that is to maintain the correct
alignment<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.720> get<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:03.990> really<00:05:04.350> close<00:05:05.060> so<00:05:06.060> you

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
alignment to get it really close so you

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.969 
alignment to get it really close so you
can<00:05:06.419> drive<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.050> alignment<00:05:07.320> shop<00:05:07.680> and

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
can drive it to the alignment shop and

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.710 
can drive it to the alignment shop and
have<00:05:08.340> them<00:05:08.370> line<00:05:09.120> it<00:05:09.360> up

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
have them line it up

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.290 
have them line it up
once<00:05:10.050> you've<00:05:10.440> reinstalled<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.400> new<00:05:11.820> tie<00:05:12.060> rod

what<00:05:25.800> I<00:05:25.830> just<00:05:26.100> showed<00:05:26.280> you<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:26.580> that<00:05:26.639> is

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
what I just showed you and that is

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.650 
what I just showed you and that is
threading<00:05:28.110> this<00:05:28.260> back<00:05:28.470> on<00:05:29.300> placing<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.419> back

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
threading this back on placing it back

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.990 
threading this back on placing it back
into<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:32.340> spindle<00:05:33.440> tightening<00:05:34.440> torquing<00:05:35.310> the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
into the spindle tightening torquing the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.279 
into the spindle tightening torquing the
nut<00:05:36.380> back<00:05:37.380> on<00:05:38.300> holding<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.720> ball<00:05:39.900> joint<00:05:40.200> to

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
nut back on holding the ball joint to

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.430 
nut back on holding the ball joint to
the<00:05:40.530> spindle<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:41.150> then<00:05:42.150> taking<00:05:42.660> this<00:05:42.840> jamb

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
the spindle and then taking this jamb

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.150 
the spindle and then taking this jamb
nut<00:05:43.470> and<00:05:44.330> turning<00:05:45.330> it<00:05:45.479> slightly<00:05:45.810> back<00:05:46.380> to

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
nut and turning it slightly back to

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.150 
nut and turning it slightly back to
where<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.610> tightens<00:05:48.120> back<00:05:48.570> up<00:05:48.840> against<00:05:49.470> the

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
where it tightens back up against the

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.940 
where it tightens back up against the
end<00:05:50.370> of<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.610> tie<00:05:50.789> rod<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.690> at<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:52.440> tie<00:05:52.590> rod<00:05:52.800> end

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
end of the tie rod so at the tie rod end

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.460 
end of the tie rod so at the tie rod end
so<00:05:53.190> it<00:05:53.310> holds<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.639> in<00:05:53.789> place<00:05:53.940> and<00:05:54.360> it<00:05:55.289> will<00:05:55.380> all

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
so it holds it in place and it will all

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.320 
so it holds it in place and it will all
be<00:05:55.500> done<00:05:55.919> just<00:05:56.520> take<00:05:56.669> it<00:05:56.760> to<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:56.910> alignment

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
be done just take it to the alignment
