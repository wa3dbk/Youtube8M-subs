maneuverability<00:00:33.360> there's<00:00:33.809> also<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.290> minor

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
maneuverability there's also the minor

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.010 
maneuverability there's also the minor
difference<00:00:34.950> where<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.489> faster<00:00:35.910> ship<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
difference where the faster ship is a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680 
difference where the faster ship is a
little<00:00:37.559> better<00:00:37.800> against<00:00:38.309> ground<00:00:38.820> enemies<00:00:39.420> for

start<00:00:42.360> off<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.320> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.770> secondary

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
start off with this kind of secondary

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.459 
start off with this kind of secondary
grenade<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> tag<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.840> falls<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> ground

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
grenade a tag that falls to the ground

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.029 
grenade a tag that falls to the ground
the<00:00:47.160> small<00:00:47.550> airplane<00:00:48.180> type<00:00:48.450> ship<00:00:48.750> shoots<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the small airplane type ship shoots the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.189 
the small airplane type ship shoots the
projectile<00:00:50.730> straight<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> ground<00:00:51.809> so

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
projectile straight to the ground so

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.450 
projectile straight to the ground so
it's<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.379> lot<00:00:52.469> easier<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.949> hit<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> ground

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
it's a lot easier to hit the ground

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.090 
it's a lot easier to hit the ground
vehicles<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.629> bigger<00:00:54.899> Zeppelin<00:00:55.559> ship<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
vehicles the bigger Zeppelin ship on the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.430 
vehicles the bigger Zeppelin ship on the
other<00:00:56.219> hand<00:00:56.460> first<00:00:57.149> shoots<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:58.020> into<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
other hand first shoots it up into the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.790 
other hand first shoots it up into the
air<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.550> could<00:00:59.730> also<00:00:59.910> hit<00:01:00.539> ships<00:01:01.079> with

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
air so that it could also hit ships with

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189 
air so that it could also hit ships with
its<00:01:02.039> secondary<00:01:02.640> projectile<00:01:03.329> attack<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.899> then

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
its secondary projectile attack and then

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
its secondary projectile attack and then
it<00:01:04.439> falls<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> ground<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it falls down to the ground so it's a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.990 
it falls down to the ground so it's a
lot<00:01:06.450> harder<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.290> hit<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.100> ground<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.580> enemies

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
lot harder to hit the ground at enemies

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
lot harder to hit the ground at enemies
with<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> Zeppelin<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.770> pretty

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
with the Zeppelin but really it's pretty

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890 
with the Zeppelin but really it's pretty
challenging<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> hit<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> ground<00:01:12.420> enemies

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
challenging to hit the ground enemies

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.320 
challenging to hit the ground enemies
with<00:01:13.170> both<00:01:13.530> ships<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.430> most<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.820> time<00:01:15.060> you'll

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
with both ships so most of time you'll

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
with both ships so most of time you'll
find<00:01:15.630> yourself<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.470> avoiding<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
find yourself kind of avoiding the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.429 
find yourself kind of avoiding the
ground<00:01:17.700> enemies<00:01:18.150> versus<00:01:18.659> trying<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> take

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
ground enemies versus trying to take

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.230 
ground enemies versus trying to take
them<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.340> could<00:01:20.549> also<00:01:20.670> try<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> hit<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
them out you could also try to hit the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
them out you could also try to hit the
ground<00:01:21.390> enemies<00:01:21.780> with<00:01:21.990> your<00:01:22.140> regular<00:01:22.500> attacks

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
ground enemies with your regular attacks

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.100 
ground enemies with your regular attacks
by<00:01:23.040> flying<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.610> low<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.180> ground<00:01:24.270> but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
by flying really low to the ground but

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.080 
by flying really low to the ground but
if<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.950> risk<00:01:26.220> hurting<00:01:26.520> yourself

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
if you do that you risk hurting yourself

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
if you do that you risk hurting yourself
by<00:01:27.390> running<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:27.840> ship<00:01:28.140> into<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> ground<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
by running your ship into the ground the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
by running your ship into the ground the
game<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.790> challenging<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:31.259> both

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
game is challenging but because both

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.069 
game is challenging but because both
ships<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> vitality<00:01:32.790> bar<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.630> don't<00:01:33.840> just

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
ships have a vitality bar and don't just

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.200 
ships have a vitality bar and don't just
die<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.710> hit<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> right

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
die in one hit it's just the right

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.719 
die in one hit it's just the right
amount<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.990> challenge<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.680> fun<00:01:38.009> you'll<00:01:38.430> find

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
amount of challenge and fun you'll find

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.060 
amount of challenge and fun you'll find
yourself<00:01:39.060> having<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.420> lot<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.780> fun<00:01:40.070> maneuvering

of<00:01:55.140> shots<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.009> kill<00:01:56.250> they're<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:56.880> impossible

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
of shots to kill they're not impossible

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.780 
of shots to kill they're not impossible
but<00:01:57.659> there's<00:01:58.079> certainly<00:01:58.590> an<00:01:58.920> old-school

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
but there's certainly an old-school

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.330 
but there's certainly an old-school
arcade<00:02:00.200> challenge<00:02:01.200> even<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:02.070> what

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
arcade challenge even if you know what

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.969 
arcade challenge even if you know what
you're<00:02:02.460> doing<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.360> will<00:02:03.689> get<00:02:03.960> killed<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.829> or

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you're doing you will get killed one or

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.190 
you're doing you will get killed one or
two<00:02:05.189> times<00:02:05.430> when<00:02:05.790> fighting<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.270> boss<00:02:06.450> another

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
two times when fighting a boss another

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.999 
two times when fighting a boss another
strategy<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.069> take<00:02:08.250> into<00:02:08.399> account

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
strategy you have to take into account

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.339 
strategy you have to take into account
is<00:02:09.159> which<00:02:09.640> ships<00:02:10.119> aren't<00:02:10.420> good<00:02:10.720> through<00:02:11.049> which

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
is which ships aren't good through which

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.199 
is which ships aren't good through which
levels<00:02:11.920> for<00:02:12.189> example<00:02:12.610> if<00:02:12.730> there's<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.939> level

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
levels for example if there's a level

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.449 
levels for example if there's a level
when<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.569> have<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.840> fly<00:02:14.079> really<00:02:14.500> fast<00:02:14.709> through

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
when you have to fly really fast through

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.600 
when you have to fly really fast through
a<00:02:15.519> corridor<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.480> mine<00:02:16.840> somewhere

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
a corridor in the mine somewhere

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.830 
a corridor in the mine somewhere
obviously<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.760> smaller<00:02:19.150> ship<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.629> going<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
obviously the smaller ship is going to

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.899 
obviously the smaller ship is going to
be<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.989> lot<00:02:20.170> better<00:02:20.409> just<00:02:21.129> because<00:02:21.310> it's

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
be a lot better just because it's

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.630 
be a lot better just because it's
smaller<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.689> it<00:02:23.049> maneuvers<00:02:23.739> better<00:02:24.069> you're

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
smaller and it maneuvers better you're

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.670 
smaller and it maneuvers better you're
not<00:02:24.879> going<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.180> hit<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.540> walls<00:02:25.810> as<00:02:26.049> much<00:02:26.290> but

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
not going to hit the walls as much but

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.020 
not going to hit the walls as much but
of<00:02:26.829> course<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.159> have<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.340> take<00:02:27.549> into<00:02:27.670> account

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
of course you have to take into account

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.460 
of course you have to take into account
that<00:02:28.239> even<00:02:28.480> if<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.659> do<00:02:28.840> hit<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.110> walls<00:02:29.319> the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
that even if you do hit the walls the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.430 
that even if you do hit the walls the
bigger<00:02:29.890> ship<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.459> take<00:02:30.489> more<00:02:30.970> damage<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:32.049> even

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
bigger ship can take more damage so even

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.289 
bigger ship can take more damage so even
though<00:02:32.470> there<00:02:32.829> is<00:02:32.950> strategy<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:33.730> some<00:02:33.790> ships

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
though there is strategy and some ships

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.059 
though there is strategy and some ships
are<00:02:34.510> better<00:02:34.750> against<00:02:35.109> some<00:02:35.379> things<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.829> worse

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
are better against some things and worse

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.729 
are better against some things and worse
against<00:02:36.549> others<00:02:36.909> the<00:02:37.329> ships<00:02:37.629> are<00:02:37.810> really<00:02:38.439> well

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
against others the ships are really well

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.220 
against others the ships are really well
balanced<00:02:39.370> neither<00:02:39.909> ship<00:02:40.359> is<00:02:40.629> objectively

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
balanced neither ship is objectively

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.920
