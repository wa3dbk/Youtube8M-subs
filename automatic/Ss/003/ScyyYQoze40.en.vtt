 not too hot and after a minute 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.860
 The cancer is about ready for it 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.460
 I would always use something longer 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.570
 use 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.650

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.500
 Dab in the middle of the pan 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.630
 temperature is a bit lower and then 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.860
 wait that gets really nice 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.420
 probably everywhere on the surface 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.650
 small bubbles have then developed 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.650
