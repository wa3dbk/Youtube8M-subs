00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.989
 just like 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.879
 because now there is no directed plot 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.360
 I want to say that we must continue 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.939

 how I reinstalled windows and saved 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.659
 the ki should have disappeared but I did 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:29.869
