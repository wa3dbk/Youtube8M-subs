00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 two 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.480
 and well, welcome here to 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.340
 metal achievements and rising that deals with 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.619
 defeat to mistral the first boss of the 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.660
 game in perfect and good 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.430
 this is a guide of achievements more than anything 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.930
 visual what I 'm going to give them 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.910
 below are a series of tips 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.590
 you may be setting what is 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.510
 what I do in this is 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.600
 recommendation is to have the wig of the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.670
 infinite repair mode that gets it to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.630
 Finish the game in difficult and 20 arms 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.610
 of the guards and well because let's say 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.710
 that the wig makes you enter the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.870
 mode in repair mode so 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.470
 unlimited and good repair mode makes 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.720
 a lot of damage 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.300
 Well, what can I mention? 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.810
 with respect to this boss advantages and 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.690
 disadvantages that they will face in this 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.090
 voice faith not to start the advantages 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.970
 the advantages is that they have two check 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.100
 points and have a control point at 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.260
 moment when mistral falls to what is 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.150
 the tube or you touch on the tube either 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.710
 of the two that depends on whether you cut or not 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.900
 the tie 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.659
 they will do a checkpoint when they advance to 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.159
 the next zone that allows if you 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.560
 hit in that area and your 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.450
 reboots in what is the good count the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.610
 game is going to restart you from there 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.130
 from the life that you left him and not from 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.759
 the beginning of the fight 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.860
 and well we go to the hours and beds of the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.320
 advantages not or what is it that you owe 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.960
 do in this in this voice faith for 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.119
 start weak attack against the 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.520
 geckos is not one of the disadvantages 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.259
 to a certain extent and is that those who 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.420
 It was hard to start charging it despite 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.909
 that do not hurt you is in difficulty 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.079
 difficult to say that they are quite 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.640
 annoying because they're going to start you 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.960
 cornered and they will grab you and then 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.240
 mistral is going to hit you without any 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.470
 problem then my recommendation is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.000
 that at the time when mistral is 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.570
 away start to get rid of the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.310
 holes 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.110
 The main advantage against mistral is 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.569
 let's say that the strong attacks for 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.910
 break the cane is what they should be 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.190
 trying strong attacks here is the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.480
 second checkpoint and once 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.670
 here you have to be careful when 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.110
 she starts spinning since normally 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.959
 start to do in a pretty way 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.390
 but quite castros and that provokes therefore 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.980
 the defense fails I say we know that the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.130
 defense mode of this game is not what 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.569
 more perfect then let's say that that 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.640
 will affect quite a lot in addition to the 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.560
 camera problems 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.239
 those are going to do things more let's say 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.640
 that constants that you are going to affect 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.100
 camera problems and defense mode 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.049
 not once you master what they are 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.910
 the really mistral geckos do not attack 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.120
 a lot so it's a pretty easy boss 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.010
 to defeat 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.830
 maybe many will not go to me 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.920
 believe that this is so difficult but good 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.569
 maybe you can check my advice on my 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.670
 profile in xbox live and you will see that I have 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.470
 the achievements of all the bosses as well 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.599
 that I will upload the guides of all the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.890
 other bosses with the same advice 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.739
 advantages and disadvantages that are going to 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.090
 face with them the advantage more 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.250
 clear of mistral is that its 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.379
 achichincles do not hurt you and that 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.450
 let's say it does not attack very fast 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.310
 so that 's a big advantage with 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.019
 about it then not good then 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.790
 so far this series of advice from the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.260
 guide of achievements and well I say goodbye 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.140
 I do not get the little bit because I already have it 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.140
 see you until the next and cool
