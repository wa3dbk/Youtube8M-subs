00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
from breaking down right as opposed to

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.710 
from breaking down right as opposed to
uh<00:01:15.369> T's<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.850> don't<00:01:16.030> have<00:01:16.180> those<00:01:16.299> qualities

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
uh T's that don't have those qualities

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.660 
uh T's that don't have those qualities
will<00:01:16.900> ferment<00:01:17.170> really<00:01:17.439> fast<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.430> can

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
will ferment really fast so you can

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.789 
will ferment really fast so you can
actually<00:01:18.880> make<00:01:19.299> this<00:01:19.479> tea<00:01:19.780> before<00:01:20.560> we<00:01:20.710> have

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
actually make this tea before we have

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.440 
actually make this tea before we have
the<00:01:20.920> fats<00:01:21.100> into<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.520> tea<00:01:21.640> itself<00:01:21.910> can<00:01:22.150> sit

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
the fats into it the tea itself can sit

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.720 
the fats into it the tea itself can sit
out<00:01:22.660> on<00:01:22.720> your<00:01:22.990> counter<00:01:23.350> for<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.590> week<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:24.160> won't

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
out on your counter for a week I won't

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.490 
out on your counter for a week I won't
go<00:01:24.880> mad<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.570> you<00:01:25.750> start<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.080> put<00:01:26.230> things<00:01:26.260> like

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
go mad if you start to put things like

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.190 
go mad if you start to put things like
goji<00:01:26.890> berries<00:01:27.160> which<00:01:27.370> are<00:01:27.520> really<00:01:27.670> rich<00:01:27.940> in

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
goji berries which are really rich in

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.230 
goji berries which are really rich in
antioxidants<00:01:29.200> right<00:01:30.100> antioxidants<00:01:30.970> stop

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
antioxidants right antioxidants stop

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.570 
antioxidants right antioxidants stop
oxidation<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.470> they'll<00:01:32.710> keep<00:01:32.920> Ploesti<00:01:33.370> for<00:01:33.550> a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
oxidation so they'll keep Ploesti for a

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.910 
oxidation so they'll keep Ploesti for a
long<00:01:33.760> time

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.840 

it's<00:01:38.520> completely<00:01:39.240> possible<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.640> over<00:01:41.640> time

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it's completely possible and over time

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.790 
it's completely possible and over time
you<00:01:41.909> probably<00:01:42.659> develop<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.110> taste<00:01:43.260> for<00:01:43.440> fresher

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
you probably develop a taste for fresher

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.950 
you probably develop a taste for fresher
stuff<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.180> definitely<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:45.690> it<00:01:45.720> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
stuff but you can definitely do it that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.430 
stuff but you can definitely do it that
way<00:01:46.110> or<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.310> make<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.580> tea<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:49.200> just

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440

way or you can make a tea that you just
keep<00:01:49.619> drawing<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.550> want<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.909> scale

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.099 
to blend those for a long time that's
gonna<00:03:41.060> create<00:03:41.269> friction<00:03:41.569> that<00:03:41.750> you're<00:03:41.900> eating

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
gonna create friction that you're eating

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.690 
gonna create friction that you're eating
now<00:03:42.140> break<00:03:42.470> those<00:03:42.650> down<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.340> put<00:03:43.549> all<00:03:43.670> that

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
now break those down so I put all that

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.880 
now break those down so I put all that
stuff<00:03:43.849> in<00:03:44.150> at<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.359> very<00:03:44.480> end<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:50.890> probably

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
stuff in at the very end so probably

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.949 
stuff in at the very end so probably
everybody<00:03:52.250> by<00:03:53.120> now<00:03:53.299> has<00:03:53.450> heard<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.660> there's

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
everybody by now has heard that there's

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.250 
everybody by now has heard that there's
a<00:03:54.019> bit<00:03:54.139> of<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.290> crisis<00:03:54.680> with<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:54.919> honey<00:03:55.099> bee<00:03:55.280> boa

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
a bit of a crisis with the honey bee boa

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.629 
a bit of a crisis with the honey bee boa
and<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.500> think<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:57.889> that's<00:03:57.980> bringing<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.400> real

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
and I think that that's bringing a real

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.159 
and I think that that's bringing a real
consciousness<00:03:59.389> with<00:03:59.630> befell<00:03:59.959> know<00:04:00.049> if<00:04:00.109> you

which I think that we all
it<00:04:33.350> supports<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:33.980> bees<00:04:34.400> we<00:04:34.850> support<00:04:35.420> the

veganism what I think it's interesting

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.060 
veganism what I think it's interesting
about<00:04:44.930> veganism<00:04:45.320> is<00:04:45.560> that<00:04:45.680> all<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.889> food

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
about veganism is that all the food

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.530 
about veganism is that all the food
means<00:04:46.430> either<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.700> pollinated<00:04:47.210> by<00:04:47.240> bees
