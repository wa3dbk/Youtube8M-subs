with<00:00:49.890> an<00:00:50.520> interface<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.600> maybe<00:00:52.140> just

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
with an interface like this maybe just

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.049 
with an interface like this maybe just
with<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> mouse<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:53.430> other<00:00:53.550> single

pointing device would be somewhat of a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
pointing device would be somewhat of a
challenge<00:00:59.329> therefore<00:01:00.329> i<00:01:01.430> would<00:01:02.430> use<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.879> web

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
challenge therefore i would use a web

challenge therefore i would use a web
browser<00:01:03.420> such<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.019> kyle<00:01:04.799> o<00:01:04.850> KY<00:01:05.850> ello<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.950> was

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
browser such as kyle o KY ello it was

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.960 
browser such as kyle o KY ello it was
the<00:01:08.820> topic<00:01:09.860> looks<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.070> ankles<00:01:11.549> messing

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the topic looks like ankles messing

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
have obviously a computer connected to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.830 
have obviously a computer connected to
it<00:01:28.220> maybe<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.610> living<00:01:29.850> room<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.360> example

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it maybe in your living room for example

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.569 
it maybe in your living room for example
where<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.439> probably<00:01:31.829> wouldn't<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.250> using<00:01:32.520> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
where you probably wouldn't be using a

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.749 
where you probably wouldn't be using a
keyboard<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.450> time<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.829> course<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
keyboard all the time and of course the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.760 
keyboard all the time and of course the
TV<00:01:36.180> would<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.479> quite<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> distance<00:01:37.110> away<00:01:37.380> from

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
TV would be quite a distance away from

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.130 
TV would be quite a distance away from
you<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.310> standard<00:01:38.909> web<00:01:39.090> browsers<00:01:39.540> interface

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you so a standard web browsers interface

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.999 
you so a standard web browsers interface
wouldn't<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.070> too<00:01:41.310> easy<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.009> interact

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
wouldn't be too easy to see and interact

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.880 
wouldn't be too easy to see and interact
with<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> kind<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.710> home

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
with so this is kind of like the home

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.590 
with so this is kind of like the home
screen<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.939> kylo<00:01:48.470> we<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.740> various<00:01:50.700> buttons

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
screen for kylo we get various buttons

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.749 
screen for kylo we get various buttons

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
interface in Kyllo to make it much

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.180 
interface in Kyllo to make it much
easier<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.869> find<00:02:10.110> videos<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.770> navigate

easier to find videos and navigate

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.680 
easier to find videos and navigate
around<00:02:11.520> the

contrast<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.940> quite<00:02:24.770> good<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:26.010> better<00:02:26.490> for

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
contrast is quite good a better for

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.910 
contrast is quite good a better for
using<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.600> TV<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:31.380> doesn't<00:02:31.650> make<00:02:31.710> any

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
using a TV that doesn't make any

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.040 
using a TV that doesn't make any
difference<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.060> hard<00:02:33.330> for<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.840> see<00:02:34.020> but

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
difference it is hard for you to see but

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.650 
difference it is hard for you to see but
it<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.530> very<00:02:34.560> clear<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.430> me<00:02:35.610> from<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.390> point

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
it is very clear for me from this point

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.900 
it is very clear for me from this point
of<00:02:36.870> view<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.890> if<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.160> was<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.340> click<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and then I could go ahead and slowly

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.780 
and then I could go ahead and slowly

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
let me just show you a bit of the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.360 
let me just show you a bit of the
interface<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:32.260> kylo<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.650> at<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:34.069> bottom

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
interface of kylo so at the bottom

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.800 
interface of kylo so at the bottom
obviously<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.879> buttons<00:03:35.239> are<00:03:35.389> very<00:03:35.569> large

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
obviously the buttons are very large

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.229 
obviously the buttons are very large
easy<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.530> see<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:37.780> use<00:03:38.780> from<00:03:39.459> like<00:03:40.459> across<00:03:40.669> a

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
easy to see and use from like across a

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.330 
easy to see and use from like across a
room<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.290> we<00:03:42.379> built<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.650> sound<00:03:42.919> and<00:03:43.069> back

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
room so we built the sound and back

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.339 
room so we built the sound and back
forward<00:03:43.760> refresh<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.510> home<00:03:44.719> button<00:03:45.109> which

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
forward refresh and home button which

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.530 
forward refresh and home button which
would<00:03:45.530> obviously<00:03:45.560> take<00:03:46.189> us<00:03:46.760> back<00:03:46.969> to<00:03:47.000> this

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
would obviously take us back to this

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.470 
would obviously take us back to this
home<00:03:47.780> screen<00:03:48.169> that<00:03:48.379> we<00:03:48.469> saw<00:03:48.650> earlier<00:03:49.269> what<00:03:50.269> we

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
home screen that we saw earlier what we

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.420 
home screen that we saw earlier what we
can<00:03:50.629> also<00:03:50.750> set<00:03:51.079> up<00:03:51.230> favorites<00:03:51.769> just<00:03:52.040> like<00:03:52.189> any

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
can also set up favorites just like any

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.550 
can also set up favorites just like any
standard<00:03:53.150> web<00:03:53.299> browser<00:03:53.569> I'm<00:03:54.019> going<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.409> turn

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
this back on so you can actually see me

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.000 
this back on so you can actually see me
we<00:03:58.129> can<00:03:58.310> use<00:03:58.340> have<00:03:58.790> multiple<00:03:59.269> windows<00:03:59.510> or<00:04:00.010> tabs

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
we can use have multiple windows or tabs

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.280 
we can use have multiple windows or tabs
I<00:04:01.280> suppose<00:04:01.669> if<00:04:01.849> you<00:04:01.939> want<00:04:02.090> with<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:02.840> whichever

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
I suppose if you want with it whichever

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.339 
I suppose if you want with it whichever
you<00:04:03.530> want<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.709> call<00:04:03.769> them<00:04:03.949> so<00:04:04.909> you<00:04:05.449> can<00:04:05.689> have

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
you want to call them so you can have

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.289 
you want to call them so you can have
more<00:04:06.590> than<00:04:06.650> one<00:04:06.799> window<00:04:07.250> open<00:04:07.699> at<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.239> same

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
more than one window open at the same

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.229 
more than one window open at the same
time<00:04:08.859> there's<00:04:09.859> an<00:04:09.980> on<00:04:10.159> the<00:04:10.430> keyboard<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.060> open

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
time there's an on the keyboard to open

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.659 
time there's an on the keyboard to open
a<00:04:11.659> person<00:04:12.590> sorry<00:04:12.769> to<00:04:12.980> open<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.400> on-screen

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
a person sorry to open the on-screen

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.270 
a person sorry to open the on-screen
keyboard<00:04:13.849> at<00:04:14.479> any<00:04:15.169> time<00:04:15.470> if<00:04:15.650> we<00:04:15.769> need<00:04:15.949> to<00:04:15.979> input

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
keyboard at any time if we need to input

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.080 
keyboard at any time if we need to input
text<00:04:16.519> into<00:04:17.949> some<00:04:18.949> field<00:04:19.579> on<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.849> webpage

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
text into some field on a webpage

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.300 
text into some field on a webpage
obviously<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.199> can<00:04:21.470> still<00:04:21.799> use<00:04:22.009> a<00:04:22.039> keyboard

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
obviously you can still use a keyboard

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.060 
obviously you can still use a keyboard
if<00:04:22.699> you<00:04:22.789> have<00:04:23.000> one<00:04:25.030> various<00:04:26.030> settings<00:04:27.039> so<00:04:28.039> you

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
if you have one various settings so you

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:38.519 
if you have one various settings so you
can<00:04:28.630> choose<00:04:29.630> how<00:04:30.199> kylo<00:04:32.440> behaves

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:38.529 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.459 

and<00:04:39.069> obviously<00:04:39.489> the<00:04:40.209> address<00:04:41.049> bar<00:04:41.289> which

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:41.469 
and obviously the address bar which

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:43.679 
and obviously the address bar which
again<00:04:41.769> brings<00:04:41.829> up<00:04:42.339> the<00:04:42.789> on-screen<00:04:43.059> keyboard

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
again brings up the on-screen keyboard

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.949 
again brings up the on-screen keyboard
so<00:04:44.469> there's<00:04:44.739> a<00:04:44.799> really<00:04:45.089> nice<00:04:46.089> web<00:04:46.419> browser<00:04:46.659> to

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:46.959 
so there's a really nice web browser to

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:51.989 
so there's a really nice web browser to
use<00:04:48.089> as<00:04:49.089> part<00:04:49.599> of<00:04:49.899> a<00:04:50.229> media<00:04:50.769> or<00:04:51.009> entertainment

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:51.999 
use as part of a media or entertainment

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.449

an interface you'd expect to see on a TV
much<00:05:40.509> better<00:05:40.809> to<00:05:41.079> use<00:05:41.379> than<00:05:41.519> something<00:05:42.519> like

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
much better to use than something like

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.089 
much better to use than something like

improvement there for the people behind
kylo<00:05:51.309> but<00:05:51.699> hope<00:05:52.089> surely<00:05:52.869> with<00:05:53.019> time<00:05:53.319> hopefully

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:54.189 
kylo but hope surely with time hopefully

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:58.739 
kylo but hope surely with time hopefully
it<00:05:54.489> will<00:05:55.559> improve<00:05:56.559> but<00:05:57.279> certainly<00:05:57.789> for<00:05:58.360> a<00:05:58.419> free

00:05:58.739 --> 00:05:58.749 
it will improve but certainly for a free

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:02.129 
it will improve but certainly for a free

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:12.219 
around using the cursor it is much

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:14.339 
around using the cursor it is much
easier<00:06:12.249> to<00:06:12.669> use<00:06:12.999> than<00:06:13.029> I<00:06:13.239> said<00:06:13.509> the<00:06:14.019> normal

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
easier to use than I said the normal
