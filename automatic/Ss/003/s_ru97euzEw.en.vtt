hi<00:00:00.510> guys<00:00:01.079> you<00:00:01.979> might<00:00:02.190> remember<00:00:02.340> my<00:00:03.049> styrofoam

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hi guys you might remember my styrofoam

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.290 
hi guys you might remember my styrofoam
plate<00:00:05.839> glider<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:07.490> I<00:00:08.490> converted<00:00:09.150> to

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
plate glider that I converted to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.570 
plate glider that I converted to
electric<00:00:09.780> power<00:00:09.809> by<00:00:10.320> putting<00:00:10.740> small<00:00:11.370> motor

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
electric power by putting small motor

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.910 
electric power by putting small motor
from<00:00:11.940> one<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.150> my<00:00:12.300> vibrating<00:00:13.080> tooth<00:00:13.349> brushes

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
from one of my vibrating tooth brushes

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.510 
from one of my vibrating tooth brushes
on<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.630> was<00:00:15.839> powering<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:16.770> super

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
on it and I was powering it with super

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.099 
on it and I was powering it with super
capacitor<00:00:18.560> but<00:00:19.560> I've<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.850> put<00:00:20.850> my<00:00:21.109> lipo

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
capacitor but I've just put my lipo

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.009 
capacitor but I've just put my lipo
battery<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:23.580> my<00:00:23.820> nano<00:00:24.090> copter<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.810> there

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
battery from my nano copter on there

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.720 
battery from my nano copter on there
this<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.560> lipo<00:00:25.980> battery<00:00:26.400> that's<00:00:26.550> all

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
this is the lipo battery that's all

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.380 
this is the lipo battery that's all
puffed<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.769> like<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.920> was<00:00:29.039> about<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.550> burst

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
puffed up and like it was about to burst

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.470 
puffed up and like it was about to burst
into<00:00:30.750> flames<00:00:31.219> it<00:00:32.219> doesn't<00:00:32.579> hold<00:00:32.700> charge<00:00:33.120> very

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
into flames it doesn't hold charge very

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.380 
into flames it doesn't hold charge very
well<00:00:34.250> but<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.370> hoping<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.790> might<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.120> just

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
well but I'm hoping it might have just

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.720 
well but I'm hoping it might have just
enough<00:00:36.630> charge<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.620> run<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.190> electric

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
enough charge in it to run this electric

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.680 
enough charge in it to run this electric
motor<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:40.579> power<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.850> glider<00:00:42.059> across<00:00:42.480> my

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
motor and power the glider across my

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.260 
motor and power the glider across my
garden

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.300 

doesn't<00:00:51.990> help<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> propellers<00:00:52.920> falling

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
doesn't help that the propellers falling

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.310 
doesn't help that the propellers falling
off<00:00:53.400> I<00:00:56.420> think<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.450> might<00:00:57.600> go<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.990> if<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.140> got<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
off I think I might go see if I got a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:23.730 
off I think I might go see if I got a
slightly<00:00:58.800> smaller<00:00:59.190> propeller

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.789 

one<00:01:24.340> slight<00:01:24.970> lifting<00:01:25.540> flight<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.470> all<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
one slight lifting flight and all the

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.180 
one slight lifting flight and all the
others<00:01:27.210> powered<00:01:28.210> glides<00:01:29.200> I<00:01:29.590> would<00:01:29.740> say<00:01:29.979> or

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
others powered glides I would say or

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.670 
others powered glides I would say or
we're<00:01:31.000> waiting<00:01:31.390> for<00:01:31.570> it<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.690> charge<00:01:32.050> I'll<00:01:32.530> just

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
we're waiting for it to charge I'll just

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.180 
we're waiting for it to charge I'll just
point<00:01:32.979> out<00:01:33.159> some<00:01:33.369> of<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.550> changes<00:01:33.970> I've<00:01:34.150> made

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
point out some of the changes I've made

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.760 
point out some of the changes I've made
I've<00:01:36.190> got<00:01:36.490> my<00:01:36.930> portable<00:01:37.930> USB<00:01:38.229> power<00:01:38.890> supply

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I've got my portable USB power supply

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.570 
I've got my portable USB power supply
I've<00:01:41.770> got<00:01:42.009> my<00:01:42.600> USB<00:01:43.600> charger<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.890> comes<00:01:45.159> from

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
I've got my USB charger that comes from

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.730 
I've got my USB charger that comes from
the<00:01:46.619> helicopter<00:01:47.619> kit<00:01:49.830> so<00:01:50.830> I've<00:01:50.950> actually

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the helicopter kit so I've actually

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.070 
the helicopter kit so I've actually
soldered<00:01:53.740> on<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.460> right<00:01:54.640> size<00:01:54.940> connector<00:01:55.630> so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
soldered on the right size connector so

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.389 
soldered on the right size connector so
that<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.229> can<00:01:56.410> charge<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:57.270> lipo<00:01:58.270> battery<00:01:59.399> and

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
that I can charge the lipo battery and

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.790 
that I can charge the lipo battery and
I've<00:02:00.820> also<00:02:01.000> soldered<00:02:01.840> on<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> little<00:02:02.259> plug<00:02:02.560> on

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
I've also soldered on a little plug on

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.889 
I've also soldered on a little plug on
the<00:02:02.950> end<00:02:02.979> of<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:05.070> motor<00:02:06.300> that's<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.600> one<00:02:07.780> out

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
the end of the motor that's the one out

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.460 
the end of the motor that's the one out
of<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.110> vibrating<00:02:08.530> toothbrush<00:02:10.290> so<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.440> I

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
of the vibrating toothbrush so that I

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.150 
of the vibrating toothbrush so that I
can<00:02:11.620> just<00:02:11.800> connect<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.220> up<00:02:12.310> easily<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:14.160> then

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
can just connect it up easily and then

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.729 
can just connect it up easily and then
that<00:02:15.370> propeller<00:02:15.870> I've<00:02:16.870> taken<00:02:17.200> off<00:02:17.410> my

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.479 

mosquito<00:02:20.739> model<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:23.280> seems<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.430> a

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
mosquito model and that seems to be a

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:32.100 
mosquito model and that seems to be a
better<00:02:24.730> size<00:02:25.090> for<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.720> motor<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.840> we'll<00:02:31.959> just

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
better size for this motor so we'll just

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.020 
better size for this motor so we'll just
leave<00:02:32.320> this<00:02:32.530> for<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.799> while<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.190> charge<00:02:33.489> up<00:02:36.030> the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
leave this for a while to charge up the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.270 
leave this for a while to charge up the
LED<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.630> here<00:02:37.900> should<00:02:38.350> come<00:02:38.590> on<00:02:38.799> when<00:02:39.100> it's

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
LED in here should come on when it's

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.509 
LED in here should come on when it's
finished<00:02:39.640> charging<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.070> just<00:02:42.250> have<00:02:42.400> to

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
finished charging so we just have to

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.520 
finished charging so we just have to
leave<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.239> see<00:02:43.630> if<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.900> charges<00:02:44.260> up

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
leave that and see if it charges up

00:02:44.530 --> 00:03:09.839 
leave that and see if it charges up
enough<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:46.090> do<00:02:46.239> that

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.910 

well<00:03:10.849> it's<00:03:10.969> still<00:03:11.209> running<00:03:11.689> off<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.019> battery

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
well it's still running off that battery

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.190 
well it's still running off that battery
but<00:03:13.370> it's<00:03:13.549> lost<00:03:13.849> a<00:03:14.000> lot<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.150> power<00:03:14.420> now<00:03:14.810> it's

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
but it's lost a lot of power now it's

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.599 
but it's lost a lot of power now it's
little<00:03:15.530> bit<00:03:15.680> like<00:03:15.859> using<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.340> super

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
little bit like using the super

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.940 
little bit like using the super
capacitors<00:03:17.209> we<00:03:17.420> got<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.540> burst<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.079> power<00:03:18.290> to

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
capacitors we got a burst of power to

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.940 
capacitors we got a burst of power to
begin<00:03:19.099> with<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.900> after<00:03:20.959> that<00:03:21.439> it's<00:03:21.650> run<00:03:21.920> down

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
begin with but after that it's run down

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
begin with but after that it's run down
quite<00:03:22.519> quickly<00:03:23.709> which<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.970> expectable

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
quite quickly which is expectable

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.229 
quite quickly which is expectable
because<00:03:26.359> this<00:03:26.569> lipo<00:03:27.470> battery<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.849> one

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
because this lipo battery is the one

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.300 
because this lipo battery is the one
I've<00:03:29.480> stopped<00:03:30.049> using<00:03:30.409> in<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.799> helicopter

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
I've stopped using in the helicopter

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.729 
I've stopped using in the helicopter
because<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.579> wasn't<00:03:31.879> holding<00:03:32.000> charge

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
because it wasn't holding charge

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.170 
because it wasn't holding charge
obviously<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.890> smaller<00:03:34.040> propeller<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.879> just

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
obviously the smaller propeller is just

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.089 
obviously the smaller propeller is just
about<00:03:35.359> right<00:03:35.629> for<00:03:35.659> this<00:03:36.019> so<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.650> might<00:03:36.859> just

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
about right for this so I might just

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.089 
about right for this so I might just
save<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.790> for<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.000> little<00:03:38.120> bit<00:03:38.239> longer<00:03:38.829> before<00:03:39.829> I

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
save it for a little bit longer before I

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.640 
save it for a little bit longer before I
dispose<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.579> it<00:03:40.879> still<00:03:41.750> got<00:03:41.959> this<00:03:42.079> puffed<00:03:42.439> up

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
dispose of it still got this puffed up

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.149 
dispose of it still got this puffed up
shape<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:44.750> doesn't<00:03:45.019> hold<00:03:45.139> power<00:03:45.439> or

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
shape to it and it doesn't hold power or

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.069 
shape to it and it doesn't hold power or
doesn't<00:03:46.489> hold<00:03:46.639> full<00:03:46.939> charge<00:03:47.329> very<00:03:47.720> long<00:03:47.930> at

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
doesn't hold full charge very long at

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.679 
doesn't hold full charge very long at
all<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:49.459> takes<00:03:49.669> longer<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.209> charge<00:03:50.450> up

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
all and it takes longer to charge up

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.829 
all and it takes longer to charge up
than<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.959> super<00:03:51.230> capacitors
