00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
recommend wide receiver because the

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.420 
recommend wide receiver because the

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410

receiver that's that's the that's the
assailant<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:11.700> so<00:06:11.850> I<00:06:11.910> only<00:06:12.090> consider<00:06:12.570> them<00:06:12.780> in

equivalent<00:06:25.650> wide<00:06:26.100> receivers<00:06:26.580> can<00:06:26.760> be<00:06:26.820> picked

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
equivalent wide receivers can be picked

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.630 
equivalent wide receivers can be picked
at<00:06:27.210> all<00:06:27.390> even<00:06:28.350> into<00:06:28.590> the<00:06:28.710> six<00:06:28.950> around<00:06:29.250> so

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:29.640 
at all even into the six around so

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.740 
at all even into the six around so
they're<00:06:30.240> not<00:06:30.870> worth<00:06:32.030> so<00:06:33.030> in<00:06:33.210> conclusion<00:06:33.810> the

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
they're not worth so in conclusion the

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.600 
they're not worth so in conclusion the
first<00:06:36.750> four<00:06:37.080> rounds<00:06:37.590> I<00:06:38.070> would<00:06:38.190> say<00:06:38.340> even<00:06:38.430> the

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
first four rounds I would say even the

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.300 
first four rounds I would say even the
first<00:06:39.120> five<00:06:39.360> rounds<00:06:39.570> of<00:06:39.930> fantasy<00:06:40.740> draft<00:06:41.040> is

the<00:06:41.850> science<00:06:42.330> and<00:06:42.600> that's<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:43.020> sign<00:06:43.200> is<00:06:43.410> that

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
the science and that's the sign is that

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.000 
the science and that's the sign is that
we're<00:06:43.710> boiling<00:06:43.950> over<00:06:44.280> drafting<00:06:44.820> and<00:06:45.770> so<00:06:46.770> long
