there<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.890> basically<00:01:09.080> this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.290> kind<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
there and basically this is kind of a

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.010 
there and basically this is kind of a
controller<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> give<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
controller that is going to give you the

controller that is going to give you the
pro<00:01:13.710> advantage<00:01:14.430> when<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.729> comes<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.509> game<00:01:15.750> in

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
pro advantage when it comes to game in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.710 
pro advantage when it comes to game in
all<00:01:17.310> you're<00:01:17.490> probably<00:01:17.670> thinking<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:18.210> how

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
all you're probably thinking what how

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.719 
all you're probably thinking what how
the<00:01:18.780> hell<00:01:19.049> does<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> sounder<00:01:20.189> well

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the hell does it do that sounder well

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
the hell does it do that sounder well
I'm<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> tell<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.210> right<00:01:21.299> now<00:01:21.680> first<00:01:22.680> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
I'm going to tell you right now first of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
I'm going to tell you right now first of
all<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.130> little<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:24.240> thing<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.439> there

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
all a little know thing is right there

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.569 
all a little know thing is right there
on<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> Left<00:01:26.100> you'll<00:01:26.479> see<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> has<00:01:28.579> an

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
on the Left you'll see that it has an

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.539 
on the Left you'll see that it has an
xbox<00:01:30.119> joystick<00:01:30.720> which<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:32.250> quite

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
xbox joystick which actually is quite

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
xbox joystick which actually is quite
low<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.840> right<00:01:33.990> you'll<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.530> there

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
low down on the right you'll see there

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.810 
low down on the right you'll see there
is<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.450> ps3<00:01:36.619> joystick<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.430> see<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.790> a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
is a ps3 joystick which you see is a

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.399 
is a ps3 joystick which you see is a
little<00:01:39.090> bit<00:01:39.240> higher<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.689> any<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.930> you've<00:01:40.170> seen

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
little bit higher if any of you've seen

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.130 
little bit higher if any of you've seen
the<00:01:40.530> FPS<00:01:41.310> freeks<00:01:41.549> CQC's<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the FPS freeks CQC's it's about that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.600 
the FPS freeks CQC's it's about that
much<00:01:43.290> length<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.680> added<00:01:43.890> arms<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> little

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
much length for added arms is a little

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.910 
much length for added arms is a little
bit<00:01:44.729> higher<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.840> much<00:01:46.110> more<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.799> can

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
bit higher but that much more if you can

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.690 
bit higher but that much more if you can
see<00:01:47.070> our<00:01:47.280> mother<00:01:47.430> finger<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:49.979> it's

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
see our mother finger and then also it's

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.130 
see our mother finger and then also it's
like<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> dome<00:01:51.119> effect<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.780> get<00:01:51.869> more

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
like a dome effect so you get more

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.170 
like a dome effect so you get more
precision<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.040> reckon<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:53.640> you're<00:01:53.759> using<00:01:53.939> it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
precision I reckon when you're using it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.600 
precision I reckon when you're using it
so<00:01:54.899> that's<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> first<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.920> advantage<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.430> get

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
so that's the first one advantage to get

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.039 
so that's the first one advantage to get
why<00:01:56.729> they're<00:01:56.909> obviously<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:57.899> cool

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
why they're obviously you get some cool

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.630 
why they're obviously you get some cool
Charlie<00:01:58.590> blackout<00:01:58.950> buttons<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.430> there

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
Charlie blackout buttons right there

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.899 
Charlie blackout buttons right there
black<00:02:00.570> up<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.840> right<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.670> then<00:02:02.670> when<00:02:02.820> we

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
black up it right there and then when we

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.840 
black up it right there and then when we
turn<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> over<00:02:03.329> you'll<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:05.369> actually

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
turn it over you'll see that actually

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.440 
turn it over you'll see that actually
there<00:02:06.570> are<00:02:06.689> trigger<00:02:07.020> stops<00:02:07.580> on<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> back<00:02:08.879> yes

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
there are trigger stops on the back yes

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.380 
there are trigger stops on the back yes
there

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
there

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.980 
there

problems people who play MLG and you
know<00:05:10.840> what<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:10.990> is<00:05:11.110> in<00:05:11.380> this<00:05:11.500> way<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:12.040> when<00:05:12.250> you

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
know what I is in this way and when you

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.460 
know what I is in this way and when you
go<00:05:12.639> to<00:05:12.700> turn<00:05:13.000> nothing<00:05:13.360> you<00:05:13.720> get<00:05:13.840> kind<00:05:14.080> of<00:05:14.110> delay

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
go to turn nothing you get kind of delay

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.190 
go to turn nothing you get kind of delay
or<00:05:14.800> you<00:05:15.130> get<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.280> slow<00:05:15.610> movement<00:05:16.150> when<00:05:16.690> trying

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
or you get a slow movement when trying

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.810 
or you get a slow movement when trying
to<00:05:17.260> use<00:05:17.410> your<00:05:17.500> joysticks<00:05:18.010> which<00:05:18.520> if<00:05:18.669> your

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
to use your joysticks which if your

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.020 
to use your joysticks which if your
energy<00:05:19.450> that<00:05:20.169> can<00:05:20.410> be<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:20.919> main<00:05:21.130> reason<00:05:21.580> what

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
energy that can be the main reason what

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.120 
energy that can be the main reason what
can<00:05:22.210> be<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.510> difference<00:05:23.080> between<00:05:23.380> losing<00:05:23.830> and

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
can be the difference between losing and

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.180 
can be the difference between losing and
winning<00:05:24.540> so<00:05:25.540> am<00:05:25.750> I<00:05:26.080> test<00:05:26.919> all<00:05:27.040> their

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
winning so am I test all their

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.430 
winning so am I test all their
controllers<00:05:27.639> make<00:05:28.419> sure<00:05:28.450> they<00:05:28.720> get<00:05:28.840> rid<00:05:28.960> of<00:05:29.020> no

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
controllers make sure they get rid of no

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.750 
controllers make sure they get rid of no
slope<00:05:30.000> or<00:05:31.000> slow<00:05:31.770> nobody<00:05:32.770> wants<00:05:33.010> to<00:05:33.070> go<00:05:33.130> slow<00:05:33.520> to

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
slope or slow nobody wants to go slow to

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.860 
slope or slow nobody wants to go slow to
be<00:05:33.850> honest<00:05:34.090> so<00:05:34.870> at<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.979> end<00:05:36.039> of<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.250> day<00:05:36.400> guys

joystick which gives you a lot more
precision<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:15.039> aiming<00:06:15.400> sits<00:06:15.639> a<00:06:15.700> little<00:06:15.789> bit

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
precision and aiming sits a little bit

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.800 
precision and aiming sits a little bit
taller<00:06:16.150> and<00:06:16.470> also<00:06:17.470> um<00:06:17.820> reverses<00:06:18.820> don't<00:06:19.090> so<00:06:19.720> you

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
taller and also um reverses don't so you

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.150 
taller and also um reverses don't so you
can<00:06:19.930> get<00:06:20.080> me<00:06:20.169> you<00:06:20.260> can<00:06:20.440> literally<00:06:20.650> fit<00:06:21.039> your

zoom in you can fit your thumb all the
way<00:06:25.960> around<00:06:26.820> so<00:06:27.820> you<00:06:27.910> fit<00:06:28.060> in<00:06:28.150> that<00:06:28.180> way<00:06:28.510> like

that so you can get a full movement with

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.779 
that so you can get a full movement with
the<00:06:31.780> xbox<00:06:32.560> one<00:06:32.680> is<00:06:32.830> currently<00:06:33.130> first<00:06:33.430> into<00:06:33.729> the

the xbox one is currently first into the

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.370 
the xbox one is currently first into the
minimum<00:06:34.150> obviously<00:06:34.900> there's<00:06:35.050> not<00:06:35.169> as<00:06:35.229> much

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
minimum obviously there's not as much

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.899 
minimum obviously there's not as much
grip<00:06:35.620> as<00:06:35.770> well<00:06:35.950> that's<00:06:36.490> what's<00:06:36.669> one<00:06:36.820> little

bit
plasticky<00:06:37.750> you<00:06:37.810> can<00:06:37.930> see<00:06:38.050> these<00:06:38.169> ones<00:06:38.379> are<00:06:38.500> a

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
plasticky you can see these ones are a

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.800 
plasticky you can see these ones are a
little<00:06:38.590> bit<00:06:38.919> more<00:06:39.099> grip<00:06:39.479> and<00:06:40.479> feel<00:06:40.659> more

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
little bit more grip and feel more

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:48.649 
little bit more grip and feel more
rubberized<00:06:41.349> see<00:06:42.069> it<00:06:42.129> up<00:06:42.389> flips<00:06:44.069> doesn't<00:06:45.069> sit

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:48.659 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:52.700 

see<00:06:49.659> it's<00:06:49.930> a<00:06:49.990> lot<00:06:50.139> lot<00:06:50.349> better<00:06:50.530> so<00:06:51.460> obviously<00:06:52.300> I

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
see it's a lot lot better so obviously I

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.020 
see it's a lot lot better so obviously I
really<00:06:53.710> would<00:06:53.889> recommend<00:06:54.430> going<00:06:54.520> out<00:06:54.789> to<00:06:54.909> get

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
really would recommend going out to get

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.550 
really would recommend going out to get
one<00:06:55.120> of<00:06:55.210> these<00:06:55.300> and<00:06:55.539> compared<00:06:56.199> to<00:06:56.289> some<00:06:56.439> of<00:06:56.469> the

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
one of these and compared to some of the

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.589 
one of these and compared to some of the
molecules<00:06:57.099> in<00:06:57.219> the<00:06:57.370> cell<00:06:57.819> on<00:06:58.120> the<00:06:58.180> market<00:06:58.449> on

00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 
molecules in the cell on the market on

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:00.510 
molecules in the cell on the market on
rapid<00:06:58.960> fire<00:06:59.139> and<00:06:59.289> all<00:06:59.379> that<00:06:59.469> rubbish<00:06:59.800> these

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
rapid fire and all that rubbish these

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.059 
rapid fire and all that rubbish these
are<00:07:00.849> pretty<00:07:01.270> much<00:07:01.449> cheaper<00:07:01.960> and<00:07:02.439> quite<00:07:02.830> a<00:07:02.860> bit

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:03.069 
are pretty much cheaper and quite a bit

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:06.059 
are pretty much cheaper and quite a bit
cheaper<00:07:03.460> and<00:07:03.810> some<00:07:04.810> of<00:07:04.930> them<00:07:05.050> do<00:07:05.710> so<00:07:05.889> guys

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:06.069 
cheaper and some of them do so guys

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:08.730 
cheaper and some of them do so guys
believe<00:07:06.460> it<00:07:06.550> or<00:07:06.610> not<00:07:06.699> these<00:07:06.969> are<00:07:07.270> MLG<00:07:07.990> approved

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
believe it or not these are MLG approved

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.709 
believe it or not these are MLG approved
it<00:07:09.400> also<00:07:09.639> some<00:07:09.789> other<00:07:09.849> like<00:07:10.090> gaming<00:07:10.360> events

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:38.830 
obviously I used to earn my use tactical

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.439 
obviously I used to earn my use tactical
wherever<00:07:39.129> so<00:07:39.610> I<00:07:39.639> always<00:07:39.849> wanted<00:07:40.210> to<00:07:40.270> go<00:07:40.419> out

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:40.449 
wherever so I always wanted to go out

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:42.749 
wherever so I always wanted to go out
that<00:07:40.689> to<00:07:41.289> you<00:07:41.409> go<00:07:41.650> prone<00:07:41.919> and<00:07:42.129> stuff<00:07:42.310> and

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 
that to you go prone and stuff and

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:43.950 
that to you go prone and stuff and
obviously<00:07:43.090> doing<00:07:43.300> that<00:07:43.509> is<00:07:43.629> a<00:07:43.659> lot<00:07:43.840> better

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960 
obviously doing that is a lot better

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.300 
obviously doing that is a lot better
than<00:07:44.229> going<00:07:44.440> like<00:07:44.590> that<00:07:44.740> to<00:07:44.860> go<00:07:44.949> to<00:07:44.979> Brian

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.310 
than going like that to go to Brian

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.369 
than going like that to go to Brian
because<00:07:45.460> you<00:07:45.550> can<00:07:45.699> do<00:07:45.759> it<00:07:45.849> quicker<00:07:46.090> and

00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:46.379 
because you can do it quicker and

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:48.089 
because you can do it quicker and
probably<00:07:47.379> a<00:07:47.440> bit<00:07:47.560> more<00:07:47.710> useful<00:07:48.069> than

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099 
probably a bit more useful than

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:49.920 
probably a bit more useful than
tacticals<00:07:48.669> and<00:07:48.789> no<00:07:49.060> than<00:07:49.270> a<00:07:49.389> knife<00:07:49.750> and

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:49.930 
tacticals and no than a knife and

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.899 
tacticals and no than a knife and
sometimes<00:07:50.319> so<00:07:50.800> I've<00:07:50.860> been<00:07:50.979> prone<00:07:51.279> being<00:07:51.669> there

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:51.909 
sometimes so I've been prone being there

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:54.570 
sometimes so I've been prone being there
and<00:07:52.120> having<00:07:52.810> tactical<00:07:53.500> available<00:07:53.919> or<00:07:54.190> having

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.580 
and having tactical available or having

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.219 
and having tactical available or having
night<00:07:54.729> and<00:07:54.940> available<00:07:55.240> at<00:07:55.330> the<00:07:55.389> back<00:07:55.509> it<00:07:56.020> just

00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:56.229 
night and available at the back it just

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:59.129 
night and available at the back it just
makes<00:07:56.379> it<00:07:56.650> awesome<00:07:57.490> and<00:07:58.060> I<00:07:58.449> cannot<00:07:58.779> do<00:07:58.960> about

00:07:59.129 --> 00:07:59.139 
makes it awesome and I cannot do about

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:03.390 
makes it awesome and I cannot do about
it<00:07:59.349> so<00:08:00.129> am<00:08:00.339> I<00:08:00.750> mistaken<00:08:01.750> for<00:08:02.229> much<00:08:02.319> goes<00:08:02.529> and<00:08:02.919> be

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 
it so am I mistaken for much goes and be

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.930
