00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
in the finals but we did lose to two

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.609 
in the finals but we did lose to two
good<00:01:49.420> players<00:01:49.660> and<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:49.990> did<00:01:50.140> come<00:01:50.350> very<00:01:50.500> very

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
good players and we did come very very

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.440 
good players and we did come very very
close<00:01:50.860> but<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.399> fact<00:01:51.610> of<00:01:51.729> winning<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.119> middle

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
close but the fact of winning the middle

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.719 
close but the fact of winning the middle
I<00:01:52.600> think<00:01:52.869> even<00:01:53.020> thought<00:01:53.290> today<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.770> one<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.520> my

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
I think even thought today is one of my

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.370 
I think even thought today is one of my
biggest<00:01:54.940> accomplishments<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:55.990> one<00:01:56.200> there

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.390 
Australian Open for the man from
Johannesburg<00:02:19.959> knew<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.890> would<00:02:21.010> soon<00:02:21.340> be

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
Johannesburg knew that it would soon be

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.860 
Johannesburg knew that it would soon be
time<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.269> call<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.810> day

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.130 

I<00:02:28.250> think<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> decision<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> retire<00:02:30.569> is<00:02:30.870> always

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
I think the decision to retire is always

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.780 
I think the decision to retire is always
difficult<00:02:31.319> for<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.800> lot<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.099> people<00:02:32.459> but<00:02:32.550> for<00:02:32.610> me

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
difficult for a lot of people but for me

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.970 
difficult for a lot of people but for me
I<00:02:32.910> think<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.330> wasn't<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> sense<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.590> I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
I think it wasn't in the sense that I

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.720 
I think it wasn't in the sense that I
had<00:02:35.580> such<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.819> good<00:02:36.030> year<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.300> 2003<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.890> did<00:02:38.519> make

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
had such a good year in 2003 I did make

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.449 
had such a good year in 2003 I did make
a<00:02:38.760> point<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.480> myself<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:40.200> when<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.709> had<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
a point to myself that when I had the

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.369 
a point to myself that when I had the
birth<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.819> my<00:02:41.970> second<00:02:42.390> son<00:02:42.660> my<00:02:42.840> second<00:02:43.200> child

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
birth of my second son my second child

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.580 
birth of my second son my second child
that<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.160> would<00:02:44.280> be<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.900> was<00:02:46.290> starting

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
that that would be it and I was starting

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.470 
that that would be it and I was starting
to<00:02:46.620> get<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.860> lot<00:02:47.129> quite<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.459> few<00:02:47.700> injuries<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.450> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
to get a lot quite a few injuries so I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.449 
to get a lot quite a few injuries so I
think<00:02:48.720> there<00:02:49.049> was<00:02:49.170> quite<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> few<00:02:49.830> things<00:02:50.129> that

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
think there was quite a few things that

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.640 
think there was quite a few things that
made<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.209> easier<00:02:51.540> for<00:02:51.599> me<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.319> think<00:02:52.379> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
made it easier for me but I think the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.990 
made it easier for me but I think the
fact<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.129> had<00:02:53.310> such<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.580> good<00:02:53.819> 2003<00:02:56.000> putting

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
fact that I had such a good 2003 putting

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.420 
fact that I had such a good 2003 putting
so<00:02:57.180> much<00:02:57.299> effort<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.860> knew<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.220> end<00:02:59.340> of

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
so much effort in that I knew the end of

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.390 
so much effort in that I knew the end of
2003<00:03:00.120> that<00:03:00.360> would<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.630> funny<00:03:01.400> remarkably

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
2003 that would be a funny remarkably

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.759 
2003 that would be a funny remarkably
consistent<00:03:02.700> throughout<00:03:03.390> his<00:03:03.660> career<00:03:03.840> Ferrera

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
consistent throughout his career Ferrera

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.170 
consistent throughout his career Ferrera
once<00:03:05.069> held<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.400> record<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.030> most

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
once held the record for the most

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.270 
once held the record for the most
consecutive<00:03:06.530> appearances<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.739> grants<00:03:08.040> and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
consecutive appearances in grants and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.270 
consecutive appearances in grants and
tournaments<00:03:08.910> with<00:03:09.060> 56<00:03:09.959> something<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.069> kept

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
tournaments with 56 something that kept

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.710 
tournaments with 56 something that kept
him<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.640> tour<00:03:11.849> until<00:03:12.349> 2004

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.630 

pretty<00:03:18.350> much<00:03:18.500> after<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.070> only<00:03:19.250> reason

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
pretty much after that the only reason

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.240 
pretty much after that the only reason
why<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.790> played<00:03:20.150> 2004<00:03:21.110> was<00:03:21.350> because<00:03:21.830> of<00:03:22.040> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
why I played 2004 was because of the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.880 
why I played 2004 was because of the
record<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.300> most<00:03:23.510> Grand<00:03:23.780> Slams<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.380> so

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
record of the most Grand Slams and so

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.520 
record of the most Grand Slams and so
2004<00:03:25.640> was<00:03:25.820> kind<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.120> like<00:03:26.270> my<00:03:26.540> my<00:03:27.020> last<00:03:27.230> year

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
2004 was kind of like my my last year

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.310 
2004 was kind of like my my last year
out<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.970> didn't<00:03:29.570> really<00:03:29.750> put<00:03:29.990> that<00:03:30.110> much

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
out I didn't really put that much

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.500 
out I didn't really put that much
attention<00:03:30.500> or<00:03:30.890> focus<00:03:30.920> on<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.460> 2003<00:03:32.180> was<00:03:32.330> pretty

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
attention or focus on a 2003 was pretty

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.590 
attention or focus on a 2003 was pretty
much<00:03:32.600> my<00:03:32.780> last<00:03:32.930> year<00:03:34.000> fiercely<00:03:35.000> loyal<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.360> his
