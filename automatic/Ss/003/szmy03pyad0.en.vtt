 are that although welcome to this 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.629
 brand new video of gta 5 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.099
 today I will show you the new screenshots 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.139
 released by rockstar games of the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.059
 pc version that we all know by now 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.400
 has been postponed and will be released on April 14th 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.230
 and nothing we go to analyze one ad 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.510
 one the screenshots that I remember they are 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.949
 strictly in 4k 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.480
 but before starting as usual a 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.910
 invitation to the ascom likes this video 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.830
 to support me and subscribe to the channel 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.939
 if you have n't already done it and done that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.830
 we can also start 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.570
 in the first image we can see 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.980
 franklin and with a bag on his shoulders 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.079
 probably this will be one of the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 history and background missions 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.860
 we can see the skyscrapers of los 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.210
 altos nothing to say particularly about 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.340
 this image and move on to the next 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.719
 well in this picture we can see 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
 a train crossing black country 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.500
 very close to the lake the jumping thing 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.780
 immediately to the eye is definitely the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.149
 vegetation and the surrounding environment that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.160
 really well taken care of the remarkable also 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.690
 distance to render I don't know if from 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.699
 video you can see it but you can 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.859
 catch a glimpse of the wind turbines and in any case 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.300
 they are very far from that point e 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.010
 maybe if you can't see it well 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.940
 in the video in description I leave you the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.979
 screen link 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.110
 if you want to see them better but let's move on 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.790
 to the next image well these 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.830
 images there is not much to say we can 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.650
 see trevor holding a gun e 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.909
 heads for something is the thing that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.650
 more impressed me with these images 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.930
 are the details of the face 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.820
 where we can see some scar 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.380
 as you can also see on the hand yes 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.659
 manage to distinguish cuts and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.040
 no details really well done in 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.540
 this other image we can see 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.850
 what would appear to be michael 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.500
 that we play golf at the top we can see 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.390
 a mid-jet that really flies low 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.189
 altitude and in the background obviously i 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.810
 skyscrapers of los altos in this one 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.670
 image we can distinguish frank 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.009
 intent on taking a leap with the quad 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.229
 in the background always los santos with a 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.759
 render distance noticeable even if there is 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.100
 the sunset and therefore turns out to be a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.170
 little dark on the right side is the thing that 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.030
 it caught my eye in this one 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.350
 image a little lack of vegetation 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.729
 on this hill 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.350
 in fact on the left side we can 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.649
 just see a few tufts of grass 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.570
 then only soil texture goes well not 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.180
 it's a very serious thing so let's move on 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.800
 to the next image 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.850
 well here we can see michael who 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.920
 probably holds a gun 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.990
 during the mission north of Anton 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.270
 in fact on the left we see the cemetery 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.250
 snowy and the thing that most surprised me 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.140
 of these images are the details 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.570
 we can absolutely notice how 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.000
 how many are well done 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.070
 see the fabric and the writing on the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.230
 absolutely legible gun i 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.140
 details on the face of michael what to say 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.120
 really well done in this other one 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.550
 image we can see one of the rivers 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.680
 running through black country is the thing 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.209
 that you immediately notice is definitely the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.070
 rich vegetation 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.560
 then we can notice two deer on the other 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.640
 river bank and two rabbits on the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.100
 left 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.570
 the water is well done obviously and both i 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.720
 reflections that the waves because it goes well 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.910
 gta 5 water is really something 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.100
 I've never seen water so well made 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.420
 in other games really on this one 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.950
 image instead there is not much to 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.510
 say we can see three characters 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.700
 in the final phase of the robbery in 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.620
 fine jewelry this is one of the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.870
 my favorite images we can see 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.040
 michael frankiln and trevor in a car 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.750
 chased by the police 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.950
 but the thing that struck me most about 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.530
 this image is the reflections 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.540
 surrounding environment is on the glass 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.920
 than on the bodywork but above all 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.140
 on the mirror where we can see 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.150
 even reflected in full of the 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.220
 skyscrapers in the surroundings 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.360
 but let's move on to the next image well 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.430
 in this image we can of the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.380
 blaine country campaigns still one 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.630
 once the distance to go makes you see 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.850
 and we can see an agricultural plane that 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.230
 he wants above the fields but one thing 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.450
 which leaves me a little doubtful is 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.130
 that grass maybe it's just a matter of 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.470
 distance but I don't see it particularly 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.230
 beautiful in this picture we see 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.280
 franklin on a bike that shoots and things 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.019
 beautiful of these images are 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.940
 certainly the reflections of the neon of 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.610
 local is on the car on the right 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.950
 that on Franklin's face making everything 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.230
 incredibly realistic and one more 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.640
 time the details of the glove fabric 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.440
 in this picture we can see 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.750
 trevor going to one of 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.579
 sel shore and we can see a saber 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.380
 turbo in the foreground nothing to say about 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.000
 this really very simple image 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.470
 in this other image we can see 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.560
 trevor to hold a rifle of 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.030
 probable accuracy 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.590
 while during a hunt 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.989
 in the background we can see belen 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.040
 county with lots of lightning in the sky and 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.230
 nothing to say about vegetation 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.750
 unfortunately it's dark so it doesn't stand out 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.299
 very well is another doubt I have is the 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.130
 texture of the camouflage of trevor that not 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.169
 is one of the best in the penultimate 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.490
 image we see francken and ciop in front 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.139
 michael's house 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.000
 the thing that struck me most about this 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.070
 image surely the details of the hair 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.110
 of shop that is easily distinguishable 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.360
 now I don't know if you can see them in the video 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.800
 but in any case there is the description 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.270
 link all the images if you want 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.740
 see them in high resolution 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.750
 well the last image is really 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.340
 particular we can see from the fruits 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.800
 which probably belongs to Michael 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.900
 take a photo at the beach but the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.720
 particular thing over reflections of the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.250
 moonlight on the water is the yacht e 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.780
 where michael is taking the photo 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.850
 which is most likely the same 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.830
 yacht shown in the robbery trailer 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.210
 and this makes me think we can find it 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.060
 even outside the mission of the 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.770
 therefore robbery that we can reach it 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.080
 easily also in free mode let's say 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.889
 now I don't know if only in history or maybe 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.260
 Also in online 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.780
 anyway we'll see the kids 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.130
 images are finished as always vi 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.169
 call to leave I like the video for 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.950
 support me subscribe to the channel if not 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.870
 you have already done it 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.760
 I recommend you share the video on 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.289
 facebook with your friends maybe 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.030
 also leave a comment below 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.280
 this video to make me understand what it is 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.979
 think of these images and what they do 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.660
 think of the PC version in general and 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:32.070
 nothing dax comes all we see ourselves in 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.070
 a nice video next guys
