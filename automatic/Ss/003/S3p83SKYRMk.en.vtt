have<00:01:40.009> gone<00:01:40.039> on<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.520> start<00:01:41.359> successful

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
have gone on to start successful

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.450 
have gone on to start successful
startups<00:01:42.289> based<00:01:42.530> on<00:01:42.680> some<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:42.920> their<00:01:43.009> projects

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
startups based on some of their projects

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.700 
startups based on some of their projects
where<00:01:43.789> are<00:01:43.909> they<00:01:44.000> getting<00:01:44.119> these<00:01:44.390> ideas<00:01:44.869> well

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
where are they getting these ideas well

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.529 
where are they getting these ideas well
you'd<00:01:46.159> be<00:01:46.280> surprised<00:01:46.640> at<00:01:46.759> how<00:01:46.909> creative<00:01:47.359> that

really from necessity a lot of these
ideas<00:01:56.000> come<00:01:56.210> up<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:57.289> entire<00:01:58.130> project<00:01:58.369> is

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
ideas come up and this entire project is

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.789 
ideas come up and this entire project is
the<00:01:58.850> final<00:01:59.149> mark<00:01:59.329> correct<00:01:59.630> that's<00:02:00.289> correct<00:02:00.409> so

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
the final mark correct that's correct so

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.770 
the final mark correct that's correct so
the<00:02:00.890> course<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.579> based<00:02:01.939> entirely<00:02:02.299> on<00:02:02.509> this

right and you know what it's really a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.809 
right and you know what it's really a
nice<00:02:20.650> simulation<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.340> what<00:02:21.400> engineering

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
nice simulation of what engineering

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.750 
nice simulation of what engineering
really<00:02:22.300> has<00:02:22.510> required<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.319> put<00:02:23.530> together

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
really has required you to put together

that we would all have this sort of

studying this and then come up with your
final<00:03:06.670> business<00:03:07.000> plan<00:03:07.209> couldn't<00:03:07.540> you

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
final business plan couldn't you

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.080 
final business plan couldn't you
certainly<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.590> mean<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.100> mean<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.550> idea<00:03:09.700> will

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
certainly I mean I mean the idea will

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.330 
certainly I mean I mean the idea will
evolve<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.720> as<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.410> gain<00:03:11.590> more<00:03:11.620> information

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
evolve and as you gain more information

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.150 
evolve and as you gain more information
more<00:03:12.819> knowledge<00:03:13.209> about<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.600> area<00:03:13.890> your<00:03:14.890> your

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
more knowledge about the area your your

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.979 
more knowledge about the area your your
strength<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.180> area<00:03:16.360> will<00:03:16.510> will<00:03:16.780> evolve

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
strength in the area will will evolve

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.210 
strength in the area will will evolve
but<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.350> course<00:03:17.560> yeah<00:03:17.739> you're<00:03:17.950> right<00:03:18.040> it's

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
but of course yeah you're right it's

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.850 
but of course yeah you're right it's
possible<00:03:18.580> indeed<00:03:19.019> give<00:03:20.019> us<00:03:20.140> some<00:03:20.290> examples<00:03:20.410> of

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
possible indeed give us some examples of

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.340 
possible indeed give us some examples of
some<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.040> these<00:03:21.130> projects<00:03:21.580> in<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.730> past<00:03:21.940> that

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
some of these projects in the past that

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.990 
some of these projects in the past that
you<00:03:23.350> know<00:03:23.440> have<00:03:23.620> enlightened<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.130> uh<00:03:24.160> 3d

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
you know have enlightened you uh 3d

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.970 
you know have enlightened you uh 3d
youtube<00:03:25.660> videos<00:03:26.049> i'm<00:03:26.260> guessing<00:03:26.620> we're<00:03:26.739> seeing

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
youtube videos i'm guessing we're seeing

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.860 
youtube videos i'm guessing we're seeing
a<00:03:27.100> lot<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:28.709> personal<00:03:29.709> devices<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.250> lot<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.970> this

involved in today yeah i think you know
there's<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.350> popular<00:03:35.530> film<00:03:35.920> called<00:03:35.980> avatar

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
there's a popular film called avatar

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.300 
there's a popular film called avatar
recently<00:03:36.970> which<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.269> think<00:03:37.530> thrust<00:03:38.530> 3d<00:03:38.950> onto

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
recently which I think thrust 3d onto

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.750 
recently which I think thrust 3d onto
the<00:03:39.459> onto<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.880> public<00:03:40.920> limelight<00:03:41.920> but<00:03:42.459> yeah

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
the onto the public limelight but yeah

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.190 
the onto the public limelight but yeah
we<00:03:42.880> have<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.030> group<00:03:43.269> which<00:03:43.510> is<00:03:43.630> built<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.930> 3d

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
we have a group which is built a 3d

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.460 
we have a group which is built a 3d
camera<00:03:44.790> which<00:03:45.790> can<00:03:45.820> image<00:03:46.299> in<00:03:46.540> 3d<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.110> they

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
camera which can image in 3d and they

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.199 
camera which can image in 3d and they
produce<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.920> 3d<00:03:48.220> display<00:03:48.609> you<00:03:48.670> have<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.060> put

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
produce the 3d display you have to put

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.819 
produce the 3d display you have to put
on<00:03:49.299> some<00:03:49.510> special<00:03:49.840> glasses<00:03:50.049> but<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.620> see

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
on some special glasses but you can see

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.849 
on some special glasses but you can see
the<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.670> resulting<00:03:52.299> field<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.690> 3d<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.500> who

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
the the resulting field in 3d and who

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.680 
the the resulting field in 3d and who
knows<00:03:53.980> maybe<00:03:54.040> your<00:03:54.609> next<00:03:54.730> video<00:03:55.209> camera<00:03:55.600> will

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
knows maybe your next video camera will

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.300 
knows maybe your next video camera will
be<00:03:55.780> 3d<00:03:56.109> and<00:03:56.320> powered<00:03:56.829> by<00:03:56.950> some<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
be 3d and powered by some of the

Steve this is totally off topic but
obviously<00:04:01.060> you've<00:04:01.209> been<00:04:01.239> following<00:04:01.450> this<00:04:01.810> you

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
obviously you've been following this you

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
obviously you've been following this you
know<00:04:02.019> what<00:04:02.140> this<00:04:02.200> is<00:04:02.350> all<00:04:02.470> about<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.829> know<00:04:02.920> the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
know what this is all about you know the

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.620 
know what this is all about you know the
most<00:04:03.160> of<00:04:03.310> us<00:04:03.430> have<00:04:03.549> these<00:04:03.700> big<00:04:03.880> TVs<00:04:04.209> now<00:04:04.420> and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
most of us have these big TVs now and

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.660 
most of us have these big TVs now and
now<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.750> guess<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.079> next<00:04:05.230> stage<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.920> for<00:04:06.190> 3d

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
now I guess the next stage is for 3d

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.410 
now I guess the next stage is for 3d
