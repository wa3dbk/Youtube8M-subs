the manufacturing process that leaches
to<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> surface<00:00:49.680> we<00:00:49.829> want<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> make<00:00:50.129> sure<00:00:50.160> we

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
gross residue that we brought to the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
gross residue that we brought to the
surface<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> brush<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.470> I'm

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
surface with the brush as you see I'm

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.870 
surface with the brush as you see I'm
going<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> grain<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.729> there's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
going with the grain here if there's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
going with the grain here if there's
some<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> gray<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> tire<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.020> helps

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
some kind of gray on the tire it helps

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
some kind of gray on the tire it helps
you<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> grooves<00:01:11.010> helps<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.610> all

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
you get in the grooves helps you get all

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.140 
you get in the grooves helps you get all
that<00:01:11.970> gunk<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.740> crevices<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that gunk out of the crevices of the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.330 
that gunk out of the crevices of the
tire<00:01:17.900> now<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.049> looks<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.439> we're<00:01:19.619> clean<00:01:19.890> here

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
tire now it looks like we're clean here

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.990 
tire now it looks like we're clean here
but<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.619> sometimes<00:01:22.619> it'll<00:01:23.250> take<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
but we're not sometimes it'll take up to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.359 
but we're not sometimes it'll take up to
two<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.479> three<00:01:24.509> even<00:01:24.990> five<00:01:25.320> applications<00:01:25.920> of

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
two or three even five applications of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.050 
see more of that same oil and chemical
that<00:01:58.829> we<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.189> get<00:01:59.340> off<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.759> surface<00:02:00.030> of

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that we have to get off the surface of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.429 
that we have to get off the surface of
the<00:02:00.149> tire<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.540> have<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> pure<00:02:00.930> rubber<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.409> rubber

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the tire to have a pure rubber on rubber

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.200 
the tire to have a pure rubber on rubber
installation<00:02:02.219> again<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.820> me<00:02:02.939> following

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
installation again you see me following

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.230 
installation again you see me following
the<00:02:03.390> grain<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.469> clean<00:02:04.710> rag<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.240> you're

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the grain with the clean rag and you're

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.240 
the grain with the clean rag and you're
gonna<00:02:06.390> see<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.710> using<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.039> bit<00:02:08.129> of

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
gonna see that I'm using a little bit of

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.440 
gonna see that I'm using a little bit of
force<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.670> look<00:02:08.789> at<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.940> gunk<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.270> I'm

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
force here look at the gunk that I'm

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.790 
force here look at the gunk that I'm
pulling<00:02:09.690> off<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.319> thought<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> tire

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
pulling off that and we thought the tire

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.350 
pulling off that and we thought the tire
was<00:02:10.950> clean<00:02:11.239> two<00:02:12.239> applications<00:02:12.810> ago<00:02:13.020> so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
was clean two applications ago so

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.820 
was clean two applications ago so
gives<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.660> an<00:02:13.720> idea<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:14.170> how<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.380> have<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.650> get

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
gives you an idea of how you have to get

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.490 
gives you an idea of how you have to get
this<00:02:15.010> surface<00:02:15.400> clean<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.940> free<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.660> all<00:02:16.840> oils

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
this surface clean of free of all oils

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.010 
this surface clean of free of all oils
so<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.640> again<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.030> pure<00:02:19.450> rubber<00:02:19.780> on

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
so you have again a pure rubber on

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.570 
so you have again a pure rubber on
rubber<00:02:20.640> installation<00:02:23.160> now<00:02:24.160> we've<00:02:24.340> done<00:02:24.520> our

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
rubber installation now we've done our

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.060 
rubber installation now we've done our
multiple<00:02:25.210> cleaning<00:02:25.600> applications<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.950> we're

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
multiple cleaning applications and we're

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.460 
multiple cleaning applications and we're
starting<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.490> get<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> tire<00:02:27.970> clean<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:29.350> know

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
starting to get the tire clean we know

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.780 
starting to get the tire clean we know
it's<00:02:29.650> starting<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.980> become<00:02:30.100> clean<00:02:30.550> for<00:02:30.760> two

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
it's starting to become clean for two

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.280 
it's starting to become clean for two
reasons<00:02:31.270> one<00:02:31.330> we're<00:02:31.690> feeling<00:02:31.960> some<00:02:32.110> good

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
reasons one we're feeling some good

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.140 
reasons one we're feeling some good
resistance<00:02:32.890> against<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.310> rag<00:02:33.520> as<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:33.880> scrub

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
resistance against the rag as we scrub

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.970 
resistance against the rag as we scrub
and<00:02:34.420> we're<00:02:34.930> actually<00:02:35.080> pulling<00:02:35.380> away<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.710> little

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and we're actually pulling away a little

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.610 
and we're actually pulling away a little
bit<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.160> fibers<00:02:36.580> off<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.090> rag<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:38.350> tells

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
bit of fibers off the rag and that tells

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.890 
bit of fibers off the rag and that tells
us<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.010> rubber<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.490> actually<00:02:39.900> gripping

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
us that the rubber is actually gripping

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.260 
us that the rubber is actually gripping
against<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.380> rag<00:02:41.620> now<00:02:42.580> as<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.820> can<00:02:42.880> see<00:02:42.970> here

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
against the rag now as you can see here

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.520 
against the rag now as you can see here
another<00:02:43.450> thing<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.840> we<00:02:43.930> noticed<00:02:44.230> says<00:02:44.380> we're

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
another thing that we noticed says we're

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.170 
another thing that we noticed says we're
not<00:02:44.560> pulling<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.070> lot<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.280> black<00:02:45.459> gunk<00:02:45.760> off<00:02:45.940> a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
not pulling a lot of black gunk off a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.210 
not pulling a lot of black gunk off a
little<00:02:46.360> bit<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.570> residue<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:47.110> fine<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.950> tells

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
little bit of residue is fine that tells

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.560 
little bit of residue is fine that tells
you<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.459> you're<00:02:48.610> getting<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.910> tire<00:02:49.090> extra

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
you that you're getting the tire extra

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.900 
you that you're getting the tire extra
clean<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:49.990> again<00:02:50.350> cleanliness<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.670> most

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
clean and again cleanliness is the most

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.970 
clean and again cleanliness is the most
important<00:02:52.480> part<00:02:52.720> when<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.989> comes<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
important part when it comes to the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.350 
important part when it comes to the
long-lasting<00:02:54.640> tread<00:02:54.880> wear<00:02:55.060> letters

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
