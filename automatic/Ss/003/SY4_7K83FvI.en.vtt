progress<00:01:10.720> is<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:12.050> amount<00:01:12.229> of<00:01:12.320> progressions

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
progress is the amount of progressions

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:23.050 
progress is the amount of progressions
for<00:01:14.120> me<00:01:14.240> personally

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.580 

spot<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.240> very<00:01:24.630> good<00:01:24.810> at<00:01:24.899> particular<00:01:25.109> for<00:01:25.469> leaf

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
spot is very good at particular for leaf

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.639 
spot is very good at particular for leaf
in<00:01:25.770> certain<00:01:26.159> movements<00:01:27.259> just<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
in certain movements just because of the

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.139 
in certain movements just because of the
layout<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> place<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.789> can<00:01:29.969> link

layout of the place you can link
obstacle<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> obstacle<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.469> can<00:01:31.649> create<00:01:31.859> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
obstacle to obstacle you can create a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.609 
obstacle to obstacle you can create a
lot<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> fluid<00:01:33.270> movement<00:01:33.689> over<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> whole

lot of fluid movement over the whole

lot of fluid movement over the whole
place<00:01:35.090> progression<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.179> that<00:01:36.359> sense<00:01:36.630> is

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
place progression in that sense is

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.980 
place progression in that sense is
amplified<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.549> link<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.780> many

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
amplified if you can link so many

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.660 
amplified if you can link so many
movements<00:01:40.170> together<00:01:40.469> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.429> do<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> full

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
movements together you can do a full

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.209 
movements together you can do a full
sequence<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.719> movements<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:43.200> better<00:01:43.799> yourself

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
sequence of movements a better yourself

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.279 
sequence of movements a better yourself
you<00:01:44.399> better<00:01:44.579> mindset<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.929> better<00:01:46.109> the

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
you better mindset and you better the

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.959 
you better mindset and you better the
stamina<00:01:46.709> that's<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> able<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.670> lend<00:01:47.789> your

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
stamina that's the able to lend your

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:55.460 
stamina that's the able to lend your
muscular<00:01:48.390> endurance

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.410 

I<00:01:55.530> guess<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.370> spot<00:01:56.610> could<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.030> bad<00:01:57.210> for

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
I guess the spot could be bad for

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.210 
I guess the spot could be bad for
freerunning<00:01:57.660> because<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.440> state<00:01:59.010> of<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
freerunning because of the state of the

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.680 
freerunning because of the state of the
walls<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> minute<00:02:00.090> some<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:00.540> walls

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
walls at the minute some of the walls

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.960 
walls at the minute some of the walls
are<00:02:00.870> quite<00:02:01.020> loose<00:02:01.260> while<00:02:01.620> me<00:02:02.520> personally<00:02:02.910> I

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
are quite loose while me personally I

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.280 
are quite loose while me personally I
feel<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.150> just<00:02:03.510> presents<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.900> good<00:02:04.080> challenge

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
feel that just presents a good challenge

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.800 
feel that just presents a good challenge
it's<00:02:05.280> something<00:02:05.730> you<00:02:06.240> should<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.450> aware<00:02:06.570> of

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it's something you should be aware of

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.320 
it's something you should be aware of
other<00:02:07.200> people<00:02:07.530> might<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.270> very

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
other people might think that is very

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330 
other people might think that is very
dangerous<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.649> shouldn't<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.070> on<00:02:11.160> that

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
dangerous and I shouldn't be on that

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.250 
dangerous and I shouldn't be on that
