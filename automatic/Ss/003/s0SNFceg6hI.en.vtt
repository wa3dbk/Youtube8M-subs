00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.789
 balconies in the yard 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.029
 is ran or premier w that a very heavy test 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.029
 Why the temperature? 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:25.029
 changes very quickly, it warms up a lot of processor and although we 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.839
 nitrogen it does a part part with which it works 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.130
 will do with what with a lot of instability we will try to run 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:33.510
 good 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.769
 to break the world record like trying first with 5405 megahertz 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.490
 I'll try to launch 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.260
 the memories to the dialogue with the north indicates 470 that the new group the memories 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.790
 are to 1852 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.200
 st 7 7 20 also at a good air level 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.890
 You're used to latecomers for me. 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.650
 O 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.210
 6 is with four cores right 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.840
 is she or 8 300 in this case we are 12 is much heavier and much more 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.900
 difficult stays 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.010
 too much 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.570
 in the evaluation is much more abrupt they will try to correct it now 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.590
 I change the temperature and chose to come here. 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.730
 we got the temperature at 108 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.010
 I'll leave it here for you to follow. 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.610
 How are you going to put it? 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.970
 how is she going to have a 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.010
 a very abrupt variation 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.560
 This makes it easier with what. 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.960
 with which the program trainee him 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.680
 would have to work 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.970
 Starting now is twisting back. 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.080
 with the dean to take classes 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 the 6 6 seconds that the world record 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.780
 Cuca temperature 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.970
 no rating 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.270
 already dropped a lot and temperature starts to increase works 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.270
 enough 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.320
 many have to complain 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.320
 complete with the fifth 21% of the test 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.960
 23 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.679
 is here 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.509
 there was any 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.349
 and people are excited 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.269
 It's too early to come. 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.269
 to break a world record there 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.309
 still a new processor, right? 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:28.179
 many new billion and the people record and many others 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.169
 it's summer many adjustments still proceed 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.529
 fritzl and charles 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.529
 this must take place at this level 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.890
 mainly why I spoke on the screen very abrupt variation of 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.799
 temperature drops 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.089
 of 22 degrees beijing criticized began 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:53.489
 with great pride of 108 110 now has around 90 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.250
 this variation of 20 degrees and very cough 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.569
 strong dash 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.199
 It was a job at that level. 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.199
 a gt motivate 2% also coming near the end 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:07.260
 the world record to 106 according to 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.949
 we are there 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.969
 next in there 87 seconds 94% 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.009
 96 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.609
 98 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:24.149
 93 5 points 4 half 8 we just beat the world record of crime hint as 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.069
 registry 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.139
 the result 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.899
 the uniform 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:33.899
 the bar owner 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.489
 Hey everybody, trying to break our record 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.319
 had 93 point six seconds 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.029
 and it's not easy, you saw that he died 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:49.789
 98% 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:52.989
 is very difficult 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.989
 now the goal is to reach 92 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.229
 I want 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:59.499
 and if we can 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.529
 I uploaded the low 90 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.529
 comment below 1 1/2 minutes that 90 seconds 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:08.609
 and tell him would you say it was 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.609
 a brand that can close the account for today 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.519
 say the very sudden temperature variation 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.370
 and this favored shutting down the machine or 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.759
 instability 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.159
 crisis all this kind of problem that we have 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.470
 and how much closer to the end of the race 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.150
 more defender to complete 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.150
 completing 70 percent 73 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.490
 it's very strong 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.910
 80% lack 20% what the 20% most difficult of the 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.180
 90% of production to 10% 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.809
 we have 34 seconds 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:01.569
 26 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.009
 98 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.569
 92 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:06.310
 5 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.689
 with seven or eight 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.689
 hit our record now 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.339
 some 5457 denied 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.719
 in August getting well 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.819
 let's paint 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.819
 memory 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.330
 saves 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.330
 in artur moraes village 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.939
 the isolated leader in the attack 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.650
 in the state 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.729
 closed to improve 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.930
 quique 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.960
 the North Korean attack 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.689
 the complaint 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:17.089
 the internal system 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:20.169
 frears 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.169
 and completed 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.749
 in relation to October 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:30.150
 extreme 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.130
 ef 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.949
 above others 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.949
 do not know 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.029
 and that this rocked me 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:43.509
 in full crisis 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.509
 and what she can do 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.479
 and if you want to see 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.789
 As soon as it has come to an end 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:03.789
 the couple scored against 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:08.569
 it can not be 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.240
 pochmann 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.100
 hugo still in 2010 in order in narration 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:20.830
 black saw 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.210
 with dollar and pound 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.210
 in the first place we must seek a victory 

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:28.999
 we managed 

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:31.999
 incredible brand of nine children 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:35.809
 the court of appeals 

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:38.000
 at 425 00 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.490
 needing to relax the memory a bit 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.469
 failed 

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:44.469
 highest level 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:50.689
 Today is our Lady of the Macabu River. 

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:54.069
 we managed to show that it's a delight 

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:58.249
 bulls managed to catch two the micro-bus hit records at 

00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:59.740
 opening of the world cup 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.089
 and it is that the service is paralyzed 

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:05.089
 the spokesman of the Vatican 

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:10.159
 the side
