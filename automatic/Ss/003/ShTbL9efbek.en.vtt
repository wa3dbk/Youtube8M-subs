opposite<00:00:26.789> hand<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.150> foot<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.199> look

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
opposite hand and foot but if you look

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.720 
opposite hand and foot but if you look
at<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> other<00:00:28.800> way<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.279> fine

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
at the other way it's fine

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
at the other way it's fine

see<00:02:52.490> which<00:02:52.640> one's<00:02:52.880> more<00:02:53.090> comfortable<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.840> do

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
see which one's more comfortable to do

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.650

whichever one is easier for you you

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.270 
whichever one is easier for you you
should<00:02:56.870> keep<00:02:56.989> practicing<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.800> try<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.160> one

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
should keep practicing and try that one

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.070 
should keep practicing and try that one
first<00:02:58.989> practice

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
first practice

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.820 
first practice
you<00:03:01.200> see<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.520> her<00:03:03.060> feet
