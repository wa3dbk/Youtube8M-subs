00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
increase the size of it and let's
feather<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.210> some<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.420> let's<00:01:22.259> turn<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.530> auto

the<00:01:25.320> saturation<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:27.119> paint<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
the saturation and just paint in the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.890 
the saturation and just paint in the
blue<00:01:28.939> okay<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.479> playing<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

saturation and with that auto mask on it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.880 
saturation and with that auto mask on it

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that's a pretty good job of not hitting

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.649 
that's a pretty good job of not hitting
the<00:01:35.369> building<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.350> give<00:01:37.350> me<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> nod<00:01:37.890> look<00:01:38.659> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
brush I want to bump the exposure bit

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.830 
brush I want to bump the exposure bit
and<00:01:55.560> I'm<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.030> pop<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> exposure<00:01:57.659> on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and I'm going to pop the exposure on

and I'm going to pop the exposure on
these<00:01:57.990> clouds<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.500> bit<00:01:59.750> it's<00:02:00.750> kind<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:00.990> like

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
these clouds a bit it's kind of like

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.249 
these clouds a bit it's kind of like
that<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.329> backslash<00:02:04.110> key

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
that so here is with the backslash key

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.770 
that so here is with the backslash key
before<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.600> after<00:02:06.600> look<00:02:08.090> into<00:02:09.090> our<00:02:09.300> watermark

effects<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.260> choose<00:02:23.500> opacity<00:02:24.250> for<00:02:24.490> it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
effects you can choose opacity for it

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.390 
effects you can choose opacity for it
proportional<00:02:26.410> size<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.010> if<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.160> turn<00:02:27.250> that

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
proportional size and if you turn that

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.000 
proportional size and if you turn that
off<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.880> can<00:02:28.030> hit<00:02:28.120> fit<00:02:28.420> or<00:02:28.600> fill<00:02:29.020> whatever

you'd<00:02:30.250> like<00:02:30.690> okay<00:02:31.690> proportional<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.500> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
you'd like okay proportional to the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.890 
you'd like okay proportional to the
original<00:02:32.980> size<00:02:33.160> image<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.700> then<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.750> can

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
original size image and then you can

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.720 
original size image and then you can
insert<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.530> move<00:02:35.740> it<00:02:35.860> basically<00:02:36.430> wherever

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
insert it and move it basically wherever

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.580 
insert it and move it basically wherever
in<00:02:37.030> Lightroom<00:02:37.420> as<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:37.900> Photoshop<00:02:38.380> but

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
in Lightroom as it is in Photoshop but

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.500 
in Lightroom as it is in Photoshop but
we're<00:02:38.740> going<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> not<00:02:39.130> open<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.820> Lightroom

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
we're going to not open it in Lightroom

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.640 
we're going to not open it in Lightroom
we're<00:02:40.690> actually<00:02:40.840> just<00:02:41.080> going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.320> let<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.470> be

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
we're actually just going to let it be

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.610 
we're actually just going to let it be
automated<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.400> what<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.450> does<00:02:43.660> very<00:02:44.170> simply

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
automated and what it does very simply

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.440 
automated and what it does very simply
is<00:02:44.770> smooth<00:02:45.400> out<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:45.760> face<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.120> she's<00:02:46.270> got<00:02:46.420> a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
is smooth out this face and she's got a

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.630 
is smooth out this face and she's got a
little<00:02:46.660> too<00:02:46.930> much<00:02:47.080> going<00:02:47.380> on<00:02:47.440> right<00:02:47.500> here<00:02:47.680> so

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
little too much going on right here so

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.160 
little too much going on right here so
we<00:02:48.730> might<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.180> play<00:02:49.690> with<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.900> controls

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
we might have to play with the controls

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.990 
we might have to play with the controls
a<00:02:50.260> little<00:02:50.470> bit<00:02:50.590> but<00:02:50.950> if<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.130> hold<00:02:51.310> my<00:02:51.490> mouse<00:02:51.700> down

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
a little bit but if I hold my mouse down

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.700 
a little bit but if I hold my mouse down
you<00:02:52.150> can<00:02:52.270> see<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.540> original<00:02:52.630> image<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.560> if<00:02:53.650> I

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
you can see the original image and if I

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.470 
you can see the original image and if I
let<00:02:53.920> go<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.130> actually<00:02:54.670> can<00:02:54.820> see<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.180> skin

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
let go you actually can see the skin

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.500 
let go you actually can see the skin
softening<00:02:56.050> look<00:02:56.560> down<00:02:56.740> here<00:02:56.890> on<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.040> chin<00:02:57.510> but

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
softening look down here on the chin but

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.450 
softening look down here on the chin but
what's<00:02:58.660> nice<00:02:58.840> about<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.440> it's<00:03:00.070> that<00:03:00.310> it

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
what's nice about this is it's that it

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.570 
what's nice about this is it's that it
doesn't<00:03:00.880> take<00:03:01.240> away<00:03:01.390> too<00:03:01.600> much<00:03:01.960> detail<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.710> the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
doesn't take away too much detail in the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.020 
doesn't take away too much detail in the
eyes<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.010> nose<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.460> mouth<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:06.910> so

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
eyes up in the nose and the mouth and so

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.210 
eyes up in the nose and the mouth and so
on
