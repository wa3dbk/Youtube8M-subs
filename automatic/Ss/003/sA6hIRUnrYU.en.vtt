00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.460 

I'm<00:00:01.619> gonna<00:00:01.800> create<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.189> lariat<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.270> lasso<00:00:03.870> with<00:00:04.200> a

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
I'm gonna create a lariat a lasso with a

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.339 
I'm gonna create a lariat a lasso with a
Honda<00:00:04.919> knot<00:00:05.629> you<00:00:06.629> can<00:00:06.689> probably<00:00:07.109> use<00:00:07.319> a

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:07.349 
Honda knot you can probably use a

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:09.380 
Honda knot you can probably use a
running<00:00:07.799> bowline<00:00:08.160> but<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.700> think<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.210> is

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.390 
running bowline but I think this is

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.020 
running bowline but I think this is
easier<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.020> tie<00:00:10.200> I'm<00:00:10.920> right-handed<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.580> I'm

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
easier to tie I'm right-handed so I'm

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.200 
easier to tie I'm right-handed so I'm
gonna<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:13.100> working<00:00:14.100> in<00:00:14.340> facing<00:00:14.910> my

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
gonna have the working in facing my

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.409 
gonna have the working in facing my
right<00:00:16.009> alright<00:00:17.009> so<00:00:17.699> first<00:00:17.970> off<00:00:18.179> we're<00:00:18.300> gonna

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:18.419 
right alright so first off we're gonna

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.109 
right alright so first off we're gonna
do<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.779> stop<00:00:19.019> or<00:00:19.169> not<00:00:19.289> near<00:00:19.769> the<00:00:20.009> working<00:00:20.970> end

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
do is stop or not near the working end

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.779 
do is stop or not near the working end
I'm<00:00:21.839> gonna<00:00:22.079> do<00:00:22.259> a<00:00:22.289> simple<00:00:22.650> overhand<00:00:22.890> knot<00:00:25.789> give

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
I'm gonna do a simple overhand knot give

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.849 
I'm gonna do a simple overhand knot give
a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.419> bit<00:00:27.599> more<00:00:27.869> length<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.499> the<00:00:28.650> rope

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
a little bit more length in the rope

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.339 
a little bit more length in the rope
because<00:00:29.179> you'll<00:00:30.179> need<00:00:30.329> it<00:00:30.539> we're<00:00:31.019> gonna<00:00:31.140> do

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
because you'll need it we're gonna do

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.650 
because you'll need it we're gonna do
another<00:00:31.560> overhand<00:00:31.949> right<00:00:32.460> around<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:35.660> now

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
another overhand right around here now

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.050 
another overhand right around here now
if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.470> analyze<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:37.920> overhand<00:00:38.550> knot<00:00:38.730> you've

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
if you analyze this overhand knot you've

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.240 
if you analyze this overhand knot you've
got<00:00:39.560> two<00:00:40.560> loops<00:00:41.330> one<00:00:42.330> loop<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.860> closest

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
got two loops one loop that is closest

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.150 
got two loops one loop that is closest
to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> working<00:00:45.330> end<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.960> another<00:00:46.890> loop

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
to the working end here another loop

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790 
to the working end here another loop
that<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.700> closest<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.330> standing<00:00:49.050> end<00:00:49.170> here

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that is closest to the standing end here

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.090 
that is closest to the standing end here
okay<00:00:50.960> with<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.260> loop<00:00:52.470> closest<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
okay with the loop closest to the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.090 
okay with the loop closest to the
working<00:00:53.400> end<00:00:53.490> I'm<00:00:53.640> gonna<00:00:54.560> feed<00:00:55.560> the<00:00:55.740> working

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
working end I'm gonna feed the working

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.310 
working end I'm gonna feed the working
in<00:00:56.220> through<00:00:56.550> that

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.009 

and<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:03.030> creates<00:01:03.449> another<00:01:03.719> loop

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and as I do that it creates another loop

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.649 
and as I do that it creates another loop
here<00:01:04.640> okay<00:01:05.640> there's<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:07.200> my<00:01:07.259> over<00:01:07.619> hang<00:01:07.740> on

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
here okay there's my is my over hang on

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
here okay there's my is my over hang on
as<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.780> go<00:01:09.899> through<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.350> loop<00:01:10.799> closest<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
as I go through that loop closest to the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.719 
as I go through that loop closest to the
working<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.720> create<00:01:13.290> another<00:01:13.670> loop<00:01:14.670> here

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
working and create another loop here

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.469 
working and create another loop here
this<00:01:15.630> will<00:01:15.899> eventually<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.060> loop<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
this will eventually be the loop or the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.109 
this will eventually be the loop or the
I<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.530> Honda<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:20.070> I'm<00:01:20.430> gonna<00:01:20.610> pinch<00:01:20.940> on

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
I in the Honda not I'm gonna pinch on

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.020 
I in the Honda not I'm gonna pinch on
that<00:01:21.299> we're<00:01:21.630> gonna<00:01:21.720> pull<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:23.030> standing

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that we're gonna pull on the standing

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
that we're gonna pull on the standing
end<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.140> longer<00:01:25.500> part<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> rope<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
end it's a longer part of the rope and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
end it's a longer part of the rope and
that<00:01:27.320> will<00:01:28.320> constrict<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:29.479> or<00:01:30.860> near<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
that will constrict on or near the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.880 
that will constrict on or near the
descending<00:01:33.360> end<00:01:33.509> I'm<00:01:34.020> sorry<00:01:34.319> the<00:01:34.440> working<00:01:34.740> end

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
descending end I'm sorry the working end

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.770 
descending end I'm sorry the working end
and<00:01:35.869> there<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.080> there's<00:01:37.800> a<00:01:37.860> Honda<00:01:38.190> not<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
and there it is there's a Honda not and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
and there it is there's a Honda not and
here's<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.979> stopper<00:01:41.429> that's<00:01:41.759> needed<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
here's the stopper that's needed to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.690 
here's the stopper that's needed to
prevent<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> from<00:01:42.659> slipping<00:01:42.990> through<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:44.490> is

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
prevent it from slipping through this is

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.230 
prevent it from slipping through this is
the<00:01:44.729> eye<00:01:44.819> that's<00:01:45.119> created<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> lasso

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
the eye that's created and for the lasso

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.770 
the eye that's created and for the lasso
part<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.420> need<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.750> feed<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:50.630> standing<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
part you need to feed these standing in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.279 
part you need to feed these standing in
through<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.560> eye<00:01:52.590> through<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.580> loop<00:01:54.289> and

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
through the eye through the loop and

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.960 
through the eye through the loop and
there's<00:01:55.470> your<00:01:55.590> lasso<00:01:55.950> lariat<00:01:57.920> all<00:01:58.920> right<00:01:59.039> now

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
there's your lasso lariat all right now

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.730 
there's your lasso lariat all right now
there's<00:02:02.970> here's<00:02:03.360> another<00:02:03.600> method<00:02:04.049> which<00:02:04.470> will

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
there's here's another method which will

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.449 
there's here's another method which will
create<00:02:05.069> the<00:02:05.369> lasso<00:02:06.050> without<00:02:07.050> feeding<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
create the lasso without feeding the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.750 
create the lasso without feeding the
standing<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.239> through<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> longer

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
standing in through this is a longer

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.990 
standing in through this is a longer
piece<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.180> rope<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.720> will<00:02:13.410> help<00:02:13.709> in<00:02:14.000> having

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
piece of rope this will help in having

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.070 
piece of rope this will help in having
access<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.450> little<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:16.230> lasso<00:02:16.620> as<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:18.390> you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
access to a little the lasso as you you

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.270 
access to a little the lasso as you you
know<00:02:19.170> complete<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> knot<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:21.830> we<00:02:22.830> first<00:02:23.099> need

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
know complete the knot and we first need

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.820 
know complete the knot and we first need
to<00:02:23.370> do<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.690> they<00:02:24.690> stop<00:02:24.959> or<00:02:25.080> not<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.739> this

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
to do a they stop or not and in this

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.220 
to do a they stop or not and in this
case<00:02:26.040> I'm<00:02:26.190> going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> do<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> double<00:02:27.120> overhand

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.870 

it's<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.320> thicker<00:02:32.560> rope<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> double

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
it's a thicker rope I like the double

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.370 
it's a thicker rope I like the double
overhand<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.540> can<00:02:34.690> do<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> figure<00:02:35.080> eight<00:02:35.230> if

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
overhand you can do a figure eight if

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.490 
overhand you can do a figure eight if
you<00:02:35.410> want<00:02:35.680> there's<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.340> my<00:02:36.790> double<00:02:37.060> overhand

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
you want there's a my double overhand

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.280 
you want there's a my double overhand
okay<00:02:39.390> I'm<00:02:40.390> going<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.630> give<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.900> some<00:02:40.930> length

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
okay I'm going to give it some length

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.370 
okay I'm going to give it some length
and<00:02:41.800> I'm<00:02:42.430> gonna<00:02:42.610> do<00:02:42.820> my<00:02:43.080> overhand<00:02:44.080> knot<00:02:44.200> again

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
and I'm gonna do my overhand knot again

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.930 
and I'm gonna do my overhand knot again
similar<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.520> first<00:02:45.700> demo<00:02:47.670> I'm<00:02:48.670> just

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
similar to the first demo I'm just

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.630 
similar to the first demo I'm just
working<00:02:49.930> end<00:02:50.820> overhand<00:02:51.820> knot<00:02:52.000> standing<00:02:52.750> end

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
working end overhand knot standing end

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.480 
working end overhand knot standing end
now<00:02:55.140> instead<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.200> going<00:02:56.440> through<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.220> going

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
now instead of going through and going

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.790 
now instead of going through and going
through<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.880> loop<00:02:58.420> created<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.500> then

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
through the loop created and then

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.990 
through the loop created and then
there's<00:03:00.010> my<00:03:00.160> Honda<00:03:01.500> I'm<00:03:02.500> gonna<00:03:02.830> add<00:03:03.520> an<00:03:03.700> extra

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
there's my Honda I'm gonna add an extra

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.480 
there's my Honda I'm gonna add an extra
step<00:03:04.090> by<00:03:04.450> crossing<00:03:05.440> by<00:03:05.740> going<00:03:06.010> over<00:03:06.280> the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
step by crossing by going over the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.860 
step by crossing by going over the
standing<00:03:07.330> end<00:03:08.370> around<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.850> I'm<00:03:10.660> gonna

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
standing end around it and I'm gonna

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.360 
standing end around it and I'm gonna
grab<00:03:12.450> first<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.750> should<00:03:13.960> grab<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:17.280> standing<00:03:18.280> in

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
grab first I should grab the standing in

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.790 
grab first I should grab the standing in

I'm gonna go over this with my working

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.870 
I'm gonna go over this with my working
end<00:03:26.730> around<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.600> since<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.680> have<00:03:29.920> my<00:03:30.190> two
