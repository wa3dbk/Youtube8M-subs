00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
of the critique says like the first half

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.530 
of the critique says like the first half
which<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.350> part<00:01:28.530> I've<00:01:28.650> read<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.159> slow<00:01:29.540> because

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
which is part I've read is slow because

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
which is part I've read is slow because
I<00:01:30.780> suppose<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.619> lot<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> action<00:01:32.189> happens<00:01:32.520> in

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
I suppose not a lot of action happens in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.950 
I suppose not a lot of action happens in
the<00:01:32.700> first<00:01:32.880> half<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> book<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> me<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the first half of the book but to me I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.200 
the first half of the book but to me I
don't<00:01:34.259> mind<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> know

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
don't mind it because you get to know

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
don't mind it because you get to know
the<00:01:36.360> main<00:01:36.509> character<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.200> basically<00:01:37.860> his

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the main character and basically his

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.280 
the main character and basically his
plight<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.640> his<00:01:38.759> background<00:01:39.270> story<00:01:39.570> which<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
plight and his background story which I

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.080 
plight and his background story which I
like<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> lot<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.460> character<00:01:41.880> setup

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
like I like a lot of character setup

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.310 
like I like a lot of character setup
because<00:01:42.420> then<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.600> feel<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.840> lot<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.049> sympathy

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
because then I feel a lot of sympathy

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.109 
because then I feel a lot of sympathy
for<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> character<00:01:44.250> later<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.640> plus<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.000> know

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
for the character later on plus I know

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
for the character later on plus I know
this<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.420> gonna<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> series<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.350> think

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
this is gonna be a series so I think

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.810 
this is gonna be a series so I think
having<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.450> know<00:01:48.710> well-written

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
having a really you know well-written

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
having a really you know well-written
background<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.000> important<00:01:51.479> besides<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
background is important besides that I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.800 
background is important besides that I
also<00:01:53.399> find<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.909> writing<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
also find the writing and the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.230 
also find the writing and the
perspective<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.860> very<00:01:56.250> unique<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.030> don't

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
perspective to be very unique I don't

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.450 
perspective to be very unique I don't
know<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.140> very<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:59.219> almost

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
know like it's a very it's almost

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.090 
know like it's a very it's almost
strangely<00:02:00.329> written<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.890> really

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
strangely written it's kind of really

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.429 
strangely written it's kind of really
hard<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.399> describe<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> beginning

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
hard to describe it it in the beginning

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.350 
hard to describe it it in the beginning
it's<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.740> third-person<00:02:05.340> perspective<00:02:05.700> which<00:02:06.210> is

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
it's a third-person perspective which is

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.479 
it's a third-person perspective which is
really<00:02:06.780> cool<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.380> he<00:02:07.680> almost<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.280> kind

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
really cool and he almost you can kind

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.279 
really cool and he almost you can kind
of<00:02:08.520> tell<00:02:08.759> how<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.209> kind<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> almost<00:02:09.750> crazy

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
of tell how like kind of almost crazy

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.330 
of tell how like kind of almost crazy
and<00:02:10.560> unhinged<00:02:11.009> he

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and unhinged he

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.370 
and unhinged he
but<00:02:11.819> then<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.030> switches<00:02:12.300> when<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.050> goes<00:02:13.170> it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
but then it switches when it goes it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.490 
but then it switches when it goes it
jumps<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.770> past<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:15.500> first-person

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
jumps in the past to a first-person

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.699 
jumps in the past to a first-person
perspective<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:18.209> really<00:02:18.720> interesting

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
perspective and it's really interesting

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.740 
perspective and it's really interesting
like<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.610> don't<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.330> can<00:02:21.420> kind<00:02:21.630> of
