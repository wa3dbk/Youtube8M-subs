00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.380
 I think so 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.510
 First of all, apologies for not having 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.510
 uploaded video last week but then 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.660
 you know how in life sometimes they give you 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.460
 Sometimes it takes away from you if it's a song 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.110
 I think it 's a song is heard as 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.610
 a song but if the important thing is that 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.960
 I 'm back here on this channel 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.340
 and today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.590
 backpack super super easy bags 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.630
 to make the truth beautifully different 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.430
 it's more than as unique you do not have to be 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.530
 exactly as I already know there are 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.350
 I am always a bad ideas and you 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.670
 they can recreate it as they like but yes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 It's very small I made it from a little bag 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.350
 which is called top box that sell the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.180
 true everywhere in walmart the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.360
 I bought this jail or like a dollar and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.880
 fair and then use a potato to paint it 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.760
 This girl can use for school 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.530
 that is, on the beach of the park , whatever 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.750
 to me the truth I loved and mochilita 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.659
 is very cool if you want to learn to 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.310
 make these backpacks the super sachets 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.399
 super easy if changing 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.399
 ah 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.820
 These are materials a bag e needles 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.170
 Thin black string thread and also a 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.910
 gross 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.500
 we will start cutting only one 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.030
 grab if you want cut is fine 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.030
 but I want to grab it from one side 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.910
 Now let's make two holes for 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.910
 opposite in the hem 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.650
 and now several from the inside 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.960
 the reason why I'm doing well 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.670
 it's because it has seams so it would have 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.130
 to choose all the seams for 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.540
 pass the rope all the way down the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.070
 it made the truth a lot easier for me 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.190
 this way but you can do it like you 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.190
 you like 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.820
 now we are going to open ourselves to rope leaving 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.730
 the longest to be able to tie 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.129
 good 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.239
 use a pin to pass more 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.239
 easy for all the eyes 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.860
 Y 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.130
 now with our thick rope we will do 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.130
 the shoulder straps of the backpack 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.180
 we're going to make a habit for the part 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.280
 back just below the hem and around 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.700
 We will put the rope to sew by 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.700
 in 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.359
 yes 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.270
 I almost used black thread but it 's notary 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.069
 so you are closer to the color of 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.189
 the bag 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.189
 and the thing we are very very very very well 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.189
 i 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.040
 and now we take it from the bottom 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.040
 in this way 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.379
 here the thread of the color of the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.269
 rope to make it more beautiful but the 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.019
 true my other lips and keep using 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.019
 the target 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.810
 now we only take the other tie equal 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.880
 that this and our bag is already backpack 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.680
 to paint it use a thinner to 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.200
 fabrics so that it is not so hard 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.180
 paint and mix it with black paint from 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.980
 already done it but it is not 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.130
 adding the camera to cycles that is another 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.130
 time 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.810
 As I said, use a potato to paint 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.950
 the triangles choose the measure that 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.480
 we are going to cut it a little less 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.560
 of the half and now we're going to mark 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.840
 slightly the design that we want already 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.540
 that you stay as you want we cut it 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.540
 well and we should have something like that 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.010
 do not 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.189
 Now we only apply paint if 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.530
 you want the figure to look good 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.319
 put more paint than me to me the truth 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.090
 I like it more as well as worn out so 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.650
 I did not put so much paint on him and only 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.650
 we press the potato and ready 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.650
 I want 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.400
 another option that they can do is cut 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.400
 a celery 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.550
 and as you can see it seems like he recites it 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.740
 so we put painting 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.970
 we press where we want and we 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.970
 it is as requested 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.830
 and another idea can cut an apple 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.090
 in half 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.920
 then we put again paint and the 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.430
 we press and we have the design of 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.430
 the manzanita 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.570
 you 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:54.990
 and I wanted to be only three rows of 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.990
 triangles 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.440
 ah 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.410
 one 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.410
 I hope you liked this 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.479
