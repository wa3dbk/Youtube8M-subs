 good for installing memory modules have 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.700
 two slots however on tests we had 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.520
 laptop with one module 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.610

 second and even more 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.430
 with graphics settings to maximum 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.740

 refers to the gaming solution 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.110
 mid level except good level 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.810
 performance worth notebook 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.100
