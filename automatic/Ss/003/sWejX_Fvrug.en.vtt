were to jam the front of the firearm
into<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.750> window<00:03:14.020> not<00:03:14.170> only<00:03:14.440> would<00:03:14.590> we<00:03:14.710> maybe

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
into the window not only would we maybe

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.710 
into the window not only would we maybe
not<00:03:15.160> reach<00:03:15.400> full<00:03:15.640> extension<00:03:16.030> but<00:03:16.600> it's

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
not reach full extension but it's

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.060 
not reach full extension but it's
possible<00:03:17.110> we<00:03:17.230> could<00:03:17.320> take<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.650> firearm<00:03:18.040> out

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
possible we could take the firearm out

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.470 
possible we could take the firearm out
of<00:03:18.220> battery<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.760> wouldn't<00:03:18.970> fire<00:03:19.180> at<00:03:19.360> all

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
of battery and it wouldn't fire at all

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.320 
of battery and it wouldn't fire at all
so<00:03:20.140> we're<00:03:20.260> gonna<00:03:20.380> lean<00:03:20.620> back<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.250> extend<00:03:21.820> this

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
so we're gonna lean back and extend this

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.940 
so we're gonna lean back and extend this
way<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:22.570> that<00:03:22.810> we<00:03:22.900> have<00:03:23.080> enough<00:03:23.380> room<00:03:23.650> inside

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
way so that we have enough room inside

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.510 
way so that we have enough room inside
the<00:03:24.340> vehicle<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.120> get<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.510> extension<00:03:26.520> in

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
the vehicle to get that extension in

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.760 
the vehicle to get that extension in
front<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:27.940> our<00:03:28.060> line<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.540> sight<00:03:28.650> parallel<00:03:29.650> with

our line of sight towards the threat and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.010 
our line of sight towards the threat and
then<00:03:32.080> touch<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.650> press<00:03:32.920> as<00:03:33.160> appropriate<00:03:34.030> if

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
then touch and press as appropriate if

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.690 
then touch and press as appropriate if
we<00:03:35.290> were<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.530> we<00:03:35.620> want<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:35.920> get<00:03:36.070> out<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.550> the

vehicle with a firearm drawn one of the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.920 
vehicle with a firearm drawn one of the
best<00:03:39.640> ways<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:39.880> do<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.390> without<00:03:40.720> worrying

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
best ways to do this without worrying

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.479 
best ways to do this without worrying
about<00:03:41.110> getting<00:03:41.350> hung<00:03:41.739> up<00:03:41.860> on<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.070> steering

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
about getting hung up on the steering

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.100 
about getting hung up on the steering
wheel<00:03:42.670> but<00:03:43.120> we're<00:03:43.330> going<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.510> go<00:03:43.570> into<00:03:43.900> the

wheel but we're going to go into the

wheel but we're going to go into the
steering<00:03:44.470> wheel<00:03:44.620> but<00:03:45.070> wouldn't<00:03:45.310> want<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.459> go

one<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.739> best<00:03:47.950> things<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.280> do<00:03:48.489> is<00:03:48.670> simply

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
one of the best things to do is simply

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.180 
one of the best things to do is simply

over<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.320> top<00:03:56.560> as<00:03:57.010> we<00:03:57.580> go<00:03:57.790> out<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.870> vehicle

by<00:04:00.370> doing<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:00.880> way<00:04:01.150> we<00:04:01.690> make<00:04:01.900> sure<00:04:02.080> that

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
by doing it that way we make sure that

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.380 
by doing it that way we make sure that
the<00:04:02.410> muzzle<00:04:03.010> never<00:04:03.459> points<00:04:03.910> down<00:04:04.090> at<00:04:04.300> our

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
lower body as we get out and we make

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.800 
lower body as we get out and we make
