00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Welcome to this tutorial on this 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.549
 channel and that's the motto active 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.309
 endeavor installed on her android 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.809
 first of all, you go to the link 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.809
 I grabbed the description 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 and download the hanglage version 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.600
 just click on it and then 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.619
 I 've already done that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 somehow I do not have that anymore 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.570
 next he goes to the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.519
 other link and indeed, invite you 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.689
 minecraft forge down that you see 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.349
 also there is then in the left 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.910
 description term dictates about it 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.070
 goes all the way down quite scrolls 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.230
 down all the way down and installed 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 you the once version 1.6 point 4 the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.719
 instagram click on it and then become too 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.420
 red fly forwarded and there 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.079
 Just drop it if you like this 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.590
 has done 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:58.199
 you start your minecraft has it ready 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:00.989
 has loaded and makes a new profile 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.460
 new profile click on it makes the work 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.030
 copy on yours from new names 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.670
 and startled 16.4 that's natural 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.220
 however, it is clearly arranged 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.119
 then she does not take the last version 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.840
 so not 1.799 with jesus now so 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.920
 but the version 1.6 point 4 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.810
 save that and start it 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.250
 you can start minecraft 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.310
 actually quit directly 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.800
 So leave game and minecraft 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.380
 Researched installers start the same 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.520
 has downloaded then comes a picture 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.869
 here and you make into the dress that would have 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.700
 actually as already stores his 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.100
 fame in minecraft that's actually 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 always there then he just makes ok 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.570
 then loads it 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.270
 when it has finished loading it would have to be there 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.369
 stand successfully installed client 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.189
 profile ford vw and porsche 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.280
 that could see everything here then 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:13.810
 I click okay and stared minecraft 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.459
 invited a bit 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.810
 that's why I skipped that 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.630
 the load with the then at ford in 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.360
 minecraft has loaded then go here 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.550
 not on the version 1.6 point 4 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.709
 but to the version above 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.239
 then something comes here then you have to 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.310
 just have to press up here on play 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.000
 you do not really sign up for a new one 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.620
 so easy play zack finished and then me 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.980
 display and then start your again 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.950
 minecraft if your minecraft again 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.810
 started then 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.830
 you see it is a new window 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.209
 come to it and there because it stuck there 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.010
 is actually nothing yet 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.470
 for something 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.590
 that is not important at the moment 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.940
 but then you also go pop songs 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.190
 resource that is also in 07.01 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.209
 just click on it I have now 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.110

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.519
 started 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.040
 So reinstalled and therefore 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.160
 then you just click on resource 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.099
 pack folder then up here in the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.870
 run on minecraft then you will 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.660
 forwarded to the whole model 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.860
 folders and then something new here 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.920
 otherwise it is here 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:28.500

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.569

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.260
 the mod way to the fore 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:38.910
 you click on the mod pack there 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:42.710
 you see this all this that you see 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.720
 all over in the folder 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.120
 Zack is it in there could be everything 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.940
 close soon 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.300
 so minecraft then 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.830
 then like to close again and 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.180
 minecraft strong again 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.900
 and then you just go here 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.860
 progresses it just press play 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:08.069
 and wait until this year minecraft 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.330
 installed has already started 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.980
 seen 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:17.660
 that comes my normal minecraft 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.660
 but not a bit with motech 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.940
 that would have 45 it must be experienced 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.360
 the first time that i hope not to 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.360
 long what am I doing here right now 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.190
 It does not take so long now though 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.160
 her here 44 company also makes 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.690
 nothing here 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:56.010
 all these motto better grass then goes 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.170
 singleplayer vigorously on big and 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.580
 then yes that is unimportant 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.120
 create your world of that lasts now 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.120
 not too long either 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:30.470
 then that should actually already 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:35.690
 be installed there it is done 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.419
 learned because right now so is now 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:42.700
 a little bit that too a bit 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:45.400
 because that also has to load everything first 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.820
 and that's how it looks 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:53.890
 whole and then it is installed 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.580
 everything on it that was actually that 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.170
 tutorial 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.610
 I hope you liked it if so 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.480

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.890
 reviews and if you actually the 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.180
 She then writes me criteria 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.890

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.150
 friendly because i would be in the future 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.650
