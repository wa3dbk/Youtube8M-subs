we're<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.139> if<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.379> actually<00:00:16.410> will

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
we're going to see if it actually will

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.650 
we're going to see if it actually will
run<00:00:16.920> on<00:00:17.039> 10-year<00:00:17.400> old<00:00:17.520> gas<00:00:17.699> once<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.240> runs<00:00:18.480> on

that<00:00:18.869> Prime<00:00:19.109> gets<00:00:19.500> done<00:00:19.800> running<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.250> that

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
that Prime gets done running on that

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.769 
that Prime gets done running on that
Prime<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.850> put<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> carb<00:00:23.510> this<00:00:24.510> would<00:00:24.689> be
