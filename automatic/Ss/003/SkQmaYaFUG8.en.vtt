00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
getting that rush off with the mp7 now I

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.310 
getting that rush off with the mp7 now I
never<00:00:32.880> knew<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.480> route<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.170> kind

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.540 
never knew about that route I just kind
of<00:00:34.380> felt<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.620> getting<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.010> higher<00:00:35.160> ground

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
of felt like getting the higher ground

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.280 
of felt like getting the higher ground
would<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> safer<00:00:36.420> thing<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.050> this

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
would be the safer thing to do on this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.740 
would be the safer thing to do on this
map<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> best<00:00:39.059> thing<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.420> take

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
map and it was the best thing to do take

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
map and it was the best thing to do take
that<00:00:39.870> higher<00:00:40.079> route<00:00:40.410> go<00:00:40.980> around<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> their

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that higher route go around to their

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.190 
that higher route go around to their
spawn<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.180> down<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> lower<00:00:42.750> route<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
spawn get down to the lower route and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680 
spawn get down to the lower route and
just<00:00:43.620> kind<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.890> figure<00:00:44.730> way<00:00:44.910> around<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.510> map

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
just kind of figure way around this map

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.810 
just kind of figure way around this map
now<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> made<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> big<00:00:46.530> mistake<00:00:46.739> starting<00:00:47.670> this

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820

to<00:01:29.520> quickscope<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> crap<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> everyone

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
to quickscope the crap out of everyone

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
to quickscope the crap out of everyone
then<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.560> those<00:01:31.740> kids<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.159> are<00:01:32.280> just

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
then you have those kids that are just

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.100 
then you have those kids that are just
sitting<00:01:32.579> back<00:01:32.729> hardscoping<00:01:33.509> then<00:01:33.990> you're

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
sitting back hardscoping then you're

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.510 
sitting back hardscoping then you're
gonna<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> people<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.250> camp

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
gonna have the people that just camp

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.149 
gonna have the people that just camp
corners<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.150> always<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.200> happen<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:37.950> I

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
corners as always in that happen so I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.160 
corners as always in that happen so I
would<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.880> careful<00:01:39.000> guys<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.840> new<00:01:39.990> map

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
would be careful guys with this new map

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.450 
would be careful guys with this new map
check<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.650> corners<00:01:40.860> there's<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> lot<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
check your corners there's a lot of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.679 
check your corners there's a lot of
corners<00:01:41.820> there's<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> lot<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> places<00:01:42.509> for

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
corners there's a lot of places for

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.630 
corners there's a lot of places for
people<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.170> hide<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.890> there's<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> ton<00:01:44.610> going

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
people to hide there there's a ton going

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.670 
people to hide there there's a ton going
on<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.360> map<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> found

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
on with this map and that's what I found

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.679 
on with this map and that's what I found
out<00:01:46.890> about<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.369> looked<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.180> relatively

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
out about it it looked like a relatively

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.499 
out about it it looked like a relatively
small<00:01:48.840> map<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.610> really<00:01:51.270> big

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
small map but it is really really big

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.630 
small map but it is really really big
it's<00:01:51.899> got<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> lot<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.950> there's<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.610> of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
it's got a lot to it there's a lot of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.670 
it's got a lot to it there's a lot of
roots<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.899> there's<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
roots that go in and out there's just a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.249 
roots that go in and out there's just a
lot<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.070> different<00:01:56.490> things<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.689> map<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
lot of different things to this map and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.830 
lot of different things to this map and
my<00:01:59.100> biggest<00:01:59.640> thing<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.149> would<00:02:00.270> run<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> motion

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
my biggest thing is I would run a motion

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.420 
my biggest thing is I would run a motion
sensor<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.259> baby<00:02:01.500> monitor<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.219> guys

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
sensor or a baby monitor so you guys

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.310 
sensor or a baby monitor so you guys
know<00:02:02.640> where<00:02:02.790> they're<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:03.060> at<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.420> times<00:02:03.479> if

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
know where they're at at all times if

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.289 
know where they're at at all times if
you<00:02:04.380> run<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.979> baby<00:02:05.369> monitor<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> got<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> be

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
you run that baby monitor you got to be

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.449 
you run that baby monitor you got to be
careful<00:02:06.450> because<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:08.069> don't<00:02:08.280> know

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
careful because with that you don't know

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.830 
careful because with that you don't know
if<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> guys<00:02:08.849> are<00:02:08.879> upstairs<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.569> downstairs

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
if the guys are upstairs or downstairs

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.930 
if the guys are upstairs or downstairs
so<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.530> gives<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> sense<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.580> where<00:02:11.790> they're

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
so it gives you a sense of where they're

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.730 
so it gives you a sense of where they're
coming<00:02:12.150> from<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.540> they're<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:12.900> your<00:02:13.290> level

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
coming from if they're on your level

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
coming from if they're on your level
if<00:02:14.040> they're<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.580> your<00:02:14.730> level<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:15.150> got<00:02:15.300> to

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
if they're not on your level you got to

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.370 
if they're not on your level you got to
be<00:02:15.480> careful<00:02:15.630> because<00:02:15.840> that's<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.110> thing<00:02:16.260> you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
be careful because that's the thing you

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.660 
be careful because that's the thing you
got<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.530> check<00:02:16.800> your<00:02:16.950> corner<00:02:17.280> make<00:02:17.520> sure

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
got to check your corner make sure

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.070 
got to check your corner make sure
they're<00:02:17.820> not<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.030> your<00:02:18.180> level<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:18.630> they're<00:02:18.960> not

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
they're not on your level if they're not

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.930 
they're not on your level if they're not
on<00:02:19.260> your<00:02:19.410> level<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:20.310> got<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.550> go<00:02:20.640> down<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.910> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
on your level you got to go down to the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.760 
on your level you got to go down to the
next<00:02:21.120> level<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.380> messes

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
next level and it's just it messes

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.380 
next level and it's just it messes
everything<00:02:23.010> up<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.400> there's<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:23.700> two<00:02:24.000> levels

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
everything up so there's like two levels

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.150 
everything up so there's like two levels
to<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.900> constantly<00:02:25.440> up<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.860> down<00:02:25.980> up

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
to this it's constantly up and down up

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.040 
to this it's constantly up and down up
and<00:02:26.280> down<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.240> these<00:02:27.390> windows<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.960> my

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
and down and I like these windows to my

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.510 
and down and I like these windows to my
right<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.530> know<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.800> didn't<00:02:29.040> look<00:02:29.130> at<00:02:29.280> them<00:02:29.340> that

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
right I know I didn't look at them that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.190 
right I know I didn't look at them that
long<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.180> kind<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.450> jump<00:02:30.750> up<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.050> them

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
long but you can kind of jump up on them

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.290 
long but you can kind of jump up on them
when<00:02:31.290> they're<00:02:31.440> broken<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.090> can

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
when they're broken and then you can

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.060 
when they're broken and then you can
just<00:02:33.960> pick<00:02:34.170> people<00:02:34.200> off<00:02:34.500> down<00:02:34.740> on<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.920> lower

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
just pick people off down on the lower

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.520 
just pick people off down on the lower
levels<00:02:35.460> in<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.880> right<00:02:36.360> here<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.810> where<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
levels in this right here is where the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.980 
levels in this right here is where the
BS<00:02:37.830> happened<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.400> was<00:02:38.820> somewhere<00:02:39.210> up<00:02:39.330> there<00:02:39.480> 10

didn't feel that safe in there just

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.310 
didn't feel that safe in there just
because<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.060> was<00:03:09.090> wide<00:03:09.390> open<00:03:09.420> it's<00:03:10.050> got<00:03:10.230> the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
because it was wide open it's got the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.930 
because it was wide open it's got the
windows<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.710> the<00:03:10.800> front<00:03:10.830> leading<00:03:11.370> across<00:03:11.700> to

the other side of the map if enemies are

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.890 
the other side of the map if enemies are
there<00:03:13.650> they'll<00:03:13.890> definitely<00:03:14.100> catch<00:03:14.460> me<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.300> try

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
there they'll definitely catch me so try

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.660 
there they'll definitely catch me so try
to<00:03:15.930> stick<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.380> corners<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.280> outside

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
to stick to the corners and the outside

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.700 
to stick to the corners and the outside
of<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.910> map<00:03:18.090> don't<00:03:18.480> sit<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:18.900> them<00:03:19.080> just<00:03:19.320> just

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
of the map don't sit in them just just

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.020 
of the map don't sit in them just just
move<00:03:19.920> around<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.370> outside<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.880> map

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
move around the outside of the map

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.400 
move around the outside of the map
that's<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.390> best<00:03:21.540> thing<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:21.990> because

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
that's the best thing you can do because

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.840 
that's the best thing you can do because
then<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.680> only<00:03:22.830> have<00:03:22.950> one<00:03:23.130> direction<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.670> look

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
then you only have one direction to look

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.570 
then you only have one direction to look
and<00:03:24.000> that's<00:03:24.150> inside<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.780> map<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.350> just<00:03:26.010> that's

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
and that's inside the map so just that's

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.910 
and that's inside the map so just that's
my<00:03:26.760> little<00:03:26.970> advice<00:03:27.390> go<00:03:28.080> with<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.290> suppressed

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
my little advice go with a suppressed

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.340 
my little advice go with a suppressed
extended<00:03:29.520> mag<00:03:29.720> submachine<00:03:30.720> gun<00:03:30.900> or<00:03:31.020> assault

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
extended mag submachine gun or assault

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.140 
extended mag submachine gun or assault
rifle<00:03:31.680> because<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.370> do<00:03:32.490> have<00:03:32.520> long<00:03:32.850> spots

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
rifle because you do have long spots

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.300 
rifle because you do have long spots
like<00:03:34.050> that<00:03:34.080> where<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.650> guys<00:03:34.800> jeez<00:03:35.160> just

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
like that where the guys jeez just

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.920 
like that where the guys jeez just
hiding<00:03:35.640> with<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.790> little<00:03:36.000> sniper<00:03:36.270> rifle<00:03:36.690> but

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
hiding with a little sniper rifle but

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.740 
hiding with a little sniper rifle but

this map see people they don't know the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.970 
this map see people they don't know the
routes<00:03:39.960> they<00:03:40.110> just<00:03:40.320> dropped<00:03:40.560> down<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.860> front

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
routes they just dropped down in front

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.890
