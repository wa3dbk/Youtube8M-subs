one<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:35.760> touring<00:00:36.480> these<00:00:37.200> use<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.820> 650<00:00:38.820> CC<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
one up touring these use a 650 CC and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.900 
one up touring these use a 650 CC and
now<00:00:39.570> they<00:00:39.750> might<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.010> 649<00:00:41.010> C<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.760> sure

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
now they might be 649 C I'm not sure

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.180 
now they might be 649 C I'm not sure
exactly<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> CC<00:00:42.899> isn't<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.530> rated

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
exactly what the CC isn't but we rated

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.360 
exactly what the CC isn't but we rated
as<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> 650<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.899> twin<00:00:46.230> cylinder<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.770> parallel

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
as a 650 it's a twin cylinder a parallel

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.569 
as a 650 it's a twin cylinder a parallel
twin<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:48.390> dual<00:00:48.690> overhead<00:00:48.899> cam<00:00:49.469> four<00:00:50.190> valves

per<00:00:50.700> cylinder<00:00:50.840> they're<00:00:51.840> liquid<00:00:52.199> cool<00:00:52.379> me

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
per cylinder they're liquid cool me

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.420 
per cylinder they're liquid cool me
there's<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> radiator<00:00:56.030> fuel<00:00:57.030> injected<00:00:58.430> these

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
there's a radiator fuel injected these

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.939 
there's a radiator fuel injected these
also<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:00.000> some<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> really

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
also have some really this is a really

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.770 
also have some really this is a really
good<00:01:02.129> motor<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> pretty<00:01:03.570> recent

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
good motor because it's a pretty recent

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.420 
good motor because it's a pretty recent
design<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.559> has<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> cassette<00:01:04.979> type

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
design me it has a cassette type

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.870 
design me it has a cassette type
transmission<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.049> means<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.920> on

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
transmission what that means is is on

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.310 
transmission what that means is is on
the<00:01:08.939> older<00:01:09.360> style<00:01:09.659> bikes<00:01:09.960> when<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:12.450> access<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the older style bikes when to access the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.630 
the older style bikes when to access the
transmission<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:13.979> them<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.130> had<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.310> remove

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
transmission on them you had to remove

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.240 
transmission on them you had to remove
the<00:01:14.850> motor<00:01:15.060> from<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.630> frame<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.740> had<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the motor from the frame you had to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
the motor from the frame you had to
completely<00:01:18.240> disassemble<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.900> motor<00:01:19.049> split

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
completely disassemble the motor split

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.929 
completely disassemble the motor split
the<00:01:19.470> cases<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.979> access<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> transmission

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the cases to access the transmission

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.760 
the cases to access the transmission
shafts<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.990> has<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> cassette<00:01:22.409> type

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
shafts but this has a cassette type

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.260 
shafts but this has a cassette type
transmission<00:01:23.430> which<00:01:23.549> means<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.090> pull

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
transmission which means if you pull

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
transmission which means if you pull
this<00:01:24.420> clutch<00:01:24.720> cover<00:01:24.960> pull<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> clutch<00:01:26.070> out

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
this clutch cover pull the clutch out

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.340 
this clutch cover pull the clutch out
there'll<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.060> backing<00:01:27.479> plate<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.750> played<00:01:28.140> in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
there'll be a backing plate I played in

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
there'll be a backing plate I played in
there<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.619> has<00:01:28.770> some<00:01:28.979> bolts<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.820> pull

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
there it has some bolts in it you pull

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.670 
there it has some bolts in it you pull
that<00:01:30.299> plate<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.229> actually<00:01:31.470> pull<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that plate out you can actually pull the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.990 
that plate out you can actually pull the
transmission<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:32.310> off<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> side<00:01:32.759> so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
transmission right off the side so

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.819 
transmission right off the side so
instead<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.360> being<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.720> two-day<00:01:34.140> job<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
instead of being a two-day job for a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.730 
instead of being a two-day job for a
good<00:01:35.009> mechanic<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.180> two<00:01:36.360> hour<00:01:36.390> job<00:01:36.900> so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
good mechanic it's a two hour job so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.149 
good mechanic it's a two hour job so
that's<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.820> cool<00:01:39.000> feature<00:01:39.740> with<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> cassette

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that's a cool feature with the cassette

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.649 
that's a cool feature with the cassette
type<00:01:41.340> transmission<00:01:42.030> not<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> you'll<00:01:42.509> ever

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
type transmission not that you'll ever

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.389 
type transmission not that you'll ever
have<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.079> work<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.439> transmission<00:01:43.890> because

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
have to work on the transmission because

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.580 
have to work on the transmission because
you<00:01:44.490> probably<00:01:44.850> won't<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> did<00:01:46.020> it's

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
you probably won't but if you did it's

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.499 
you probably won't but if you did it's
much<00:01:46.890> easier<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.880> don't<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> dig

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
much easier to do it I don't know I dig

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.530 
much easier to do it I don't know I dig
that<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:50.189> has<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.670> call<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> trellis

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that but this has what we call a trellis

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.020 
that but this has what we call a trellis
type<00:01:51.810> frame<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.009> steel<00:01:53.280> frame<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
type frame it's a steel frame it's a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.270 
type frame it's a steel frame it's a
perimeter<00:01:54.540> frame<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:55.799> also<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
perimeter frame but then it's also the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.850 
perimeter frame but then it's also the
trellis<00:01:56.640> part<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:58.140> frame

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
trellis part of that is that this frame

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.690 
trellis part of that is that this frame
rail<00:01:59.100> right<00:01:59.310> here<00:01:59.540> kind<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.659> makes<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.930> triangle

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
rail right here kind of makes a triangle

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.209 
rail right here kind of makes a triangle
or<00:02:02.700> trellis<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:04.320> then<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> frame<00:02:04.829> does<00:02:05.070> not

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
or trellis and then the frame does not

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.760 
or trellis and then the frame does not
come<00:02:05.579> down<00:02:05.820> around<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.630> motor<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.439> the

motor is kind of a stressed member of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.210 
motor is kind of a stressed member of
the<00:02:09.420> frame<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.379> keeps<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> frame<00:02:10.920> light

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the frame so that keeps the frame light

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.590

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
one is kind of flipped and what it does

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.080 
one is kind of flipped and what it does
it<00:02:43.590> makes<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.860> fork<00:02:44.130> more<00:02:44.340> rigid<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:44.790> there's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it makes the fork more rigid so there's

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.780 
it makes the fork more rigid so there's
less<00:02:45.210> flex<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.960> way<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:47.100> write<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:47.610> better

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
less flex this way we write it so better

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.120 
less flex this way we write it so better

these are a little taller seat height of

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.930 
these are a little taller seat height of
course<00:03:22.830> it's<00:03:23.010> hard<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.280> get<00:03:23.400> ground<00:03:23.670> clearance

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
course it's hard to get ground clearance

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.120 
course it's hard to get ground clearance
and<00:03:24.240> suspension<00:03:24.750> travel<00:03:24.930> without<00:03:25.650> getting<00:03:26.070> a

and suspension travel without getting a
taller<00:03:26.370> seat<00:03:26.670> height<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.090> that's<00:03:27.300> just<00:03:27.450> kind

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
taller seat height so that's just kind
