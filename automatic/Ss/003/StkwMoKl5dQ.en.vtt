00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
one the only difference between this

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.550

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
mold and this mold is the fact well this

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.280 
mold and this mold is the fact well this
one<00:02:21.709> has<00:02:21.740> pulse<00:02:22.100> cannons<00:02:22.520> this<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.330> has<00:02:23.750> laser

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
one has pulse cannons this one has laser

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.070 
one has pulse cannons this one has laser
rifles<00:02:24.950> see<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:26.530> anyhow<00:02:27.530> he's<00:02:28.430> pretty<00:02:28.700> cool

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
rifles see that anyhow he's pretty cool

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.510 
rifles see that anyhow he's pretty cool
now<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.530> second<00:02:30.950> one<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.220> one<00:02:31.430> that

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
now the second one is the one that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.340 
now the second one is the one that
everyone<00:02:31.910> likes<00:02:32.240> everyone<00:02:32.750> loves<00:02:33.050> and

stand<00:02:35.330> knockoffs<00:02:36.020> which<00:02:36.740> they<00:02:36.920> should<00:02:36.950> for<00:02:37.580> at

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
stand knockoffs which they should for at

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.810 
stand knockoffs which they should for at
least<00:02:37.790> for<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.120> one<00:02:38.360> because<00:02:38.870> this<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.820> the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
least for this one because this is the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.590 
least for this one because this is the
ghost<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.360> Starscream<00:02:42.220> pretty<00:02:43.220> cool<00:02:43.430> huh<00:02:43.600> now

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
anyhow this one again comes with laser

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.960 
anyhow this one again comes with laser
