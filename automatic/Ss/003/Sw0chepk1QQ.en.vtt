00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.580
 Truly there is One 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.580
 Ah 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.320
 Hero you 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.250
 3 balls 2 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.900
 Do not you waiting Do and I want to pull a little more 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.900
 Climbed together when finished 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.720
 Totally 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.720
 You always appear suddenly and don't surprise me 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.460
 So I 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.920
 water 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.629
 The true self I was hiding 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.629
 Maybe it's going to go away 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.470
 me 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.380
 The contest for childhood is the starting point 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.110
 I am 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.550
 I kept secret that I could play the piano 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.690
 I never wanted to play in public again a 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.690
 I 've become stubborn 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.120
 However 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.890
 I am puzzled by my first contest 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.280
 While being anxious 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.750
 I'm looking at you trying to stand up 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.750
 I can not shut up very much 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.950
 I can't afford it 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.750
 I felt like this 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.750
 Ohmae is the first time 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.870
 But 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:53.660
 Omae who was dangerous at first and could not see it 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.180
 Omae's back I thought I had to support 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.519
 Since when car 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.519
 I was staring straight ahead 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.239
 Hmm 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.640
 A pin and a tree when you play the violin 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.550
 I always get caught 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.190
 It is correlated courage in the back 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.570
 A heart travel run I was closing 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.570
 Could it be opened 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.190
 I will not hide anymore 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.620
 real me 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.330
 True feelings 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.300
 Also to you piano 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.800
 Straight direction is good 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.800
 I will never look away 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.050
 So let's buy 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.660
 I am 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.670
 From now on, the difference is 0 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.600
 He continued to play the piano 8 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.230
 Good good 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.230
 not 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.400
 You are my 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.400
 It's only one soloist
