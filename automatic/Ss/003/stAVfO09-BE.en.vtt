actually<00:02:12.880> ended<00:02:13.090> up<00:02:13.150> working<00:02:13.360> up<00:02:13.660> working<00:02:13.990> as

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
actually ended up working up working as

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.570 
actually ended up working up working as
a<00:02:14.230> team<00:02:14.500> at<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.650> end<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.920> episode

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580

even<00:02:16.060> though<00:02:16.180> sex<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.600> kind<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.020> screwed<00:02:17.470> up<00:02:17.560> a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
even though sex I kind of screwed up a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.790 
even though sex I kind of screwed up a
little<00:02:17.830> bit<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.520> sekai<00:02:18.940> definitely<00:02:19.390> has<00:02:19.540> a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
little bit so sekai definitely has a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.280 
little bit so sekai definitely has a
room<00:02:20.800> for<00:02:21.190> improvement<00:02:21.790> as<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.300> Gunpla<00:02:22.870> build

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
room for improvement as a Gunpla build

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.430 
room for improvement as a Gunpla build
fighter<00:02:23.620> there's<00:02:24.220> no<00:02:24.400> doubt<00:02:24.580> about<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.910> but

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
fighter there's no doubt about it but

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.900 
fighter there's no doubt about it but
his<00:02:26.440> martial<00:02:26.860> arts<00:02:27.130> are<00:02:27.250> making<00:02:27.550> up<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:27.820> that

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
his martial arts are making up for that

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.880 
his martial arts are making up for that
lack<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.330> experience<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.020> other<00:02:29.170> areas<00:02:29.620> which

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
lack of experience in other areas which

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.170 
lack of experience in other areas which
we've<00:02:30.160> seen<00:02:30.370> when<00:02:30.610> they<00:02:30.700> were<00:02:30.790> doing<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
we've seen when they were doing the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.780 
we've seen when they were doing the
shooting<00:02:31.930> training<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:33.280> good<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.550> see

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
shooting training so it's good to see

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.460 
shooting training so it's good to see
that<00:02:33.820> he<00:02:34.120> was<00:02:34.150> he's<00:02:34.540> able<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.930> hold<00:02:35.170> his<00:02:35.320> own

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
that he was he's able to hold his own

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
with these two more experience to Gunpla

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.320 
with these two more experience to Gunpla

colonization it's a cop it's a comedy
basically<00:03:00.220> blowing<00:03:00.490> from<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.910> top<00:03:01.120> down<00:03:01.450> to

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
basically blowing from the top down to

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.960 
basically blowing from the top down to
the<00:03:01.600> bottom<00:03:01.690> of<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.170> column<00:03:02.350> colony<00:03:03.040> causing

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
the bottom of the column colony causing

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.150 
the bottom of the column colony causing
a<00:03:04.060> wind<00:03:04.360> suck<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.990> vacuum<00:03:05.410> which<00:03:06.040> was

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
a wind suck in the vacuum which was

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.630 
a wind suck in the vacuum which was
gonna<00:03:06.310> throw<00:03:06.870> gyaku<00:03:07.890> zoobel<00:03:08.890> su<00:03:09.040> out<00:03:09.250> through

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
gonna throw gyaku zoobel su out through

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.820 
gonna throw gyaku zoobel su out through
the<00:03:09.730> bottom<00:03:10.030> but<00:03:10.150> sekai<00:03:10.540> rescues<00:03:11.020> her<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
the bottom but sekai rescues her and the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.340 
the bottom but sekai rescues her and the
reason<00:03:12.130> why<00:03:12.250> he<00:03:12.820> rescues<00:03:13.240> that<00:03:13.270> Gunpla<00:03:14.140> is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
reason why he rescues that Gunpla is

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.900 
reason why he rescues that Gunpla is
because<00:03:14.770> it<00:03:14.920> would<00:03:15.010> have<00:03:15.100> been<00:03:15.160> destroyed<00:03:15.550> in

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
because it would have been destroyed in

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.530 
because it would have been destroyed in
the<00:03:16.120> vacuum<00:03:17.050> so<00:03:17.350> he<00:03:17.830> realizes<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.880> girl<00:03:19.120> his

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
the vacuum so he realizes the girl his

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.470 
the vacuum so he realizes the girl his

when<00:05:26.520> we<00:05:26.760> were<00:05:26.940> younger<00:05:27.150> well<00:05:27.390> maybe<00:05:27.540> like

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
when we were younger well maybe like

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.470 
when we were younger well maybe like

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
maybe 12 13 years old and we looked at

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.140 
maybe 12 13 years old and we looked at
somebody<00:05:30.870> in<00:05:31.020> like<00:05:31.500> 27<00:05:31.980> 28<00:05:32.340> years<00:05:32.610> old<00:05:32.670> we<00:05:32.880> even

somebody in like 27 28 years old we even

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.400 
somebody in like 27 28 years old we even
thought<00:05:33.330> they<00:05:33.480> were<00:05:33.570> kind<00:05:33.810> of<00:05:33.900> old<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.290> know

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
thought they were kind of old you know

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.290 
thought they were kind of old you know
because<00:05:35.160> they<00:05:35.250> were<00:05:35.310> a<00:05:35.400> lot<00:05:35.550> older<00:05:35.880> than<00:05:35.910> us<00:05:36.150> we

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
because they were a lot older than us we

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.630 
because they were a lot older than us we
didn't<00:05:36.540> have<00:05:36.720> that<00:05:37.380> perception<00:05:37.830> of<00:05:38.160> what<00:05:38.400> old

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640

and young and what different ages met

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.900 
and young and what different ages met
