you<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.500> eventually<00:00:34.739> set<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.520> into<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you can eventually set up into just a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.660 
you can eventually set up into just a
system<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.250> start<00:00:38.309> off<00:00:38.550> with

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
system what I do is I start off with

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.430 
system what I do is I start off with
life<00:00:38.820> screen<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.180> reflect<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.840> klefki

life screen or reflect on klefki

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.740 
life screen or reflect on klefki
and<00:00:40.649> then<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.309> depending<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.360> how<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.719> looks

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
and then I depending on how it looks

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.940 
and then I depending on how it looks
like<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.170> look<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.500> I'm<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.860> get

knocked out that turn I would go into my

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.229 
knocked out that turn I would go into my
defensive<00:00:46.110> form<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> king<00:00:47.969> shield
