 connected to us is the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:11.230

 several mixed acceleration bar videos 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:28.830
 gpu you put into performance mode 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:32.340
 single video and gives when applying 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.260
 done that's just to get into your game and I 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.720
 to be in any movie anything that 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.540
 has to do with the video card 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.300
 you will notice a higher performance 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.040
 of your beauty board until acceleration 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.019
