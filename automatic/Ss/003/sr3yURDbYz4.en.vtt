00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
hi I'm back and I did go back in and put

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.049 
hi I'm back and I did go back in and put
on<00:00:09.170> my<00:00:09.260> optimizers<00:00:09.889> and<00:00:09.920> resolder<00:00:10.400> this<00:00:10.789> and

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
on my optimizers and resolder this and

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.700 
on my optimizers and resolder this and
this<00:00:11.180> is<00:00:11.299> what<00:00:11.450> it<00:00:11.570> should<00:00:11.719> look<00:00:11.780> like<00:00:11.930> now

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
this is what it should look like now

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.230 
this is what it should look like now
normally<00:00:13.309> if<00:00:13.429> I<00:00:13.549> was<00:00:13.730> just<00:00:13.879> going<00:00:14.030> to<00:00:14.089> leave

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
normally if I was just going to leave

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.299 
normally if I was just going to leave
this<00:00:14.419> like<00:00:14.629> that<00:00:14.809> I<00:00:14.870> would<00:00:15.230> sand<00:00:15.559> it<00:00:15.740> finish<00:00:16.129> it

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
this like that I would sand it finish it

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.940 
this like that I would sand it finish it
and<00:00:16.400> clean<00:00:16.669> it<00:00:16.700> up<00:00:16.970> but<00:00:17.300> I<00:00:17.419> don't<00:00:17.840> care<00:00:18.169> yeah

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
and clean it up but I don't care yeah

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.730 
and clean it up but I don't care yeah
because<00:00:19.460> I'm<00:00:19.669> going<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:19.880> hammer<00:00:20.029> it<00:00:20.740> the

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
because I'm going to hammer it the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.380 
because I'm going to hammer it the
hardest<00:00:22.220> thing<00:00:22.369> about<00:00:22.400> this<00:00:22.789> hammering<00:00:23.210> is

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
hardest thing about this hammering is

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.349 
hardest thing about this hammering is
not<00:00:23.630> hitting<00:00:23.960> your<00:00:24.019> fingers<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.029> all<00:00:26.029> I<00:00:26.090> can

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
not hitting your fingers so all I can

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.650 
not hitting your fingers so all I can
tell<00:00:26.480> you<00:00:26.689> is<00:00:26.990> just<00:00:27.800> be<00:00:28.279> careful<00:00:28.640> I'm<00:00:29.420> going<00:00:29.599> to

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
tell you is just be careful I'm going to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.150 
tell you is just be careful I'm going to
switch<00:00:29.929> hammers<00:00:30.289> by<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.560> way<00:00:30.679> I<00:00:30.710> grabbed<00:00:30.980> the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
switch hammers by the way I grabbed the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.860 
switch hammers by the way I grabbed the
wrong<00:00:31.310> one<00:00:31.519> I<00:00:31.550> want<00:00:31.789> a<00:00:31.820> heavier<00:00:32.150> handle<00:00:32.629> on

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
wrong one I want a heavier handle on

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.130 
wrong one I want a heavier handle on
hand<00:00:33.110> hammer<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.100> I<00:00:34.129> do<00:00:34.280> less<00:00:34.699> work<00:00:35.140> so

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
hand hammer so I do less work so

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.410 
hand hammer so I do less work so
fortunately<00:00:36.769> there's<00:00:37.100> one<00:00:37.280> right<00:00:37.460> here<00:00:37.670> this

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
fortunately there's one right here this

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.210 
fortunately there's one right here this
has<00:00:38.659> a<00:00:38.690> little<00:00:38.930> more<00:00:39.019> heft<00:00:39.290> onto<00:00:39.739> it<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.040> by

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
has a little more heft onto it and by

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.680 
has a little more heft onto it and by
the<00:00:40.280> way<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:40.580> proper<00:00:40.940> way<00:00:41.059> to<00:00:41.089> hold<00:00:41.269> a<00:00:41.449> hammer

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
the way the proper way to hold a hammer

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.509 
the way the proper way to hold a hammer
is<00:00:41.960> at<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.260> back<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.739> it<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:43.070> don't<00:00:43.339> want<00:00:43.460> to

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
is at the back of it you don't want to

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:44.979 
is at the back of it you don't want to
hold<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:43.790> up<00:00:43.940> here<00:00:44.360> you're<00:00:44.570> wasting<00:00:44.960> your

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
hold it up here you're wasting your

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.810 
hold it up here you're wasting your
energy<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.769> your<00:00:45.860> time<00:00:45.890> you're<00:00:46.519> not<00:00:46.610> getting

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
energy and your time you're not getting

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.920 
energy and your time you're not getting
enough<00:00:48.070> weight<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.400> the<00:00:50.150> fulcrum<00:00:50.479> isn't<00:00:50.690> as

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
enough weight and the fulcrum isn't as

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.649 
enough weight and the fulcrum isn't as
effective<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:51.589> hold<00:00:51.799> it<00:00:51.920> back<00:00:52.100> here<00:00:52.580> of<00:00:53.390> course

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
effective so hold it back here of course

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:54.789 
effective so hold it back here of course
now<00:00:53.839> you're<00:00:54.019> going<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.199> hit<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.379> harder<00:00:54.769> so

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
now you're going to hit it harder so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:55.960 
now you're going to hit it harder so
you're<00:00:55.040> going<00:00:55.159> to<00:00:55.220> hit<00:00:55.309> your<00:00:55.430> finger<00:00:55.670> harder

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
you're going to hit your finger harder

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.520 
you're going to hit your finger harder
if<00:00:56.089> you're<00:00:56.210> not<00:00:56.360> paying<00:00:56.629> attention<00:00:56.689> trying<00:00:57.409> to

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
if you're not paying attention trying to

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.700 
if you're not paying attention trying to
keep<00:00:57.769> it<00:00:57.949> as<00:00:58.070> far<00:00:58.309> back<00:00:58.610> as<00:00:58.939> possible<00:00:59.030> I<00:00:59.750> have

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
keep it as far back as possible I have

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.259 
keep it as far back as possible I have
yet<00:01:00.979> to<00:01:01.010> figure<00:01:01.280> out<00:01:01.369> a<00:01:01.430> glue<00:01:01.699> strong<00:01:02.059> enough

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
yet to figure out a glue strong enough

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.469 
yet to figure out a glue strong enough
to<00:01:02.420> hold<00:01:02.570> this<00:01:02.720> down<00:01:02.960> without<00:01:03.290> using<00:01:03.589> my<00:01:03.860> hand

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
to hold this down without using my hand

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.450 
to hold this down without using my hand
and<00:01:05.479> what<00:01:05.630> I'm<00:01:05.720> going<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.930> do<00:01:06.049> is<00:01:06.439> slowly<00:01:06.890> curve

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
and what I'm going to do is slowly curve

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.249 
and what I'm going to do is slowly curve
it<00:01:07.700> around<00:01:10.060> with<00:01:11.060> my<00:01:11.299> left<00:01:11.600> hand<00:01:11.719> while

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
it around with my left hand while

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.010 
it around with my left hand while
hammering<00:01:12.770> with<00:01:12.890> my<00:01:13.070> right<00:01:13.280> hand<00:01:13.810> if<00:01:14.810> you're<00:01:14.990> a

down actually seeing this thing isn't
the<00:03:15.540> signs<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:16.049> it's<00:03:16.200> hard<00:03:16.470> Tyler<00:03:18.950> okay<00:03:19.950> so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
the signs of it's hard Tyler okay so

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.789 
the signs of it's hard Tyler okay so
that's<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.580> pattern<00:03:20.940> using<00:03:21.780> up<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
that's one pattern using up the

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.910 
that's one pattern using up the
wedge-shaped<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.549> on<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.030> riveting<00:03:24.360> hammer

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
wedge-shaped and on the riveting hammer

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.400 
wedge-shaped and on the riveting hammer
you<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:26.100> do<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.640> mix<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.180> patterns<00:03:27.570> but<00:03:28.230> for

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
you can do this mix the patterns but for

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.930 
you can do this mix the patterns but for
demonstration<00:03:28.530> purposes<00:03:29.370> I'm<00:03:29.549> going<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.790> do

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
demonstration purposes I'm going to do

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.539 
demonstration purposes I'm going to do
it<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.239> same<00:03:30.480> piece<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.680> now<00:03:32.160> you've<00:03:32.340> used

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
it on the same piece you now you've used

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.630 
it on the same piece you now you've used
a<00:03:32.700> ball-peen<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.780> ball<00:03:34.320> peen<00:03:34.530> hammer

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
a ball-peen and of the ball peen hammer

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.160 
a ball-peen and of the ball peen hammer
to<00:03:35.640> put<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:35.910> nice<00:03:36.299> little<00:03:36.600> circle<00:03:37.110> dent<00:03:37.530> on<00:03:37.799> it

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
to put a nice little circle dent on it

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.410 
to put a nice little circle dent on it
this<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.230> another<00:03:40.500> simple<00:03:41.040> way<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:41.910> pattern

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
this is another simple way to pattern

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.590 
this is another simple way to pattern
your<00:03:42.470> material<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.620> could<00:03:43.739> also<00:03:44.330> run<00:03:45.330> this

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
your material you could also run this

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.890 
your material you could also run this
through<00:03:46.080> a<00:03:46.410> rolling<00:03:47.160> mill<00:03:47.310> with<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:48.590> brass

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
through a rolling mill with a brass

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.110 
through a rolling mill with a brass
pattern<00:03:51.900> plate<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:53.010> what<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.220> do<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.760> run<00:03:54.000> it

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
pattern plate but what I do is I run it

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.840 
pattern plate but what I do is I run it
through<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.390> rolling<00:03:54.570> mill<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:55.049> way<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:56.700> make

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
through the rolling mill one way to make

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.570 
through the rolling mill one way to make
it<00:03:57.000> into<00:03:57.209> oval<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.870> anneal<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.769> pull<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.430> out

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
it into oval I anneal it I pull it out

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.640 
it into oval I anneal it I pull it out
of<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.000> pickle<00:04:00.360> dry<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.049> then<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.290> run<00:04:01.530> it

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
of the pickle dry it and then I run it

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.020 
of the pickle dry it and then I run it
through<00:04:01.680> with<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.040> pattern<00:04:02.519> plate<00:04:02.700> the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
through with the pattern plate the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.509 
through with the pattern plate the
opposite<00:04:03.570> way<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:04.049> can<00:04:04.260> continue<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.370> have

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
opposite way so you can continue to have

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.949 
opposite way so you can continue to have
your<00:04:05.640> circle<00:04:05.940> if<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.390> run<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.750> through<00:04:06.780> the

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
your circle if you run it through the

different<00:04:11.100> times<00:04:11.310> we'll<00:04:11.670> do<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:11.850> demo<00:04:12.120> on<00:04:12.360> that

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
different times we'll do a demo on that

different times we'll do a demo on that
at<00:04:12.690> another<00:04:12.840> point<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:14.099> anyway<00:04:14.400> right<00:04:14.610> now<00:04:14.760> we

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
at another point so anyway right now we

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.719 
at another point so anyway right now we

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
with two different patterns on it so

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.000 
with two different patterns on it so

is<00:04:29.400> we're<00:04:29.580> going<00:04:29.730> to<00:04:29.850> curl<00:04:30.480> our<00:04:30.690> ends<00:04:31.280> I'm

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
is we're going to curl our ends I'm

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.250 
is we're going to curl our ends I'm
going<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.520> take<00:04:32.760> I<00:04:33.030> put<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:33.450> tape<00:04:33.720> on<00:04:33.900> here<00:04:34.080> to

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
going to take I put this tape on here to

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.060 
going to take I put this tape on here to
mark<00:04:34.560> where<00:04:35.370> I'm<00:04:35.520> going<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:35.760> curl<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:37.680> part

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
mark where I'm going to curl this part

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.210 
mark where I'm going to curl this part
of<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.760> hook<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:40.020> do<00:04:40.230> it<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.680> same<00:04:40.919> every

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
of the hook so I do it the same every

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.340 
of the hook so I do it the same every
time<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:43.970> beginning<00:04:44.970> part<00:04:45.600> of<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.720> hook<00:04:45.960> here

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
time the beginning part of the hook here

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.409 
time the beginning part of the hook here
I<00:04:46.380> use<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.830> very<00:04:46.980> tip<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.580> smallest<00:04:47.880> part<00:04:48.330> of

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
I use the very tip the smallest part of

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.770 
I use the very tip the smallest part of
the<00:04:49.639> round<00:04:50.639> nose<00:04:50.730> and<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.330> problem<00:04:51.660> with

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
the round nose and the problem with

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.430 
the round nose and the problem with
these<00:04:52.260> are<00:04:52.530> just<00:04:52.889> loves<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.580> slip<00:04:54.350> trying<00:04:55.350> to

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
these are just loves the slip trying to

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.219 
these are just loves the slip trying to
curl<00:04:55.919> it<00:04:56.100> as<00:04:56.160> cleanly<00:04:56.790> and<00:04:57.120> neatly<00:04:57.570> as<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:57.960> can

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
curl it as cleanly and neatly as I can

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.680 
curl it as cleanly and neatly as I can
which<00:04:58.889> is<00:04:59.040> why<00:04:59.070> I'm<00:04:59.460> rotating<00:04:59.940> it<00:05:00.270> from<00:05:00.510> side

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
which is why I'm rotating it from side

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.170 
which is why I'm rotating it from side
to<00:05:00.750> side<00:05:00.960> if<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.979> don't<00:05:02.220> rotate<00:05:02.639> it<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:02.970> end

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
to side if you don't rotate it you end

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.570 
to side if you don't rotate it you end
up<00:05:03.419> with<00:05:03.570> one<00:05:03.870> side<00:05:04.139> higher<00:05:04.889> than<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.430> other

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
up with one side higher than the other

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.490 
up with one side higher than the other
because<00:05:05.850> these<00:05:06.479> are<00:05:06.720> not<00:05:06.870> straight<00:05:07.260> up<00:05:07.290> and

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
because these are not straight up and

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.790 
because these are not straight up and
down<00:05:07.620> they're<00:05:08.180> con<00:05:09.180> shape<00:05:09.479> so<00:05:10.290> you<00:05:10.320> always

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
down they're con shape so you always

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.920 
down they're con shape so you always
alternate<00:05:11.490> when<00:05:12.030> you're<00:05:12.150> using<00:05:12.360> round<00:05:12.750> nose

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
alternate when you're using round nose

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.210 
alternate when you're using round nose
pliers<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:14.419> want<00:05:15.419> to<00:05:15.510> just<00:05:15.660> make<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:16.080> nice<00:05:16.860> and

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
pliers I want to just make this nice and

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.670 
pliers I want to just make this nice and
clean<00:05:17.669> okay<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:18.690> that's<00:05:18.990> going<00:05:19.139> to<00:05:19.200> be<00:05:19.410> our

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
clean okay so that's going to be our

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.740 
clean okay so that's going to be our
leading<00:05:20.010> end<00:05:21.110> like<00:05:22.110> right<00:05:22.500> here
