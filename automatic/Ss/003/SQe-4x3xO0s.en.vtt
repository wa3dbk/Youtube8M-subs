here<00:00:30.160> at<00:00:30.250> Union<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:31.539> is<00:00:31.600> for<00:00:31.810> smc<00:00:32.020> this<00:00:32.529> is

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
here at Union this is for smc this is

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.670 
here at Union this is for smc this is
the<00:00:32.829> lightest<00:00:33.370> binding<00:00:33.850> on<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.480> planet<00:00:34.930> we

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
the lightest binding on the planet we

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.920 
the lightest binding on the planet we
build<00:00:35.890> out<00:00:36.010> of<00:00:36.040> exotic<00:00:36.550> materials<00:00:37.090> carbon

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
build out of exotic materials carbon

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.140 
build out of exotic materials carbon
fiber<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.500> high<00:00:38.950> back<00:00:39.160> not<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:39.879> be<00:00:40.000> the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
fiber and a high back not to be the

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.430 
fiber and a high back not to be the
stiffest<00:00:40.450> finding<00:00:40.750> out<00:00:40.870> there<00:00:41.080> because<00:00:41.230> it's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
stiffest finding out there because it's

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.990 
stiffest finding out there because it's
nice<00:00:41.559> and<00:00:41.620> flexible<00:00:41.980> but<00:00:42.340> to<00:00:42.460> be<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.670> lightest

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
nice and flexible but to be the lightest

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.970 
nice and flexible but to be the lightest
so<00:00:43.480> you<00:00:43.540> got<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.690> totally<00:00:44.080> cord<00:00:44.320> out<00:00:44.410> base<00:00:44.680> it's

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
so you got a totally cord out base it's

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.340 
so you got a totally cord out base it's
cnc<00:00:45.460> machine<00:00:45.790> machine<00:00:46.390> our<00:00:46.690> own<00:00:46.809> hardware

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
cnc machine machine our own hardware

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.759 
cnc machine machine our own hardware
carbon<00:00:48.160> fiber<00:00:48.340> in<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:49.180> high<00:00:49.960> back<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.559> in<00:00:50.739> the

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
carbon fiber in the high back and in the

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.340 
carbon fiber in the high back and in the
trays<00:00:51.160> magnesium<00:00:51.940> buckles<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.629> then<00:00:52.930> we<00:00:53.080> had

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
trays magnesium buckles and then we had

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.320 
trays magnesium buckles and then we had
new<00:00:53.620> for<00:00:53.800> this<00:00:53.890> year<00:00:53.949> is<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.370> nanotech<00:00:55.120> heel

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
new for this year is a nanotech heel

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.540 
new for this year is a nanotech heel
loop<00:00:55.540> so<00:00:56.050> this<00:00:56.199> is<00:00:56.350> actually<00:00:56.589> a<00:00:56.830> plastic<00:00:57.339> heel

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
loop so this is actually a plastic heel

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.850 
loop so this is actually a plastic heel
loop<00:00:57.730> that<00:00:58.000> we<00:00:58.120> inject<00:00:58.510> dip<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.320> in<00:00:59.410> zinc<00:00:59.680> and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
loop that we inject dip it in zinc and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.219 
loop that we inject dip it in zinc and
then<00:00:59.979> dip<00:01:00.250> it<00:01:00.280> in<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.549> nanotech<00:01:01.030> material<00:01:01.540> from

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
then dip it in a nanotech material from

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.560 
then dip it in a nanotech material from
that<00:01:02.470> we<00:01:02.620> get<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.070> strength<00:01:03.580> of<00:01:03.850> steel<00:01:04.150> with

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
that we get the strength of steel with

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.120 
that we get the strength of steel with
half<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.989> weight<00:01:05.110> of<00:01:05.229> aluminum<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:05.860> it's<00:01:05.890> even

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
half the weight of aluminum so it's even

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.609 
half the weight of aluminum so it's even
lighter<00:01:06.520> than<00:01:06.670> last<00:01:06.729> year<00:01:07.380> all<00:01:08.380> that

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
lighter than last year all that

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.990 
lighter than last year all that
lightweight<00:01:08.830> costs<00:01:09.369> a<00:01:09.400> lot<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.670> money<00:01:09.700> it's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
lightweight costs a lot of money it's

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.590 
lightweight costs a lot of money it's
400<00:01:10.420> bucks<00:01:14.670> did<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.700> binding<00:01:16.030> with<00:01:16.180> Giggy<00:01:16.390> roof
