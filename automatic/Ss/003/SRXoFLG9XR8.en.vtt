person move around and have the camera
follow<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.349> initial<00:00:32.009> setup<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.640> blender

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

in with character around although you
can<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.850> but<00:01:50.850> we're<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> use

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
can do that here but we're going to use

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.539 
can do that here but we're going to use
W<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:53.310> forward<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.049> over<00:01:55.290> here

we're<00:01:56.549> going<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> go<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.420> D<00:01:57.960> lock<00:01:58.560> that's

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
we're going to go to the D lock that's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.580 
we're going to go to the D lock that's
your<00:01:59.130> location<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.170> we're<00:02:01.170> gonna<00:02:01.259> want<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
your location and we're gonna want to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.399 
your location and we're gonna want to
move<00:02:01.710> forward<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:03.030> y-axis<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.229> goes

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
move forward on the y-axis and this goes

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
move forward on the y-axis and this goes
X<00:02:04.770> Y<00:02:04.979> Z<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.640> middle<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:05.909> we're<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.390> to

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
X Y Z so the middle one we're going to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.889 
X Y Z so the middle one we're going to
put<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.619> point<00:02:07.860> 10<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.660> go<00:02:09.869> over

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
put that up to point 10 now if I go over

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.710 
put that up to point 10 now if I go over
here<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> my<00:02:10.410> camera<00:02:10.770> view<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.310> press<00:02:11.610> P

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
here to my camera view and I press P

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.780 
here to my camera view and I press P
I<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:13.110> press<00:02:13.320> W<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.220> see<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I can press W and you can see that the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.900 
I can press W and you can see that the
ball<00:02:14.940> moves<00:02:14.970> forward<00:02:16.670> obviously<00:02:17.670> if<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.790> want

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
ball moves forward obviously if you want

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.220 
ball moves forward obviously if you want
make<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.090> faster<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.840> make<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.110> number

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
make it faster you can make that number

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.450 
make it faster you can make that number
bigger<00:02:19.530> if<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.740> want<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.920> make<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.100> slower<00:02:20.340> you

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
bigger if you want to make it slower you

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.990 
bigger if you want to make it slower you
make<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.730> number<00:02:20.940> smaller<00:02:22.100> so<00:02:23.100> I'm<00:02:23.430> going<00:02:23.850> to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
make that number smaller so I'm going to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.660 
make that number smaller so I'm going to
do<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.330> again<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.200> time<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> key

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
do that again but this time for the key

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.610 
do that again but this time for the key
I'm<00:02:26.940> going<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.480> hit<00:02:27.690> D<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.970> time<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
I'm going to hit D and this time for the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.740 
I'm going to hit D and this time for the
Y<00:02:31.830> location<00:02:32.070> I'm<00:02:32.730> going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.120> go<00:02:33.270> negative

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
Y location I'm going to go negative

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.840 
Y location I'm going to go negative
point<00:02:34.500> zero<00:02:35.310> point<00:02:35.610> one<00:02:35.880> zero<00:02:37.190> gonna<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.670> a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
point zero point one zero gonna do it a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.670 
point zero point one zero gonna do it a
third<00:02:39.480> time<00:02:40.430> go<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.610> keyboard<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:45.680> connect

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
third time go on a keyboard a connect

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.730 
third time go on a keyboard a connect
these<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.490> well<00:02:48.330> rotate<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.990> z<00:02:49.200> axis<00:02:49.230> so

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
these and well rotate on the z axis so

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.760 
these and well rotate on the z axis so
we're<00:02:49.830> gonna<00:02:49.920> go<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.160> D<00:02:50.400> ro<00:02:50.820> T<00:02:51.600> for<00:02:52.080> rotation

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
we're gonna go to D ro T for rotation

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.340 
we're gonna go to D ro T for rotation
and<00:02:53.390> we<00:02:54.390> are<00:02:54.480> going<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.690> go<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:56.520> positive<00:02:57.390> point

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
and we are going to go to positive point

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.250 
and we are going to go to positive point
one<00:02:59.130> and<00:03:00.380> now<00:03:01.760> we'll<00:03:02.760> add<00:03:02.790> one<00:03:03.330> more<00:03:03.510> sensor

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
one and now we'll add one more sensor

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.120 
one and now we'll add one more sensor
and<00:03:04.850> that's<00:03:05.850> going<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.800> another<00:03:07.800> keyboard

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
and that's going to be another keyboard

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.160 
and that's going to be another keyboard
sensor<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.360> it's<00:03:10.020> going<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.200> be<00:03:10.400> your<00:03:11.870> D<00:03:12.870> key<00:03:13.140> I
