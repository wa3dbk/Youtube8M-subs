I'm pulling out of here our little
packets<00:01:33.650> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.860> birchbox<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.090> these

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
packets this is birchbox or in see these

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.569 
packets this is birchbox or in see these
there's<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:37.770> four<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.520> that's

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
there's actually four of them so that's

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.429 
there's actually four of them so that's
nice<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.060> could<00:01:39.150> try<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.360> four<00:01:39.570> times<00:01:39.810> these

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
nice you could try it four times these

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
nice you could try it four times these
are<00:01:40.560> from<00:01:40.650> proactive<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.090> marked

fading<00:01:43.140> pads<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.399> assuming<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:45.000> like

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
fading pads so I'm assuming it's like

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.450 
fading pads so I'm assuming it's like
when<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.689> an<00:01:45.869> acne<00:01:46.290> scar<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:47.040> any<00:01:47.250> sort

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
when you have an acne scar or any sort

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
when you have an acne scar or any sort
of<00:01:47.579> hyperpigmentation<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:49.290> take<00:01:49.710> these

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
of hyperpigmentation you take these

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.149 
of hyperpigmentation you take these
there's<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.490> pre-moistened<00:01:51.210> towelettes<00:01:52.159> up

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
there's one pre-moistened towelettes up

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.109 
there's one pre-moistened towelettes up
it<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.399> area<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.700> didn't<00:01:53.909> read<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it on the area I didn't read the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.460 
it on the area I didn't read the
instructions<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:54.899> what<00:01:55.110> i<00:01:55.140> can

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
instructions but that's what i can

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.800 
instructions but that's what i can
assume<00:01:55.770> from<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> need<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> try<00:01:57.540> four

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
assume from that so you need to try four

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.289 
assume from that so you need to try four
times<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.320> better<00:01:58.590> than<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.520> once<00:01:59.729> or

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
times which is better than just once or

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.920 
times which is better than just once or
twice

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
twice

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.080 
twice
three<00:02:02.050> times<00:02:02.430> four<00:02:03.430> is<00:02:03.460> better<00:02:03.580> than<00:02:03.910> all

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
three times four is better than all

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.420 
three times four is better than all
those<00:02:04.120> things<00:02:04.570> ok<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.110> next<00:02:05.140> thing<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.710> see<00:02:06.040> is
