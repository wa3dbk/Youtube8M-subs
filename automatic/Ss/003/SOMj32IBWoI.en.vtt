 true but only in part really 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.620
 if a person will eat 3000 calories 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.590
 cabbage he will never pick up extra 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.329
 tempting to offer a person to eat 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.399
 only one cabbage in unlimited 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.399
 quantity 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.809
 tempting but so built 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.870
 very many diets 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.420
 although they all failed 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.429
 end in tears 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 version number two overweight typed 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:01:00.149
 from fat, fat is what leads to a set 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.649
 weight and then by far the most 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.010
 authoritative 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.060
 the most common theory 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.670
 weight gain really 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.870
 appearance in food high 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.080
 fat content 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.800
 often independent 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.150
 weight gain factor and even 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.960
 the development of obesity and the third theory 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:31.580
 carbohydrate theory she says that once 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.150
 weight is gained from fast carbs 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.790
 carbohydrate theory calls into question 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.900
 the most common principle of healthy 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.260
 power and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.600
 diets of the late twentieth century, what to eat 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.070
 less fat carbohydrate theory with this is not 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.970
 agrees and cites two proofs 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.440
 paradox 1 paradox french essence 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.380
 his is that the french eat 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.140
 significantly more fat than Americans 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.729
 it is the most harmonious nation 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.570
 in Europe 2 paradox 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.180
 american he is that 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.920
 America is the biggest gain and pitied them 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.870
 Americans happened for years 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.860
 propagated in america 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.250
 low calorie low fat diet 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.540
 Amount of fat in America since the 50s 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.060
 significantly reduced to today 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.320
 time but at the same time the number of people with 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.739
 overweight 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.170
 the carbohydrate theory grows sharply 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.260
 This is proof that all the same 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.500
 the main cause of overweight is necessary 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.910
 look not in fat but in carbohydrates 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.700
 taking into account all three 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.180
 versions of the development of ordinary weight we 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.240

 high in fat and food with 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.810
 high in fast carbohydrates 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:09.090
