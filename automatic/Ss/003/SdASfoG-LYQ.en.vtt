for me the Slayer is a fun truck but
you're<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.840> limited<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.740> where<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:20.970> run

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
you're very limited to where you can run

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.920 
you're very limited to where you can run
it<00:00:21.500> as<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.740> found<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.310> mean<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> truck<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> great

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
unlike loose dirt but the whole

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.599 
unlike loose dirt but the whole
short-course<00:00:28.769> thing<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.250> me

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.860 
mean I guess a short course you need to
love<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.500> hate<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.300> at<00:00:36.300> first<00:00:36.570> I

conversion you do not need to install
the<00:01:24.270> longer<00:01:24.689> wheelbase<00:01:25.170> chassis<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the longer wheelbase chassis as this the

the<00:01:31.049> long<00:01:31.259> wheelbase<00:01:31.530> Revo<00:01:32.280> conversion<00:01:33.060> I

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the long wheelbase Revo conversion I

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.670 
the long wheelbase Revo conversion I
mean<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> take<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> slayer<00:01:33.930> pro<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.439> put<00:01:34.590> an

mean if you take a slayer pro and put an

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
mean if you take a slayer pro and put an
EXO<00:01:34.950> regular<00:01:35.310> slayer<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.720> the

EXO regular slayer you can see the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.450 
EXO regular slayer you can see the
difference<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.409> length<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
difference in length so this is the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.969 
difference in length so this is the
conversion<00:01:42.259> I'm<00:01:43.259> actually<00:01:43.590> pretty<00:01:43.860> happy

on the Slayer itself the springs are
much<00:04:11.349> weaker<00:04:11.530> than<00:04:11.889> what<00:04:12.099> even<00:04:12.370> comes<00:04:12.579> on<00:04:12.729> a

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
much weaker than what even comes on a

much weaker than what even comes on a
stock<00:04:13.090> Revo<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:15.069> this<00:04:15.340> truck<00:04:15.549> is<00:04:15.699> gonna<00:04:15.790> spend

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
stock Revo so this truck is gonna spend

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.629 
stock Revo so this truck is gonna spend
most<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.389> his<00:04:16.479> time<00:04:16.539> with<00:04:16.780> its<00:04:17.109> ass<00:04:17.500> end<00:04:18.099> dragon

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.430 
most of his time with its ass end dragon
but<00:04:19.030> we'll<00:04:19.570> see<00:04:19.720> how<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:19.959> holds<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.289> mean

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
but we'll see how it holds I mean

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.719 
but we'll see how it holds I mean
sometimes<00:04:20.829> with<00:04:21.010> these<00:04:21.219> trucks<00:04:21.430> like<00:04:21.639> they

sometimes with these trucks like they

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.129 
sometimes with these trucks like they
have<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:21.880> lot<00:04:21.969> of<00:04:22.000> soft<00:04:22.300> suspension<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.020> I'll

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
have a lot of soft suspension so I'll

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.409 
have a lot of soft suspension so I'll
try<00:04:23.409> it<00:04:23.469> out<00:04:23.650> before<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.669> go<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:24.969> put<00:04:25.180> stiff

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
try it out before I go and put stiff

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.010 
try it out before I go and put stiff
springs<00:04:25.719> in

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
springs in

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.610 
springs in
I<00:04:26.080> have<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:27.069> adjusting<00:04:28.000> collars<00:04:28.389> is<00:04:28.539> down<00:04:29.289> as

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
I have the adjusting collars is down as

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.140 
I have the adjusting collars is down as
far<00:04:29.860> as<00:04:29.979> they<00:04:30.129> can<00:04:30.190> go<00:04:30.400> actually<00:04:30.610> they're<00:04:30.970> down

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
far as they can go actually they're down

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.059 
far as they can go actually they're down
so<00:04:31.479> far<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:32.849> normally<00:04:33.849> the<00:04:34.000> truck<00:04:34.240> would

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
so far that normally the truck would

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:40.700 
so far that normally the truck would
would<00:04:36.069> hit<00:04:36.310> but<00:04:37.500> with<00:04:38.500> being<00:04:39.099> down<00:04:39.250> so<00:04:39.520> far<00:04:39.729> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
would hit but with being down so far the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.960 
would hit but with being down so far the
spring<00:04:41.710> actually<00:04:41.919> stops<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.580> because<00:04:42.819> the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
spring actually stops it because the

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.300 
spring actually stops it because the
spring<00:04:43.270> is<00:04:43.419> is<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.650> coils<00:04:44.979> are<00:04:45.069> hitting

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
spring is is a the coils are hitting

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.390 
spring is is a the coils are hitting
each<00:04:45.340> other<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.870> we'll<00:04:47.470> try<00:04:47.650> it<00:04:47.680> out<00:04:47.830> gel

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
each other but we'll try it out gel

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.930 
each other but we'll try it out gel
works<00:04:48.699> but<00:04:49.569> this<00:04:49.720> is<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.990> conversion<00:04:50.940> you

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
works but this is the conversion you

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.730 
works but this is the conversion you
start<00:04:52.240> out<00:04:52.389> with<00:04:52.419> something<00:04:52.810> like<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.229> which

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
start out with something like this which

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.610 
start out with something like this which
is<00:04:53.949> my<00:04:54.190> Slayer<00:04:54.460> parts<00:04:54.819> truck<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.750> you<00:04:56.259> turn

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
is my Slayer parts truck and you turn

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.170 
is my Slayer parts truck and you turn
into<00:04:56.889> that<00:04:57.009> so<00:04:58.650> I'm<00:04:59.650> gonna<00:05:00.610> go<00:05:00.789> test<00:05:01.030> this

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
into that so I'm gonna go test this

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.469 
into that so I'm gonna go test this
thing<00:05:01.360> out<00:05:01.509> see<00:05:02.380> how<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.650> works<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.479> we'll

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
thing out see how it works and we'll

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.490 
thing out see how it works and we'll
have<00:05:04.690> a<00:05:04.750> video<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.199> truck<00:05:05.409> running<00:05:05.650> later
