00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.230
 That is the dream of every car club decades old and still 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.940
 shiny paint 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.920
 but how well is the BMW really what is with rust 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.019
 Appointment with the specialists of Timex 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 Timex is called sec maximization 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.169
 Here, the lifetime of cars should be extended 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.399
 but how does that work when the workshop first investigates 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:25.480
 involved 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.170
 a video endoscope prone to the inspection of the particularly rust 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.409
 cavities 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.409
 a long thin tube with built-in camera 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.520
 through such holes there are many in every car you get into 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.450
 cavities 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.590
 no matter how the paint on the outside also shiny so they often force 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.020
 Remains of dried-up protective walls almost no longer visible 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.130
 because the solvents have dried up dirt off the road and down the street 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.130
 Soil of course, rust size without end 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.890
 high time for a preservation that can perfectly precede the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.079
 protect and also very important 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.820
 penetrate cold water and dirt on the ground 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 both on clean rustproof surfaces and where the sheet is already 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.010
 rusted 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.800
 with no excommunicated self-developed led to use 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.510
 When cold, they do not look diluted with solvents but instead 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.720
 are fixed 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.180
 For liquefaction, they will be warm in this special unit for the first time 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 made at around 100 degrees 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.549
 with the compressed air is Ole and a fine mist desert 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.469
 as demonstrated here, the hot fat is then processed in the car 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.360
 Then SID the partial index scrap the deckle out so dry out 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.680
 impossible the youngest member does not exist here 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.420
 and what the customers of both parts of conservation appreciate 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.890
 All work steps are documented 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.320
 every hour and every day the damages are registered here the checkbook 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.650
 that makes us the topic goes on for over 20 years 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.650
 every three years will be checked later 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.299
 with a bit of practice is also made shepherd 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.289
 4 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:13.609
 for artisans 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:18.519
 all you need Products Pistols and tips for processing are there 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.339
 in the specialized trade and at Time Next 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.419
 and what do independent testers say 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.369
 this journal has 28 rust inhibitors from around the world 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.489
 scrutinized the biggest ever test so far 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.489
 Even the well-known brands are all built to celebrities like cars 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.589
 faster rusted from the inside like Beirut Heimann and partly 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:42.799
 rust-free as with new cars 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.739
 in between similar to how on the road in winter studies with 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.069
 salt water 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.179
 Aigner test duration and then the result 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.079
 Test winner is not a Macs 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.489
 no matter if hosted or rustproof best protection anywhere in the test box 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.979
 first place 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:07.359
 best protection so for classic cars and for new cars at Timex is the 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.150
 Lifespan of cars so actually extended for safe value retention 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.219
 in classics and new cars 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:16.790
 Share Macs 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.480
 4 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.239
 is the name really program
