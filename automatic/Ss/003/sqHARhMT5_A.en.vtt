00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
on the backs from the sides right I

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.350 
on the backs from the sides right I
understand<00:04:24.350> on<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.590> front<00:04:24.890> and<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.130> think<00:04:25.640> that

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
understand on the front and I think that

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.900 
understand on the front and I think that
this<00:04:26.630> is<00:04:26.810> really<00:04:27.140> cute<00:04:27.530> just<00:04:27.890> by<00:04:28.040> itself<00:04:28.400> just

on one side I think it's really cute to
personalize<00:04:31.220> your<00:04:31.250> own<00:04:31.670> charger<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.690> I<00:04:32.930> think
