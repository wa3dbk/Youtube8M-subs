00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
you have a file on mid so I believe it's

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.680 
you have a file on mid so I believe it's
called<00:05:32.000> similar<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.150> Lunarlon

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
called similar to Lunarlon

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.250 
called similar to Lunarlon
but<00:05:34.020> not<00:05:34.770> as<00:05:34.950> strong<00:05:35.630> it's<00:05:36.630> a<00:05:36.720> good<00:05:36.960> job<00:05:37.140> I

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
but not as strong it's a good job I

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.750 
but not as strong it's a good job I
think<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.740> think<00:05:38.040> this<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.190> probably<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.640> most

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
think I think this is probably the most

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.480 
think I think this is probably the most
comfortable<00:05:39.060> out<00:05:39.390> of<00:05:39.740> all<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:41.010> shoes<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.250> we

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
comfortable out of all the shoes that we

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.100
