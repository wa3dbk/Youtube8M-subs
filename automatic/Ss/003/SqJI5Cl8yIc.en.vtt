00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
it was going to happen but I think now I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.460 
it was going to happen but I think now I
came<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.330> time<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.930> challenges

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
came to the right time the challenges

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.170 
came to the right time the challenges
our<00:01:19.590> footballer<00:01:20.010> faces<00:01:20.520> where<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.730> club<00:01:20.970> move

our footballer faces where the club move

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
our footballer faces where the club move
can<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.600> difficult<00:01:22.320> especially<00:01:22.470> when<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
can be difficult especially when the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
can be difficult especially when the
opposition<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:24.270> team<00:01:24.480> he<00:01:24.660> played<00:01:24.930> for
