just<00:00:21.720> look<00:00:22.050> at<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> original<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.920> which<00:00:23.070> will

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
just look at the original one which will

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.130 
just look at the original one which will
be<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.550> sandstone<00:00:24.119> black<00:00:24.539> which<00:00:24.779> returns

looks really nice it gives it a nice
gray<00:00:37.469> profile<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.280> what<00:00:38.760> you're<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
gray profile and what you're going to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.490 
gray profile and what you're going to
find<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> cover<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.020> very<00:00:40.079> easily

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500

and<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.030> replaced<00:00:45.360> pretty<00:00:45.600> easily<00:00:45.840> which

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and can be replaced pretty easily which

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.600

other covers one by one so you can

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.500 
other covers one by one so you can
really<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:50.940> look<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.210> and

we'll start off with kevlar which is
another<00:00:55.079> darker<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.829> edition<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.760> cover

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
now kevlar looks a little bit like the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.349 
now kevlar looks a little bit like the
carbon<00:00:59.460> fiber<00:00:59.670> offerings<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.120> might<00:01:00.270> have

seen<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.510> other<00:01:00.750> phones<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.890> does<00:01:02.100> look

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
seen on other phones but it does look

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.680 
seen on other phones but it does look
quite<00:01:02.340> nice<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.910> thing<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.120> will<00:01:03.300> say<00:01:03.329> though

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
quite nice one thing I will say though

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
quite nice one thing I will say though
is<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> different

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
is that you can really see the different

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
stitching's on the back and hopefully

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.890 
stitching's on the back and hopefully
this<00:01:07.920> particular<00:01:08.580> kevlar<00:01:09.180> offering<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.750> not

this particular kevlar offering is not
going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.200> get<00:01:10.320> smudged<00:01:10.650> out<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:11.100> I've<00:01:11.280> found

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
going to get smudged out like I've found

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
going to get smudged out like I've found
in<00:01:11.820> some<00:01:12.270> other<00:01:12.450> phones<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.990> provided<00:01:13.500> it

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
in some other phones that provided it

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.219 
in some other phones that provided it

move over to bamboo which is the one
that<00:01:16.409> I'm<00:01:16.530> probably<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.340> because

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
that I'm probably going to get because

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.880 
that I'm probably going to get because
in<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> oneplus<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.110> bamboo<00:01:19.439> cover<00:01:19.680> was

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
in the oneplus one the bamboo cover was

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.469 
in the oneplus one the bamboo cover was
definitely<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> pined<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
definitely the one that I pined for and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.880 
definitely the one that I pined for and
the<00:01:21.600> moment<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.049> available<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.560> went<00:01:22.799> and

the thing about the bamboo covering on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.370 
the thing about the bamboo covering on
this<00:01:25.770> 1+2<00:01:26.280> however<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.450> only<00:01:27.720> us

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
this 1+2 however is that it is only us

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.310 
this 1+2 however is that it is only us
seen<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.670> back<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.780> thin<00:01:31.079> piece<00:01:31.290> of
