00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.270
 Here I show my chayote who grew up alone 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.160
 in quotes only because actually 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:15.550
 I had already planted before 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 but I never finish never grew 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:22.270
 and as I became disappointed I abandoned it 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.900
 and when I was cutting the grass 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.560
 finally the madman who also now 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.560
 it grew back 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.740
 I'm going to plant a chayote 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.740
 there is a lot already I have it prepared 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.410
 I also passed a little quality 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.570
 the chayote is left alone similar to what 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.960
 what is done with the potatoes that grow 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.420
 when it comes out its bud starts to germinate 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.190
 the ideal time to plant it here and 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.620
 I have it star as they are already a 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.480
 little old but I think they can still 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.870
 grow 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.490
 will show us serrato the chayote grew 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.220
 alone and I think that's the technique or the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.320
 key to grow a friend told us 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.850
 that you have to abandon it when you 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.600
 we asked how the chayote is planted 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.910
 you told us you raise what and how 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.759
 they leave it effectively left me 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.259
 chayote that I showed before we left it 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.540
 abandoned and it was until I 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.390
 we gave up when he grew up it 's the same 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.540
 what am I going to do with this let's see if 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.560
 if we check the theory good for 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.979
 planting them is simply leaving the bud 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.979
 upwards 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.240
 on top of the chayote and gift I'm going to 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.780
 add to the beginning but then I'll go 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.780
 to leave 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 yes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.990
 that by the way the chayote as is a 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.990
 climbing plant 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.900
 I chose this mesh this this post that 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.700
 I have here to climb all the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.090
 place and has enough space to 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.090
 grow
