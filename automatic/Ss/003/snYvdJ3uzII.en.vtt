00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
now what you want to do is you want to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.230 
now what you want to do is you want to
slide<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.170> forward<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.860> want<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.790> pop<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.120> off

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
slide it forward you want to pop it off

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.570 
slide it forward you want to pop it off
and<00:02:26.570> then<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.350> want<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.530> slide<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.830> back<00:02:28.130> to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
and then you want to slide it back to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.190 
and then you want to slide it back to
come<00:02:28.760> off<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.210> then<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:30.170> will<00:02:30.380> come<00:02:30.440> off<00:02:32.200> you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
come off and then this will come off you

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.930 
come off and then this will come off you
can<00:02:33.380> see<00:02:33.560> here<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> heatsink

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
can see here that this is the heatsink

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.760 
can see here that this is the heatsink
and<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.180> fan<00:02:35.390> assembly<00:02:35.720> for<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.230> AMD

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
and the fan assembly for the AMD

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.890 
and the fan assembly for the AMD
processor<00:02:38.470> we<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.590> an<00:02:39.770> D<00:02:40.040> processor<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:41.540> is

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
processor we have an D processor this is

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.080 
processor we have an D processor this is
different<00:02:42.620> than<00:02:42.860> those<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:43.910> work

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
different than those of you that work

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.550 
different than those of you that work
with<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.300> Intel<00:02:44.540> processors<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.350> it's

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
with the Intel processors it's it's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.260 
with the Intel processors it's it's
differently<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.760> just<00:02:46.970> pop<00:02:47.300> this<00:02:47.480> little

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
differently you just pop this little

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.910 
differently you just pop this little
piece<00:02:50.270> up<00:02:50.450> you'll<00:02:50.660> hear<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.900> click<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.380> then

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
piece up you'll hear it click and then

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.510 
piece up you'll hear it click and then
the<00:02:52.040> processor<00:02:52.640> comes<00:02:53.510> out<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:55.280> want<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.460> be

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
the processor comes out you want to be

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.790 
the processor comes out you want to be
very<00:02:55.550> careful<00:02:56.060> with<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.330> this<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.320> different

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
very careful with it this is different

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.400 
very careful with it this is different
because<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.490> pins<00:02:58.760> go<00:02:59.000> into<00:02:59.420> little<00:03:00.230> holes

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
because the pins go into little holes

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.470 
because the pins go into little holes
that<00:03:00.710> are<00:03:00.770> there<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.310> then<00:03:01.850> we're<00:03:02.000> going<00:03:02.180> to

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
that are there and then we're going to

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:12.350 
that are there and then we're going to
change<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.230> out

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.370 

as<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.480> showed<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.720> before<00:03:13.870> here<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.890> Dell

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
as I showed you before here is the Dell

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.660 
as I showed you before here is the Dell
heatsink<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.500> fan<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.010> pulled<00:03:18.220> off<00:03:18.400> and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
heatsink and fan that I pulled off and

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.089 
heatsink and fan that I pulled off and
here<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.930> replacement<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.830> I'm<00:03:20.920> putting

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
here is the replacement that I'm putting

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.190 
here is the replacement that I'm putting
on<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.239> see<00:03:22.450> there<00:03:22.630> is<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.780> major

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
on you can see there is a major

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.040 
on you can see there is a major
difference<00:03:23.680> between<00:03:24.489> girth<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.540> between<00:03:25.810> the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
difference between girth and between the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.610 
difference between girth and between the
way<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.380> lines<00:03:26.950> up<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:28.450> AMD<00:03:28.930> came<00:03:29.260> with<00:03:29.470> the

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
way it lines up this AMD came with the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.380 
way it lines up this AMD came with the
triple<00:03:30.010> core<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.610> put<00:03:31.000> into<00:03:31.150> another

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
triple core that I put into another

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.120 
triple core that I put into another
machine<00:03:31.720> earlier<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.470> all<00:03:32.620> I'm<00:03:32.739> gonna<00:03:32.860> do<00:03:33.099> is

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
machine earlier so all I'm gonna do is

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.850 
machine earlier so all I'm gonna do is
just<00:03:33.280> use<00:03:33.730> this<00:03:34.000> one<00:03:34.209> out<00:03:34.590> instead<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.709> this

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
just use this one out instead of this

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.890 
just use this one out instead of this
one<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.700> could<00:03:36.790> probably<00:03:36.970> use<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.510> regular

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
one you could probably use the regular

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.120 
one you could probably use the regular
one<00:03:38.050> that's<00:03:38.230> on<00:03:38.349> there<00:03:38.530> but<00:03:38.709> because<00:03:38.830> I'm

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
one that's on there but because I'm

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.000 
one that's on there but because I'm
going<00:03:39.370> from<00:03:39.660> 45<00:03:40.660> what's<00:03:40.989> up<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.260> 95<00:03:41.650> I'm<00:03:41.830> going

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
going from 45 what's up to 95 I'm going

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:50.490 
going from 45 what's up to 95 I'm going
to<00:03:42.069> be<00:03:42.130> using<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:43.150> stronger<00:03:44.050> heavier<00:03:44.799> one<00:03:49.500> now

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
to be using the stronger heavier one now

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.630 
to be using the stronger heavier one now
that<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:50.860> am<00:03:51.010> ready<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.549> have<00:03:52.450> my<00:03:53.220> AMD<00:03:54.220> Phenom

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
that I am ready I have my AMD Phenom

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.360 
that I am ready I have my AMD Phenom
that<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:54.880> have<00:03:55.120> here<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.540> I'm<00:03:55.780> going<00:03:56.049> to<00:03:56.220> set<00:03:57.220> it

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
that I have here and I'm going to set it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.930 
that I have here and I'm going to set it
in<00:03:57.430> there<00:03:57.640> it'll<00:03:58.599> line<00:03:58.900> up<00:03:59.080> with<00:03:59.610> the<00:04:00.610> corner

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
in there it'll line up with the corner

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.550 
in there it'll line up with the corner
to<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.209> corner<00:04:01.330> you<00:04:01.840> can<00:04:02.140> see<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.380> we<00:04:02.440> have

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
to the corner you can see that we have

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.610 
to the corner you can see that we have
here<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:04.390> push<00:04:04.599> it<00:04:04.750> down<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.170> everything

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
here you push it down and everything

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.420 
here you push it down and everything
slides<00:04:05.920> in<00:04:06.160> nice<00:04:06.849> and<00:04:07.090> easy<00:04:07.799> then<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:08.950> go<00:04:09.160> with

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
slides in nice and easy then I go with

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.210 
slides in nice and easy then I go with
my<00:04:11.280> AMD<00:04:12.280> fan<00:04:13.349> now<00:04:14.349> it's<00:04:14.590> already<00:04:14.769> got<00:04:15.010> the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
my AMD fan now it's already got the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.009 
my AMD fan now it's already got the
thermal<00:04:15.670> paste<00:04:15.849> on<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.209> back<00:04:16.390> so<00:04:16.750> what<00:04:16.870> I'm

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
thermal paste on the back so what I'm

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.120 
thermal paste on the back so what I'm
going<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.200> do<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.530> just<00:04:17.739> hold<00:04:18.370> everything<00:04:18.729> up

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
going to do is just hold everything up

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:28.200 
going to do is just hold everything up
and<00:04:21.130> set<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.880> down<00:04:21.910> in<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.390> socket<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:28.060> can

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
and set it down in the socket so I can

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.490 
and set it down in the socket so I can
set<00:04:28.419> it<00:04:28.450> down<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.780> right<00:04:28.960> way<00:04:29.140> that<00:04:29.350> would<00:04:29.470> be

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
set it down the right way that would be

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:47.390 
set it down the right way that would be
much<00:04:29.770> easier<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.610> will<00:04:37.470> lock<00:04:38.470> it<00:04:38.710> in

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.240 

takes<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.550> little<00:04:48.699> bit<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:49.090> line<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.360> up<00:04:50.250> you

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
takes a little bit to line it up you

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.580 
takes a little bit to line it up you
want<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.520> walk<00:04:51.669> it<00:04:51.850> in<00:04:52.000> on<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:53.220> bottom<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
want to walk it in on the bottom of the
