amazing for example we'll just show you
a<00:02:42.310> couple<00:02:42.580> things<00:02:42.790> real<00:02:43.150> quickly<00:02:43.570> we<00:02:44.200> have<00:02:44.410> a

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
a couple things real quickly we have a

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.170 
a couple things real quickly we have a
this<00:02:46.660> pic<00:02:46.959> here<00:02:47.260> has<00:02:47.470> heat<00:02:47.940> grinding<00:02:48.940> and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
this pic here has heat grinding and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.640 
this pic here has heat grinding and
speed<00:02:49.660> right<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.370> if<00:02:51.519> i<00:02:51.700> find<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.780> stone<00:02:53.620> here

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
speed right so if i find this stone here

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.620 
speed right so if i find this stone here
i<00:02:54.390> get<00:02:55.390> glass<00:02:56.459> why<00:02:57.459> do<00:02:57.519> i<00:02:57.670> get<00:02:57.850> glass<00:02:58.239> when<00:02:58.600> I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
i get glass why do i get glass when I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.060 
i get glass why do i get glass when I
mind<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.110> stone<00:02:59.760> well<00:03:00.760> because<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:02.590> has<00:03:02.769> heat

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
mind the stone well because it has heat

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.060 
mind the stone well because it has heat
on<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.360> has<00:03:04.510> grinding<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.709> get

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
on it and it has grinding so you get

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.310 
on it and it has grinding so you get
sand<00:03:06.459> from<00:03:06.940> stone<00:03:07.299> if<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.660> grind<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.079> in<00:03:08.230> a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
sand from stone if you grind it in a

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.220 
sand from stone if you grind it in a
pulverizer<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.880> get<00:03:10.060> class<00:03:10.450> from<00:03:10.870> sand

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
pulverizer and you get class from sand

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.650 
pulverizer and you get class from sand
if<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.860> heat<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.160> in<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.459> furnace<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.150> first<00:03:13.450> it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
if you heat it in a furnace so first it

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.479 
if you heat it in a furnace so first it
grinds<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.350> then<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:14.709> heats<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.310> you

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
grinds it and then it heats it and you

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.100 
grinds it and then it heats it and you
get<00:03:15.700> glass<00:03:17.579> if<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:18.820> shift<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.510> right-click

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
get glass if you shift and right-click

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.580 
get glass if you shift and right-click
it<00:03:20.890> turns<00:03:21.250> on<00:03:21.549> area<00:03:22.450> mode<00:03:22.750> let<00:03:23.230> me<00:03:23.290> turn<00:03:23.530> off

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
the ground that was this big so we did

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.910 
the ground that was this big so we did
it<00:03:37.060> illustrate<00:03:37.930> again<00:03:38.220> I'll<00:03:39.220> show<00:03:40.560> mine<00:03:41.560> right

amazing and it's all driven by this

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.540 
amazing and it's all driven by this
force<00:03:51.780> infuser<00:03:52.349> here<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.040> we're<00:03:53.220> basically

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
force infuser here and we're basically

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.330 
force infuser here and we're basically
