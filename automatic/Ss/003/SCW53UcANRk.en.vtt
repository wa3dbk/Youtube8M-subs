00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
to be made to kind of insert dark comedy

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.490 
to be made to kind of insert dark comedy
into<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> movie<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.780> sometimes<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> works

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
into the movie and sometimes it works

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
into the movie and sometimes it works
and<00:01:07.619> sometimes<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.400> made<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.670> awkward<00:01:09.060> laughs

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360

some<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.299> acting<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.780> truly<00:01:16.140> appalling

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
some of the acting is truly appalling

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
some of the acting is truly appalling
and<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.009> couldn't<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.460> over<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> large

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and I couldn't get over it for a large

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.550 
and I couldn't get over it for a large
portion<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> movie<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.350> definitely

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
portion of the movie and I definitely

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.109 
portion of the movie and I definitely
saw<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> ending<00:01:20.310> coming<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:20.880> very

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
saw the ending coming it was very

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
saw the ending coming it was very
in-your-face<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> certain<00:01:22.320> thing<00:01:22.530> was
