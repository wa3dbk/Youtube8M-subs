hi<00:00:03.750> I'm<00:00:04.290> gossamer<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.190> I'm<00:00:05.640> making<00:00:05.910> this

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
hi I'm gossamer and I'm making this

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.390 
hi I'm gossamer and I'm making this
video<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.839> teach<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.259> how<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.440> make<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.919> helix

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
video to teach you how to make a helix

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.350 
video to teach you how to make a helix
bun<00:00:08.670> which<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.860> now<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.429> helix<00:00:11.820> bun<00:00:12.059> is

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
bun which is this now the helix bun is

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.350 
bun which is this now the helix bun is
something<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.900> invented<00:00:13.290> about<00:00:14.240> two<00:00:15.240> and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
something that I invented about two and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.880 
something that I invented about two and
a<00:00:15.450> half<00:00:15.480> years<00:00:15.900> ago<00:00:15.960> totally<00:00:16.740> by<00:00:16.859> accident

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
a half years ago totally by accident

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.120 
a half years ago totally by accident
when<00:00:17.460> trying<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> do<00:00:17.910> an<00:00:18.029> infinity<00:00:18.480> bun<00:00:19.070> and<00:00:20.070> I

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
when trying to do an infinity bun and I

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.240 
when trying to do an infinity bun and I
found<00:00:20.310> out<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.670> really<00:00:21.240> secure<00:00:22.250> looks

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
found out that it's really secure looks

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.269 
found out that it's really secure looks
way<00:00:23.880> cooler<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.720> way<00:00:24.930> more<00:00:24.960> complicated<00:00:25.859> than

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
way cooler and way more complicated than

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.349 
way cooler and way more complicated than
it<00:00:26.400> actually<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.660> held<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:28.830> entirely<00:00:29.330> by<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
it actually is and held up entirely by a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.870 
it actually is and held up entirely by a
single<00:00:30.750> stick

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
single stick

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.760 
single stick
so<00:00:32.880> let's<00:00:33.660> teach<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.899> how<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:36.770> my

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
so let's teach you how to do it and my

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.479 
so let's teach you how to do it and my
cats<00:00:38.100> will<00:00:38.399> help<00:00:38.670> me<00:00:39.590> all<00:00:40.590> right<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:43.250> you<00:00:44.250> want

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
cats will help me all right so you want

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.400 
cats will help me all right so you want
to<00:00:44.670> start<00:00:45.620> fairly<00:00:46.620> high<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.070> your<00:00:47.280> head

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
to start fairly high on your head

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.660 
to start fairly high on your head
Thank<00:00:49.410> You<00:00:49.649> cat<00:00:50.420> with<00:00:52.340> twisting<00:00:53.340> like<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
Thank You cat with twisting like you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.799 
Thank You cat with twisting like you
would<00:00:53.850> first<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> bun

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
would first in a bun

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.869 
would first in a bun
but<00:00:55.170> I'm<00:00:55.260> starting<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.010> guess<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.520> about<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
but I'm starting I guess right about the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.099 
but I'm starting I guess right about the
middle<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> my<00:00:57.390> head<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.760> now<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:01:00.120> just

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
middle of my head then now I'm just

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.160 
middle of my head then now I'm just
twisting<00:01:01.829> around<00:01:02.420> four<00:01:03.420> would<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> first

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
twisting around four would be the first

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.010 
twisting around four would be the first
loop<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.619> us<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.979> bun<00:01:06.110> as<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.340> here

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
loop of us in a bun as you can see here

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.800 
loop of us in a bun as you can see here
what<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> want<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:11.070> however<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.150> flip

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
what you want to do now however is flip

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.660 
what you want to do now however is flip
it<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.560> give<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> little<00:01:14.010> slack<00:01:14.250> by

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
it and you give it a little slack by

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.289 
it and you give it a little slack by
letting<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> twist<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.119> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
letting up on the twist and you do this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
letting up on the twist and you do this
and<00:01:20.060> flip<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> loop<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and flip and you have a loop here and it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
and flip and you have a loop here and it
comes<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.549> bottom<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.500> keep

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
comes at the bottom so now that you keep

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.649 
comes at the bottom so now that you keep
that<00:01:26.040> loop<00:01:26.280> secured<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:27.000> non-dominant

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that loop secured with your non-dominant

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.130 
that loop secured with your non-dominant
hand<00:01:28.400> keep<00:01:29.400> twisting<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
hand keep twisting now you're going to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.219 
hand keep twisting now you're going to
make<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> bottom<00:01:31.560> loop

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.890 

when<00:01:39.229> you've<00:01:39.380> got<00:01:39.940> enough<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.330> twist<00:01:41.630> and

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
when you've got enough of a twist and

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.039 
when you've got enough of a twist and
pardon<00:01:42.350> me<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:42.710> really<00:01:43.240> but<00:01:44.240> 95<00:01:45.020> percent

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
pardon me it's really but 95 percent

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.380 
pardon me it's really but 95 percent
humidity<00:01:45.740> today<00:01:46.220> my<00:01:46.490> hair<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.850> just<00:01:47.000> sticking

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
humidity today my hair is just sticking

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.219 
humidity today my hair is just sticking
to<00:01:47.540> everything<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.799> me<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:50.750> have<00:01:50.930> enough<00:01:51.170> of

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
to everything and me you have enough of

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.410 
to everything and me you have enough of
a<00:01:51.350> twist<00:01:51.650> you're<00:01:52.430> going<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.759> do<00:01:52.880> another<00:01:53.119> twist

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
a twist you're going to do another twist

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.050 
a twist you're going to do another twist
and<00:01:53.600> make<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.780> bottom<00:01:54.200> loop<00:01:57.700> now<00:01:58.700> what<00:01:58.909> this

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
and make a bottom loop now what this

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.030 
and make a bottom loop now what this
does<00:01:59.330> if<00:01:59.659> I<00:01:59.780> keep<00:01:59.960> my<00:02:00.080> hands<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.890> way

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
does if I keep my hands of the way

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.230 
does if I keep my hands of the way
enough<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.490> show<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.759> is<00:02:02.649> it<00:02:03.649> makes<00:02:04.240> something

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
enough to show you is it makes something

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.779 
enough to show you is it makes something
like<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:06.549> bottom<00:02:07.549> loop<00:02:07.850> top<00:02:08.630> loop<00:02:09.789> here's

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
like this bottom loop top loop here's

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.160 
like this bottom loop top loop here's
where<00:02:11.150> you're<00:02:11.330> going<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.600> do<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> little<00:02:11.930> bit

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
where you're going to do a little bit

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.699 
where you're going to do a little bit
more<00:02:12.200> twisting<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.640> go<00:02:15.610> over<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.720> and

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
more twisting and go over like that and

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.600 
more twisting and go over like that and
now<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.130> see<00:02:19.459> how<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:21.739> twist<00:02:22.069> in<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> middle

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
now you see how that twist in the middle

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.670 
now you see how that twist in the middle
is<00:02:22.760> formed<00:02:23.209> now<00:02:23.660> what<00:02:24.050> happens<00:02:24.350> because<00:02:24.500> you

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
is formed now what happens because you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.509 
is formed now what happens because you
have<00:02:24.709> all<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.459> hair<00:02:25.700> left<00:02:25.940> over<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:28.310> is

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
have all this hair left over this is

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.970 
have all this hair left over this is
probably<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.180> look<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:30.019> goes<00:02:30.319> better<00:02:30.680> on

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
probably a look that goes better on

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.070 
probably a look that goes better on
people<00:02:31.370> who<00:02:31.580> are<00:02:31.730> between<00:02:31.910> about<00:02:32.300> tailbone

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
people who are between about tailbone

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.650 
people who are between about tailbone
length<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.830> mean<00:02:34.100> length<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.850> think<00:02:35.180> because

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
length and mean length I think because

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.080 
length and mean length I think because
of<00:02:35.690> ankle<00:02:36.260> length<00:02:36.380> right<00:02:36.680> now<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.190> have<00:02:37.730> this

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
of ankle length right now I have this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.900 
of ankle length right now I have this
and<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:39.530> means<00:02:40.030> by<00:02:41.030> having<00:02:41.329> a<00:02:41.360> very<00:02:41.709> obvious

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
and it means by having a very obvious

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.319 
and it means by having a very obvious
bun<00:02:44.049> underneath<00:02:45.049> my<00:02:45.620> helix<00:02:46.040> here<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.299> that

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
bun underneath my helix here and on that

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.110 
bun underneath my helix here and on that
side<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.709> fine<00:02:49.070> but<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.670> doesn't<00:02:49.880> look<00:02:50.000> as

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
side it's fine but it doesn't look as

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.180 
side it's fine but it doesn't look as
elegant<00:02:50.600> as<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:51.200> would<00:02:51.380> without<00:02:51.560> much<00:02:51.920> about

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
elegant as it would without much about

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.490 
elegant as it would without much about
underneath<00:02:52.579> so<00:02:53.209> now<00:02:53.360> here<00:02:53.630> we<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:54.170> take<00:02:54.350> your
