00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.080
 republic is one of us 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.970
 unknown manufacturer of headphones 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.290
 and that's partly because of that 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.550
 for two years no products in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.660
 Germany could be sold that 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.490
 is partly due to the packaging 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.460
 who are not compliant now 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.199
 But they go back and want beats 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.550
 We will learn that fear 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.310
 looked at what is behind it and 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.109
 Just look at us now 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.310
 speaker the wireless headsets and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.310
 the normal headset 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.199
 Let's start with the first one 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.540
 headset these are the 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.920
 so-called relays board that are whole 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.500
 normal headphones in the aux 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.690
 Connection of every smartphone itself 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.250
 be infected 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.960
 the packaging is still the one 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.329
 bit hook is but if we are 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 then have done it then 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.019
 around here quite passable headphones 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:00.289
 possibly with us we have here 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:00.289
 an instruction manual guarantee 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.280
 Replacement replacement plugs for the headphones 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.570
 myself and the actual head around 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.570
 the need to meet out 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.310
 well then my personal or for that 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.070
 I have the most interest shadow 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.540
 Wireless is the name of the whole thing 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.140
 wireless headphones are not very 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.550
 looking forward to it and great fan of times 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.210
 look what they can and how they do 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.370
 appearance 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.720
 still no free here 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.710
 packing maybe you should still 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.710
 a bit of design 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.300
 there are the good pieces are already 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.869
 very fancy the packaging can 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.869
 say 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:21.250
 Here we find a guide how to 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:22.750
 the whole lives and connects exactly that 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.030
 idea behind it is you put that down 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.370
 whole quasi simply dies around the neck 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.630
 the headphones on and then you go 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.280
 assuming that the whole thing too 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.390
 is reasonably safe even if 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.490
 you somehow walk here 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.410
 quick start guide and of course because of it 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.500
 is wireless and certainly that is too 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.850
 a battery with a usb charging cable 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.120
 micro usb connection 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.260
 Of course, there are also replacement plugs 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.680
 because you always like to lose 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.900
 that 's it for the shadow wireless for the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.850
 moment and last but not least we have here 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.980
 still the punk that is a bluetooth 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.390
 loudspeaker in a very frust free 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.130
 thank god 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.470
 The one puts so easy because with 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.730
 via bluetooth connection connects 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.470
 the mobile phone and plays the music 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.810
 this speaker off pretty loud 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.450
 Apparently we heard that way 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.890
 a louder or quieter key is that 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.209
 whole also equipped that means one 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.920
 does not have to grab the mobile phone every time 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.780
 but just to this puck and 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.610
 yes more is the fact almost 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.320
 not in the packaging if everything 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.820
 what is still here is one 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.500
 user manual an aux cable and 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.300
 a great gift that gives output 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.920
 Of course, then it makes sense if the battery is empty 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.459
 Is that still the case? 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.459
 music continues 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.080
 thank god on video
