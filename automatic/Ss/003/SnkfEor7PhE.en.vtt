00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
three-point contest in my my career

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.170 
three-point contest in my my career
series<00:02:38.080> look<00:02:38.650> at<00:02:38.770> him<00:02:38.920> struggling<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.820> here

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
series look at him struggling out here

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.630 
series look at him struggling out here
he<00:02:40.540> does<00:02:40.810> gets<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.320> money<00:02:41.470> fall<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:42.010> fall<00:02:42.280> and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
he does gets the money fall to fall and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.940 
he does gets the money fall to fall and
I<00:02:42.700> think<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.270> means<00:02:43.540> he<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.140> moving<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
I think that means he is moving on to

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.940 
I think that means he is moving on to
the<00:02:45.070> second<00:02:45.580> round<00:02:45.850> yup<00:02:46.630> 11<00:02:47.350> points<00:02:47.800> and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
the second round yup 11 points and

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.770 
the second round yup 11 points and
you're<00:02:48.340> moving<00:02:48.670> on<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.120> second<00:02:49.540> round

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
you're moving on to the second round

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.020 
you're moving on to the second round
that<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.080> just<00:02:50.440> crazy<00:02:50.740> look<00:02:51.610> at<00:02:51.790> this

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
that is just crazy look at this

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.150 
that is just crazy look at this
performance<00:02:52.390> right<00:02:52.720> there<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.710> is<00:02:53.920> most

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
performance right there this is most

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.580 
performance right there this is most
likely<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.610> worst<00:02:55.030> 3-point<00:02:55.930> contest<00:02:56.020> that

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
likely the worst 3-point contest that

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.130 
likely the worst 3-point contest that
I've<00:02:56.710> ever<00:02:56.920> seen<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.490> my<00:02:57.550> entire<00:02:57.880> life<00:02:58.660> so

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.720 
I've ever seen in my entire life so
let's<00:02:59.350> hope<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.770> the<00:02:59.950> second<00:03:00.340> round<00:03:00.490> is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
let's hope that the second round is

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.820 
let's hope that the second round is
going<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.090> be<00:03:01.210> a<00:03:01.540> little<00:03:01.990> bit<00:03:02.140> better<00:03:02.380> for

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
going to be a little bit better for

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.890 
going to be a little bit better for

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
points in the second round well I think

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.979
