00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:15.610
 hi girls who are today I bring you a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.279
 floral design a beautiful decorated 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.830
 let's start 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:27.650
 applying two layers of pink base 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.650
 and we are going to do a French 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.880
 Violet 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.520
 in these moments we are going to draw a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.570
 rose a flower 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.430
 with white that is going to be our draft 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:54.340
 then if the color the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.340
 glazes that you like 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.850
 let's give a little life to this 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.500
 French doing it the three lines a 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.920
 shorter the other more medium and the other 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 long 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:47.770
 we started coloring our flower 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.240
 I chose the yellow color in yellow and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.840
 Clear 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.840
 with 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:01.090
 silver shine in the center and above 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.670
 with a thin brush we will choose the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.510
 enamel 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.770
 orange 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:12.300
 and we are going to make some little lines so that 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.300
 contrast with this flower 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.100
 for the leaves we are going to apply a green 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.610
 a green apple green clarito and over 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.130
 let's delineate the or do other 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.130
 strips with darker green 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:48.040
 we finished giving a touch of brightness 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.440
 on top of our French with a line 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.020
 silver 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.980
 and the most important 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.990
 a layer of transparent enamel for 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.450
 protect our decoration 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.530
 I hope you liked it we'll see you
