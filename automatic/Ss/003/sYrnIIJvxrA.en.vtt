00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 we're going to show you how the 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.520
 application that allows changing the 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.130
 resolution of the contacts of the photos 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.460
 of the contacts and use photos in a 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.200
 higher resolution historically for the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.230
 photos of the contacts google uses a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.470
 resolution of 96 by 96 pixels in the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.150
 modern phones especially knows that 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.250
 this resolution is very bad and the photos 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.600
 that they are very pixilated, as we will see 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.039
 our application is possible to use 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.900
 photos of 256 by 256 pixels without any 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.669
 kind of problem and if we have the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.040
 Rooted phone we can use photos 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.750
 of a lot more resolution we're going to do 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 a call for you to see the effect 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.940
 when we make a call and we have not 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.230
 used this application we will see that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.230
 the photos will be visited 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.170
 as we see the photo it looks pretty 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.170
 pixelated 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.930
 now let's access the application and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.850
 let's modify the contact's photo 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.910
 a higher resolution and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.829
 we have prepared 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.840
 let's see first the effect so that 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.120
 see what would be the difference that is the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.560
 current photo and this is the picture we're going 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.450
 to put and that has much more 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.890
 resolution is the same photo that we have 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.960
 used through google to 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.120
 put it in the contact but that google 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.330
 has reduced resolution and we have 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.800
 seen that it was pixilated 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.050
 then we apply the photo 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.940
 and even applied and now we're going to do 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.170
 a phone call to the same number 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.170
 so we can see the effect 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.729
 as we see the picture appears now with 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.729
 a lot more resolution 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.060
 and we have seen that applying the photo has 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.039
 it was very simple if we synchronized 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.109
 our contacts with google this photo 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.240
 It will remain as we have put it 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.579
 now it will not be seen again in low 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.200
 resolution let's see now the 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.200
 application configuration options 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.240
 the save button allows us to export 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.520
 the current photos of the contacts 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.950
 photos of friends and facebook 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.110
 photos of the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.940
 followers or people that we follow 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.940
 on facebook sorry on twitter 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.780
 is the little button is to re-synchronize 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.730
 the pictures 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.170
 if we want if we have a very 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.450
 long photos and what we want is 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.240
 look for a specific photo or a photo that 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.240
 follow a pattern so we can search 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.450
 in this case there is none of the group the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.450
 Pattern 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.400
 we cancel 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.500
 this little button is for the functions of 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.970
 configuration we can set the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.250
 directory in which we want you to look 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.220
 the photos or the directory in which 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.350
 will record the photos that we download from 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.170
 twitter or facebook or photos 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.890
 current contacts we can say 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.350
 that from this directory it 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.930
 also include subdirectories that 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.350
 just show us the contacts that 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.370
 they have assigned a phone number 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.370
 that ignores uppercase and lowercase 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.340
 how we want it to match between 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.310
 photo of the contact and the photo of the photo 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.750
 that we want to assign because in the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.800
 application what it does is that the photos 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.050
 that we have in the directory 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.300
 selected they have to do marches 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.720
 with the name of the contact to be able 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.720
 to assign 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.500
 when we download photos if we want 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.100
 that about write files that we have 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.560
 with the same name or not if we have that 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.020
 what it will do is that we will have a copy 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.970
 with another name if we want the 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.710
 photos that do not match with any 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.900
 contact appear in black and white 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.770
 to quickly see that they do not match 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.990
 with none 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.210
 where we want the bar to appear 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.630
 of icons up down or just that 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.840
 do not appear 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.990
 if we want to use higher mass photos 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.840
 resolution is to say more than 256 by 256 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.090
 pixels we have to activate here 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.050
 if we apply photos in higher 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.760
 resolution 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.720
 we will have to restart the device 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.030
 once the photos are applied and 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.549
 Here we indicate what size of photo 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.560
 we want to apply if we want it not 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.400
 automatically scale the photos 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.860
 we mark here if we want the photos 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.820
 escalate because we simply indicate 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.820
 what scale do we want 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.160
 the cache photos is the list of photos if 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.810
 we want you to have a cache read them 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.880
 all at the beginning with which he is alone 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.889
 will go much faster if we want the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.560
 read when 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.599
 you need them the first scroll will go more 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.710
 slow and the others will go faster and if 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.810
 we do not want this to be for 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.150
 devices with very low memory and no 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.949
 It is recommended because the effect of 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.259
 scroll from the list of photos will go quite 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.979
 slow and that's it since we finished the 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.749
 explanation of how this works 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.409
 application that we encourage you to try 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.409
 Thank you
