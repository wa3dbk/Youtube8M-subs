00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello everyone, this issue of enem 2014 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.069
 objective of constructing an equation 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.780
 high school 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.790
 she said that a teacher after 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.870
 correct the tests your students noticed 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.139
 that several issues were very 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.840
 difficult then to make up for it is 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.760
 used a function is of degree less than 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.550
 3 to change the notes x for notes and 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.039
 equal to fdx as follows the note 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.650
 zero and to remain 10 to note 10 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.770
 would remain on this note 5 would pass 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.440
 to be any expression of the function y 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.809
 yo fdx to be used by the teacher 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.469
 good , easy to solve this 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.840
 question 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.670
 the situation was lower than the third 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.320
 then she was at maximum is with the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.140
 high school action an equation of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.800
 high school is given by fdx equal to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.699
 warn x squared plus bx more if 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.140
 so we meet the given conditions 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.949
 For the problem, we'll tell you what. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.350
 when x 0 then fd01 will have to be 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.460
 zero the zero note remains 0 then efe 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.040
 from 0 to 0 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.470
 replacing here the xis of our equation 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.500
 second grade 1 to 0 the result 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.740
 will have to give zero then sometimes 0 to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.400
 Square more serious steak but be equal to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 zero 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.860
 with this result here will give zero 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.560
 performed 0 b 0 to 0 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.630
 so I 'll have to be zero 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.280
 then in our equation of the second degree the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.710
 0 when ox was the 10th and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.560
 will be 10 then f10 equal to 10 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.909
 replacing x by 10 and came back sometimes 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.399
 10 squared more times 10 but I know that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.540
 at 0 will be equal to 10 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.259
 so I 'm going to have 100 plus 10 b 's the same 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.390
 to 10 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:01.110
 ok already when there is ox for 5 and it will be 6 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.369
 note 5 to be 6 then effect from 5 to 6 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.780
 sometimes replacing x5 squared more 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.090
 bbc 5 plus you that is zero equals 6 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.390
 then 25 to 5 b 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.739
 is equal to 6 from there we have a 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.930
 system of two equations of this 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:26.709
 beginning to simplify pure for the first 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.010
 with the unarmed action 10b is equal to 10 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.190
 if I split everything by 10 and went back 10 to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.720
 plus b is equal to one then putting well 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.700
 in evidence or tb equal to 1 - 10 a a 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.030
 I'm going to replace the value of b 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.590
 in the second equation 25 plus 5 came to 6 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.459
 substituting the value of b 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:52.420
 I will have 25 air five times the Blessing 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.310
 bené 1 - 10 to 15 times less 10 to this 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.160
 will be equal to 6 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.739
 so here I am going to have 25 to 5 - 50 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.670
 is equal to 6 solving these contents 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.049
 I'll have 25 the same - a step 25 that 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.000
 here is multiplying by one side of 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:15.280
 I'll have the area value 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.620
 equal to minus 1 over 25 11 25 years 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.660
 then in our equation of the second degree 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.489
 already has the value of a and already has the value of 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.660
 be that at 0 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.470
 uai - one about 25 to discover the value 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.930
 from b 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.900
 just play this value there is in here 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.380
 equation came to 1 - this kiss is not 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.760
 least ten times using so grab the 1 - Ten 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:43.419
 times less 1 on 25 - with less goes 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.750
 give more then I'll have one more 10 on 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:51.040
 25 always stay here for 5 10 split by 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.230
 5 to 2 25/5 of the five minimum shots 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.880
 common multiple between 1 and 5 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:01.359
 of 55 times 15 plus 27 fifths then the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.489
 bb is going to descend 7 fifths 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.530
 then it is only the values 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.750
 in this equation of the second degree the avaí sc 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.709
 - one on 25 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.040
 bb is going to be 7 fifths of x 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.910
 so I'll have oy equal to minus 1 on 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.849
 25 resist the square plus seven 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.390
 the 5th x times but they were or nothing 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.950
 this is the answer of the question is the letter a 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.230
 OK people 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.800
 questions leave in the comments is this until 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.800
 the next
