 [Music] 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.860
 [Applause] 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.330
 to ronaldo who is also newcomer 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.619
 to madrid you're going to be here a few days 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.220
 Goodnight 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.040
 if your a few days here I take advantage for 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.439
 from madrid where near since from 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.239
 I see it almost always and I think that 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.879
 This year is just as good as the year 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.800
 past so an honor is here another 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.760
 time because you have our first 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.449
 part what would you highlight 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.570
 good christians always moves from 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:49.360
 particular way and that impresses a lot 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.329
 with its quality with the ball 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.170
 I would not make any pass of envy either 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.440
 well I took advantage of it quite well 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.769
 all my career and especially that I left 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.659
 when he could not play anymore so 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.909
 nvidia no but I enjoy I enjoy the same 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.189
 that the fans so that the 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.770
 you took advantage of two gold balls and you have 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:17.000
 to give your favorite so I see if 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.300
 this year rather quiet of the year 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.380
 past where 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.870
 he has won too but it was not so clear 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.110
 that but this year it's pretty clear 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.970
 that he's going to win again and I'll be there 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.740
 also in the golden ball day 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.870
 Ronaldo will end up having 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.390
 Christian according to you that does not have messi 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.860
 good not that one has more than the other and 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.550
 the years are changing and the two continue 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.760
 at a very high level so 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.880
 it depends on the season that one takes 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.980
 on the other you're a Christian this is 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.470
