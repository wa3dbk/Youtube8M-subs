people to help me with this but here is
the<00:00:18.090> original<00:00:18.840> down<00:00:19.500> test<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:20.160> all<00:00:20.220> devices

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the original down test on all devices

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.599 
the original down test on all devices
when<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.300> let<00:00:21.480> go<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.810> exact<00:00:22.320> same<00:00:22.590> time<00:00:22.920> so

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
when I let go at the exact same time so

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.359 
when I let go at the exact same time so
there<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> goes<00:00:24.390> surprisingly<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.590> 3gs<00:00:26.130> was

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
there it goes surprisingly the 3gs was

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790 
there it goes surprisingly the 3gs was
first<00:00:26.699> followed<00:00:27.210> by<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> 3g<00:00:27.930> than<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> four

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
first followed by the 3g than the four

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.620 
first followed by the 3g than the four
and<00:00:29.039> then<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.400> 2g<00:00:29.789> there's<00:00:30.090> something<00:00:30.510> about

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and then the 2g there's something about

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.959 
and then the 2g there's something about
i<00:00:30.750> was<00:00:31.230> 6<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.679> lower<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.669> makes

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
i was 6 and lower that actually makes

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.150 
i was 6 and lower that actually makes
the<00:00:33.120> shutdown<00:00:33.630> time<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.050> lot<00:00:34.260> faster<00:00:34.559> than<00:00:34.980> i

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the shutdown time a lot faster than i

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.819 
the shutdown time a lot faster than i
was<00:00:35.399> seven<00:00:35.760> although<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.600> devices<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.170> iowa<00:00:37.500> 7

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
was seven although all devices on iowa 7

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.979 
was seven although all devices on iowa 7
shut<00:00:38.040> down<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> exact<00:00:39.030> same<00:00:39.329> time<00:00:39.690> which

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
shut down at the exact same time which

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.020 
shut down at the exact same time which
makes<00:00:40.260> me<00:00:40.500> think<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.950> do<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.460> change<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
makes me think what do they change and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880 
makes me think what do they change and
in<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> second<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.260> should<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.860> be

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
in a second here they should all be

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.100 
in a second here they should all be
turning<00:00:44.370> off<00:00:44.489> at<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> exact<00:00:45.090> same<00:00:45.390> time<00:00:45.690> now

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
turning off at the exact same time now

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.810 
turning off at the exact same time now
all<00:00:46.350> performing<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> bootup<00:00:47.250> test<00:00:47.520> i<00:00:47.640> just

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
all performing the bootup test i just

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.220 
all performing the bootup test i just
want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> let<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.180> guys<00:00:48.300> know<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.750> important

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
want to let you guys know it's important

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
want to let you guys know it's important
to<00:00:49.350> notice<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.280> from<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> 5s<00:00:51.120> under<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> 2g

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to notice that from the 5s under the 2g

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.510 
to notice that from the 5s under the 2g
there<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> massive<00:00:52.590> difference<00:00:53.039> in

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
there is a massive difference in

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.119 
there is a massive difference in
processing<00:00:54.059> power<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.420> ram<00:00:54.780> obviously<00:00:55.590> also

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
processing power and ram obviously also

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.889 
processing power and ram obviously also
the<00:00:56.460> software<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.030> different<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.750> could

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the software is different so that could

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.290 
the software is different so that could
majorly<00:00:58.379> affect<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.949> now<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.609> wasn't<00:01:00.210> too

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
majorly affect this now I wasn't too

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
majorly affect this now I wasn't too
surprised<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> 5s<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.680> course<00:01:01.890> came

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
surprised because the 5s of course came

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.160 
surprised because the 5s of course came
in<00:01:02.280> first<00:01:02.550> followed<00:01:03.030> by<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.449> five<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> five

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
in first followed by the five and five

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.380 
in first followed by the five and five
see<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.979> came<00:01:05.220> next<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:06.270> pretty

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
see what came next was actually pretty

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.030 
see what came next was actually pretty
surprising<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> let<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.710> guys<00:01:07.740> know

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
surprising and just to let you guys know

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
surprising and just to let you guys know
all<00:01:08.250> these<00:01:08.820> devices<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.450> freshly<00:01:09.780> restored

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
all these devices are freshly restored

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.770 
all these devices are freshly restored
non-jailbroken<00:01:11.000> completely<00:01:12.000> stock<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
non-jailbroken completely stock so the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.100 
non-jailbroken completely stock so the
5c<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.320> 5<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.920> followed<00:01:14.250> by<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.460> 4s<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
5c and 5 was followed by the 4s and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
5c and 5 was followed by the 4s and
surprisingly<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.380> 2g<00:01:17.100> came<00:01:17.549> before<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
surprisingly the 2g came before the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.800 
surprisingly the 2g came before the
iphone<00:01:18.479> 4<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> 3gs<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> iphone<00:01:21.420> 4

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
iphone 4 then the 3gs then the iphone 4

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.490 
iphone 4 then the 3gs then the iphone 4
and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.979> iphone<00:01:23.400> 3g<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.299> long<00:01:24.630> last<00:01:24.900> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and then the iphone 3g at long last that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200 
and then the iphone 3g at long last that
was<00:01:25.650> actually<00:01:25.770> really<00:01:26.070> surprising<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.000> me<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
was actually really surprising for me to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
was actually really surprising for me to
see<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.600> these<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:28.560> running<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
see because these are all running the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850 
see because these are all running the
latest<00:01:29.340> firmwares<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.630> 2g<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.229> obviously

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
latest firmwares and the 2g is obviously

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.249 
latest firmwares and the 2g is obviously
not<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.310> powerful<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> four<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:34.020> just

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
not as powerful as the four it's just

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
not as powerful as the four it's just
the<00:01:34.350> booting<00:01:34.680> sequence<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> way<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> works

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the booting sequence in the way it works

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.990 
the booting sequence in the way it works
probably<00:01:36.630> was<00:01:36.840> changed<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.409> Iowa<00:01:37.799> 7<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
probably was changed in Iowa 7 so that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.550 
probably was changed in Iowa 7 so that
could<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.360> fault<00:01:39.689> now<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> last<00:01:40.290> couple

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
could be a fault now for the last couple

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.440 
could be a fault now for the last couple
of<00:01:40.770> tests<00:01:41.159> i'm<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.490> load<00:01:41.640> reddit<00:01:41.970> com<00:01:42.299> in

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
apple com and the 5s is almost
instantaneous<00:01:45.500> thanks<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.680> extra

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
instantaneous thanks to the extra

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
instantaneous thanks to the extra
processing<00:01:47.159> power<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.329> new<00:01:48.450> Wi-Fi

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
processing power and the new Wi-Fi

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.569 
processing power and the new Wi-Fi
capabilities<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.710> an<00:01:49.799> amazing<00:01:50.340> web

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
capabilities it's an amazing web

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.190 
capabilities it's an amazing web
browsing<00:01:50.850> device<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.780> goes<00:01:51.930> downhill

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
browsing device and it goes downhill

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.130 
browsing device and it goes downhill
from<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> 5c<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
from there to the 5c and so on just to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
from there to the 5c and so on just to
confirm<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.860> applications<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.909> been

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
confirm all applications have been

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.389 
confirm all applications have been
closed<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.719> multitasking<00:01:58.500> bar<00:01:58.710> where

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
closed in the multitasking bar where

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.160 
closed in the multitasking bar where
applicable<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.149> we're<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> go

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
applicable and we're just going to go

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.200 
applicable and we're just going to go
ahead<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.350> load<00:02:01.740> reddit<00:02:02.100> com<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.180> go

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
ahead and load reddit com and here we go

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.810 
ahead and load reddit com and here we go
so<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.899> reddit<00:02:04.290> com<00:02:04.680> launched<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.670> all

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
so this is reddit com launched on all

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.479 
so this is reddit com launched on all
devices<00:02:06.030> at<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> same<00:02:06.570> time<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.500> 5s<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.190> king

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
devices at the same time the 5s is king

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.219 
devices at the same time the 5s is king
in<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.759> test<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.239> well<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.720> others<00:02:09.989> then

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in this test as well as all others then

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.770 
in this test as well as all others then
comes<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> five<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> 5c<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> 4s

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
comes the five then the 5c then the 4s

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.990 
comes the five then the 5c then the 4s
and<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> four<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:14.700> what<00:02:14.880> did

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and then the four and so on so what did

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.090 
and then the four and so on so what did
I<00:02:15.060> learn<00:02:15.240> doing<00:02:15.600> these<00:02:15.750> tests<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.319> learned<00:02:16.920> that

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
I learn doing these tests I learned that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.860 
I learn doing these tests I learned that
the<00:02:17.310> amount<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.819> processing<00:02:18.000> power<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the amount of processing power is

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.510 
the amount of processing power is
greater<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.380> course<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> generation<00:02:20.340> goes

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
greater of course as a generation goes

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.210 
greater of course as a generation goes
on<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.240> it's<00:02:21.420> marginally<00:02:22.200> less<00:02:22.620> noticeable

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
on but it's marginally less noticeable

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.699 
on but it's marginally less noticeable
the<00:02:23.580> higher<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.060> go<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.660> if<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> five

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the higher you go so if you have a five

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.100 
the higher you go so if you have a five
I<00:02:26.040> wouldn't<00:02:26.730> really<00:02:26.910> recommend<00:02:27.030> upgrading<00:02:27.690> or

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
I wouldn't really recommend upgrading or

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.900 
I wouldn't really recommend upgrading or
5s<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.830> based<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.160> fact<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.670> want

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
5s just based on the fact that you want

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.760 
5s just based on the fact that you want
extra<00:02:30.300> little<00:02:30.540> bit<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.810> power<00:02:30.989> because<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.530> has

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
extra little bit of power because it has

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.800 
extra little bit of power because it has
an<00:02:31.920> amazing<00:02:32.459> amount<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.760> power<00:02:32.940> as<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.510> if

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
an amazing amount of power as it is if

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.090 
an amazing amount of power as it is if
you're<00:02:33.870> always<00:02:34.380> upgrading<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.010> latest

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
spike in power you know this video I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.729 
spike in power you know this video I
just<00:02:39.390> show<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.600> guys<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.319> isn't<00:02:40.650> even
