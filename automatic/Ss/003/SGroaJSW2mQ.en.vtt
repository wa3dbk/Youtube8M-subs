00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
redstone torch the power rails won't be

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.630 
redstone torch the power rails won't be
powered<00:00:46.710> anymore<00:00:48.379> now<00:00:49.379> put<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.710> back<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.219> it's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
powered anymore now put it back and it's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.069 
powered anymore now put it back and it's
powered<00:00:51.149> again<00:00:52.910> see<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:53.940> hid<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.570> torch<00:00:54.840> over

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
powered again see I hid the torch over

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.939 
powered again see I hid the torch over
there<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.360> can<00:00:57.360> hide<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> other<00:00:58.260> blocks<00:00:58.710> if

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
there so I can hide the other blocks if

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:11.390 
there so I can hide the other blocks if
I<00:00:59.070> wanted<00:00:59.430> to<00:01:02.359> but<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:09.470> now<00:01:10.470> next<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
I wanted to but not now now next is the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.760 
I wanted to but not now now next is the
button

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
button

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.399 
button
it<00:01:13.219> works<00:01:13.700> like<00:01:13.939> a<00:01:14.090> lever<00:01:14.390> but<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:15.020> doesn't

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
it works like a lever but it doesn't

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.779 
it works like a lever but it doesn't
work<00:01:15.469> at<00:01:16.009> long<00:01:16.630> so<00:01:17.630> it's<00:01:18.039> levers<00:01:19.039> are<00:01:19.340> way<00:01:19.759> more

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
work at long so it's levers are way more

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.889 
work at long so it's levers are way more
useful<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:21.880> pressure<00:01:22.880> plates<00:01:23.240> are<00:01:23.509> like

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
useful and pressure plates are like

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.499 
useful and pressure plates are like
buttons<00:01:24.409> but<00:01:24.740> you<00:01:24.979> operate<00:01:25.850> them<00:01:26.030> with<00:01:26.240> your

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
buttons but you operate them with your

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:37.899 
buttons but you operate them with your
feet<00:01:32.799> then<00:01:33.799> next<00:01:34.130> is<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:34.789> dispenser<00:01:36.909> press

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
the button and the thing that's in it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.520 
the button and the thing that's in it
will<00:01:40.280> come<00:01:40.520> out<00:01:40.729> see<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:41.719> like<00:01:41.899> a<00:01:41.929> gumball

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
will come out see it's like a gumball

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.850 
will come out see it's like a gumball
machine<00:01:43.000> suppose<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.479> put<00:01:45.170> dirt<00:01:45.500> in<00:01:45.530> there

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.700 
sissons are useful for bridges see you
can<00:03:25.000> cross<00:03:25.210> over<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.720> bridge<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.290> get<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
can cross over this bridge to get to the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:36.450 
can cross over this bridge to get to the
leather<00:03:34.080> why<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.290> keep<00:03:35.620> pushing<00:03:36.100> like<00:03:36.250> that

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
leather why is it keep pushing like that

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:45.600 
leather why is it keep pushing like that
go<00:03:37.390> ahead<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.690> change<00:03:37.960> circuits<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:44.430> think<00:03:45.430> it's

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
go ahead to change circuits I think it's

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.250 
go ahead to change circuits I think it's
changing<00:03:46.180> speeds<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.990> it<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:47.560> my<00:03:48.360> stuff<00:03:52.260> now

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
changing speeds of it so my stuff now

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.810 
changing speeds of it so my stuff now
it's<00:03:53.440> really<00:03:53.800> fast<00:03:54.040> really<00:03:54.430> little<00:03:55.000> fast<00:03:56.760> do<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
it's really fast really little fast do I

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:07.500 
it's really fast really little fast do I
do<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.920> redstone<00:04:00.760> oh<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:04.450> get<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:06.330> just<00:04:07.330> get

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
do this redstone oh I get it just get

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.250 
do this redstone oh I get it just get
rid<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.840> crystal<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.710> it<00:04:09.250> will<00:04:09.370> stop<00:04:09.640> now

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.630 

last<00:04:14.260> but<00:04:14.410> not<00:04:14.680> least<00:04:14.740> is<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:16.739> sticky<00:04:17.739> piston

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
last but not least is the sticky piston

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.450 
last but not least is the sticky piston
dope<00:04:19.530> sticky<00:04:20.530> pistons<00:04:20.950> are<00:04:21.100> just<00:04:21.310> like

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
dope sticky pistons are just like

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.990 
dope sticky pistons are just like
Pistons<00:04:21.940> but<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:23.170> holds<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.680> block<00:04:24.000> useful

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
Pistons but it holds the block useful

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.030 
Pistons but it holds the block useful
for<00:04:25.240> doors<00:04:28.740> but<00:04:29.740> be<00:04:30.040> careful<00:04:30.810> if<00:04:31.810> you<00:04:32.470> push<00:04:33.010> a

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
for doors but be careful if you push a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.310 
for doors but be careful if you push a
sticky<00:04:33.550> piston<00:04:33.760> pressure<00:04:34.390> at<00:04:34.660> play<00:04:34.930> then<00:04:35.200> you

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
sticky piston pressure at play then you

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.920 
sticky piston pressure at play then you
get<00:04:35.590> stuck<00:04:35.890> in<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.070> wall<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.970> are<00:04:37.270> going<00:04:37.690> to

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
get stuck in the wall you are going to

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.710 
get stuck in the wall you are going to
get<00:04:38.400> quick<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.670> now<00:04:40.510> by<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.350> mean<00:04:41.400> rude

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
get quick and now by that I mean rude

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.190 
get quick and now by that I mean rude
and<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:45.730> see<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.090> red<00:04:46.240> stone<00:04:46.510> is<00:04:46.750> under<00:04:47.020> there

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
and you see the red stone is under there

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.140 
and you see the red stone is under there
that<00:04:47.470> redstone<00:04:47.800> torch<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.370> used<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.760> power<00:04:48.970> the

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
that redstone torch is used to power the

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.260 
that redstone torch is used to power the
first<00:04:52.150> piston<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:52.870> sick<00:04:53.440> end<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.610> word

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
first piston and sick end and the word

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.360 
first piston and sick end and the word
stone<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:55.870> second<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:58.000> right<00:04:58.930> stone<00:04:59.370> pal
