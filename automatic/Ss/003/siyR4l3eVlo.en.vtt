about is the del Tran battery tender

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.270 
about is the del Tran battery tender
this<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:30.990> also<00:03:31.290> referred<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.709> as<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.890> smart

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
this is also referred to as a smart

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.130 
this is also referred to as a smart
charger<00:03:32.760> because<00:03:33.270> we've<00:03:33.420> picked<00:03:33.690> up<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.020> your

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
charger because we've picked up to your

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.930 
charger because we've picked up to your
battery<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:35.010> going<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.280> charge<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.670> battery

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
battery it's going to charge the battery

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.760 
battery it's going to charge the battery
until<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.300> reaches<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.630> hundred<00:03:36.959> percent<00:03:37.080> and

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
until it reaches a hundred percent and

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.470 
until it reaches a hundred percent and
once<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.160> does<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.580> unit<00:03:38.820> will<00:03:38.940> switch<00:03:39.180> itself

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
once it does the unit will switch itself

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.140 
once it does the unit will switch itself
into<00:03:39.780> float<00:03:40.050> mode<00:03:40.230> or<00:03:40.500> storage<00:03:41.070> mode<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:42.000> what

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
into float mode or storage mode and what

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.400 
into float mode or storage mode and what
this<00:03:42.300> means<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.720> going<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.050> constantly

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
this means is going to constantly

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.650 
this means is going to constantly
monitor<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.070> charge<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.700> battery<00:03:44.940> and

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
monitor the charge of that battery and

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.540 
monitor the charge of that battery and
if<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.900> drops<00:03:46.170> under<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> full<00:03:46.739> charge<00:03:47.040> the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
if it drops under a full charge the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.580 
if it drops under a full charge the
charge<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.910> going<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.060> recognize<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.840> kick

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
charge is going to recognize that kick

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.140 
charge is going to recognize that kick
back<00:03:49.800> on<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.220> bring<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.489> battery<00:03:50.730> back<00:03:51.120> up

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
back on and bring that battery back up

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.479 
back on and bring that battery back up
to<00:03:51.480> a<00:03:51.510> hundred<00:03:51.690> percent<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.350> lot<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.280> times

the recommended level we'll talk a
little<00:04:44.259> more<00:04:44.409> about<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.190> also

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
little more about this and also

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.129 
little more about this and also
demonstrate<00:04:45.940> how<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.060> top<00:04:46.360> off<00:04:46.569> each<00:04:46.780> cell

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
demonstrate how to top off each cell

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.550 
demonstrate how to top off each cell
with<00:04:47.379> fluid<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.889> little<00:04:48.220> later<00:04:48.400> in<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.669> video

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
with fluid a little later in the video

battery some attention as well it's also

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.579 
battery some attention as well it's also
important<00:06:37.719> to<00:06:37.750> keep<00:06:37.899> all<00:06:38.169> your<00:06:38.320> connections

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:38.589 
important to keep all your connections

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:40.980 
important to keep all your connections
tight<00:06:39.130> loose<00:06:39.849> connections<00:06:40.360> can<00:06:40.539> also<00:06:40.690> lead<00:06:40.960> to

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
tight loose connections can also lead to

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.810 
tight loose connections can also lead to
unwanted<00:06:41.409> discharge<00:06:42.009> of<00:06:42.159> the<00:06:42.219> battery

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
unwanted discharge of the battery

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.550 
unwanted discharge of the battery
so<00:06:43.240> again<00:06:43.420> making<00:06:43.630> sure<00:06:43.780> everything<00:06:44.230> is<00:06:44.320> tight

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
so again making sure everything is tight

conventional or lead acid batteries

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.540 
conventional or lead acid batteries
during<00:07:23.590> the<00:07:23.650> life<00:07:23.830> of<00:07:23.950> the<00:07:24.040> battery<00:07:24.340> you<00:07:24.520> need

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
during the life of the battery you need

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.400 
during the life of the battery you need
to<00:07:24.760> watch<00:07:24.940> the<00:07:25.180> electrolyte<00:07:25.660> level<00:07:26.020> inside

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410 
to watch the electrolyte level inside

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.410 
to watch the electrolyte level inside
each<00:07:26.590> cell<00:07:26.980> especially<00:07:27.820> when<00:07:27.940> it's<00:07:28.090> charging

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420 
each cell especially when it's charging

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.900 
each cell especially when it's charging
add<00:07:28.750> only<00:07:29.740> distilled<00:07:30.130> water<00:07:30.370> when<00:07:30.700> necessary

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 
add only distilled water when necessary

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.270 
add only distilled water when necessary
and<00:07:31.450> then<00:07:32.110> it's<00:07:32.230> also<00:07:32.380> a<00:07:32.530> good<00:07:32.620> idea<00:07:32.680> to<00:07:32.950> charge

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 
and then it's also a good idea to charge

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.060 
and then it's also a good idea to charge
these<00:07:33.490> batteries<00:07:33.940> on<00:07:34.060> a<00:07:34.090> flat<00:07:34.360> surface
