00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
series to record anyway moving on this

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
series to record anyway moving on this
series<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.700> basically<00:00:33.180> I'll<00:00:33.300> get<00:00:33.450> any<00:00:33.630> race<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
series is basically I'll get any race to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.410 
series is basically I'll get any race to
division<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.829> road<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> glory<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.149> will<00:00:36.329> be

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
division or road to glory but I will be

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.150 
division or road to glory but I will be
in<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> zero<00:00:36.930> chemistry<00:00:37.170> team<00:00:37.530> throughout<00:00:37.800> so

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
in a zero chemistry team throughout so

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.650 
in a zero chemistry team throughout so
it<00:00:38.430> should<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.670> different<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> other<00:00:39.270> series

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it should be different to other series

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.170 
it should be different to other series
on<00:00:39.780> YouTube<00:00:40.079> haven't<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.010> seen<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.520> done

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
on YouTube haven't really seen it done

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700 
on YouTube haven't really seen it done
before<00:00:42.210> while<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> seen<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.110> individual

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
before while I seen that individual

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.770 
before while I seen that individual
videos<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.160> zero<00:00:44.340> chemistry<00:00:44.640> teams<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.390> they

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
videos on zero chemistry teams and they

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.330 
videos on zero chemistry teams and they
went<00:00:45.960> down<00:00:46.140> pretty<00:00:46.350> far<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.860> I'm<00:00:46.950> hoping<00:00:47.219> this

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
went down pretty far so I'm hoping this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010 
went down pretty far so I'm hoping this
series<00:00:47.700> will<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.360> entertaining<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> watch

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
series will be entertaining to watch

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.020 
series will be entertaining to watch
hopefully<00:00:49.559> now<00:00:50.190> i<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> doing<00:00:50.820> this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
hopefully now i will be doing this

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.700 
hopefully now i will be doing this
series<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.899> another<00:00:51.989> youtuber<00:00:52.680> called

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
series with another youtuber called

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.529 
series with another youtuber called
because<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:53.789> before<00:00:54.120> who<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.420> may

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
because you be not before who you may

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.569 
because you be not before who you may
know<00:00:54.590> there's<00:00:55.590> also<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.860> skillet<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.430> this

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
know there's also a skillet so this

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.220 
know there's also a skillet so this
series<00:00:56.760> will<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.180> pretty<00:00:57.510> interesting<00:00:58.020> we're

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
series will be pretty interesting we're

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.090 
series will be pretty interesting we're
going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> hopefully<00:00:58.559> make<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> gold

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
going to hopefully make a gold

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.580 
going to hopefully make a gold
compilation<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.120> best<00:01:00.510> goals<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.199> get

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
compilation of the best goals we get

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.529 
compilation of the best goals we get
from<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.370> series<00:01:02.730> thus<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.480> only

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
from this series thus if there is only

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.340 
from this series thus if there is only
because<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.260> pretty

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
because it's going to be pretty

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
because it's going to be pretty
challenging<00:01:04.920> i'm<00:01:05.430> guessing<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.450> check<00:01:06.810> out

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
challenging i'm guessing so check out

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.120 
challenging i'm guessing so check out
his<00:01:07.049> channel<00:01:07.110> his<00:01:07.470> link<00:01:07.710> will<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
his channel his link will be in the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.710 
his channel his link will be in the
description<00:01:08.340> below<00:01:08.790> anyway<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.330> we're<00:01:09.630> going

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
description below anyway now we're going

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.460 
description below anyway now we're going
to<00:01:09.780> move<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:11.010> team<00:01:11.220> while<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
to move on to the team while we use it

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.850 
to move on to the team while we use it
i'm<00:01:13.470> using<00:01:14.180> 352<00:01:15.180> or<00:01:15.450> five<00:01:15.990> star<00:01:16.229> Skyler<00:01:16.409> team

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
i'm using 352 or five star Skyler team

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.219 
i'm using 352 or five star Skyler team
so<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> should<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.460> pretty<00:01:17.520> good<00:01:17.990> left<00:01:18.990> striker

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so it should be pretty good left striker

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.649 
so it should be pretty good left striker
we<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.680> alia<00:01:20.400> from<00:01:20.759> werder<00:01:21.180> bremen<00:01:21.360> who<00:01:21.600> is

we have alia from werder bremen who is

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.149 
we have alia from werder bremen who is
pretty<00:01:21.900> fast<00:01:22.290> guy<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.740> i'll<00:01:22.830> put<00:01:22.950> him<00:01:23.040> up

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
pretty fast guy so i'll put him up

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.340 
pretty fast guy so i'll put him up
strike<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.939> adult<00:01:24.750> erupt<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
strike and then we have adult erupt the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.990 
strike and then we have adult erupt the
right<00:01:25.500> stalker<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.400> five<00:01:26.640> star
