and whilst I finish unboxing the Space

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.859 
and whilst I finish unboxing the Space
Gray<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.189> would<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.360> talk<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> little<00:01:45.720> bit

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
Gray I would like to talk a little bit

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.810 
Gray I would like to talk a little bit
about<00:01:45.960> what<00:01:46.649> makes<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.070> different<00:01:47.549> from<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
about what makes this different from the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.539 
about what makes this different from the
previous<00:01:48.329> iPad<00:01:49.049> air<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> there's<00:01:50.340> quite<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
previous iPad air and there's quite a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.810 
previous iPad air and there's quite a
number<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.240> things<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.689> been<00:01:51.780> upgraded

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
number of things that have been upgraded

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.249 
number of things that have been upgraded
including<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.030> screen<00:01:54.509> because<00:01:54.869> they've

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
including the screen because they've

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.370 
including the screen because they've
made<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> thinner<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.070> now<00:01:56.840> 6.1<00:01:57.840> millimetres

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
made it thinner it's now 6.1 millimetres

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.069 
made it thinner it's now 6.1 millimetres
instead<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.829> 7.5<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.090> that's<00:02:00.240> quite<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> bit<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
instead of 7.5 so that's quite a bit of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.030 
instead of 7.5 so that's quite a bit of
a<00:02:02.040> millimeter<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.180> bit<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:04.040> because

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
a millimeter in a bit and because

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.350 
a millimeter in a bit and because
they've<00:02:05.189> made<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.490> dinner<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:06.090> now

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
they've made this dinner it's now

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.419 
they've made this dinner it's now
actually<00:02:06.780> got<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> fully<00:02:07.530> laminated<00:02:07.890> display

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
actually got a fully laminated display

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.880 
actually got a fully laminated display
which<00:02:09.149> means<00:02:09.420> basically<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.379> less

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
which means basically it's just less

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.230 
which means basically it's just less
reflective<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.230> also<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:13.680> light

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
reflective and also it is now light

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.490 
reflective and also it is now light
it's<00:02:14.450> gone<00:02:14.660> from<00:02:14.860> 469<00:02:15.860> grams<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.550> 437<00:02:17.510> so

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
it's gone from 469 grams to 437 so

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.800 
it's gone from 469 grams to 437 so
that's<00:02:19.370> quite<00:02:19.580> a<00:02:19.610> bit<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.850> weight<00:02:20.000> gotten<00:02:20.720> off

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
that's quite a bit of weight gotten off

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.990 
that's quite a bit of weight gotten off
there<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.230> finally<00:02:22.130> they've<00:02:22.460> also<00:02:22.760> upgraded

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
there and finally they've also upgraded

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.760 
there and finally they've also upgraded
the<00:02:23.390> chip<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:23.930> now<00:02:24.080> running<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.950> AAA<00:02:25.280> X

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
the chip it is now running the AAA X

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.970 
the chip it is now running the AAA X
Apple<00:02:27.770> chip<00:02:28.130> with<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.760> 64-bit<00:02:29.980> architecture

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
Apple chip with the 64-bit architecture

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.630 
Apple chip with the 64-bit architecture
and<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.790> m8<00:02:32.150> motion<00:02:32.990> coprocessor<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.520> is

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
and the m8 motion coprocessor so that is

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.730 
and the m8 motion coprocessor so that is
super<00:02:34.820> fast<00:02:35.120> that's<00:02:35.390> actually<00:02:35.870> better<00:02:36.530> than

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
super fast that's actually better than

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.800 
super fast that's actually better than
the<00:02:36.800> one<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.460> iPhone<00:02:37.730> 6<00:02:38.000> amendment<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.630> I

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
the one in the iPhone 6 amendment and I

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.240 
the one in the iPhone 6 amendment and I
didn't<00:02:39.140> think<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.440> could<00:02:39.590> get<00:02:39.800> any<00:02:40.010> faster

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
didn't think you could get any faster

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.790 
didn't think you could get any faster
than<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.670> iPhone<00:02:40.940> 6<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:42.380> course<00:02:42.620> we've

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
than the iPhone 6 and of course we've

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.650 
than the iPhone 6 and of course we've
obviously<00:02:43.130> now<00:02:43.250> got<00:02:43.490> touch<00:02:43.670> ID<00:02:43.880> in<00:02:44.210> both<00:02:44.450> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
obviously now got touch ID in both the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.150 
obviously now got touch ID in both the
iPad<00:02:44.900> air<00:02:45.050> 2<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.830> iPad<00:02:46.130> Mini<00:02:46.310> 3<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.930> I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
iPad air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 and I

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.200 
iPad air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 and I
think<00:02:49.160> there's<00:02:49.340> definitely<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.790> reason<00:02:50.120> to

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
think there's definitely a reason to

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.910 
think there's definitely a reason to
upgrade<00:02:50.360> from<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.900> iPad<00:02:51.290> air<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.680> iPad

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
upgrade from the iPad air to the iPad

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.520 
upgrade from the iPad air to the iPad
air<00:02:52.040> 2<00:02:52.240> definitely<00:02:53.240> not<00:02:53.510> for<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.840> iPad<00:02:54.140> Mini<00:02:54.380> 2

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
air 2 definitely not for the iPad Mini 2

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.770 
air 2 definitely not for the iPad Mini 2
to<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.890> iPad<00:02:55.130> Mini<00:02:55.520> 3<00:02:55.580> though<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.360> that's

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
to the iPad Mini 3 though that that's

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.140 
to the iPad Mini 3 though that that's
just<00:02:57.110> how<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.530> see<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.890> all<00:02:58.460> they've<00:02:58.760> added<00:02:59.000> is

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
just how I see it all they've added is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.810 
just how I see it all they've added is
touch<00:02:59.330> ID<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.080> gold<00:03:00.350> color<00:03:00.620> option<00:03:01.100> the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
touch ID and the gold color option the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.090 
touch ID and the gold color option the
camera<00:03:02.180> has<00:03:02.210> also<00:03:02.450> been<00:03:02.750> updated<00:03:02.870> in<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.860> new

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
camera has also been updated in the new

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.850 
camera has also been updated in the new
iPad<00:03:04.460> air<00:03:04.580> 2<00:03:04.640> we<00:03:05.300> now<00:03:05.450> have<00:03:05.630> an<00:03:05.750> 8<00:03:05.960> megapixel

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
iPad air 2 we now have an 8 megapixel

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.280 
iPad air 2 we now have an 8 megapixel
camera<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:08.410> slow<00:03:09.410> motion<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.160> we<00:03:10.850> just<00:03:11.060> have

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
camera and slow motion and we just have

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.160 
camera and slow motion and we just have
much<00:03:12.290> better<00:03:12.590> than<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.490> previous<00:03:14.240> model<00:03:14.990> is

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
much better than the previous model is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.020 
much better than the previous model is
now<00:03:15.590> sort<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.160> par<00:03:16.400> with<00:03:17.380> phone<00:03:18.380> cameras

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
now sort of on par with phone cameras

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.580 
now sort of on par with phone cameras
rather<00:03:20.030> than<00:03:20.300> tablet<00:03:20.900> cameras<00:03:21.200> which<00:03:21.410> you
