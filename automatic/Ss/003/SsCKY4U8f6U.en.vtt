00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.370
 there are more people crowded in london now 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.710
 than ever in British history 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.059
 the capital cityâ€™s population exceeded 8 s 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.710
 half a million people 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.410
 it is expected that this figure will grow 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.990
 only in the last 25 years the amount 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 residents increased by 2 million and although 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.859
 the delights of london speak for themselves 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.189
 let's find out what the residents of the capital think 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.090
 a growing population seems to me that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.980
 london became too hectic of course in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.199
 the city can only build a limited 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.969
 the number of houses and transport can transport 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.219
 limited number of people here 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.550
 more and more people are coming and the city is not 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.079
 copes in london too much 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.800
 people in the subway and buses are not 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.540
 push over 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.160
 therefore, in my opinion, residents should 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.110
 become less although it is hardly possible 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.270
 don't you think that lives here too 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.910
 a lot of people and what do you think is simple 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.360
 look around I think to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.340
 many nations the city is crowded 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.770
 the main problem is her own now 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.940
 it is very difficult to find especially for people with 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.470
 low incomes now population 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.460
 london more than ever in history 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.700
 what do you think about it is crazy but in 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.979
 it's easy to believe this is the best city 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.360
 everyone wants to live here so they come 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 from europe 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.170
 I meet a lot of foreigners who 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.090
 think that as soon as they enter 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.990
 British land will collapse on them 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.750
 Golden Rain 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.720
 but it is not so live in London is incredible 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.040
 dear I came north if there y 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.369
 I had money that I earn 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.409
 here it would live in a mansion instead 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.900
 I have to huddle in a small but 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.869
 terribly expensive flat with another 4 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.979
 the guys promise to expand 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.720
 infrastructure and adapt it to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.729
 needs of a growing population however 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.920
 skeptics doubt that the city can 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.869
 accommodate even more people many not in 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.220
 delighted with the need to divide london 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.899
 with so many people 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.369
 but it seems to be disgruntled or 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.290
 accept or leave 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.570
 according to research after 35 years 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.180
 population of the capital will increase to 11 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.659
 million people anastasia churkina rt
