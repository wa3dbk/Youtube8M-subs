00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.710
 specialized in the production and 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.899
 export of bananas thanks to the 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.149
 kindness of the climate and incomparable

 properties of their floors that allow 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.860
 achieve high levels of productivity 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.350
 in this natural paradise the quirón group 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.780
 to account with 3,300 hectares of banana 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.550
 in fully technified production 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.350
 that meet all the requirements 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.630
 demanded by the ministry of

 agriculture and of which three farms 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.879
 400 hectares are in process 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.000

 agricultural practice and a farm of 70 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.160
 hectares has organic certification 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.470
 which will guarantee our customers 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.600
 better conditions of sale in the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.640
 markets due to the emphasis that is made 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.770
 in the health of food the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.869
 tracing the product to its place of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.670
 origin in the requirements on the use of

 national labor laws among others 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.720
 production processes selection of 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.160
 Quirola group land prioritizes the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.320
 selection of the best floors 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.180
 agricultural and the preparation of this 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.340
 through its proper cleaning 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.650
 mechanization and implementation of 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.520
 drainage and irrigation channels for 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.320
 Later proceed to planting 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.939
 the main element in the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.460
 establishment of a new plantation 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.549
 of banana is the selection of a good 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.219
 this seed is know scallion or Melis 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.799
 theme therefore select children 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.049
 healthy of a plantation that is known is 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.780
 The best guarantee to avoid problems 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.520
 of health in the short and medium term and is 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.799
 for this reason that the group quirola 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.649
 has its own propagation system 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.069
 with seedlings of local production and 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.629
 other imported from israel group quirón 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.090
 always the banana variety 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.579
 high productivity williams which 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.250
 requires management with state-of-the-art technology 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:24.830
 as fertigation prevention quality 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.740
 drainage and adequate nutrition 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.930
 I manage the plantation during its 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.510
 development receives all the care that 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.030
 modern technology demands so much with 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.010
 basic tasks as with others that have 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.610
 result of the investigation for the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.930
 integrated crop management 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.580
 among these are said to require 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.070
 consists of removing suckers or 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.110
 children who are not productive the concept 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.820
 basic is to keep only one 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.460
 sequence between the mother the son and a 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.690
 grandchild selecting only the best 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.050
 plants for production 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.340
 soybean leaf removal no 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.930
 functional irrigation and fertigation is 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.060
 in the application of the sheet of water 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.970
 necessary for physiological development 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.280
 of the crop which include the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.230
 fertilizer and nutrients all this 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.480
 it is done in a friendly way with the environment 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.060
 environment taking care of the balance between 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.430
 nature technology and high 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.160
 productivity by minimizing the use of 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.610
 chemical 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.920
 preventive cavity once developed 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.900
 the fruit is taken care of under procedures 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.030
 established quality control that 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.740
 allow the obtaining of healthy banana 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.950
 clean and with excellent quality from 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.320
 1960 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.790
 the doctor honoris cause esteban quirola 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.430
 has experimented with different 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.620
 cultural practices to improve the 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.140
 development and presentation of the fruit 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.000
 He pioneered the use of the cover for 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.080
 the bacillus as well as the use of 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.760
 protectors of the human segment 'today bypass 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.950
 another important practice that he developed 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.320
 Dr. Quirola was the chili 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.660
 fruit that consists in eliminating the segments 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.640
 small has just formed the cluster 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.370
 all this is based on the main 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.010
 concept of our production the 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.040
 quality 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.669
 and other tasks to review are the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.549
 deflore or shoring cleaning 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.550
 control receipt practices 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.900
 phytosanitary the Quirola group 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.660
 with highly technical staff 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.880
 qualified and with extensive experience in 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.650
 the management of pests and diseases of 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.350
 crop that reviews permanent 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.539
 prevention monitoring to evaluate and 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.270
 discuss the best procedures in 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.850
 each specific case with this methodology 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.430
 efficient control is achieved and 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.370
 minimize the applications of 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.030
 pesticides to avoid causing impacts on 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.970
 the environment 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.130
 and processing when the future has 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.050
 completed his physiological maturity is 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.780
 harvested very carefully to avoid 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.150
 damage and transported by cable lines 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.980
 ways to the packing plants for 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.970
 be qualified under parameters of 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.830
 quality demanded by our customers 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.600
 the tip is cleaned and sorted 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.360
 inside the processing pools 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.000
 to remove the natural latex 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.220
 complain clean clusters are heavy and 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.470
 then they receive a protective coating 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.420
 against pathogens what 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.140
 guarantees the preservation of its quality 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.570
 and that the consumer gets a fruit 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.830
 completely healthy finally the tip 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.570
 is packed according to the 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.370
 market requirements and 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.070
 transported to the ports of guayaquil 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.260
 or bolivar port to be exported to

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.120
 they have select farms dedicated to 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.650
 high quality banana production 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.960
 so our fruit is 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.390
