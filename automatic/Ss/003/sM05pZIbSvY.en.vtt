in Basel we are actually introducing an

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.370 
in Basel we are actually introducing an
extension<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.450> idea<00:02:07.780> which<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.110> the

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
extension of the the idea which is the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.930

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
I'm wearing actually right now so it's a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.320 
I'm wearing actually right now so it's a
particular<00:02:13.690> design<00:02:14.110> because<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:18.330> represents

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
particular design because it represents

the<00:02:22.150> skull<00:02:22.510> was<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.080> logo<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:24.460> group<00:02:24.760> of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
the skull was the logo of this group of

the skull was the logo of this group of
you<00:02:25.510> know<00:02:25.630> fighters<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:28.570> at<00:02:28.810> that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
you know fighters and and so at that

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.440 
you know fighters and and so at that

time it was very very very Pakistan on

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.000 
time it was very very very Pakistan on
this<00:02:31.630> concept<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.170> he<00:02:32.260> developed<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.770> idea<00:02:32.950> of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
this concept so he developed the idea of

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.370 
this concept so he developed the idea of
the<00:02:33.100> pen<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.610> pen<00:02:34.330> actually<00:02:34.630> made<00:02:35.230> it

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
the pen and the pen actually made it

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.350 
the pen and the pen actually made it
into<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.740> movie<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:36.070> Expendables<00:02:36.670> 2<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:37.150> has<00:02:37.330> a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
into the movie in Expendables 2 it has a

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.310 
into the movie in Expendables 2 it has a
scene<00:02:38.200> where<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.709> pen<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.070> no<00:02:39.450> shown<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.810> then

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
scene where the pen is no shown and then

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.640 
scene where the pen is no shown and then
and<00:02:41.830> then<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:43.090> thought<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.540> mean<00:02:43.750> we<00:02:43.900> need<00:02:44.110> to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
and then we thought I mean we need to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.340 
and then we thought I mean we need to
have<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.800> watch<00:02:45.360> versus<00:02:46.360> alone<00:02:46.750> aside<00:02:47.320> from

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
have a watch versus alone aside from

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.860 
have a watch versus alone aside from
being<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:48.100> pen<00:02:48.400> collector<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:48.910> cigar<00:02:49.360> smoker<00:02:49.480> is

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
being a pen collector a cigar smoker is

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.920 
being a pen collector a cigar smoker is
also<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.500> big<00:02:50.890> watch<00:02:51.100> fan<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.360> we<00:02:52.540> developed

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
also a big watch fan and so we developed

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.960 
also a big watch fan and so we developed
this<00:02:53.080> this<00:02:53.560> concept<00:02:53.740> we<00:02:54.160> launched<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.550> our<00:02:54.700> in

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
this this concept we launched in our in

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.220 
this this concept we launched in our in
Basel

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.640 

I<00:02:58.319> think<00:02:59.159> a<00:02:59.340> brain<00:02:59.610> like<00:02:59.879> Montegrappa<00:03:00.500> needs<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
I think a brain like Montegrappa needs a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.580 
I think a brain like Montegrappa needs a
