that space to dead space ignition is the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.939 
that space to dead space ignition is the
next<00:00:50.879> step<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.300> how<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:52.230> expanding<00:00:52.739> our

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
next step in how we are expanding our

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.619 
next step in how we are expanding our
story<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> dead<00:00:53.640> space<00:00:53.820> universe<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.329> if

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
story in the dead space universe so if

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.970 
story in the dead space universe so if
you<00:00:54.719> remember<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> first<00:00:55.199> dead<00:00:55.559> space<00:00:55.770> we

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you remember on the first dead space we

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.470 
you remember on the first dead space we
had<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> motion<00:00:56.460> comic<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:57.180> well

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
had the motion comic it was very well

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.760 
had the motion comic it was very well
received<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.109> want<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> take<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
received but we want to take that to the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.279 
received but we want to take that to the
next<00:00:58.859> level<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.809> doing<00:01:00.960> some<00:01:01.199> new

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
next level so we are doing some new

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.020 
next level so we are doing some new
tricks<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.770> respect<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> VFX<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
tricks with respect to the VFX and the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
tricks with respect to the VFX and the
camera<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> animation<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.619> we're<00:01:04.799> also

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
camera and the animation but we're also

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
camera and the animation but we're also
giving<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.280> some<00:01:05.430> interactivity<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
giving you some interactivity now so you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
giving you some interactivity now so you
actually<00:01:06.990> play<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> hacker<00:01:07.979> you're<00:01:08.580> going

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
actually play as a hacker you're going

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.980 
actually play as a hacker you're going
to<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> story<00:01:09.180> segment<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:09.900> you're

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
to get a story segment and then you're

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.450 
to get a story segment and then you're
going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> hacking<00:01:10.979> minigame

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to have to do a hacking minigame

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.190 
going to have to do a hacking minigame
and<00:01:11.729> there's<00:01:12.390> three<00:01:12.510> different<00:01:12.659> types<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
and there's three different types the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.499 
and there's three different types the
traceroute<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.860> system<00:01:14.159> override<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
traceroute the system override and the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.969 
traceroute the system override and the
hardware<00:01:15.960> crack<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.439> we've<00:01:16.560> got<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> puzzler

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
hardware crack so we've got a puzzler

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.550

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
weapons just yet but we were definitely

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.350 
weapons just yet but we were definitely
keeping<00:05:20.860> with<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.280> mining<00:05:21.640> tool<00:05:21.790> theme<00:05:22.120> you

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
keeping with the mining tool theme you

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.940 
keeping with the mining tool theme you
know<00:05:22.450> that's<00:05:22.600> very<00:05:23.050> very<00:05:23.290> important<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:23.830> us

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
know that's very very important to us

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.620 
know that's very very important to us
you<00:05:24.220> know<00:05:24.310> Isaac<00:05:24.729> is<00:05:24.880> not<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.060> super<00:05:25.450> soldier

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
you know Isaac is not a super soldier

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.090 
you know Isaac is not a super soldier
he's<00:05:25.900> an<00:05:26.020> engineer<00:05:26.410> so<00:05:26.440> he's<00:05:26.710> going<00:05:26.830> to<00:05:26.890> take

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
he's an engineer so he's going to take

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.980 
he's an engineer so he's going to take
what<00:05:27.700> works<00:05:27.910> best<00:05:28.180> against<00:05:28.479> the<00:05:28.570> Necromorphs

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
what works best against the Necromorphs

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.540 
what works best against the Necromorphs
and<00:05:29.110> that's<00:05:29.229> cutting<00:05:29.500> tools<00:05:29.800> it's<00:05:30.280> ripping

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
and that's cutting tools it's ripping

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.340 
and that's cutting tools it's ripping
their<00:05:30.790> their<00:05:31.240> bodies<00:05:31.660> apart<00:05:31.900> limb<00:05:32.110> from<00:05:32.140> limb

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
their their bodies apart limb from limb

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.790 
their their bodies apart limb from limb
so<00:05:32.740> definitely<00:05:33.400> keeping<00:05:33.580> in<00:05:33.790> that<00:05:33.940> theme<00:05:34.210> and

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
so definitely keeping in that theme and

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.960 
so definitely keeping in that theme and
really<00:05:35.800> important<00:05:36.190> to<00:05:36.250> us<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.400> we<00:05:36.580> made<00:05:36.850> it

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
really important to us that we made it

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.880 
really important to us that we made it
feel<00:05:37.150> like<00:05:37.180> Isaac's<00:05:37.870> rig<00:05:38.110> you<00:05:38.350> know<00:05:38.440> his<00:05:38.620> suit

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
feel like Isaac's rig you know his suit

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.830 
feel like Isaac's rig you know his suit
is<00:05:39.070> being<00:05:39.310> upgraded<00:05:39.490> as<00:05:39.790> well<00:05:39.970> so<00:05:40.300> for<00:05:40.750> example

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
is being upgraded as well so for example

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.780 
is being upgraded as well so for example
his<00:05:41.169> stasis<00:05:41.680> now<00:05:41.830> recharges<00:05:42.400> over<00:05:42.580> time

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
his stasis now recharges over time

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.240 
his stasis now recharges over time
that's<00:05:43.150> a<00:05:43.419> huge<00:05:43.930> improvement<00:05:44.320> you<00:05:44.979> can't

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
that's a huge improvement you can't

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.100 
that's a huge improvement you can't
won't<00:05:45.640> let<00:05:45.880> you<00:05:46.000> nerf<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:46.419> game<00:05:46.600> but<00:05:47.020> you

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
won't let you nerf the game but you

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.300 
won't let you nerf the game but you
don't<00:05:47.169> have<00:05:47.320> to<00:05:47.380> hold<00:05:47.590> on<00:05:47.740> to<00:05:47.860> it<00:05:47.950> like<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.070> miser

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
don't have to hold on to it like a miser

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.620 
don't have to hold on to it like a miser
like<00:05:48.490> a<00:05:48.669> lot<00:05:48.850> of<00:05:48.940> people<00:05:49.120> did<00:05:49.300> you<00:05:49.450> know<00:05:49.540> you

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
like a lot of people did you know you

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.659 
like a lot of people did you know you
can<00:05:49.750> use<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.080> in<00:05:50.140> combat<00:05:50.440> more<00:05:50.590> often<00:05:50.830> TK<00:05:51.490> is

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
can use it in combat more often TK is

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.159 
can use it in combat more often TK is
actually<00:05:52.000> a<00:05:52.060> combat<00:05:52.390> application<00:05:52.960> because

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
actually a combat application because

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.630 
actually a combat application because
you<00:05:53.229> can<00:05:53.350> rip<00:05:53.590> the<00:05:53.710> spikes<00:05:53.950> off<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.310> enemies

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
you can rip the spikes off the enemies

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.280 
you can rip the spikes off the enemies
impale<00:05:55.510> them<00:05:55.630> to<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.810> wall<00:05:55.930> with<00:05:55.990> our<00:05:56.200> new

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
impale them to the wall with our new

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.870 
impale them to the wall with our new
impalement<00:05:56.620> mechanic<00:05:57.130> and<00:05:57.280> then<00:05:57.610> zero

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
impalement mechanic and then zero

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.339 
impalement mechanic and then zero
gravity<00:05:58.180> has<00:05:58.450> been<00:05:58.630> completely<00:05:58.990> overhauled

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
gravity has been completely overhauled

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.700 
gravity has been completely overhauled
so<00:06:00.070> Isaac<00:06:00.700> now<00:06:00.910> has<00:06:01.120> full<00:06:01.360> 360-degree<00:06:02.050> control

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
so Isaac now has full 360-degree control

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.570 
so Isaac now has full 360-degree control
he<00:06:02.979> can

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
he can

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.790 
he can
move<00:06:03.729> around<00:06:04.030> stop<00:06:04.689> boost<00:06:05.259> from<00:06:05.439> here<00:06:05.680> to

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
move around stop boost from here to

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.839 
move around stop boost from here to
there<00:06:06.009> as<00:06:06.340> opposed<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.669> just<00:06:06.699> a

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
there as opposed to just a

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.219 
there as opposed to just a
point-to-point<00:06:07.210> jump<00:06:07.599> like<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:07.870> original

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
point-to-point jump like the original

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.320 
point-to-point jump like the original
game<00:06:08.259> now<00:06:08.889> it<00:06:09.099> changes<00:06:09.129> completely<00:06:09.789> the<00:06:10.300> way

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
game now it changes completely the way

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.390 
game now it changes completely the way
that<00:06:10.509> you<00:06:10.569> navigate<00:06:11.110> and<00:06:11.319> solve<00:06:11.800> puzzles<00:06:12.219> and

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
that you navigate and solve puzzles and

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.670 
that you navigate and solve puzzles and
fight<00:06:12.879> in<00:06:13.060> zero<00:06:13.270> gravity<00:06:13.330> so<00:06:13.810> in<00:06:14.289> addition<00:06:14.500> to

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
fight in zero gravity so in addition to

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.050 
fight in zero gravity so in addition to
the<00:06:14.830> new<00:06:14.949> weapons<00:06:15.340> and<00:06:15.669> obviously<00:06:15.909> the<00:06:16.030> new
