00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
I ain't again from safety one skill just

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.980 
I ain't again from safety one skill just
to<00:00:02.220> em<00:00:02.429> go<00:00:03.149> over<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.360> couple<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:03.600> points<00:00:03.840> again

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
to em go over a couple of points again

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.780 
to em go over a couple of points again
about<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.290> coach<00:00:04.470> first<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.220> all<00:00:05.310> if<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.609> have

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
about the coach first of all if I have

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.430 
about the coach first of all if I have
the<00:00:05.879> car<00:00:06.060> already<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.390> 4th<00:00:06.629> gear<00:00:06.810> our<00:00:06.990> junction

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
the car already in 4th gear our junction

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.650 
the car already in 4th gear our junction
to<00:00:08.309> move<00:00:08.460> off<00:00:08.670> I'm<00:00:08.880> not<00:00:09.030> closing<00:00:09.269> on<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
to move off I'm not closing on the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.120 
to move off I'm not closing on the
clutch<00:00:09.870> or<00:00:10.080> just<00:00:10.290> simply<00:00:10.500> hovering<00:00:10.679> gear<00:00:11.010> to

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
clutch or just simply hovering gear to

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.650 
clutch or just simply hovering gear to
move<00:00:11.280> off<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.700> don't<00:00:11.910> always<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.480> be<00:00:12.570> in

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
move off so I don't always have to be in

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.980 
move off so I don't always have to be in
neutral<00:00:12.840> just<00:00:13.500> use<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.799> mitt<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.870> that's<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
neutral just use the mitt so that's the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.390 
neutral just use the mitt so that's the
first<00:00:16.199> thing<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.470> staying<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> couch

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
first thing that staying on the couch

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.490 
first thing that staying on the couch
the<00:00:17.580> whole<00:00:17.609> time<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.180> gear<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.869> perfectly<00:00:19.260> for

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the whole time in gear is perfectly for

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.550 
the whole time in gear is perfectly for
it<00:00:19.880> if<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:20.939> want<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> move<00:00:21.449> off<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.960> very<00:00:22.260> short

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
it if we want to move off a very short

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.200 
it if we want to move off a very short
distance<00:00:22.740> I'm<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.490> don't<00:00:23.550> release<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.029> clutch

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
distance I'm I don't release the clutch

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.120 
distance I'm I don't release the clutch
for<00:00:24.420> example<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.930> can't<00:00:25.260> dog<00:00:25.439> foot<00:00:25.680> brake<00:00:25.920> we're

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
for example I can't dog foot brake we're

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.410 
for example I can't dog foot brake we're
normally<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.519> don't<00:00:26.670> brake<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.060> clutch<00:00:27.090> down

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
normally you don't brake and clutch down

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.540 
normally you don't brake and clutch down
to<00:00:27.599> stop<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.710> gonna<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.980> walking<00:00:29.369> for

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to stop so it's gonna be walking for

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.970 
to stop so it's gonna be walking for
seconds<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.630> only<00:00:31.320> got<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.500> short<00:00:31.560> distance

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
seconds if I only got a short distance

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.920 
seconds if I only got a short distance
and<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:32.730> think<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.090> put<00:00:33.270> up<00:00:33.390> all<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.809> way

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
and I don't think you put up all the way

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.470 
and I don't think you put up all the way
I<00:00:34.230> don't<00:00:34.649> want<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> stop<00:00:35.040> again<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:36.390> go

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
I don't want to stop again I can go

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.880 
I don't want to stop again I can go
clutch<00:00:36.690> brake<00:00:39.110> because<00:00:40.110> I'm<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.620> slow

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
clutch brake because I'm going so slow

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.410 
clutch brake because I'm going so slow
so<00:00:41.129> when<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.399> gonna<00:00:41.640> open<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.910> car<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> very

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so when I'm gonna open the car in a very

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.779 
so when I'm gonna open the car in a very
short<00:00:42.750> distance<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> very<00:00:43.559> slow<00:00:43.829> speed<00:00:43.890> but

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
short distance or a very slow speed but

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.310 
short distance or a very slow speed but
can<00:00:45.030> use<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> clutch<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.780> control<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> speed

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
can use the clutch to control the speed

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.260 
can use the clutch to control the speed
going<00:00:46.530> forwards<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> also<00:00:47.969> when<00:00:48.180> I'm

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
going forwards and also when I'm

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.619 
going forwards and also when I'm
reversing<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.899> well<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.039> example<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
reversing as well so for example if I

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
reversing as well so for example if I
was<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> turn<00:00:52.350> about<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.640> road<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
was to do a turn about in the road I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.029 
was to do a turn about in the road I
just<00:00:53.910> move<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.570> short<00:00:54.750> distance<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.860> go

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
just move up a short distance but can go

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.830 
just move up a short distance but can go
clutch<00:00:56.309> brake<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.699> over<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.180> boy<00:00:57.420> was<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> go

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
clutch brake so over it boy was to go

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.319 
clutch brake so over it boy was to go
drive<00:00:58.559> from<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.010> into<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> pot<00:00:59.460> with<00:01:00.090> enough

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
drive from here into the pot with enough

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
drive from here into the pot with enough
foot<00:01:00.539> bait<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> stop<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> car<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> don't

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
foot bait to stop the car so I don't

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.240 
foot bait to stop the car so I don't
brake<00:01:02.879> too<00:01:02.910> hard<00:01:03.439> like<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.010> use<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
brake too hard like I have to use the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.429 
brake too hard like I have to use the
clutch<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.670> control<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.060> even<00:01:06.290> reverse<00:01:07.290> as

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
clutch to control it even reverse as

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
clutch to control it even reverse as
well<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.010> example<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.450> bring<00:01:09.540> into

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
well so for example if I just bring into

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.420 
well so for example if I just bring into
coach<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.290> bit<00:01:10.409> see<00:01:10.860> where<00:01:11.010> here

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
coach a little bit see where here

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.219 
coach a little bit see where here
I'm<00:01:11.549> reversing<00:01:11.939> back<00:01:12.210> now<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.659> slowly<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
I'm reversing back now very slowly I

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.300 
I'm reversing back now very slowly I
thought<00:01:13.590> it'd<00:01:13.650> come<00:01:13.740> off<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.130> touch

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
thought it'd come off to touch

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.870 
thought it'd come off to touch
completely<00:01:14.840> I'm<00:01:15.840> gonna<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.170> too<00:01:16.380> fast<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
completely I'm gonna go too fast so the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
completely I'm gonna go too fast so the
car<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.090> without<00:01:18.689> even<00:01:18.840> giving<00:01:18.990> gases<00:01:19.409> on

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
car is without even giving gases on

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.920 
car is without even giving gases on
really<00:01:19.830> fast<00:01:20.040> now<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> stay<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
really fast now so I have to stay on the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.050 
really fast now so I have to stay on the
clutch<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.320> control<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> speed<00:01:22.979> when<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
clutch to control the speed when I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.740 
clutch to control the speed when I
reverse<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> also<00:01:26.820> when<00:01:27.060> you're<00:01:27.210> parking<00:01:27.570> just

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
reverse so also when you're parking just

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.450 
reverse so also when you're parking just
emphasize<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.740> you're<00:01:28.890> maneuvering<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
emphasize when you're maneuvering the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.010 
emphasize when you're maneuvering the
car<00:01:29.610> short<00:01:29.880> distance<00:01:30.180> gonna<00:01:30.329> pack<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> car

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
car short distance gonna pack in the car
