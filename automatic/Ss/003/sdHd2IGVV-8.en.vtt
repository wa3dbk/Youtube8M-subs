00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.410
 If you think Team Fortress 2 is a fun and crazy online shooter with weird hat addiction 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.180
 So Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is his sibling who is again dependent on 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.330
 weapons and competition. 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.730
 "Dude this game doesn't play anything" 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.159
 But you're not here to listen to me talking about the game, you're here because this is a LowSpecsGamer 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:25.380
 Where 2GhZ and 30FPS are large numbers. You wanted it that way. 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.860
 So forget about great graphics and flying details because we'll make this game playable. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.160
 This is the defalute configuration that the game recommended to me from the installation. This is the Source engine 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.810
 game, so we can expect a lot of possibilities to play with 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.050
 but this is a professional online multiplayer game where every slide can move us forward 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.810
 to performance 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.100
 So. Let's take a look at what we are. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.550
 Why do I always get to the Office Map? 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.760
 Sure, let's all work together like that, working together, shoot 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.150
 together on anything that moves 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.409
 So when everyone is around and the bullets are flying we can see around 35 FPS 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.170
 if the action is very close and the personal images go below 30 to 25. 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.860
 Of course ... when I'm alone, the FPS is around 50. But we're trying to make exciting moments 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.170
 better. Otherwise it is very difficult to play effectively 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.730
 Am I the last in my team? 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.210
 Damn ... 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.740
 As in Team Fortress, we can use a few commands to improve performance 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.330
 at these very much needed moments 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.510
 First we have "high". This command switches the process to "High Priority" 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.380
 It's very important because the game is very CPU dependent. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.480
 Then, we have "threads" which can set the minimum number of threads 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.010
 which game uses and must be set as many threads as your CPU has. How many fibers 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.620
 has your CPU found in File Manager. Open it 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.260
 when you press Ctrl + Alt + Delete 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.080
 See this table? You will see one chart for each thread. Some pages 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.630
 they say that the thread number also indicates the number of cores in the CPU but, buddy, Believe It If 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.069
 I'll say I don't have a Quad Core but a pantry one of these strange laptop CPUs it has 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.959
 2 cores but 4 threads due to one magical thing called "hyper threading". Well, I got nothing 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.160
 4 threads, so I can end the command with the number 4. 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:07.940
 Finally, we have the command "nod3d9ex" which will turn off a lot of improvements due to Direct3D 9 API 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.860
 We don't need this. 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.910
 Oh, that's good. I think our new standard is 45 FPS otherwise FPS is falling 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.420
 to 35. You can only feel the change from playing 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.080
 There's that enemy or ... SAKRA. 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.420
 Come on guys. We have a game to play with. 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.670
 Why did you do that? Come on. At least a good chance to test performance. I do not think 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.330
 that Flashbang bit us fps under 30 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.849
 Almost 60 FPS. Great! Wait, there is no enemy Maybe 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.120
 I can bypass it and kill it 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.220
 Wait ... where is he? 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.569
 COME ON. 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.209
 Enough with Flashbangs! This guy sticks into the box. We're all very friends 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.349
 bad in this game not. This time my FPS fell to 27 shots ... SAKRA. 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:15.340
 * Sigh * Well, Time to show the dark last trick. 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.560
 Veterans of this game should know about their own configuration files, but if 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.280
 you may not know about it. All settings are stored in a file 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.560
 and that means you can copy configurations from other players that contain things to improve 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.750
 Performance, Like "preloaded textures" 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.750
 I tried a few config and my favorite is FPS Boost configuration from Game banana 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.900
 I'll leave a link in the label 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.810
 What you need to do is take the configuration and copy it. 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:00.490
 The config we are looking for is in: (x86) / steam / steamapps / common 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.150
 counter strike global offensive / csgo / cfg / config.cfg 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.310
 open this file and copy it over the old new config and save it 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.470
 What's your favorite FPS Boost Config? and where did you get it? Don't forget 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.710
 mention in the comments 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.740
 This makes me faster. More than 45FPS normally? SAKRA ... awwww ..... 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.650
 It's good to go back to Office. I feel like I'm getting a little more pictures than 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.120
 previously. Between 37 and 45 shots. 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.509
 Neflashbangnul the guy? 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.520
 Fast. Take the hostage. Get out of here! 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.560
 SAKRA! ..... Awww balls ... 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.389
 This is all for this video. I hope you can use it. Tahlehra can 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:57.150
 be serious. Before I started playing I looked at the welcome videos there 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.789
 Explained that this game is not for normal playing, but requires studying, testing, and 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.350
 experience only to begin playing. I decided to ignore it and start now. I remember 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.490
 How do I say: Will it be fine, how hard can it be? 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.580
 Wait. I got one of them!
