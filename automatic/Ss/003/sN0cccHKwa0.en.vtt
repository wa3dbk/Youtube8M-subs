00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.240 
activity so if we bring up the next
generation<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.000> children<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.320> sedentary

then<00:00:48.180> they<00:00:48.420> become<00:00:48.690> sedentary<00:00:49.110> adults<00:00:49.680> then

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
then they become sedentary adults then

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.619 
then they become sedentary adults then
that's<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> flow<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.910> into<00:00:51.390> chronic
