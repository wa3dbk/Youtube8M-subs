00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.309
 Canada goes hard on the brakes 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.110
 no place for mistakes otherwise you go 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.420
 in the wall of champions and there are those 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:26.210
 best steaks all season 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.700
 Canada 44 kilometers 70 rounds 305 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.610
 kilometers of distance 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.880
 four straight two slow turns three 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.829
 good overtaking opportunities topspeed 3 123 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.350
 km h 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.690
 we are in Montreal at the formula 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.350
 1 run with you on a round in the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.350
 red bull simulator 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.540
 into the first bridge down in the 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.329
 third gear but the decisive factor is the 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.079
 second turn then makes possible 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.420
 back to the gas sooner 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.050
 now in first of the famous canadas 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.370
 can turn right over much to the curbs 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.320
 but watch out 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.939
 the wall is damned high 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.600
 accelerate fourth fifth gear is 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.600
 it is very tight 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.030
 left right combination 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.009
 comes back at the exit you have the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 wall threatening that comes close 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.520
 important is that in Canada despite 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.890
 the fact that the walls are right there 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.900
 are the distance the foot leaves and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.180
 to really let the author dare 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.080
 he has me he does not have anything i have 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.080
 once the wall kissed 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.310
 to the slowest point of the route to 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.990
 Spitzkehre including in the second course 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.820
 important that you are late on the brake 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.710
 the car quickly rotates around and the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.020
 sooner to the gas because here comes the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.270
 longest just the whole route to 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.270
 highly accelerated to over 320 km h 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.210
 a bit of time to rest but 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.259
 has to focus on the last one 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.180
 chicane, it is important that we 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.619
 do not overdo it otherwise sticks 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.570
 the car on the famous wall of 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.570
 champions that was a round in Canada
