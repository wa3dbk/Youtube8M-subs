 a water produced with a 3d printer 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.230
 was fired successfully by the first 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.420
 In the United States 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.840
 the plastic gun and was produced in the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.060
 in this $ 8,000 printer. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.240
 parts of the soul are projected in the 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.340
 computer and sent to the printer 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.519
 machine then produces each of the parts 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.679
 with layers of plastic from there 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.530
 user has a weapon that can not be 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.590
 monitored by security authorities and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.989
 potentially can not be detected. 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.149
 group that produced the gun the defend says 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.239
 Ubiratan wants the project to be 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.890
 available worldwide on the internet 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.530

 wilson leader of this controversial group of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.420
 texas said that many governments prohibit 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.760
 that ordinary people can guns but this 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.219
 it will not be possible anymore because he believes 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.729
 that technology will enable 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.570
 people have what they want 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.880
 interview with bbc 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.610
 Wilson admits that this technology can 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.010
 be used to hurt others 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.770
 after all they are producing a weapon 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.130
 but for him this is no reason not to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.409
 continue with the project but the agencies 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.470
 the world's security systems are already 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.170
 eye in the water produced with a printer. 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.759
 europol police of the european union is 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.000
 closely following the development 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.810
 and weapon tests to keep in position 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.450
 finally 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 there will be goods victory and work in the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.369
 European police say criminals 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.740
 are still going to have easier access to 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.380
 traditional way without having to 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.840
 but printers will be able to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.030
 popularization of arms among sectors of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.689
 society that did not have access to it 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.479
 as the young printers 3d already 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.210
 were called the future of production 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.130
 but like all new technology the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.130
 benefits come along with the risks
