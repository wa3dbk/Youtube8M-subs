00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.140
 for the ancient Mexica the art of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.840
 governing required an education 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.940
 strict and disciplined to such a degree that 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.480
 they had specialized institutions to 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.529
 the formation of their future rulers 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 the children of the Aztec nobles 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.330
 also known as piti were 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.730
 educated from 6 and up to 15 years 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.039
 in the meat where far from being 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.199
 treated in a privileged manner should 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.000
 sweep to load line participate in 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.960
 public works and in works of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.380
 agriculture in the Mexicas had 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.680
 also this conception that the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.649
 ruling classes if they were going to have that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.559
 responsibility to govern the destinations of 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.160
 society had to be more 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.750
 disciplined more rigid with their 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.010
 education in calmecac they learned the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.379
 statesmanship 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.020
 the military leadership the knowledge 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.750
 religious the reading of the codices and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.159
 of the books of the destinies 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.390
 [Music] 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.539
 there were two educational institutions between 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.579
 the mexicas one was the calmecac that 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.710
 I found also located or was 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.990
 they found these located 'the mecca' 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.179
 inside the sacred precinct and on the other 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.130
 the side of the post carl and that were 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.289
 the schools where the children went 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.110
 from that of the common people of the most 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.930
 same 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.810
 and that they were fundamentally instructed 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.410
 as warriors in these schools that yes 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.930
 they were spread so to speak in 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:43.570
 several of the different neighborhoods that 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:45.690
 they composed the city in education among 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.370
 the mexicas occupies a preponderant place 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.770
 so that the teachers went to the 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.080
 house of children and youth to invite them 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.360
 to be educated according to their social stratum 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.190
 outside in the calmecac can between the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.680
 bosc to the calmecac as high the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.800
 post carl portal and they went young 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.679
 men, mainly women in 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.920
 Mexica society were educated in their 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.170
 home there were certainly teachers in each 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.720
 one of these institutions and there were 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.150
 hierarchies also for example in the the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.970
 post carl and there were teachers who 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.540
 they were directly in charge of training 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.400
 educate to coordinate youth that 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.879
 these were called scouting 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.849
 what does the greater or the ruling mean 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.180
 and there were others that were above 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:41.160
 them the one of the post dish and that were the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.370
 that they had the ability to 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.460
 of imposing punishments on young people with 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.860
 with respect to those who instructed in the 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.920
 calmecac there is not so much information but 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.960
 Of course it is also logical to assume 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.700
 that there was a hierarchy between them 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.160
 [Music] 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.180
 although women were excluded from 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.209
 formal education 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.920
 it is important to emphasize the rigor with the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.019
 who were trained who would be the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.180
 rulers of this empire that came to 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.819
 dominate much of Mesoamerica 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.300
