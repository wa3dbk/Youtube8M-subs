00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.400
 for a cadiz is not right is not well 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.900
 we have to make a decision with him 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.349
 he has decided to leave 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.480
 to a doctor who should be that knows well 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.869
 and he has a lot of confidence in him we have 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.169
 given permission the case is that we need 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.579
 that kadir is one more and more with 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.960
 all the things that happen that never 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.150
 you know the casualties you're going to have and for 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.670
 what cause because here you do not know by 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.129
 what causes then good so let's go 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.019
 see if we recover a player that 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.330
 We're going to need it because we're going to 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.030
 need all in the case of kings 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.670
 he missed the first three 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.160
 but it was normal because he came out in 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.469
 stretcher in the field and its recovery has 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.940
 been important to us and there was 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.969
 trained without any problems 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.329
 therefore it is something positive in the case 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.579
 of Jordi and Molina, as they say 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.950
 comrades you know what has happened and 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.710
 obviously yesterday and I do not train but 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.540
 nothing happens either if they come tomorrow but 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.100
 I want to talk to them because every 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.399
 person takes things in a way 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.320
 then as I do not have more news than 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.289
 you me until I spoke with 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.570
 them and from making decisions of 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.340
 a rival is a veteran in as such has 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.310
 the virtue of knowing how to compete and have 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.710
 trade in important matches is a 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.220
 team that does not lose at home I think that 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.060
 he has only lost one game at home 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.870
 a team that has players with 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.270
 very long experience at first 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.950
 division and you know it's a match 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.790
 important for all that makes him be 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 dangerous then 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.070
 they play in a way that makes them 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 doubly dangerous the fact that the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.259
 people who play up 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.570
 always ready for the attack 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.649
 for the counter and defend with a line 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.229
 of 4 and another of 3 behind them very 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.610
 together therefore they do it very well and 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.829
 that's why they are in the position that they are 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.509
 but it turns out that the betis is in 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.160
 the same position therefore also 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.700
 it will be that we do it well a match 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.959
 Interesting nice and disputed match 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.319
 good in that question I have done 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.700
 twice you told me you consider 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.040
 that the molinón party is the most 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.019
 important you consider that the party 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.340
 del lleida is the most important and you 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.470
 believes that the match against 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.709
 Valladolid is the most important after 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.450
 of the palms we will be 13 and always 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.250
 now will come one that will be more important 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.380
 therefore as it is not the league end 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.450
 as it is not the last as it is not the one 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.640
 gives you the promotion, not like it's just 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.860
 the match that makes you add and that you 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.820
 do as I said before mentally 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.600
 put you in optimal conditions is 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.800
 simply that but it is true 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.090
 which is a game of course 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.640
 important 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.280
 they are not equal they are equal is that 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.650
 us if you look at the table 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.300
 each week varies in two or three 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.400
 positions of the five that we're going to 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.400
 up we have been the fifth 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.470
 we won we put the first ones we went 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.360
 to miranda we put back the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.320
 fifth Girona has got it the 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.420
 sporting loses and falls now wins and rises 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.250
 therefore we are all of the same cut 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.230
 because we are at a point in two points 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.310
 that's nothing because that's a match 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.010
 only good obviously I admit what 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.320
 you say there is no lack of reason to the question 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.900
 yes it is true that this party is 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.540
 resembles more molinón has nothing to 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.200
 see with the last matches we have 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.360
 played out 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.580
 but it is true what you say 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.950
 you have to admit it because if we 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.470
 we want that there is not that sway in the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.300
 table that told your partner 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.629
 we have to try to win three in 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.010
 three 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.590
 good 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.879
 it is clear that the last time I said 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.970
 this did not work out very well because we were going 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.890
 Miranda, I think so, not what we have 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.079
 what to do is to be the betis the betis 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.810
 that we went the other day in the field and 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.670
 everyone knows their work and take it to 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.829
 one hundred percent and with aggressiveness to the ball 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.230
 that is the only way in second division 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.760
 to be protagonists and as we know the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.560
 rival that we have opposite and as 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.659
 we know that it is a good good team and that 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.030
 and that as we neglect we are going to 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.100
 find the hole where 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.530
 let's leave then we have to make a good 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.270
 man match I think it's a good 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.889
 prize for this club is a good prize 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.080
 for the béticos a good prize for 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.289
 sevilla in general that is a city 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.889
 football with two very good teams and 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.880
 that the two hobbies deserve to receive 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.620
 national team 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.840
 sevilla always like that a city 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.610
 hospital for the Spanish team 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.310
 and it's always been talisman not so 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.620
 be benito villamarín not be sanchez 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.699
 pizjuán or the Olympic stadium I think 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.699
 that sevilla turns out the same
