00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:05.890
 does not always contribute to the quality of ownership so some techniques 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.110
 need to be adopted is one of them 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.400
 with the regular water distribution has passages through irrigation 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.350
 is the guarantee that the milk producer has a good step that the same in 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.720
 dry season 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.199
 proper irrigation of small pasture means 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.119
 decrease in 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.119
 the cost and abundant productivity 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.030
 the home irrigation system in this bioterra 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.539
 now 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.639
 the first procedure to speak about doing the environmental survey of a doctor 

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:44.560
 of the area 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.370
 right 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.770
 such as the number of livestock you want 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.040
 irrigation and Basque is an increasingly 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.570
 Livestock farms 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.520
 particularly those which practice intensive production 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.289
 milkmaid 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.110
 and which depend on the constant forage supply 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.770
 the irrigation allows you to have participated a little earlier 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.350
 and asks what you had with the area for example of a hectar you are late 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.649
 putting it all day long with the ipad horse show unit animals the hour it 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:19.930
 would be in 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.320
 cigarette is an agricultural practice is just like any other 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.960
 depends on technical criteria to function properly 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.659
 The technician's follow-up will guarantee the producer a fodder that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.789
 better your productive needs your animals to have an effect 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.050
 by the need to donate 120 millimeters of water per month 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.400
 so that there has to be sized with pumps thought arias was divided into 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.750
 sectors to facilitate this reaction here for example find that the agent 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.510
 can call and everything in five days but this can happen up to seven days 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.770
 but the first step is to look for a new technician to do it doing this 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.050
 kind of work 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.180
 the secret of the irrigation process is to know how to economize 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.920
 it is essential for the producer to know how 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 and when you turn on your ticket to avoid damage the lack of planning 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.730
 with which the activity has a very high cost now wait the hour is to spin semi 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.109
 allows us to have a discomfort 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.150
 fantastic on energy bill 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.129
 Who do you love? 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.959
 the green tariff you have placed a specific standard that acm consed and 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.109
 You will call only from nine o'clock at night at six o'clock then you 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.910
 would have enough reduction in the cost of energy and would also take to the grass 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.930
 during the night virtually without having I will take to the action won 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.189
 prosperous action 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:57.169
 rotational grazing consists of dividing a pasture area into 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.249
 pickets 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:03.389
 the cattle placed each day in a picket and a wire of rectified wire with low 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.949
 voltage prevents the animals from leaving the defined area 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.789
 on reaching the last picket the grass of the first one has already been renewed and the cycle 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:17.299
 we start small again in the 800 meter range 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.309
 square allows 40 Warsaw for one day 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:24.209
 so that it facilitates management because livestock 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.279
 I've gone all out in a way that allows 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:27.930
 iodine 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.170
 have the captain rest well 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.510
 so we work with a rest period and around 30 days 25 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.249
 days of the first page 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.219
 when the producer has a well-planned irrigation project 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:45.409
 and considering all the aspects that involve its implementation the results 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.439
 are positive, irrigation is a final technology that interferes with 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.209
 grass quality 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.449
 and subsequently on milk quality 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:59.379
 may be that the animals and AndrÃ© Bessette who have supported him 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.679
 second well here we always recommend come in after the second 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:04.689
 setback in the afternoon 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.040
 av why the animal has to go bad at night 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.300
 then as can be seen space they are with seven players who is 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.889
 being posted since yesterday 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.509
 he's picking up about 30 centimeters in height and everywhere he 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.949
 the project is morning delays and 60 to 70 centimeters in height 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:27.750
 so the advantage of going to jco is nothing and if you are every day providing 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.889
 forage 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.029
 green and new freescale to your side 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.000
 know the operation of irrigation equipment 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.860
 is a fundamental condition to have quality in the final production 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.410
 the results in the production of milk with passage denied 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.860
 show that it is possible to exploit dairy farming by achieving better 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.980
 productivity indexes and, consequently, greater 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.500
 profitability
