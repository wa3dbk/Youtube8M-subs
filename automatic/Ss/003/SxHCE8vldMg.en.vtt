00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
damage came from a couple years of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.870 
damage came from a couple years of
drought<00:00:28.020> they<00:00:28.260> were<00:00:28.320> stressed<00:00:28.770> also<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.730> had<00:00:29.850> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
drought they were stressed also we had a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.429 
drought they were stressed also we had a
late<00:00:30.090> freeze<00:00:30.390> back<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.840> March<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.260> that's

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.440 
the middle of July right now the reason
I<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> Japanese

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
I do this now is because the Japanese

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.900 
I do this now is because the Japanese
beetles<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.320> begun<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> show<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
beetles have just begun to show up and I

beetles have just begun to show up and I
know<00:00:56.969> they're<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.450> damage<00:00:57.809> anyway

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
know they're going to do damage anyway

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.660 
know they're going to do damage anyway
so<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.039> ahead<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.460> ahead

substantial<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.900> get<00:04:11.079> flowers<00:04:11.470> on<00:04:11.680> again<00:04:12.220> I'll

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
substantial to get flowers on again I'll

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.650 
substantial to get flowers on again I'll
bring<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.640> little<00:04:12.910> bit<00:04:13.000> closer<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:13.540> this

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
bring you a little bit closer to this

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.270 
bring you a little bit closer to this
branch<00:04:13.989> right<00:04:14.079> here<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:14.890> can<00:04:15.010> see<00:04:15.160> what

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
branch right here so you can see what

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.509 
branch right here so you can see what
I'm<00:04:15.340> about<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.670> do<00:04:16.380> on<00:04:17.380> this<00:04:17.709> cane<00:04:17.979> right<00:04:18.160> here

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
I'm about to do on this cane right here

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.099 
I'm about to do on this cane right here
as<00:04:18.700> you<00:04:18.850> can<00:04:18.880> see<00:04:19.000> I've<00:04:19.269> got<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.450> lot<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.750> little

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
as you can see I've got a lot of little

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.599 
as you can see I've got a lot of little
side<00:04:20.350> shoots<00:04:20.680> coming<00:04:21.010> off<00:04:21.100> its<00:04:21.280> not<00:04:21.400> really

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
side shoots coming off its not really

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.820 
side shoots coming off its not really
unlike<00:04:21.940> a<00:04:21.970> climber<00:04:22.330> basically<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.110> these<00:04:23.680> are

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
unlike a climber basically and these are

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.200 
unlike a climber basically and these are
kind<00:04:23.979> of<00:04:24.039> small<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.580> Twiggy<00:04:24.880> there's<00:04:25.060> not

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
kind of small and Twiggy there's not

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.760 
kind of small and Twiggy there's not
much<00:04:25.390> going<00:04:25.570> on<00:04:25.810> so<00:04:26.020> I'm<00:04:26.140> going<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:26.320> M<00:04:26.500> going<00:04:26.710> to

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
much going on so I'm going to M going to

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.770 
much going on so I'm going to M going to
go<00:04:26.860> ahead<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.250> find<00:04:27.460> an<00:04:27.610> eye<00:04:27.789> down<00:04:27.849> here<00:04:28.450> it

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
go ahead and find an eye down here it

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
go ahead and find an eye down here it
doesn't<00:04:28.930> matter<00:04:29.200> if<00:04:29.260> it's<00:04:29.380> inward<00:04:29.650> or<00:04:29.740> outward

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
doesn't matter if it's inward or outward

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800 
doesn't matter if it's inward or outward
facing<00:04:30.220> really<00:04:30.610> at<00:04:30.700> this<00:04:30.820> point<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.570> I'm<00:04:31.660> just

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
facing really at this point and I'm just

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.580 
facing really at this point and I'm just
going<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:31.960> take<00:04:32.289> the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
going to take the

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.530 
going to take the
back<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:34.270> something<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.780> bit<00:04:34.810> more<00:04:35.170> substantial

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
back to something a bit more substantial

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.330 
back to something a bit more substantial
because<00:04:37.540> my<00:04:37.870> new<00:04:38.050> flowers<00:04:38.530> can<00:04:38.740> be<00:04:38.860> born<00:04:39.130> off

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
because my new flowers can be born off

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.550 
because my new flowers can be born off
that<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.880> there'll<00:04:40.600> be<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.690> lot<00:04:40.870> sturdier<00:04:41.230> when

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
that and there'll be a lot sturdier when

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.110 
that and there'll be a lot sturdier when
they<00:04:41.650> actually<00:04:42.070> go<00:04:42.250> even<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:42.760> one<00:04:42.940> and<00:04:43.060> I

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
they actually go even this one and I

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.030 
they actually go even this one and I
might<00:04:43.270> just<00:04:43.450> take<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:43.750> piece<00:04:44.020> out<00:04:44.200> again<00:04:45.010> I

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
might just take that piece out again I

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.440 
might just take that piece out again I
haven't<00:04:45.340> done<00:04:45.400> anything<00:04:45.610> really<00:04:45.820> radical

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
haven't done anything really radical

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.240 
haven't done anything really radical
here<00:04:46.660> but<00:04:46.810> also<00:04:46.960> I've<00:04:47.140> done<00:04:47.320> is<00:04:47.500> just<00:04:47.530> taking

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
here but also I've done is just taking

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.530 
here but also I've done is just taking
them<00:04:48.340> back<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.700> slightly<00:04:49.210> in<00:04:49.360> about<00:04:49.510> a

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
them back to a slightly in about a

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.300 
them back to a slightly in about a
thickness<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.140> pencil<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:51.010> get<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.160> little

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
thickness of a pencil to get a little

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.740 
thickness of a pencil to get a little
more<00:04:51.520> vigor<00:04:51.820> because<00:04:52.150> I<00:04:52.240> know<00:04:52.300> that's<00:04:52.600> going

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
more vigor because I know that's going

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.120 
more vigor because I know that's going
to<00:04:52.810> give<00:04:52.960> me<00:04:53.050> slightly<00:04:53.380> better<00:04:53.500> flowers<00:04:53.980> I'll

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
to give me slightly better flowers I'll

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.980 
to give me slightly better flowers I'll
work<00:04:54.700> my<00:04:54.880> way<00:04:54.910> through<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.330> whole<00:04:55.510> plant<00:04:55.840> and

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
work my way through the whole plant and

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.930 
work my way through the whole plant and
do<00:04:56.140> that<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:56.560> begin<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.190> take<00:04:57.400> this<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.820> take

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
do that and begin to take this and take

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.370 
do that and begin to take this and take
out<00:04:58.120> some<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.420> this<00:04:58.510> small<00:04:58.840> growth<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.290> make

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
out some of this small growth and make

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.140 
out some of this small growth and make
it<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.560> little<00:04:59.680> bit<00:04:59.860> more<00:04:59.980> substantial<00:05:00.220> that

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
it a little bit more substantial that

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.640 
it a little bit more substantial that
should<00:05:01.330> about<00:05:01.420> do<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.750> so<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.050> already<00:05:02.290> begin<00:05:02.530> to

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
should about do it so I already begin to

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.350 
should about do it so I already begin to
clean<00:05:02.860> itself<00:05:03.130> up<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.490> little<00:05:03.700> bit<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.060> book<00:05:04.210> is

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
clean itself up a little bit the book is

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.850 
clean itself up a little bit the book is
the<00:05:04.480> bushes<00:05:04.930> looking<00:05:05.170> a<00:05:05.260> little<00:05:05.350> bit<00:05:05.560> lighter

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
the bushes looking a little bit lighter

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.770 
the bushes looking a little bit lighter
and<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.700> shape<00:05:06.910> is<00:05:07.060> starting<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.420> come<00:05:07.600> back

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
and the shape is starting to come back

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.600 
and the shape is starting to come back
to<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.050> a<00:05:08.110> little<00:05:08.260> bit<00:05:08.470> some<00:05:09.100> of<00:05:09.130> these<00:05:09.310> that

a<00:05:24.820> bush<00:05:25.090> I'm<00:05:25.300> not<00:05:25.450> going<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.660> worry<00:05:25.780> so<00:05:25.930> much

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
a bush I'm not going to worry so much

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.960 
a bush I'm not going to worry so much
about<00:05:26.290> pegging<00:05:26.740> so<00:05:27.310> I'm<00:05:27.460> going<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:27.640> take<00:05:27.820> this

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
about pegging so I'm going to take this

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.240 
about pegging so I'm going to take this
long<00:05:28.270> piece<00:05:28.690> here<00:05:29.170> and<00:05:29.320> then<00:05:29.770> much<00:05:29.890> like<00:05:30.100> we

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
long piece here and then much like we

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.680 
long piece here and then much like we
did<00:05:30.370> in<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.580> pruning<00:05:30.820> video<00:05:31.210> I'm<00:05:31.390> going<00:05:31.480> to<00:05:31.540> go

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
did in the pruning video I'm going to go

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.000 
did in the pruning video I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:31.810> and<00:05:32.080> actually<00:05:32.230> go<00:05:32.470> ahead<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:32.680> bring<00:05:32.890> it

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
ahead and actually go ahead and bring it

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.920 
ahead and actually go ahead and bring it
back<00:05:33.040> pretty<00:05:33.370> good<00:05:33.520> and<00:05:34.330> I've<00:05:34.420> even<00:05:34.510> got<00:05:34.750> one

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
back pretty good and I've even got one

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.420 
back pretty good and I've even got one
here<00:05:35.230> that's<00:05:35.260> shooting<00:05:35.680> across<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.980> middle

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
here that's shooting across the middle

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.040 
here that's shooting across the middle
I'm<00:05:36.490> going<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.670> go<00:05:36.730> ahead<00:05:36.880> and<00:05:37.000> leave<00:05:37.210> that<00:05:37.240> but

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
I'm going to go ahead and leave that but

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.660 
I'm going to go ahead and leave that but
I<00:05:38.110> will<00:05:38.320> go<00:05:38.470> ahead<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:38.710> find<00:05:39.010> an<00:05:39.130> eye<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.490> cut

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
I will go ahead and find an eye and cut

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.910 
I will go ahead and find an eye and cut
it<00:05:39.790> here<00:05:40.090> I<00:05:40.240> might<00:05:40.960> take<00:05:41.170> that<00:05:41.230> out<00:05:41.530> during<00:05:41.830> the

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
it here I might take that out during the

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.010 
it here I might take that out during the
winter<00:05:42.040> next<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.670> when<00:05:42.850> I<00:05:42.880> spoon<00:05:43.240> in<00:05:43.390> spring

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
winter next in when I spoon in spring

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.060 
winter next in when I spoon in spring
but<00:05:44.200> right<00:05:44.320> now<00:05:44.500> I'm<00:05:44.590> not<00:05:44.710> going<00:05:44.830> to<00:05:44.920> worry

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
but right now I'm not going to worry

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.830 
but right now I'm not going to worry
about<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.370> so<00:05:45.880> that's<00:05:46.060> about<00:05:46.180> what<00:05:46.480> I've<00:05:46.630> done

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
about it so that's about what I've done

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.240 
about it so that's about what I've done
I've<00:05:47.050> kind<00:05:47.290> of<00:05:47.350> like<00:05:47.500> just<00:05:47.770> sort<00:05:47.920> of<00:05:47.950> cleaned

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
I've kind of like just sort of cleaned

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.310 
I've kind of like just sort of cleaned
out<00:05:48.400> all<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.610> Deadwood<00:05:49.150> I've<00:05:49.600> taken<00:05:49.960> some<00:05:50.290> of

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
out all the Deadwood I've taken some of

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.110 
out all the Deadwood I've taken some of
these<00:05:50.470> little<00:05:50.800> Twiggy<00:05:51.070> things<00:05:51.430> if<00:05:51.640> I<00:05:51.730> can<00:05:51.880> find

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
these little Twiggy things if I can find

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.430 
these little Twiggy things if I can find
it<00:05:52.270> and<00:05:52.360> get<00:05:52.420> it<00:05:52.540> back<00:05:52.660> to<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:52.930> thickness<00:05:53.260> of<00:05:53.380> a

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
it and get it back to the thickness of a

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.490 
it and get it back to the thickness of a
pencil<00:05:53.620> I've<00:05:53.980> done<00:05:54.190> that<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.810> just<00:05:55.810> take<00:05:56.290> I'll

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
pencil I've done that and just take I'll

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.050 
pencil I've done that and just take I'll
take<00:05:56.800> out<00:05:56.950> some<00:05:57.160> of<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.340> leaves<00:05:57.490> a<00:05:57.670> little<00:05:57.790> bit

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
take out some of the leaves a little bit

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.190 
take out some of the leaves a little bit
I<00:05:58.090> might<00:05:58.360> even<00:05:58.450> use<00:05:58.660> a<00:05:58.690> little<00:05:58.900> bit<00:05:58.960> of<00:05:59.050> lime

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
I might even use a little bit of lime

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.750 
I might even use a little bit of lime
and<00:05:59.380> sulfur<00:05:59.710> spray<00:05:59.950> and<00:06:00.130> kind<00:06:00.250> of<00:06:00.340> clean<00:06:00.520> it<00:06:00.550> up

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
and sulfur spray and kind of clean it up

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.940 
and sulfur spray and kind of clean it up
a<00:06:00.880> little<00:06:01.060> bit<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:02.080> that's<00:06:02.290> all<00:06:02.440> there<00:06:02.620> is<00:06:02.740> to

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
a little bit and that's all there is to

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.860 
a little bit and that's all there is to
it<00:06:03.190> I'm<00:06:03.250> basically<00:06:03.970> finished<00:06:04.300> now<00:06:04.450> I<00:06:04.630> hope

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
it I'm basically finished now I hope

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.150 
it I'm basically finished now I hope
that<00:06:05.080> gives<00:06:05.260> you<00:06:05.350> the<00:06:05.470> confidence<00:06:05.800> to<00:06:05.950> get

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
that gives you the confidence to get

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.950 
that gives you the confidence to get
into<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.520> middle<00:06:06.760> of<00:06:06.880> summer<00:06:07.090> and<00:06:07.330> get<00:06:07.660> tucked

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
into the middle of summer and get tucked

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.360 
into the middle of summer and get tucked
into<00:06:08.140> your<00:06:08.260> bushes<00:06:08.710> and<00:06:08.860> give<00:06:08.950> him<00:06:09.070> a<00:06:09.160> really

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
into your bushes and give him a really

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.850 
into your bushes and give him a really
good<00:06:09.550> trimming<00:06:10.120> up<00:06:10.240> cleaning<00:06:11.050> them<00:06:11.260> up<00:06:11.470> you

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
good trimming up cleaning them up you

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.350 
good trimming up cleaning them up you
don't<00:06:12.040> like<00:06:12.220> pick<00:06:12.460> this<00:06:12.610> time<00:06:12.820> like<00:06:13.000> I<00:06:13.090> said<00:06:13.300> in

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
don't like pick this time like I said in

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.790 
don't like pick this time like I said in
the<00:06:13.420> beginning<00:06:13.540> Japanese<00:06:14.230> beetles<00:06:14.650> are

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
the beginning Japanese beetles are

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.110 
the beginning Japanese beetles are
coming<00:06:15.040> I'm<00:06:15.130> trying<00:06:15.340> to<00:06:15.430> work<00:06:15.610> with<00:06:15.670> nature

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
coming I'm trying to work with nature

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.150 
coming I'm trying to work with nature
instead<00:06:16.390> of<00:06:16.450> against<00:06:16.900> it<00:06:17.050> so<00:06:17.650> what<00:06:17.890> I've<00:06:18.010> done

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
instead of against it so what I've done

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.590 
instead of against it so what I've done
now<00:06:18.220> is<00:06:18.580> just<00:06:18.730> kind<00:06:18.850> of<00:06:19.000> lighten<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:19.330> up<00:06:19.450> you

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
now is just kind of lighten it up you

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.790 
now is just kind of lighten it up you
can<00:06:19.720> see<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.020> shape<00:06:20.290> that<00:06:20.320> we've<00:06:20.590> come<00:06:20.770> up

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
can see the shape that we've come up

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.320 
can see the shape that we've come up
with<00:06:21.100> as<00:06:21.250> compared<00:06:21.610> to<00:06:21.730> where<00:06:21.880> we<00:06:22.000> were<00:06:22.150> when

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
with as compared to where we were when

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.890 
with as compared to where we were when
we<00:06:22.450> started

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
we started

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.170 
we started
I've<00:06:23.320> just<00:06:23.620> basically<00:06:24.040> taken<00:06:24.820> some<00:06:25.030> of<00:06:25.120> these

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
I've just basically taken some of these

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.910 
I've just basically taken some of these
big<00:06:25.420> kings<00:06:25.690> back<00:06:25.990> a<00:06:26.020> little<00:06:26.320> bit<00:06:26.500> I've<00:06:26.710> taken

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 
big kings back a little bit I've taken

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.650 
big kings back a little bit I've taken
these<00:06:27.130> side<00:06:27.400> shoots<00:06:27.730> and<00:06:27.940> clean<00:06:28.120> them<00:06:28.360> up<00:06:28.390> to

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
these side shoots and clean them up to

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.480 
these side shoots and clean them up to
some<00:06:28.870> degree<00:06:29.170> and<00:06:29.380> I<00:06:29.680> started<00:06:30.040> of<00:06:30.100> course<00:06:30.130> by

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
some degree and I started of course by

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.880 
some degree and I started of course by
taking<00:06:30.640> out<00:06:30.940> all<00:06:31.150> of<00:06:31.180> that<00:06:31.630> dead<00:06:31.930> wood<00:06:32.230> now

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890 
taking out all of that dead wood now

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.650 
taking out all of that dead wood now
this<00:06:33.070> is<00:06:33.190> probably<00:06:33.460> more<00:06:33.910> radical<00:06:34.420> than<00:06:34.450> you

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
this is probably more radical than you

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.570 
this is probably more radical than you
might<00:06:34.930> normally<00:06:34.960> do<00:06:35.650> in<00:06:35.800> a<00:06:35.890> season<00:06:36.130> but<00:06:36.430> this

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
might normally do in a season but this

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.790 
might normally do in a season but this
plant<00:06:36.820> was<00:06:36.940> so<00:06:37.210> stressed<00:06:37.690> and<00:06:37.930> once<00:06:38.320> I<00:06:38.440> got<00:06:38.620> all
