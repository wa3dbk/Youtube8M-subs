00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 so I think it is again lateral thinker 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.300
 and as you can see I have that 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.230
 cinema missed a cage again 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.219
 I'm just looking forward to that 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.789
 Baumarkt an 8 mm thick aluminum of the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.000
 Stange brought a meter long so costs 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.680
 not the world a few euros and you 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.400
 All you need is the customs office 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.980
 what to sign a hacksaw and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.300
 a vice and i have the cage 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 within two hours 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.620
 can 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.000
 against form so relatively fix have the form too 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.340
 I met her pretty well 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 also wanted to have 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.800
 that's what the whole thing looks like i'll go 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.660
 a little closer then you can see it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.390
 maybe that's better so here 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.399
 the back so is from these clips 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.309
 The clips hang directly on 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.680
 the damper bridge here the blue parts 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.930
 there are two pieces that are out there 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.780
 also in every size from 6 to 22 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.510
 millimeter diameter 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.960
 and then you can just on it 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.970
 stick 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.680
 that's the way they are here 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.680
 between pieces in the same way 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.090
 mounted around the deep I do not get here 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.650
 I have not drilled any holes 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 and then directly connected but 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.600
 Just the clips that keeps her looks like that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 from piece rod holes drill with 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.250
 provided thread and then simply the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.710
 Screw clips here and then leaves 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.710
 Here you are comfortably in the cage 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.729
 relaxes and stabilizes the whole thing 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.729
 accept 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.399
 So I'm happy because really surprised 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.689
 how easy it all went but I have 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.100
 me out times can I have to say 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.829
 I then so much given me trouble 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.600
 to get that straight as you can see 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.360
 the culture on the left follows 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.009
 exactly the culture on the right 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.009
 it is side 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:17.460
 I've become really nice just like that 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:22.380
 The whole thing looks real from the beginning 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.730
 crass vehicle is really crass show 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.960
 bigger and bigger people i have to be careful 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.420
 that I'm not a spaceship farmer here 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.470
 looks the whole 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.510
 then I have another one 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.540
 something different attachment method for the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.190
 caged because it is logical 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.470
 that every now and then the body 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.570
 you have to lose weight and somehow you have to 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.980
 but if you could do that, 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.540
 then unscrew the cage every time 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.930
 that means two screws in the front 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.430
 Loosen two screws in the back 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.960
 then it can not have been the solution 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.610
 his 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.650
 So I have this in the following way and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.650
 solved as you can see here 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.000
 put on this eight millimeter and 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.410
 profile a tube with 10 mm 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.959
 outside diameter and inside diameter 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.390
 eight that is what exactly here 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.120
 also the cage on it can be so 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.720
 push it on and if you do that 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.720
 pushes all the way back then leaves 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.200
 The cages are normal without further 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.810
 solve problems from the vehicle 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.209
 one-handed is a bit stupid because of it 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.970
 so it comes a bit with it 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.290
 not by itself triggers to say so 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.170
 now I have it all looks like 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.360
 Cage is disconnected and then you can get it 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.190
 quite simply fold up easily 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.780
 and comes to the body's turn 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.110
 So absolutely no effort can be 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:59.840
 completely lose weight when needed 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.840
 is not your whole cage more is not 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:38.390
 yes then as I said just again 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:39.920
 connect again so join the 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.900
 cage protects the engine a bit 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.320
 at the top but mainly 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.730
 I wanted the vehicle here 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.680
 bit stiffening now it is here 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.250
 a completely closed rectangle 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.010
 below the bottom plate top of the cage and 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.530
 in between, just the two at the 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.900
 behave and thus nothing can 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.390
 do not bend anything more use it 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.060
 So it's really pretty stiff 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:09.050
 it should be me completely so completely 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:12.530
 lift up the cage and feel everything 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:19.510
 very solid, that's the whole thing 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.510
 people this is the vehicle 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.700
 but I have to admit it already 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.330
 a bit exaggerated from 12 8 to 1 to 6 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.390
 rebuild 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:46.520
 but somehow I find totally awesome I 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:48.920
 really fits a bit what the 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:55.010
 It's easy 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:57.110
 just bomb so much more I wanted 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.920
 is showing it's actually today 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.760
 just about this cage I think that 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.910
 really well done 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.350
 also fits visually to the vehicle like 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.790
 the protection and as I said the 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.950
 dispute is in any case 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.050
 given and thus I have my goal 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.310
 reached 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.310
 Good then until next time
