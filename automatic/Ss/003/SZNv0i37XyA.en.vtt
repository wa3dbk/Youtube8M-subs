00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.430 

these<00:00:11.809> two<00:00:12.849> pods<00:00:13.849> here<00:00:14.240> and<00:00:14.420> this<00:00:14.750> one<00:00:15.019> here

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
these two pods here and this one here

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.990 
these two pods here and this one here
are<00:00:15.740> going<00:00:16.279> to<00:00:16.430> be<00:00:17.560> carbon<00:00:18.560> rubber<00:00:18.739> and<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:19.489> a

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
are going to be carbon rubber and so a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.089 
are going to be carbon rubber and so a
little<00:00:20.329> more<00:00:20.450> durable<00:00:20.869> in<00:00:21.140> those<00:00:21.349> areas<00:00:21.890> and

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
little more durable in those areas and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.999 
little more durable in those areas and
then<00:00:22.610> they<00:00:22.790> really<00:00:23.180> placed<00:00:23.529> these<00:00:24.529> pod

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
then they really placed these pod

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.010 
then they really placed these pod
systems<00:00:25.640> here<00:00:26.060> through<00:00:26.329> the<00:00:26.450> center<00:00:26.720> a<00:00:26.750> little

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
systems here through the center a little

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.389 
systems here through the center a little
bit<00:00:27.110> differently<00:00:27.470> where<00:00:27.649> they<00:00:27.860> felt<00:00:28.099> like<00:00:28.250> the

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
bit differently where they felt like the

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.609 
bit differently where they felt like the
wear<00:00:28.579> pattern<00:00:29.000> was<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:29.840> try<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.079> really<00:00:30.410> give

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
wear pattern was to try to really give

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.860 
wear pattern was to try to really give
us<00:00:30.739> some<00:00:30.890> dirt<00:00:31.040> building<00:00:31.460> guys<00:00:32.210> Devon's<00:00:32.660> back

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
think three pairs of the Camorra tues

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.720 
think three pairs of the Camorra tues
absolutely<00:00:52.999> love<00:00:53.179> them<00:00:54.370> had<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.399> hard<00:00:55.670> time

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
absolutely love them had a hard time

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.610 
absolutely love them had a hard time
getting<00:00:56.179> away<00:00:56.329> from<00:00:56.390> anything<00:00:56.809> into<00:00:57.589> anything

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
getting away from anything into anything

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.149 
getting away from anything into anything
else<00:00:58.719> so<00:00:59.719> obviously<00:01:00.469> when<00:01:00.649> I<00:01:00.679> heard<00:01:00.890> that<00:01:01.010> the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
else so obviously when I heard that the

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.220 
else so obviously when I heard that the
conveyor<00:01:01.399> three<00:01:01.609> was<00:01:01.760> coming<00:01:01.969> out<00:01:02.059> timing<00:01:02.960> was

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
conveyor three was coming out timing was

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.720 
conveyor three was coming out timing was
perfect<00:01:03.260> I<00:01:03.829> actually<00:01:03.980> needed<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.430> replacement

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
perfect I actually needed a replacement

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.940 
perfect I actually needed a replacement
pair<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.050> came<00:01:06.290> in<00:01:06.439> gravities<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:08.420> far

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
pair so I came in gravities and so far

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.639 
pair so I came in gravities and so far
I'm<00:01:09.950> extremely<00:01:10.930> extremely<00:01:11.930> happy<00:01:12.290> with<00:01:12.320> just

I'm extremely extremely happy with just
the<00:01:12.860> small<00:01:13.100> changes<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.549> they<00:01:13.670> made<00:01:14.030> the

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
the small changes that they made the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.770 
the small changes that they made the
first<00:01:15.259> thing<00:01:15.470> being<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:16.420> upper<00:01:17.420> I<00:01:17.540> mean<00:01:17.719> it

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
first thing being the upper I mean it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.170 
first thing being the upper I mean it
still<00:01:18.020> aerated<00:01:18.500> out<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:18.890> can<00:01:19.040> see<00:01:19.340> here<00:01:20.000> if<00:01:20.090> I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
still aerated out you can see here if I

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.399 
still aerated out you can see here if I
put<00:01:20.360> my<00:01:20.390> fingers<00:01:20.810> here<00:01:20.930> kind<00:01:21.110> of<00:01:21.170> gives<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:21.350> a

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
put my fingers here kind of gives you a

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:22.840 
put my fingers here kind of gives you a
better<00:01:21.590> idea<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.070> they<00:01:22.159> still<00:01:22.310> have<00:01:22.399> a<00:01:22.460> mesh<00:01:22.670> in

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
better idea so they still have a mesh in

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.050 
better idea so they still have a mesh in
there<00:01:23.060> yeah<00:01:23.509> this<00:01:23.810> just<00:01:24.049> shreds<00:01:24.530> okay<00:01:25.130> um<00:01:25.369> and

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
there yeah this just shreds okay um and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.810 
there yeah this just shreds okay um and
this<00:01:26.479> has<00:01:26.659> got<00:01:26.840> some<00:01:27.049> overlays<00:01:27.590> yep<00:01:28.159> yep<00:01:28.610> yep

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
this has got some overlays yep yep yep

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.330 
this has got some overlays yep yep yep
sure<00:01:29.689> okay<00:01:30.140> in<00:01:30.380> terms<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:31.479> feel<00:01:32.740> feels<00:01:33.740> very

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
sure okay in terms of feel feels very

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.160 
sure okay in terms of feel feels very
similar<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.210> Kimura<00:01:35.539> too<00:01:35.780> which<00:01:35.930> is<00:01:35.960> nice

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
similar to the Kimura too which is nice

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.100 
similar to the Kimura too which is nice
so<00:01:36.229> it's<00:01:36.469> very<00:01:36.590> very<00:01:36.710> familiar<00:01:37.840> formula<00:01:38.840> meter

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
so it's very very familiar formula meter

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.819 
so it's very very familiar formula meter
drop<00:01:39.369> so<00:01:40.369> for<00:01:40.700> those<00:01:41.289> for<00:01:42.289> those<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.560> you<00:01:42.680> that

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
are looking for more of a minimal shoe

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.469 
are looking for more of a minimal shoe
which<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:44.780> love<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:45.859> run<00:01:46.070> in<00:01:46.219> white<00:01:46.490> stuff<00:01:46.820> if<00:01:47.329> I

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
which I love to run in white stuff if I

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.240 
which I love to run in white stuff if I
remember<00:01:47.509> correctly<00:01:47.780> ounces<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:49.039> is

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
remember correctly ounces of this is

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.039 
remember correctly ounces of this is
still<00:01:49.520> pretty<00:01:49.640> similar<00:01:50.119> I<00:01:50.270> think<00:01:50.570> it's<00:01:50.689> it's

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
still pretty similar I think it's it's

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.260 
still pretty similar I think it's it's
right<00:01:51.320> around<00:01:51.439> eight<00:01:51.799> ish<00:01:52.579> don't<00:01:53.060> hold<00:01:53.149> me<00:01:53.240> to

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
right around eight ish don't hold me to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.609 
right around eight ish don't hold me to

graphic this
it<00:01:56.109> is<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.549> actually<00:01:58.090> just<00:01:58.299> kind<00:01:58.509> of

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
it is and it actually just kind of

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:59.849 
it is and it actually just kind of
really<00:01:58.719> stunk<00:01:58.960> surround<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.289> heel<00:01:59.469> which<00:01:59.679> is

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
really stunk surround the heel which is

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.169 
really stunk surround the heel which is
you<00:02:00.219> know<00:02:00.250> when<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:00.520> put<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.789> on<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.060> don't

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
you know when you put it on you don't

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.730 
you know when you put it on you don't
it's<00:02:01.570> not<00:02:01.689> something<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.140> think<00:02:02.229> about<00:02:02.350> it

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
it's not something to think about it

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.230 
it's not something to think about it
it's<00:02:03.219> really<00:02:03.429> nice<00:02:03.609> because<00:02:03.759> it's<00:02:03.939> not<00:02:04.030> too

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
and snug I would say that the fit for

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.140 
and snug I would say that the fit for
these<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.069> terms<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.489> first<00:02:15.700> impression

terms of exercise let's geek out a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.690 
terms of exercise let's geek out a
little<00:02:22.750> bit<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.110> we<00:02:23.230> got<00:02:23.379> a<00:02:23.519> decoupled<00:02:24.519> heel

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
little bit so we got a decoupled heel

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.140 
little bit so we got a decoupled heel
here<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:26.349> new<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.920> borrow<00:02:27.099> three<00:02:27.459> instead

here in the new can borrow three instead

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.970 
here in the new can borrow three instead
of<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.450> one<00:02:28.690> piece<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.170> wraps<00:02:29.410> what

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
of this one piece that wraps what

of this one piece that wraps what
they're<00:02:30.130> doing<00:02:30.340> with<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.760> giving<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.150> an

even smoother he'll toe transition we do
not<00:02:33.849> necessarily<00:02:34.329> want<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.690> running<00:02:34.870> on<00:02:35.079> your

not necessarily want you running on your
heels<00:02:35.290> all<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.650> time<00:02:35.799> but<00:02:36.130> sometimes<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:37.030> get

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
heels all the time but sometimes you get

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.270 
heels all the time but sometimes you get
tired<00:02:37.420> that's<00:02:37.959> going<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.230> smooth<00:02:38.500> out<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.980> get

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
tired that's going to smooth out and get

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.240 
tired that's going to smooth out and get
you<00:02:39.400> rolling<00:02:39.610> quickly<00:02:40.329> to<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.629> front<00:02:40.870> end

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
you rolling quickly to the front end

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.800 
you rolling quickly to the front end
they<00:02:42.250> they<00:02:42.700> call<00:02:42.970> these<00:02:44.519> outer<00:02:45.519> sole<00:02:46.090> pods<00:02:46.420> and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
they they call these outer sole pods and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.059 
they they call these outer sole pods and
the<00:02:47.410> outer<00:02:47.590> sole<00:02:48.010> pods<00:02:48.280> here<00:02:48.549> are<00:02:48.760> bigger<00:02:50.069> here

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
the outer sole pods here are bigger here

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.229 
the outer sole pods here are bigger here
than<00:02:51.250> they<00:02:52.060> were<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:53.829> two<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.090> what

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
than they were on the two and so what

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.520 
than they were on the two and so what
they're<00:02:55.360> trying<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.599> give<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.500> know

they're trying to give you is you know
it's<00:02:56.799> more<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.310> platform<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.329> what<00:02:58.510> they're

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
it's more of a platform so what they're

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.420 
it's more of a platform so what they're
trying<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.930> give<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.590> as<00:02:59.709> more<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.190> fill<00:03:00.400> in

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
trying to give you as more of a fill in

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.789 
trying to give you as more of a fill in
the<00:03:00.670> forefoot<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:01.690> Devon's<00:03:02.230> saying<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.680> know

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
the forefoot but Devon's saying you know

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.770 
the forefoot but Devon's saying you know
when<00:03:03.010> he's<00:03:03.190> transitioning<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.180> mean<00:03:04.600> it's<00:03:04.750> a

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
when he's transitioning I mean it's a

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.500 
when he's transitioning I mean it's a
fast<00:03:05.019> transition<00:03:05.260> yeah<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.700> one<00:03:07.269> thing

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
fast transition yeah the the one thing

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.330 
fast transition yeah the the one thing
that<00:03:07.540> I<00:03:07.750> forgot<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.170> mention<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:09.069> toe

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
that I forgot to mention is the the toe

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.770 
that I forgot to mention is the the toe
off<00:03:09.579> in<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.840> comparison<00:03:11.620> feels<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.400> lot

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
off in this in comparison feels a lot

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.750 
off in this in comparison feels a lot
smoother<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:13.989> quicker<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.980> definitely<00:03:15.489> think

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
smoother and quicker I definitely think

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.720 
smoother and quicker I definitely think
it<00:03:15.940> had<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.389> has<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.780> do<00:03:16.930> with<00:03:17.139> the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
it had that has to do with the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.710 
it had that has to do with the
re-engineering<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:18.940> forefoot<00:03:19.329> for<00:03:19.569> sure

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
re-engineering of the forefoot for sure

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.839 
re-engineering of the forefoot for sure
so<00:03:20.380> there's<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.739> definitely<00:03:21.099> updates<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.700> it

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
so there's that definitely updates to it

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.699 
so there's that definitely updates to it
but<00:03:22.030> nothing<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.959> would<00:03:23.079> say<00:03:23.260> do<00:03:23.500> they

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
but nothing that you would say do they

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.009 
but nothing that you would say do they
just<00:03:23.920> ruined<00:03:24.099> it<00:03:24.370> no<00:03:24.760> no<00:03:25.359> you<00:03:25.389> like<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:25.930> if

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
just ruined it no no you like and if

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.319 
just ruined it no no you like and if
anything<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:26.859> think<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.250> it's<00:03:27.400> if<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.239> was

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
anything I think that it's if it was

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.539 
anything I think that it's if it was
possible<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.780> improve<00:03:29.079> it<00:03:29.319> yeah<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.889> think<00:03:30.040> just

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
possible to improve it yeah I think just

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.129 
possible to improve it yeah I think just
based<00:03:30.730> on<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> first<00:03:31.180> couple<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.660> impressions

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
based on the first couple of impressions

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.329 
based on the first couple of impressions
here<00:03:32.319> oh<00:03:32.349> yeah<00:03:32.829> cool<00:03:33.700> it's<00:03:33.970> gonna<00:03:34.060> be<00:03:34.180> better
