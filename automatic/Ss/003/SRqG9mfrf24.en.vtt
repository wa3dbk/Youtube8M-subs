a new age will come and purify all the
hates<00:02:46.830> evil<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.880> conflict<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.350> seems

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
hates evil and conflict but it seems

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.460 
hates evil and conflict but it seems
that<00:02:49.830> no<00:02:50.250> matter<00:02:50.280> how<00:02:50.520> many<00:02:50.820> times<00:02:51.210> he<00:02:51.660> watches

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
that no matter how many times he watches

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.590 
that no matter how many times he watches
and<00:02:52.710> hopes<00:02:52.980> for<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.550> happen<00:02:53.700> people<00:02:54.240> make

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
and hopes for that to happen people make

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.120 
and hopes for that to happen people make
the<00:02:54.750> same<00:02:54.960> mistakes<00:02:55.320> over<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.680> over<00:02:55.890> again

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
the same mistakes over and over again

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.120 
the same mistakes over and over again
and<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.820> guess<00:02:57.030> after<00:02:57.420> seven<00:02:58.350> years<00:02:58.380> yeah<00:02:58.830> this

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
and I guess after seven years yeah this

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.070 
and I guess after seven years yeah this
is<00:02:59.280> what<00:02:59.490> he<00:02:59.640> did<00:02:59.790> for<00:03:00.120> seven<00:03:00.510> years<00:03:00.690> just

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
is what he did for seven years just

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.740 
is what he did for seven years just
thinking<00:03:02.010> about<00:03:02.220> what<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:02.820> going<00:03:03.150> on<00:03:03.270> even

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
thinking about what is going on even

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.240 
thinking about what is going on even
watching<00:03:04.290> what<00:03:04.470> happened<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> grand

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
witnessed he came to the conclusion he

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.900 
witnessed he came to the conclusion he
is<00:03:09.690> going<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.110> reject<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> world<00:03:10.920> if<00:03:11.370> the
