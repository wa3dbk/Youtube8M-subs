okay<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.620> gonna<00:00:01.709> do<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.340> bones<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:03.060> the

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
okay so we're gonna do the bones of the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.210 
okay so we're gonna do the bones of the
skull<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.870> I'm<00:00:04.529> going<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.770> do<00:00:04.859> them<00:00:05.040> in

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
skull and I'm going to do them in

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.070 
skull and I'm going to do them in
alphabetical<00:00:05.490> order<00:00:05.940> just<00:00:06.330> like<00:00:06.480> they<00:00:06.660> are<00:00:06.779> on

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
alphabetical order just like they are on

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.140 
alphabetical order just like they are on
your<00:00:07.230> wish<00:00:07.379> list<00:00:07.410> so<00:00:08.220> we<00:00:08.400> start<00:00:08.670> with<00:00:08.790> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
your wish list so we start with the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.600 
your wish list so we start with the
ethmoid<00:00:09.330> bone<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.710> ethmoid<00:00:10.860> bone<00:00:11.190> in

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
ethmoid bone and the ethmoid bone in

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.690 
ethmoid bone and the ethmoid bone in
these<00:00:11.730> skulls<00:00:12.030> when<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.660> concentrate<00:00:13.700> mostly

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
these skulls when I concentrate mostly

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.779 
these skulls when I concentrate mostly
on<00:00:15.830> introducing<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> bones<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
on introducing you to the bones with a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.939 
on introducing you to the bones with a
coach<00:00:18.000> skull<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.869> then<00:00:19.109> we'll<00:00:19.289> shift<00:00:19.529> over<00:00:19.770> to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
coach skull and then we'll shift over to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.000 
coach skull and then we'll shift over to
the<00:00:19.980> white<00:00:20.220> skull<00:00:21.500> because<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.740> colored

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
the white skull because the colored

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.279 
the white skull because the colored
skulls<00:00:23.250> are<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.760> easy<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.420> them<00:00:24.600> so

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
skulls are really easy to see them so

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.250 
skulls are really easy to see them so
the<00:00:25.710> ethmoid<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.849> yellow<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the ethmoid is yellow and we can see the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.140 
the ethmoid is yellow and we can see the
yellow<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> part<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
yellow here this is a part of the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.429 
yellow here this is a part of the
ethmoid<00:00:30.240> they're<00:00:30.689> actually<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.109> couple<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
ethmoid they're actually a couple of

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.780 
ethmoid they're actually a couple of
features<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.160> we'll<00:00:32.279> talk<00:00:32.460> about<00:00:32.759> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
features of it that we'll talk about a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.430 
features of it that we'll talk about a
little<00:00:33.059> while<00:00:33.210> we're<00:00:33.809> not<00:00:33.870> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.260> your

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
little while we're not going to get your

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
little while we're not going to get your
landmarks<00:00:34.980> right<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.120> could<00:00:36.270> also

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
landmarks right now and we could also

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.119 
landmarks right now and we could also
see<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> ethmoid<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.559> look<00:00:37.739> into<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
see the ethmoid if we look into the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.150 
see the ethmoid if we look into the
orbit<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> eye<00:00:38.690> right<00:00:39.690> there<00:00:39.980> okay<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
orbit of the eye right there okay and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
orbit of the eye right there okay and
then<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> ethmoid<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.899> more

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
then we can see the ethmoid one more

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.049 
then we can see the ethmoid one more
place<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.789> look<00:00:44.969> into<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.570> nasal

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
place and as if we look into the nasal

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.490 
place and as if we look into the nasal
cavity<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> ethmoid<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.289> sort

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
cavity so we can see the ethmoid it sort

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.340 
cavity so we can see the ethmoid it sort
of<00:00:49.559> makes<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.100> roof<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.750> nasal

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
of makes up the roof of the nasal

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.590 
of makes up the roof of the nasal
chamber<00:00:52.940> next<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.360> see<00:00:54.480> is

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
chamber next one we're going to see is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.619 
chamber next one we're going to see is
frontal<00:00:55.079> oh<00:00:55.640> I'll<00:00:56.640> show<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> ethmoid<00:00:57.270> on

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
frontal oh I'll show you the ethmoid on

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
frontal oh I'll show you the ethmoid on
the<00:00:57.690> white<00:00:57.840> bone<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.280> white<00:00:59.399> skull<00:00:59.699> will

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the white bone so the white skull will

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.220 
the white bone so the white skull will
be<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.359> will<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> lab

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
be the one that will be on the lab

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.830 
be the one that will be on the lab
practical<00:01:01.859> here's<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> ethmoid<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:03.149> again

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
practical here's the ethmoid here again

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.929 
practical here's the ethmoid here again
there<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.110> several<00:01:04.470> features<00:01:04.979> there<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.519> think

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
there are several features there I think

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.160 
there are several features there I think
you're<00:01:06.090> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.420> hard<00:01:06.630> time<00:01:06.869> seeing

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you're going to have a hard time seeing

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620 
you're going to have a hard time seeing
the<00:01:07.380> ethmoid<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> orbit<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the ethmoid in the orbit but it's a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.140 
the ethmoid in the orbit but it's a
medial<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> posterior<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.400> bit<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.970> see

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
medial and posterior a little bit to see

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.870 
medial and posterior a little bit to see
flloyd<00:01:12.420> right<00:01:12.689> there<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> nasal

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
flloyd right there and then in the nasal

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
flloyd right there and then in the nasal
cavity<00:01:15.570> we're<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.470> are

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
cavity we're going to see that there are

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.520 
cavity we're going to see that there are
several<00:01:16.830> landmarks<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.640> we're<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
several landmarks that we're going to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.170 
several landmarks that we're going to
make<00:01:19.530> note<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.250> again<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> makes<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
make note of and again it makes up the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
make note of and again it makes up the
roof<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.930> can't<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.590> where<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
roof but you can't really see where it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.120 
roof but you can't really see where it
ends<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> other<00:01:23.670> bones<00:01:23.880> begin<00:01:24.740> okay<00:01:25.740> next

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
ends and the other bones begin okay next

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.210 
ends and the other bones begin okay next
is<00:01:26.340> frontal<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.600> frontal<00:01:27.930> bone<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.860> sort

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
is frontal and the frontal bone is sort

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.499 
is frontal and the frontal bone is sort
of<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.400> peach<00:01:29.640> color<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> skull<00:01:31.140> okay<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
of a peach color in the skull okay so

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.749 
of a peach color in the skull okay so
the<00:01:33.509> frontal<00:01:33.900> bone<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.200> unusual<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.549> couple

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the frontal bone is unusual and a couple

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.480 
the frontal bone is unusual and a couple
of<00:01:35.880> regards<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> starts<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
of regards one is that it starts out and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.300 
of regards one is that it starts out and
babies<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.210> two<00:01:39.509> bones<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.290> ends<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:40.950> as

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
babies as two bones and it ends up or as

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.210 
babies as two bones and it ends up or as
one<00:01:41.909> when<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> sutures<00:01:42.960> close<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.860> looks<00:01:44.070> like

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
one when the sutures close it looks like

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.690 
one when the sutures close it looks like
it's<00:01:44.430> only<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:45.320> this<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> makes<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.369> part<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it's only one this is it makes a part of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.060 
it's only one this is it makes a part of
the<00:01:47.790> cranium<00:01:48.210> also<00:01:48.960> makes<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.710> part<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.009> your

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the cranium also makes up part of your

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.310 
the cranium also makes up part of your
forehead<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> orbit<00:01:52.290> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
forehead you can see it in the orbit of

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
orbit of the eye and then if I open up

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.630 
orbit of the eye and then if I open up
the<00:01:58.979> cranium<00:01:59.490> you<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:01.469> makes<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.130> part

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the cranium you can see it makes a part

suture separates the frontal from the
two<00:02:21.850> parietal<00:02:22.060> bones<00:02:22.600> what<00:02:23.560> makes<00:02:23.770> up<00:02:23.920> your

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
two parietal bones what makes up your

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.660 
two parietal bones what makes up your
forehead<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.350> roof<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.070> orbit<00:02:27.430> up

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
forehead it is the roof of the orbit up

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.020 
forehead it is the roof of the orbit up
in<00:02:27.910> here<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.300> each<00:02:28.450> side<00:02:28.709> okay<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.830> then<00:02:30.580> if<00:02:30.910> we

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
in here on each side okay and then if we

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.470 
in here on each side okay and then if we
take<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.480> top<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.470> skull<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:33.489> can<00:02:34.090> see

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
take the top of the skull you can see

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.390 
take the top of the skull you can see
the<00:02:34.660> frontal<00:02:35.080> bone<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.950> can<00:02:35.980> see<00:02:36.250> that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the frontal bone you can see that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.890 
the frontal bone you can see that
there's<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.640> crack<00:02:37.060> running<00:02:37.360> right<00:02:37.660> across

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
there's a crack running right across

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.830 
there's a crack running right across
here<00:02:38.230> that's<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> suture<00:02:39.120> okay<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.180> all<00:02:40.660> this

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
here that's the suture okay so all this

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.990 
here that's the suture okay so all this
is<00:02:41.020> frontal<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.920> all<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.370> frontal<00:02:42.760> over

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
is frontal and all this is frontal over

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.870 
is frontal and all this is frontal over
here<00:02:43.739> next<00:02:44.739> poem<00:02:44.920> we're<00:02:45.100> going<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.280> look<00:02:45.459> at<00:02:45.610> is

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
here next poem we're going to look at is

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.949 
here next poem we're going to look at is
incus<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.380> incus<00:02:47.709> is<00:02:47.980> one<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:51.959> there

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
incus so the incus is one of the there

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.550 
incus so the incus is one of the there
we<00:02:53.080> go<00:02:53.200> one<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.810> middle<00:02:55.810> ear<00:02:55.900> bones<00:02:56.019> and

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
we go one of the middle ear bones and

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.600 
we go one of the middle ear bones and
incus<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.930> same<00:02:59.140> thing<00:02:59.410> as<00:02:59.620> what<00:03:00.070> we<00:03:00.580> used

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
incus is the same thing as what we used

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.870 
incus is the same thing as what we used
to<00:03:00.910> call<00:03:01.120> anvil<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:03.519> something<00:03:03.790> you've

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
to call anvil and so something you've

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.880 
to call anvil and so something you've
probably<00:03:03.910> never<00:03:04.300> seen<00:03:04.450> an<00:03:04.750> anvil<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.769> an

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
probably never seen an anvil but an

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.550 
probably never seen an anvil but an
anvil<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.459> what<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.970> wily<00:03:07.390> coyote<00:03:07.840> usually

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
anvil is what the wily coyote usually

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.400 
anvil is what the wily coyote usually
tries<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:08.950> throw<00:03:09.190> on<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.489> roadrunner<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.410> it

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
tries to throw on the roadrunner and it

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.960 
tries to throw on the roadrunner and it
was<00:03:11.560> used<00:03:11.739> by<00:03:11.890> blacksmiths<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.730> shape

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
was used by blacksmiths to shape

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.340 
was used by blacksmiths to shape
horseshoes<00:03:13.739> okay<00:03:14.739> next<00:03:15.220> bone<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.900> going<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.230> be

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
horseshoes okay next bone is going to be

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.830 
horseshoes okay next bone is going to be
the<00:03:17.769> inferior<00:03:18.400> nasal<00:03:18.579> Concha<00:03:19.000> by<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.630> way

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
will be tagged on lab practicals so we

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.720 
will be tagged on lab practicals so we
see<00:03:48.940> this<00:03:49.120> sort<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.980> shelf-like<00:03:50.980> projection

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
see this sort of shelf-like projection

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
coming off a nasal wall on lateral side

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.620 
coming off a nasal wall on lateral side
and<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.280> inferior<00:03:57.640> nasal<00:03:58.209> Concha

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
and that is the inferior nasal Concha

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.930 
and that is the inferior nasal Concha
it's<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:59.019> separable<00:03:59.380> bone<00:03:59.709> it's<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.430> only<00:04:00.579> one

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
it's a separable bone it's the only one

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.520 
it's a separable bone it's the only one
of<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.239> Concha<00:04:01.660> that<00:04:01.870> is<00:04:02.049> actually<00:04:02.470> a

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
of the Concha that is actually a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.310 
of the Concha that is actually a
separate<00:04:02.890> bone<00:04:03.329> then<00:04:04.329> we<00:04:04.450> have<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.840> lacrimal

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
separate bone then we have the lacrimal

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.400 
separate bone then we have the lacrimal
bone<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.130> lacrimal<00:04:06.549> bone<00:04:06.640> is<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:08.079> the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
bone and the lacrimal bone is in the

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.210 
bone and the lacrimal bone is in the
medial<00:04:09.690> portion<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.290> orbit<00:04:11.680> anteriorly

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
medial portion of the orbit anteriorly

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.339 
medial portion of the orbit anteriorly
here<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:12.850> a<00:04:13.299> lack<00:04:13.480> role<00:04:13.660> bone<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:14.110> going<00:04:14.290> to

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
here and a lack role bone is going to

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:15.950 
here and a lack role bone is going to
have<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.470> canal<00:04:14.800> through<00:04:15.099> it<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.400> lacrimal

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
have a canal through it the lacrimal

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.540 
have a canal through it the lacrimal
canal<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:17.280> conducts<00:04:17.850> tears<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:19.650> it

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.550 
canal and it conducts tears so it

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.250 
canal and it conducts tears so it
actually<00:04:20.820> makes<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.270> connection<00:04:21.600> between<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
actually makes a connection between the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.170 
actually makes a connection between the
orbit<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.860> nasal<00:04:23.310> chamber

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
orbit and nasal chamber

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.470 
orbit and nasal chamber
I<00:04:24.210> can<00:04:24.600> show<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.020> lacrimal<00:04:25.560> bone<00:04:26.480> here

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
I can show you the lacrimal bone here

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.150 
I can show you the lacrimal bone here
it's<00:04:27.600> kind<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.930> hard<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.200> see<00:04:28.440> where<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.770> ends

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
it's kind of hard to see where it ends

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.190 
it's kind of hard to see where it ends
and<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.370> other<00:04:29.520> bones<00:04:29.760> begin<00:04:30.150> but<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.020> is

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
and the other bones begin but this is

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.290 
and the other bones begin but this is
the<00:04:31.350> area<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.860> lacrimal<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.610> then<00:04:33.150> you

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
the area of the lacrimal and then you

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.910 
the area of the lacrimal and then you
can<00:04:33.450> see<00:04:33.690> that<00:04:33.870> canal<00:04:34.200> down<00:04:34.410> in<00:04:34.620> there<00:04:34.740> we'll

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
can see that canal down in there we'll

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.150 
can see that canal down in there we'll
get<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.400> foramen<00:04:35.820> on<00:04:36.060> another<00:04:37.070> then<00:04:38.070> we

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
get to the foramen on another then we

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.080 
get to the foramen on another then we
have<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.550> malleus<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.780> malleus<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:41.090> going

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
have the malleus so the malleus is going

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.660 
have the malleus so the malleus is going
to<00:04:42.150> be<00:04:42.270> one<00:04:42.480> of<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.830> ear<00:04:43.830> bones<00:04:44.070> again

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
to be one of the ear bones again

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.700 
to be one of the ear bones again
