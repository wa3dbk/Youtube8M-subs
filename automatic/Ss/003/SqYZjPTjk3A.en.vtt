00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.740
 Like others who have done have 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.090
 few materials and it's not very difficult to 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.580
 do first for the base of the feet 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:23.720
 we would need oak wood that 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.019

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.179

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.980
 behind it is blue the row of the next 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.949
 and here they will put the white flat 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.629
 on top of the two white ones another two for 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.570
 to the top and then from 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.989
 putting blocks 17 blocks up until 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.780

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.719
 we removed one bone we removed one of the 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:06.420
