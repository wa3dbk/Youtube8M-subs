okay<00:00:02.010> so<00:00:02.070> now<00:00:02.250> we<00:00:02.310> have<00:00:02.399> an<00:00:02.580> entire<00:00:02.790> sonar

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
okay so now we have an entire sonar

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.120 
okay so now we have an entire sonar
project<00:00:03.780> loaded<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.170> has<00:00:04.290> audio<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.980> MIDI

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
project loaded that has audio and MIDI

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.519 
project loaded that has audio and MIDI
and<00:00:05.250> everything<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:05.730> it<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.379> we're<00:00:07.379> using

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
and everything in it and we're using

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.780 
and everything in it and we're using
some<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.890> track<00:00:08.099> templates<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.610> are

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
some of the track templates that are

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.970 
some of the track templates that are
included<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:09.330> sonar<00:00:09.630> as<00:00:09.780> well<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.559> what<00:00:10.950> I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
included with sonar as well and what I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.379 
included with sonar as well and what I
want<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.219> do<00:00:11.340> now<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.519> actually<00:00:11.940> just<00:00:12.179> talk

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
want to do now is actually just talk

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
with sonar smoother and easier just

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.050 
with sonar smoother and easier just
going<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> go<00:00:19.920> ahead<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.130> expand<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.789> track

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
going to go ahead and expand a track

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.670 
going to go ahead and expand a track
that<00:00:21.090> has<00:00:21.420> multiple<00:00:21.660> vocal<00:00:22.260> takes<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.619> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that has multiple vocal takes and you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.279 
that has multiple vocal takes and you
see<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> bunch<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.189> different<00:00:23.430> clips<00:00:24.199> one<00:00:25.199> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
see a bunch of different clips one of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.929 
see a bunch of different clips one of
the<00:00:25.350> new<00:00:25.470> things<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.800> Sun<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:26.099> fives<00:00:26.310> track

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the new things in Sun are fives track

the new things in Sun are fives track
layering<00:00:27.150> abilities<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.080> ability<00:00:28.260> to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
layering abilities is the ability to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.710 
layering abilities is the ability to
rebuild<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> layers<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.269> they<00:00:30.570> actually

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
rebuild the layers so that they actually

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.630 
rebuild the layers so that they actually
take<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.260> less<00:00:31.470> space<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:32.040> more<00:00:32.160> compact

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
take up less space and are more compact

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.850 
take up less space and are more compact
and<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> also<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.170> get<00:00:34.350> rid<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.559> any

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and I can also have it get rid of any

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.280 
and I can also have it get rid of any
unused<00:00:35.399> layers<00:00:35.730> by<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:36.899> clicking<00:00:37.140> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
unused layers by just right clicking and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
unused layers by just right clicking and
saying<00:00:37.530> compact<00:00:38.040> layers<00:00:38.540> furthermore<00:00:39.540> each

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
saying compact layers furthermore each

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.810 
saying compact layers furthermore each
layer<00:00:40.200> allows<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.040> hit<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> solo<00:00:41.520> button

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
layer allows you to hit a solo button

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.060 
layer allows you to hit a solo button
and<00:00:42.030> just<00:00:42.329> hear<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.510> individual<00:00:43.079> layer<00:00:43.290> mute

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
and just hear that individual layer mute

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.490 
and just hear that individual layer mute
like<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> mutant<00:00:44.940> individual<00:00:45.360> layer<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.840> also

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
like a mutant individual layer and also

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.580 
like a mutant individual layer and also
layers<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.460> overlapped<00:00:48.180> clips<00:00:49.170> so

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
layers can now have overlapped clips so

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.130 
layers can now have overlapped clips so
before<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.879> had<00:00:51.210> overlapped<00:00:51.719> clips<00:00:51.989> they

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
before if you had overlapped clips they

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.689 
before if you had overlapped clips they
would<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> another<00:00:52.620> layer<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.430> allows

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
would go to another layer this allows

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.369 
would go to another layer this allows
you<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> actually<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.210> crossfaded<00:00:54.840> clips<00:00:55.140> on

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
you to actually have crossfaded clips on

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
you to actually have crossfaded clips on
the<00:00:55.739> same<00:00:56.010> layer<00:00:56.300> giving<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> complete

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the same layer giving you complete

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.680 
the same layer giving you complete
creative<00:00:58.050> freedom<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:59.129> comping<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.699> can<00:01:00.570> also

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
creative freedom for comping I can also

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.779 
creative freedom for comping I can also
insert<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.649> by<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:01.949> clicking<00:01:02.160> insert<00:01:02.609> new

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
insert just by right clicking insert new

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.789 
insert just by right clicking insert new
layers<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.989> allow<00:01:04.229> me<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.559> ahead<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
layers which allow me to go ahead and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.280 
layers which allow me to go ahead and
create<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.040> new<00:01:05.280> layer<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> record<00:01:06.210> into<00:01:06.570> or<00:01:06.900> for

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
create a new layer to record into or for

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.039 
create a new layer to record into or for
comping<00:01:07.650> purposes<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:09.090> select<00:01:09.299> an<00:01:09.689> entire

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
comping purposes I can select an entire

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
comping purposes I can select an entire
layer<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:11.430> copying<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:11.909> pasting<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.420> delete

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
layer for copying or pasting or delete

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.840 
layer for copying or pasting or delete
an<00:01:12.930> entire<00:01:13.049> layer<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> lot<00:01:14.670> more

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
an entire layer so we have a lot more

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.730 
an entire layer so we have a lot more
capability<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.869> track<00:01:16.110> layers<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> can

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
capability in track layers now I can

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
capability in track layers now I can
also<00:01:16.860> turn<00:01:17.250> layers<00:01:17.640> off<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.150> simply<00:01:18.570> just

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
also turn layers off and on simply just

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.450 
also turn layers off and on simply just
by<00:01:18.930> clicking<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.560> button<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.280> you're<00:01:20.369> in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
by clicking a button so when you're in

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.130 
by clicking a button so when you're in
the<00:01:20.520> track<00:01:20.729> view<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.540> turning<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.869> button

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the track view just turning a button

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.660 
the track view just turning a button
will<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.439> ahead<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.680> toggle<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.130> layers<00:01:23.340> off

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
will go ahead and toggle the layers off

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.190 
will go ahead and toggle the layers off
and<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.740> now<00:01:25.740> while<00:01:25.950> we're<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> layer

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
and on now while we're here in a layer

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.319 
and on now while we're here in a layer
one<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> useful<00:01:28.530> things<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:30.060> track

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
one of the useful things in in track

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.700 
one of the useful things in in track
layering<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.930> course<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> have

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
layering of course is that you have

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
layering of course is that you have
multiple<00:01:31.920> clips<00:01:32.400> all<00:01:32.579> fed<00:01:32.790> through<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> same

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
multiple clips all fed through the same

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.480 
multiple clips all fed through the same
track<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:34.439> makes<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> easy<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.100> feed<00:01:35.340> them

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
track which makes it easy to feed them

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.730

school for a couple reasons one because

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.820 
school for a couple reasons one because
we<00:02:14.480> only<00:02:14.660> want<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.080> clip<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.319> play<00:02:15.590> through

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
we only want that clip to play through

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.250 
we only want that clip to play through
that<00:02:16.220> delay<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:17.300> also<00:02:17.510> allows<00:02:17.690> me<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.080> move

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
that delay this also allows me to move

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.930 
that delay this also allows me to move
the<00:02:18.410> clip<00:02:18.680> while<00:02:18.980> keeping<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.430> effect<00:02:19.730> with

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
the clip while keeping the effect with

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.160 
the clip while keeping the effect with
it<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.240> regardless<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.810> where<00:02:20.990> on<00:02:21.080> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
it so regardless of where on the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.750 
it so regardless of where on the
timeline<00:02:21.410> I<00:02:21.620> move<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.040> or<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.250> what<00:02:22.370> track<00:02:22.610> I

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
timeline I move it or to what track I

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.460 
timeline I move it or to what track I
move<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.209> can<00:02:23.420> always<00:02:23.600> be<00:02:23.810> sure<00:02:24.020> that

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
move it to I can always be sure that

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.880 
move it to I can always be sure that
that<00:02:24.620> effect<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:25.280> tied<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.209> clip<00:02:26.890> now

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
that effect is tied to that clip now

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.670 
that effect is tied to that clip now
furthermore<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.670> can<00:02:29.540> right<00:02:30.020> click<00:02:30.050> on<00:02:30.290> any

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
furthermore I can right click on any

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.740 
furthermore I can right click on any
clip<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.370> has<00:02:31.550> an<00:02:31.700> effect<00:02:31.820> embedded<00:02:32.420> with<00:02:32.600> it

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
clip that has an effect embedded with it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.770 
clip that has an effect embedded with it
and<00:02:32.930> go<00:02:33.860> ahead<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.160> create<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.940> clip<00:02:35.360> envelope

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
and go ahead and create a clip envelope

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.350 
and go ahead and create a clip envelope
for<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.740> effect<00:02:37.070> now<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.820> previously<00:02:38.120> we

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
for the effect now so previously we

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.990 
for the effect now so previously we
could<00:02:38.630> do<00:02:38.780> gain<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.739> pan<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.489> now<00:02:40.670> have

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
could do gain and pan I can now have

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.809 
could do gain and pan I can now have
clip<00:02:41.330> based<00:02:41.540> automation<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:43.520> applies<00:02:43.790> to

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
clip based automation that applies to

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.140 
clip based automation that applies to
effects<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:44.840> we'll<00:02:44.989> go<00:02:45.110> ahead<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.350> just

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
effects so we'll go ahead and just

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.490 
effects so we'll go ahead and just
automate<00:02:47.150> let's<00:02:47.360> say<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.750> tempo<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
automate let's say the tempo of the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.390 
automate let's say the tempo of the
delay<00:02:48.970> hit<00:02:49.970> ok<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.690> get<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.110> new<00:02:51.410> envelope

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
delay hit ok and I get a new envelope

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.190 
delay hit ok and I get a new envelope
right<00:02:52.880> on<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.090> clip<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.570> allows<00:02:53.810> me<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.080> go

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
right on the clip that allows me to go

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.160 
right on the clip that allows me to go
ahead<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.709> make<00:02:54.890> adjustments<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.780> tempo

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
ahead and make adjustments to the tempo

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.040 
ahead and make adjustments to the tempo
any<00:02:57.410> parameter<00:02:58.280> can<00:02:58.489> be<00:02:58.519> automated<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.390> can

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
any parameter can be automated I can

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.600 
any parameter can be automated I can
have<00:03:00.170> as<00:03:00.260> many<00:03:00.410> envelopes<00:03:00.980> per<00:03:01.190> clip<00:03:01.400> as<00:03:01.519> I

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
have as many envelopes per clip as I

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.390 
have as many envelopes per clip as I
like<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.000> again<00:03:02.600> not<00:03:02.959> only<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.530> effect<00:03:03.890> but

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
like and again not only the effect but

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.490 
like and again not only the effect but
also<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:05.090> automation<00:03:05.630> sticks<00:03:05.930> with<00:03:06.080> any<00:03:06.230> clip

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
also the automation sticks with any clip

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.670 
also the automation sticks with any clip
regardless<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.130> where<00:03:07.310> it's<00:03:07.430> moved
