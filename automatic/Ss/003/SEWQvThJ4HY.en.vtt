and<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.450> somewhat<00:01:30.840> hopeful<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.350> they

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and I was somewhat hopeful that they

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.649 
and I was somewhat hopeful that they
might<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:32.009> updating<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.640> as<00:01:32.909> well<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.600> even

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
might be updating that as well but even

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.810 
might be updating that as well but even
with<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.409> intro<00:01:34.770> still<00:01:35.040> gave<00:01:35.250> me<00:01:35.280> chills

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
with that the intro still gave me chills

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.450 
with that the intro still gave me chills
as<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.329> watching<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.740> also<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.220> some

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
as I was watching it we also see some

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.130

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
Twilight's paranoia is still very much a

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.410 
Twilight's paranoia is still very much a
part<00:02:18.739> of<00:02:18.829> her<00:02:18.980> character<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.939> is<00:02:20.090> one<00:02:20.239> of<00:02:20.269> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
part of her character this is one of the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.449 
part of her character this is one of the
main<00:02:20.659> reasons<00:02:21.170> she<00:02:21.319> has<00:02:21.439> become<00:02:21.829> so<00:02:22.040> adorkable

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
main reasons she has become so adorkable

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.369 
main reasons she has become so adorkable
and<00:02:22.879> I'd<00:02:22.999> be<00:02:23.150> rather<00:02:23.359> worried<00:02:23.840> if<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.049> writers

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
and I'd be rather worried if the writers

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.170 
and I'd be rather worried if the writers
had<00:02:24.560> decided<00:02:24.859> to<00:02:25.010> completely<00:02:25.459> remove<00:02:25.939> that

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
had decided to completely remove that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.539 
had decided to completely remove that
aspect<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.749> her<00:02:26.840> character<00:02:27.409> but<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:28.219> story

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
aspect of her character but the story

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.819 
aspect of her character but the story
really<00:02:28.670> starts<00:02:29.450> moving<00:02:29.870> when<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.019> strange<00:02:30.500> vine

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
really starts moving when a strange vine

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.800 
really starts moving when a strange vine
comes<00:02:31.250> out<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.549> floor<00:02:31.819> grabbing<00:02:32.269> Celestia

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
comes out of the floor grabbing Celestia

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.660 
comes out of the floor grabbing Celestia
which<00:02:33.139> apparently<00:02:33.500> causes<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:34.159> Sun<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.579> the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
which apparently causes the Sun and the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.550 
which apparently causes the Sun and the
moon<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:35.090> be<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.389> sky<00:02:35.659> at<00:02:35.719> the<00:02:35.900> same<00:02:36.170> time

moon to be in the sky at the same time
now<00:02:37.430> Twilight<00:02:37.790> actually<00:02:38.359> shows<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:38.629> little<00:02:39.049> bit

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
now Twilight actually shows a little bit

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.050 
now Twilight actually shows a little bit
of<00:02:39.409> uncertainty<00:02:39.859> when<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.400> Royal<00:02:40.700> Guards

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
of uncertainty when the Royal Guards

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.659 
of uncertainty when the Royal Guards
come<00:02:41.359> seeking<00:02:41.780> orders<00:02:42.139> from<00:02:42.260> her<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:43.430> once

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:43.669 
come seeking orders from her but once

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.909 
come seeking orders from her but once
again<00:02:43.849> twilight<00:02:44.540> almost<00:02:44.959> immediately<00:02:45.620> shows

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:45.919 
again twilight almost immediately shows

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.860 
again twilight almost immediately shows
just<00:02:46.219> how<00:02:46.340> well<00:02:46.700> she<00:02:46.909> can<00:02:47.060> lead<00:02:47.329> even<00:02:47.750> in

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
just how well she can lead even in

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.979 
just how well she can lead even in
unexpected<00:02:48.650> circumstances<00:02:49.549> I'm<00:02:50.329> really<00:02:50.689> glad

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
unexpected circumstances I'm really glad

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.569 
unexpected circumstances I'm really glad
to<00:02:51.019> see<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.379> her<00:02:51.620> character<00:02:52.159> has<00:02:52.280> learned

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
to see that her character has learned

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.729 
to see that her character has learned
from<00:02:52.819> her<00:02:52.939> many<00:02:53.180> previous<00:02:53.689> lessons<00:02:54.169> she<00:02:54.620> has

back<00:02:57.949> in<00:02:58.189> Ponyville<00:02:58.459> we<00:02:58.909> see<00:02:59.090> clouds<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.659> are

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
back in Ponyville we see clouds that are

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.689 
back in Ponyville we see clouds that are

Dash<00:03:01.969> but<00:03:02.419> a<00:03:02.480> far<00:03:02.780> more<00:03:02.810> interesting

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
Dash but a far more interesting

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.229 
Dash but a far more interesting
development<00:03:04.069> comes<00:03:04.310> when<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.579> vines<00:03:04.909> start

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
development comes when the vines start

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.909 
development comes when the vines start
causing<00:03:05.480> rarities<00:03:06.049> magic<00:03:06.469> to<00:03:06.590> be<00:03:06.709> more

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
causing rarities magic to be more

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.429 
causing rarities magic to be more
chaotic<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.669> one<00:03:08.449> little<00:03:08.689> side<00:03:09.019> note<00:03:09.049> that

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
chaotic and one little side note that

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.869 
chaotic and one little side note that
I'm<00:03:09.530> rather<00:03:09.680> curious<00:03:10.340> about<00:03:10.549> is<00:03:10.699> whether

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
I'm rather curious about is whether

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.580 
I'm rather curious about is whether
