on that I mean so often we do a bit of

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.309 
on that I mean so often we do a bit of
research<00:02:48.280> there's<00:02:49.239> usually<00:02:49.420> something<00:02:49.810> that

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
research there's usually something that

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.680 
research there's usually something that
we<00:02:50.410> find<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.769> sparks<00:02:51.220> 90<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.730> them<00:02:51.910> there<00:02:52.660> are
