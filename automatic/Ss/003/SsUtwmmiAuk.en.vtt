00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
that kind of thing on there but

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.560 
that kind of thing on there but
definitely<00:03:22.520> well<00:03:22.670> worth<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.910> download<00:03:23.180> and

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
definitely well worth the download and

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.570 
definitely well worth the download and
that<00:03:23.660> one's<00:03:23.840> called<00:03:24.020> livewire<00:03:24.470> okay<00:03:25.400> guys

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
that one's called livewire okay guys

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.130 
that one's called livewire okay guys
last<00:03:25.940> but<00:03:26.120> certainly<00:03:26.150> no<00:03:26.570> means<00:03:26.780> least<00:03:26.900> we're

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
last but certainly no means least we're

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.810 
last but certainly no means least we're
taking<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.470> look<00:03:27.620> at<00:03:27.830> a<00:03:27.860> tweak<00:03:28.160> called<00:03:28.190> for

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
taking a look at a tweak called for

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.550 
taking a look at a tweak called for
status<00:03:29.090> bar<00:03:29.480> as<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.110> can<00:03:30.260> probably<00:03:30.440> imagine

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
status bar as you can probably imagine

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.440 
status bar as you can probably imagine
this<00:03:31.010> one<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.430> actually<00:03:31.519> force<00:03:32.000> your<00:03:32.180> status

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
this one I actually force your status

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.540 
this one I actually force your status
bar<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.750> show<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.860> know<00:03:33.980> no<00:03:34.190> matter<00:03:34.220> what

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
bar to show and you know no matter what

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.740 
bar to show and you know no matter what
you're<00:03:34.700> doing<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.150> what<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.420> might<00:03:35.600> be<00:03:35.630> doing

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
you're doing so what you might be doing

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.100 
you're doing so what you might be doing
is<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.709> say<00:03:37.040> an<00:03:37.340> absolute<00:03:37.910> load<00:03:38.239> up<00:03:38.390> plants<00:03:38.780> vs

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
is in say an absolute load up plants vs

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.620 
is in say an absolute load up plants vs
zombies<00:03:39.410> here<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.850> I'll<00:03:40.850> just<00:03:41.030> turn<00:03:41.420> the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
zombies here and I'll just turn the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.420 
zombies here and I'll just turn the
volume<00:03:41.959> down<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.170> little<00:03:42.380> bit<00:03:42.560> here<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.310> can

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
volume down a little bit here so you can

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.190 
volume down a little bit here so you can
see<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.790> app<00:03:43.970> will<00:03:44.209> actually<00:03:44.540> automatically

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
see the app will actually automatically

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.620 
see the app will actually automatically
still<00:03:45.500> display<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:45.980> status<00:03:46.040> bar<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.820> no

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
still display the status bar and no

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.490 
still display the status bar and no
matter<00:03:47.780> what<00:03:47.930> you're<00:03:48.170> doing<00:03:48.350> right<00:03:48.440> for

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
matter what you're doing right for

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.620 
matter what you're doing right for
gaming<00:03:49.070> especially<00:03:49.610> so<00:03:49.880> when<00:03:50.030> we<00:03:50.180> can<00:03:50.330> see<00:03:50.510> you

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
gaming especially so when we can see you

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.000 
gaming especially so when we can see you
have<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.930> status<00:03:51.230> bar<00:03:51.260> here<00:03:51.620> we're<00:03:51.769> obviously

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
have the status bar here we're obviously

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.250 
have the status bar here we're obviously
you<00:03:52.670> wouldn't<00:03:52.910> actually<00:03:53.209> have<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.750> usually

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
you wouldn't actually have that usually

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.050 
you wouldn't actually have that usually
so<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.980> again<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.459> quite<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.700> handy<00:03:56.030> little

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
so that again is quite a handy little

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.640 
so that again is quite a handy little
tweak<00:03:56.420> some<00:03:56.630> people<00:03:56.870> might<00:03:57.049> quite<00:03:57.380> like<00:03:57.620> that

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
tweak some people might quite like that

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.640 
tweak some people might quite like that
you<00:03:58.190> can<00:03:58.340> see<00:03:58.549> actually<00:03:58.790> kind<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.420> has<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.380> bit

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
you can see actually kind of has a bit

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.860 
you can see actually kind of has a bit
of<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.860> pasty<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.549> so<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:02.269> can<00:04:02.480> sort<00:04:02.690> of<00:04:02.720> see

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
of a pasty to it so you can sort of see

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.240 
of a pasty to it so you can sort of see
through<00:04:03.110> it<00:04:03.140> as<00:04:03.320> well<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:03.680> it's<00:04:03.830> not<00:04:03.950> too

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
through it as well so it's not too

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.640 
through it as well so it's not too
invasive<00:04:04.549> on<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.930> know<00:04:06.049> gaming<00:04:06.350> and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
invasive on and you know gaming and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.350 
invasive on and you know gaming and
stuff<00:04:06.830> like<00:04:06.980> that<00:04:07.040> but<00:04:07.610> that's<00:04:07.790> been<00:04:08.000> my<00:04:08.150> top
