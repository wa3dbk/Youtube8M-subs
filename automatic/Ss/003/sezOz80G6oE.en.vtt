that kind of gets like incorporated then

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.180 
that kind of gets like incorporated then

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
fine just like that so now we have our

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.210 
fine just like that so now we have our
dry<00:02:37.160> ingredients<00:02:37.190> here<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.360> have<00:02:38.840> my<00:02:39.230> flour<00:02:39.739> and

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
dry ingredients here I have my flour and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.310 
dry ingredients here I have my flour and
my<00:02:40.310> baking<00:02:41.269> powder<00:02:41.540> baking<00:02:41.720> soda<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.200> salt

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
my baking powder baking soda and salt

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.370 
my baking powder baking soda and salt
and<00:02:42.850> my<00:02:43.850> unsweetened<00:02:44.480> cocoa<00:02:44.900> powder<00:02:44.930> now<00:02:45.320> I

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
and my unsweetened cocoa powder now I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.530 
and my unsweetened cocoa powder now I
said<00:02:45.709> before<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:46.160> did<00:02:46.519> sift<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
said before I did sift this and the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.750 
said before I did sift this and the
reason<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.080> want<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.290> sift<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.769> sift<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.370> after

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
reason you want to sift it sift it after

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.759 
reason you want to sift it sift it after
you<00:02:49.880> measure<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.480> because<00:02:51.260> there's<00:02:51.410> always

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
you measure it is because there's always

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.130 
you measure it is because there's always
lumps<00:02:52.580> in<00:02:52.730> my<00:02:53.030> experience<00:02:53.660> there's<00:02:53.900> always

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
lumps in my experience there's always

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.350 
lumps in my experience there's always
lumps<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:54.739> cocoa<00:02:55.100> powder<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:55.850> if<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.120> don't

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
lumps in cocoa powder so if you don't

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.270 
lumps in cocoa powder so if you don't
sift<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.870> then<00:02:57.170> it's<00:02:57.320> gonna<00:02:57.470> be<00:02:57.650> lumps<00:02:58.100> in

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
sift that then it's gonna be lumps in

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.800 
sift that then it's gonna be lumps in
there<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.730> don't<00:02:58.880> want<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.269> so<00:02:59.510> just

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
there and you don't want that so just

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.910 
there and you don't want that so just
mix<00:03:00.260> all<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.709> dry<00:03:01.010> stuff<00:03:01.370> together<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:02.920> just

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
mix all this dry stuff together and just

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.550 
mix all this dry stuff together and just
use<00:03:04.160> your<00:03:04.340> whisk<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:06.019> get<00:03:06.170> that<00:03:06.320> really

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
use your whisk and get that really

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.160 
use your whisk and get that really
thoroughly<00:03:07.370> combined<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.720> we're<00:03:08.959> just<00:03:08.989> gonna

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170
