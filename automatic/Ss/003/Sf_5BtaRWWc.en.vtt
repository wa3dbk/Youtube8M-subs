00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.700
 and a cyber punketos today I'm going to 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.830
 show how to mine 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.590
 with a crypto currency that is 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.880
 optimized to look with the cpu well 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.460
 is with the central unit of 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.610
 processing of any laptop 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.700
 scope or intel amd computer that by 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.490
 true amd processors of several 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.820
 cores work pretty well with this 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.829
 program called mainer gate first thing 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.110
 what they have to do is download the 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.730
 mainer program for that game will 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.559
 leave a link in the description of 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.989
 video and as you know they will be grateful 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.539
 quite that they use it once 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.359
 downloaded the software and you good 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:53.469
 installed on your computer this time 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:56.649
 works for both windows computers 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.989
 linux and mac too as you know 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.210
 I'm a Mac user and it's one of the 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.969
 programs that worked best for me 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.320
 the mining of crypto currencies in addition to 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.960
 which has an interface also very 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.289
 friendly well once downloaded the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.240
 program they are going to open we are going to look for it 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:18.100
 here it is 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.740
 we are going to open so they can see what is going 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.090
 and basically the interface is going to be something 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.590
 so I'm in what to do a 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.100
 update collected updated ago 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.770
 little and there is an update available 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.830
 well they have several have two forms of 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.960
 mine the smart myler that is the miner 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.659
 smart what is this good if you guys 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.460
 click here to smart mining what 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.580
 does it automatically go to 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.670
 select the currency crypto more 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.259
 profitable at the time to undermine the and 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.630
 in this way then let's get 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.970
 better yet here we 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.460
 let's focus only on the bait coin 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.130
 and I say better results in the sense 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.159
 that is going to look for the currency crypto more 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.050
 profitable the byte coin however it is 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.810
 a currency that I recommend you mine 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.899
 because it's a really easy way really 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.090
 process of mining and it is also 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.610
 rising little by little when I started it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.709
 to put together had a value of 4 sato if 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.230
 only and has reached the 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.580
 value of up to 11 unleashed if this wants 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.709
 say that what has been mined in a 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.260
 certain moment it doubled in value and 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.970
 until a little more almost 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.700
 and then one can change it for 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.190
 bitcoin in other pages that are dedicated 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.490
 to the exchange of currencies of crypto currencies 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.560
 and in this way get more bitcoins or 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.600
 it is one more way also to win 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.330
 bitcoins if they want to see that way 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.160
 because you can change these bytes with 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.740
 the other crypto currencies that also 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.560
 link to this program well let's go to 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.120
 see the right coin money as you see 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.540
 here we have several crypto currencies 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.130
 we have what is the byte bcn with the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.220
 psn of the phantom coin the delight etc with 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.050
 quasar coin age not and also monero the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.270
 monero and dark knight are two others 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.330
 crypto coins that are pretty good 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.760
 also and I highly recommend them if 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.310
 they want to try them for me nothing 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.250
 here I already had automatically put in 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.560
 be in mining but normally 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.689
 when we enter in we go to 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.159
 see these options to stun and 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.310
 then the first thing that we have to 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:28.790
 to do is to select how many records of the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.579
 cpu we want to designate the task of 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.790
 mine these crypto coins in this case 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.970
 I have occupied two cpu two cuts of 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.579
 biceps that actually has four cores 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.269
 is one and with seven but mysteriously 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.209
 it works better with two cuts nothing 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.720
 more and I put the four does not enlighten me 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.760
 so fast it handles just 70 kilos is 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.040
 another thing also if they have other 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.200
 open applications in this case I 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.849
 I have opened what would be the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.530
 and browser program 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.379
 screen recording to do the 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.400
 videos then obviously consume cpu 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.980
 but my processor that is only 7 to 2.7 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.400
 giga hertz is generating me the amount 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.900
 of 96 per second then it 's a 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.690
 amount that has worked for me 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.900
 generate 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.180
 the right coins that I have already made 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.690
 I have already changed this page 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.240
 mayorga and a total of about 35 thousand 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.790
 bitcoins more or less and today is the byte 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.030
 contains a price that is around 7 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.510
 to 10 sato if then if 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.120
 can generate a profit because we 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.580
 work also to change it 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.350
 bitcoin or even transcribed coins 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.140
 that suits us what with layman and 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.500
 etcetera that happens for example with the 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.990
 light coin that here as you see tells us 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.540
 that can only be mined with the gpu 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.790
 and as you already know byte with like 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.250
 with nature with are crypto coins that 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.280
 they occupy an algorithm that is only 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.770
 compatible with chips so or with as much 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.080
 similar in this case the cards of 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.060
 video from our computer but like me 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.590
 I'm on a laptop I have no card 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.780
 video so you can not master the 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.280
 the light coin but nevertheless not 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.840
 it matters or it can be mined or 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.510
 transcribed coins like those that are 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.460
 here and then change them by light 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.430
 position 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.770
 they need we could also 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.840
 access other pools that is today I will make a 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.180
 video tutorial later on simply 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.639
 adding the name of the worker the 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.819
 url of the pool and how well it gives us 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.330
 access we give you blue and automatically 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:40.460
 we would see here the other other currency 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.710
 to mine that is compatible by 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.680
 course with graphics cards or with the 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.479
 cpu another wonder is also that this 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.669
 same program you can install it on 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.009
 various computers if you have a 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.130
 laptop a kobe ​​decks and the computer 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.780
 is not an old computer that you 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.120
 about out there you can install this 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.130
 program on all three computers and 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.639
 put to mine at the same time getting 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.710
 better results more hashes of power and 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.720
 good is a program that as you can see is 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.780
 pretty intuitive pretty easy to 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.970
 understand this has been all for now 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.830
 they really have no greater science than 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.020
 download the program as I say 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.030
 obviously first they register and for 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.909
 that I left the link in the description 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.159
 of the video and well once 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.639
 start generating together with your program 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.340
 they can 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.319
 here on the dashboard of the page how much 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.870
 they have in total how much the 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:34.699
 value of what they have accumulated right now 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:39.789
 for example at this moment of generated 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:43.249
 7 606 bitcoins that equals 7 thousand 824 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:45.770
 ketosis right here on one side too 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:48.379
 tells you which pages change these 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.749
 bytes coins by bitcoin in this case hit 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:52.460
 be tc is an exchange of crypto currency is 

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:54.529
 quite recommendable 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.689
 I occupy it enough and I would make a video 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:59.870
 tutorial also about how it deals 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.849
 this page but if you've already occupied crazy 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.770
 for example or any other system of 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:06.889
 exchange crypt coins is 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:10.009
 exactly the same story then 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:12.500
 this has been all for now I hope they 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.479
 have liked the video comment any 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.879
 doubt you already know here I am to answer 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:19.779
 subscribe to the channel give a like and 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.779
 see you next time
