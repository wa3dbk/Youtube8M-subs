about what's good with this dr3 Racing

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.910 
about what's good with this dr3 Racing
the<00:01:17.210> first<00:01:17.510> thing<00:01:17.660> is<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.870> engine<00:01:18.260> it's<00:01:18.860> a

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
the first thing is the engine it's a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.950 
the first thing is the engine it's a
really<00:01:19.100> charming<00:01:19.520> engine<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.940> use<00:01:19.970> sounds

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
really charming engine to use sounds

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.410 
really charming engine to use sounds
good<00:01:21.230> and<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.860> extra<00:01:22.100> force<00:01:22.370> doesn't<00:01:22.940> come<00:01:23.240> to

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
good and the extra force doesn't come to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.200 
good and the extra force doesn't come to
the<00:01:23.480> detriment<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:24.470> lowdown<00:01:24.830> torque

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
the detriment the lowdown torque

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.460 
the detriment the lowdown torque
steering<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.360> also<00:01:26.570> good<00:01:26.810> it's<00:01:26.990> an<00:01:27.110> electric

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
steering is also good it's an electric

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.230 
steering is also good it's an electric
system<00:01:27.619> but<00:01:28.010> it's<00:01:28.369> good<00:01:28.520> feel<00:01:28.760> it's<00:01:29.090> accurate

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
system but it's good feel it's accurate

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.080 
system but it's good feel it's accurate
it's<00:01:29.690> nicely<00:01:29.840> weighted<00:01:30.130> gearbox<00:01:31.130> is<00:01:31.280> positive

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
it's nicely weighted gearbox is positive

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.170 
it's nicely weighted gearbox is positive
but<00:01:32.360> like<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:33.080> use<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.910> really<00:01:34.910> strong

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
but like to use and really strong

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.940 
but like to use and really strong
braking<00:01:35.660> performance<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.350> plenty<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.740> grip

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
braking performance and plenty of grip

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.340 
braking performance and plenty of grip
from<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.160> larger<00:01:37.760> tires<00:01:38.000> but<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:39.020> not<00:01:39.170> all

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
from the larger tires but it's not all

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.440 
from the larger tires but it's not all
positives<00:01:39.920> for<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.190> ds3<00:01:40.520> racing<00:01:40.550> I<00:01:41.000> mean<00:01:41.330> it's

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
positives for the ds3 racing I mean it's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.910 
positives for the ds3 racing I mean it's

performance really just give a bit of a

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.969 
performance really just give a bit of a
challenge<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.080> front<00:01:51.320> axle<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.740> grips

challenge to the front axle the grips

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.380 
challenge to the front axle the grips
fine<00:01:52.310> it's<00:01:52.610> what<00:01:52.759> happens<00:01:52.940> when<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.090> come<00:01:53.270> on

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
fine it's what happens when you come on

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.969 
fine it's what happens when you come on
the<00:01:53.479> throttle<00:01:53.900> just<00:01:54.500> beyond<00:01:54.680> these<00:01:54.770> greasy
