00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
have to stay silent throughout the game

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
have to stay silent throughout the game
now<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> easiest<00:01:45.090> way<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
now the easiest way to do this is to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.120 
now the easiest way to do this is to
pick<00:01:46.110> them<00:01:46.290> off<00:01:46.380> one<00:01:46.409> by<00:01:46.680> one

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
pick them off one by one

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.270 
pick them off one by one
say<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> them<00:01:49.079> leaves<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> group<00:01:49.619> so

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
say if a one of them leaves the group so

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.490 
say if a one of them leaves the group so
that<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.579> basically<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> easiest<00:01:51.210> way<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.079> get

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that is basically the easiest way to get

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.770 
that is basically the easiest way to get
the<00:01:52.649> achievement<00:01:52.880> if<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.329> these<00:01:54.420> groups

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the achievement if one of these groups

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
the achievement if one of these groups
then<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.229> easy<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> straight

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
then it's easy to just get it straight

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:04.539 
then it's easy to just get it straight
