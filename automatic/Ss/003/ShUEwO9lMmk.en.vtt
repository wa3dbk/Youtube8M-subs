can feel and just go left and right when
I<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.390> started<00:01:51.689> doing<00:01:51.780> these<00:01:52.020> stretches

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I first started doing these stretches

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.810 
I first started doing these stretches
because<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.770> back<00:01:52.950> was<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.189> tight<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.670> could

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
because my back was so tight I could

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.429 
because my back was so tight I could
literally<00:01:54.060> feel<00:01:54.270> my<00:01:54.329> back<00:01:54.600> starting<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.170> crack

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
literally feel my back starting to crack

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.340 
literally feel my back starting to crack
and<00:01:55.740> which<00:01:56.460> was<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.640> good<00:01:56.759> thing<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:57.180> me<00:01:57.350> just

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and which was a good thing for me just

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.450 
and which was a good thing for me just
basically<00:01:58.649> saying<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.890> was<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.280> tight

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
basically saying that was really tight

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.700 
basically saying that was really tight
and<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.000> now<00:02:00.210> basically<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.170> stretch<00:02:01.469> here<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and so now basically this stretch here I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
and so now basically this stretch here I
don't<00:02:01.979> really<00:02:02.100> feel<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.610> much<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:04.049> know

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
don't really feel it as much so you know

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.560 
don't really feel it as much so you know
I<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.259> tried<00:02:04.619> again<00:02:04.649> try<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> take<00:02:05.219> my<00:02:05.340> time

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
I just tried again try to take my time

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.540 
I just tried again try to take my time
do<00:02:06.570> about<00:02:06.689> 10<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> them<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.310> pretty<00:02:08.429> much

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
do about 10 of them and that pretty much

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.430 
do about 10 of them and that pretty much
basically<00:02:08.910> helps<00:02:09.239> my<00:02:09.360> shoulders<00:02:09.720> another<00:02:10.259> one

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
basically helps my shoulders another one

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.930 
basically helps my shoulders another one
that<00:02:10.470> I'll<00:02:10.649> do<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.099> i'll<00:02:11.459> do<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> shoulder

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that I'll do that is i'll do a shoulder

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.790 
that I'll do that is i'll do a shoulder
rotation<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:13.020> i'll<00:02:13.140> try<00:02:13.349> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
rotation so i'll try to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
rotation so i'll try to
get<00:02:13.980> forward<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.520> back<00:02:14.700> again<00:02:15.330> you're<00:02:15.720> going

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
get forward and back again you're going

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.150 
get forward and back again you're going
to<00:02:15.900> see<00:02:15.990> my<00:02:16.110> body<00:02:16.260> moving<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.770> little<00:02:16.890> bit<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
i'll do that forward and then again i'll

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.700 
i'll do that forward and then again i'll
do<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.910> back<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.810> i<00:02:39.840> said<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:40.320> lot<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.590> it

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710

do that back and like i said a lot of it
a<00:02:40.740> lot<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.980> these<00:02:41.100> exercises<00:02:41.340> are<00:02:41.700> these

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
a lot of these exercises are these

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.330 
a lot of these exercises are these
stretches<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.660> know<00:02:42.750> i'm<00:02:42.840> breathing<00:02:43.350> so

exercise<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:54.300> lot<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.900> us<00:02:54.990> who<00:02:55.110> have<00:02:55.200> muscled<00:02:55.500> in

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
exercise a lot of us who have muscled in

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.650 
exercise a lot of us who have muscled in
boro<00:02:55.710> muscular<00:02:56.130> dystrophy<00:02:56.490> we<00:02:57.240> can't<00:02:57.510> lean

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
boro muscular dystrophy we can't lean

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.420 
boro muscular dystrophy we can't lean
forward<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.530> rely<00:02:58.710> on<00:02:58.980> leaning<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
forward so we rely on leaning to the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.980 
forward so we rely on leaning to the
lesson<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.060> right<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.690> order<00:03:00.840> for

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.699 
I'll do it on the on the right side so
all<00:03:57.060> these<00:03:57.270> stretches<00:03:57.570> like<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.870> said<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.590> I'm

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
all these stretches like I said that I'm

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.410 
all these stretches like I said that I'm
not<00:03:58.830> shown<00:03:59.130> here<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.370> do<00:03:59.430> both<00:03:59.760> left<00:04:00.209> on<00:04:00.360> the
