00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
spaghetti noodles and putting them in

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.560 
spaghetti noodles and putting them in
there<00:01:17.400> sometimes<00:01:18.400> it's<00:01:18.580> kind<00:01:18.850> of<00:01:18.910> hard<00:01:19.420> to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
there sometimes it's kind of hard to

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.820 
there sometimes it's kind of hard to
know<00:01:19.810> how<00:01:20.140> many<00:01:20.200> that<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.820> use<00:01:22.620> but<00:01:23.620> I'll<00:01:23.800> just

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
know how many that to use but I'll just

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.889 
know how many that to use but I'll just
guess

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.730 

spend<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.530> few<00:01:30.560> minutes<00:01:31.280> here<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.530> looks<00:01:33.530> like

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
spend a few minutes here so looks like

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.889 
spend a few minutes here so looks like
these<00:01:33.950> needles<00:01:34.460> are<00:01:34.640> getting<00:01:35.299> about<00:01:35.509> done<00:01:35.869> so

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
these needles are getting about done so

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.840 
these needles are getting about done so
I'm<00:01:36.259> going<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.470> pull<00:01:36.770> those<00:01:37.040> off<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.490> drain

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850
