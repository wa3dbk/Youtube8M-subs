00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.370 
it has a gear reduction drive on it
which<00:03:21.280> allows<00:03:21.579> us<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.970> get<00:03:22.180> lots<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:23.019> torque

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
which allows us to get lots of torque

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.129 
which allows us to get lots of torque
because<00:03:24.310> when<00:03:24.519> you<00:03:24.669> tighten<00:03:25.000> this<00:03:25.329> down<00:03:25.389> get<00:03:26.079> a

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
because when you tighten this down get a

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.339 
because when you tighten this down get a
lot<00:03:26.349> of<00:03:26.470> drag<00:03:26.739> on<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.970> really<00:03:28.720> need<00:03:28.989> some

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
torque to crank this handle and so this

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.039 
torque to crank this handle and so this
machine<00:03:34.829> drill<00:03:35.829> motor<00:03:36.359> handles<00:03:37.359> that<00:03:37.540> no
