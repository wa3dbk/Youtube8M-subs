00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.030
 This girl's strong hair is a 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.320
 normal hair everyone can tie 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.400

 that happen in the bathroom that is to put 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700
 the 23 minutes that you are bathing 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.920

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.440
 bathroom curtain over I was 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.910

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:30.840
