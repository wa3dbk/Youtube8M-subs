00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.930 
invert the can of the Dutch oven show
I've<00:03:35.060> got<00:03:35.270> another<00:03:35.540> Dutch<00:03:35.870> oven<00:03:36.140> here<00:03:36.940> the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
I've got another Dutch oven here the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.100 
I've got another Dutch oven here the
reason<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.560> just<00:03:39.830> set<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.190> down<00:03:41.110> the

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
reason so I just set this down the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.620 
reason so I just set this down the
reason<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.710> inverted<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.670> basically<00:03:44.210> for<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
reason I inverted it basically for the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.030 
reason I inverted it basically for the
steam

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
steam

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.660 
steam
there's<00:03:46.640> no<00:03:46.880> stiffness<00:03:48.190> we've<00:03:49.190> got<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:49.400> little

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
there's no stiffness we've got a little

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.180 
there's no stiffness we've got a little
seal<00:03:49.910> here<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.570> sink<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.200> steam<00:03:51.440> can<00:03:51.709> escape

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
seal here the sink the steam can escape

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.260 
seal here the sink the steam can escape
out<00:03:54.580> inverted<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:58.220> steams<00:03:58.520> gonna<00:03:58.640> rise<00:03:58.940> and

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
out inverted that steams gonna rise and

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.000 
out inverted that steams gonna rise and
there's<00:03:59.390> nowhere<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.720> go<00:03:59.900> but<00:03:59.980> stay<00:04:00.980> right

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
there's nowhere to go but stay right

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.600 
there's nowhere to go but stay right
there

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
there

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.590 
there
so<00:04:01.910> that's<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.080> reason<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:04.420> use<00:04:05.420> the

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
so that's the reason I like to use the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.500 
so that's the reason I like to use the
Dutch<00:04:05.780> government<00:04:05.930> upside<00:04:06.440> down<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:07.100> makes

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
Dutch government upside down just makes

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.640 
Dutch government upside down just makes
their<00:04:08.510> steam<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:08.959> you're<00:04:09.050> gonna<00:04:09.170> get<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.440> nice
