in<00:00:20.340> with<00:00:20.490> apple<00:00:20.789> released<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.740> more<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.010> made

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
in with apple released and more and made

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.370 
in with apple released and more and made
little<00:00:23.400> click<00:00:23.699> around<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:25.199> let's

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
little click around about that but let's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.470 
little click around about that but let's
just<00:00:25.560> go<00:00:25.740> over<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.070> versus<00:00:26.699> comparison<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
just go over a versus comparison and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.140 
just go over a versus comparison and
breathe<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.900> would<00:00:28.109> sup<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:30.000> had

actually<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.949> dimensions<00:01:02.520> are<00:01:02.670> also<00:01:02.760> very

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
actually the dimensions are also very

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.340 
actually the dimensions are also very
interesting<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.660> three<00:01:03.840> millimeters

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
interesting not with three millimeters

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.190 
interesting not with three millimeters
in<00:01:04.439> thickness<00:01:04.580> now<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.270> also<00:01:06.479> galaxy's<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
in thickness now this also galaxy's to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.340 
in thickness now this also galaxy's to
have<00:01:07.740> 8.5<00:01:08.630> so<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.900> almost<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.770> yeah<00:01:11.930> is<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
have 8.5 so it's almost like yeah is it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.120 
have 8.5 so it's almost like yeah is it
it's<00:01:13.770> bad<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.670> bad<00:01:14.970> iphone<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.170> also<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it's bad it's bad iphone and also the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.260 
it's bad it's bad iphone and also the
weight<00:01:17.310> 116<00:01:18.210> grams<00:01:19.130> 140<00:01:20.130> grams<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:20.670> i<00:01:20.970> know

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
weight 116 grams 140 grams now i know

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.550 
weight 116 grams 140 grams now i know
that<00:01:21.390> they're<00:01:21.630> probably<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.110> people<00:01:22.350> think

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that they're probably some people think

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.830 
that they're probably some people think
it<00:01:22.710> feels<00:01:23.610> nice<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.060> everything<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it feels nice and everything but that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.340 
it feels nice and everything but that
does<00:01:25.080> use<00:01:25.229> bullcrap<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.670> want<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.150> thin<00:01:27.840> device

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
does use bullcrap you want a thin device

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.230 
does use bullcrap you want a thin device
I<00:01:28.590> mean<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:28.979> device<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> doesn't<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:30.119> feel

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
I mean if device it doesn't really feel

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.179 
I mean if device it doesn't really feel
that<00:01:30.960> much<00:01:31.259> when<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.590> holding<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.040> your

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
that much when you're holding it in your

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.249 
that much when you're holding it in your
hands<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.520> stuff<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.079> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
hands on stuff and then we got to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.899 
hands on stuff and then we got to
display<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:34.950> here's<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.430> thing<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> say

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
display now here's one thing I can say

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.480 
display now here's one thing I can say
the<00:01:36.360> resolution<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.200> obviously<00:01:37.650> bigger<00:01:37.860> but

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the resolution is obviously bigger but

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.569 
the resolution is obviously bigger but
we<00:01:38.610> should<00:01:38.759> remember<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.659> smaller<00:01:39.930> screen

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
we should remember it's a smaller screen

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.060 
we should remember it's a smaller screen
3.5<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.930> other<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.890> higher

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
3.5 so that other they have a higher

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.139 
3.5 so that other they have a higher
resolution<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.700> kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:44.970> obvious

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
resolution that's kind of obvious

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.760 
resolution that's kind of obvious
because<00:01:45.720> they<00:01:46.020> can't<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> high<00:01:46.590> resolution

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
because they can't do a high resolution

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.340 
because they can't do a high resolution
1<00:01:47.189> 4.3<00:01:47.640> inch<00:01:47.970> screen<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.329> tells<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> cast<00:01:49.229> is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
1 4.3 inch screen that tells the cast is

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.319 
1 4.3 inch screen that tells the cast is
to<00:01:49.500> advocate<00:01:49.649> stay<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.549> slack<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
to advocate stay they slack at it and

but<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.280> should<00:02:08.459> remember<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> when<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.300> go

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
but you should remember that when it go

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.190 
but you should remember that when it go
go<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.259> 300<00:02:10.890> PPI<00:02:11.160> new<00:02:12.000> uris<00:02:12.540> contract

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
go so like 300 PPI new uris contract

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.580 
go so like 300 PPI new uris contract

smaller<00:02:48.060> screen<00:02:48.299> something<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.930> should

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
smaller screen something you should

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.770 
smaller screen something you should
remember<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.430> mean<00:02:50.640> if<00:02:50.970> Sammy<00:02:51.329> would<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.750> a

remember so I mean if Sammy would have a
thumb<00:02:52.230> thumb<00:02:52.530> image<00:02:52.680> display<00:02:53.130> as<00:02:53.220> well<00:02:53.280> then

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
thumb thumb image display as well then

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.190 
thumb thumb image display as well then
they<00:02:53.940> would<00:02:54.120> also<00:02:54.269> like<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:54.959> high

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
they would also like have this high

they would also like have this high
resolution<00:02:55.829> with<00:02:56.130> high<00:02:56.370> through<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.180> ppi<00:02:57.720> so

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
resolution with high through a ppi so

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.520 
resolution with high through a ppi so

that it's one gigabyte ticket or a BNI
day<00:03:33.630> they<00:03:33.959> will<00:03:34.109> suck<00:03:34.350> if<00:03:34.709> they<00:03:34.920> don't<00:03:35.100> but<00:03:35.310> you

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
day they will suck if they don't but you

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.910 
day they will suck if they don't but you
get<00:03:36.329> different<00:03:36.450> sizes<00:03:36.989> they<00:03:37.440> have<00:03:37.650> finally

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
get different sizes they have finally

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.819 
get different sizes they have finally
increased<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.670> 64<00:03:39.209> gigabyte<00:03:39.569> version

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
increased it to a 64 gigabyte version

increased it to a 64 gigabyte version
main<00:03:40.829> storage<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.609> I<00:03:41.850> mean<00:03:42.030> that's<00:03:42.150> still

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
main storage so I mean that's still

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.410 
main storage so I mean that's still
pretty<00:03:42.750> good<00:03:43.109> but<00:03:44.069> what<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.459> remember<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:45.060> on

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
pretty good but what you remember is on

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.020 
pretty good but what you remember is on
the<00:03:45.959> galaxy's<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.980> can<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.310> micro<00:03:47.639> SD

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
the galaxy's to you can have micro SD

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.990 
the galaxy's to you can have micro SD
card<00:03:48.359> as<00:03:48.510> well<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.549> up<00:03:50.850> to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
card as well so you can have that up to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.270 
card as well so you can have that up to
32<00:03:51.600> gigabytes<00:03:51.989> so<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.260> can<00:03:52.650> have<00:03:52.889> the<00:03:53.040> same

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
32 gigabytes so you can have the same

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.270 
32 gigabytes so you can have the same
amount<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:54.450> Apple<00:03:54.780> have<00:03:54.989> with<00:03:55.709> their<00:03:55.829> 64

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
amount that Apple have with their 64

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.360 
amount that Apple have with their 64
gigabyte<00:03:56.609> version<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.829> kind<00:03:59.040> of

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
gigabyte version so that is kind of

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.660 
gigabyte version so that is kind of
sweet<00:03:59.700> let's<00:04:00.599> see<00:04:00.840> our<00:04:01.230> data<00:04:01.530> plus<00:04:02.010> 12<00:04:02.310> plus<00:04:02.459> 12

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
sweet let's see our data plus 12 plus 12

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.580 
sweet let's see our data plus 12 plus 12
I'm<00:04:03.150> think<00:04:03.420> people<00:04:03.750> care<00:04:03.989> too<00:04:04.049> much<00:04:04.139> about<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
I'm think people care too much about the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.740 
I'm think people care too much about the
GPRS<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.099> edge<00:04:05.340> should<00:04:05.700> become<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.060> same<00:04:06.269> age

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
GPRS and edge should become the same age

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.830 
GPRS and edge should become the same age
3g<00:04:07.590> hsdpa<00:04:08.450> 21<00:04:09.450> megabits<00:04:09.780> per<00:04:09.840> second<00:04:11.090> hsupa<00:04:12.090> 5
