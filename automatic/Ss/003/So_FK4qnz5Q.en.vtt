about although most of the time they're

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.020 
about although most of the time they're
not<00:00:28.200> like<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.620> they<00:00:29.250> disappear<00:00:29.940> like<00:00:30.090> that

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
not like that they disappear like that

not like that they disappear like that
you<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.330> sensitize<00:00:33.840> yourself<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
you have to sensitize yourself to the

you have to sensitize yourself to the
subtle<00:00:35.129> clues<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.230> there's<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.949> little<00:00:38.190> on

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
subtle clues and there's very little on

subtle clues and there's very little on
the<00:00:38.580> outside<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.710> tell<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.940> what<00:00:42.210> the

the outside that will tell you what the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.410 
the outside that will tell you what the
person<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> inside<00:00:44.420> this

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
person is really like on the inside this

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.250 
person is really like on the inside this
is<00:00:45.630> a<00:00:45.660> sort<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.050> general<00:00:47.120> attitude<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.390> my<00:00:48.420> work

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.470 

the<00:00:52.260> kosha<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.950> really<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:53.760> significant

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the kosha is a really really significant

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.990 
the kosha is a really really significant
photographer<00:00:55.200> in<00:00:55.590> fact<00:00:56.250> I'd<00:00:56.460> say<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.850> he

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
photographer in fact I'd say that he

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.760 
photographer in fact I'd say that he
probably<00:00:57.210> changed<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.380> we<00:00:58.559> think

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
probably changed the way that we think

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.139 
probably changed the way that we think
about<00:00:58.950> photography

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
about photography

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.229 
about photography
there's<00:01:00.780> Nydia<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.710> relation<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.460> photography

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
there's Nydia in relation to photography

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.700 
there's Nydia in relation to photography
that<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.719> does<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> captures<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that what it does is it captures a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.190 
that what it does is it captures a
moment<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.339> truth<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.390> photography<00:01:06.990> has<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
moment of truth that a photography has a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.499 
moment of truth that a photography has a
special<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> privileged<00:01:08.610> relationship<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
special and privileged relationship to

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.450 
special and privileged relationship to
the<00:01:09.630> real<00:01:09.890> what<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> need<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.340> about

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the real what you need to know about

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460 
the real what you need to know about
these<00:01:11.880> photographs<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.259> operate

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
these photographs is that they operate

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.110 
these photographs is that they operate
to<00:01:13.950> disrupt<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.670> completely

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.370 

I<00:01:20.350> build<00:01:21.350> these<00:01:21.860> photographs<00:01:22.730> I<00:01:23.120> don't<00:01:24.110> really

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
I build these photographs I don't really

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.650 
I build these photographs I don't really
find<00:01:24.770> them<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:25.540> choose<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.410> place<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:28.360> choose<00:01:29.360> in

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
find them I choose the place I choose in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.690 
find them I choose the place I choose in
different<00:01:30.140> ways<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:31.640> subject<00:01:32.270> matter<00:01:32.540> and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
different ways the subject matter and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.820 
different ways the subject matter and
then<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:35.180> try<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.750> put<00:01:36.110> it<00:01:36.230> together<00:01:36.320> with

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
then I try to put it together with

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.140 
then I try to put it together with
lights<00:01:37.160> and<00:01:37.900> other<00:01:38.900> what<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:39.560> would<00:01:39.860> call

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
lights and other what I would call

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.050 
lights and other what I would call
dramatizing<00:01:41.380> elements<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.620> I<00:01:43.430> think<00:01:44.390> these

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
dramatizing elements and I think these

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.850 
dramatizing elements and I think these
dramatizing<00:01:47.060> elements<00:01:47.570> are<00:01:47.720> what<00:01:47.930> makes<00:01:48.620> it

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
dramatizing elements are what makes it

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.620 
dramatizing elements are what makes it
seem<00:01:49.190> like<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:50.570> narrative<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:56.270> way<00:01:56.300> these

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
seem like a narrative the way these

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.450 
seem like a narrative the way these
photographs<00:01:57.320> are<00:01:57.470> made<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:58.070> really

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
photographs are made is really

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.480 
photographs are made is really
interesting<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.780> artist<00:02:00.290> will<00:02:00.650> set<00:02:00.980> up<00:02:01.250> a

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
interesting the artist will set up a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.620 
interesting the artist will set up a
lighting<00:02:02.150> break

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
lighting break

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.600 
lighting break
he<00:02:02.990> might<00:02:03.170> even<00:02:03.350> decide<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.040> whole<00:02:04.250> set

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
he might even decide on the whole set

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.940 
he might even decide on the whole set
take<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.420> Polaroid<00:02:05.930> with<00:02:06.380> an<00:02:06.470> assistant

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
take a Polaroid with an assistant

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.040 
take a Polaroid with an assistant
standing<00:02:07.550> in<00:02:07.700> for<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:07.970> person<00:02:08.390> who<00:02:08.869> will

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
standing in for the person who will

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.590 
standing in for the person who will
become<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.470> subject<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.100> photograph<00:02:10.600> so

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
become the subject of the photograph so

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.480 
become the subject of the photograph so
that<00:02:11.750> everything's<00:02:12.230> already<00:02:12.470> constructed<00:02:13.310> in

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
that everything's already constructed in

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.300 
that everything's already constructed in
advance<00:02:13.960> then<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.290> subject<00:02:15.740> might<00:02:15.920> enter<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
advance then the subject might enter the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.670 
advance then the subject might enter the
frame<00:02:16.700> either<00:02:17.480> because<00:02:17.810> they're<00:02:17.960> chosen<00:02:18.260> or

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
frame either because they're chosen or

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.060 
frame either because they're chosen or
because<00:02:19.370> they<00:02:19.580> walk<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:21.070> accidentally

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
because they walk in to it accidentally

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.850 
because they walk in to it accidentally
and<00:02:23.060> what<00:02:23.240> this<00:02:23.420> really<00:02:23.690> does<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.590> blurs

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
and what this really does is it blurs

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.880 
and what this really does is it blurs
the<00:02:24.890> lines<00:02:25.580> between<00:02:25.970> what's<00:02:26.480> real<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.260> what's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
the lines between what's real and what's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.490 
the lines between what's real and what's
fictional<00:02:28.489> what's<00:02:28.820> documentary<00:02:29.750> what<00:02:30.350> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
fictional what's documentary what the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.010 
fictional what's documentary what the
artist<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.220> control<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.720> way<00:02:32.989> of

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
artist is in control of this way of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.290 
artist is in control of this way of
thinking<00:02:33.170> about<00:02:33.590> photography<00:02:34.160> questions<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
thinking about photography questions the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.060 
thinking about photography questions the
fundamental<00:02:35.989> premise<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.590> when<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.860> see<00:02:37.040> a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
fundamental premise that when you see a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.900 
fundamental premise that when you see a
photograph<00:02:37.370> you're<00:02:38.239> seeing<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.750> truth

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
photograph you're seeing the truth

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.450 
photograph you're seeing the truth
I<00:02:43.750> was<00:02:44.750> never<00:02:44.960> really<00:02:45.470> particularly

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
I was never really particularly

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.180 
I was never really particularly
comfortable<00:02:47.350> photographing<00:02:48.350> people<00:02:48.380> which

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
comfortable photographing people which

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.260 
comfortable photographing people which
may<00:02:49.430> be<00:02:49.510> why<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:51.080> developed<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.400> strategies

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
may be why I developed the strategies

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.810 
may be why I developed the strategies
that<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.720> use<00:02:54.170> actually<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:55.040> don't<00:02:55.190> have<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.670> get

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
that I use actually I don't have to get

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.510 
that I use actually I don't have to get
to<00:02:55.970> know<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.330> people<00:02:56.660> very<00:02:56.870> well

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
to know the people very well

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.740 
to know the people very well
sometimes<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.610> don't<00:02:58.670> know<00:02:58.850> them<00:02:59.090> at<00:02:59.180> all<00:02:59.360> or<00:02:59.720> I

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
sometimes I don't know them at all or I

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.620 
sometimes I don't know them at all or I
never<00:02:59.960> even<00:03:00.140> speak<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.680> them<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.160> never<00:03:02.000> hold

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
never even speak to them I never hold

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.830 
never even speak to them I never hold
the<00:03:02.840> camera<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.470> my<00:03:03.620> face<00:03:04.210> it's<00:03:05.210> almost<00:03:05.510> always

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
the camera to my face it's almost always

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.170 
the camera to my face it's almost always
on<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.170> tripod<00:03:06.730> at<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:08.240> position<00:03:08.780> which<00:03:09.200> would<00:03:09.380> be

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
on a tripod at a position which would be

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.950 
on a tripod at a position which would be
not<00:03:11.180> mine

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
not mine

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.350 
not mine
I<00:03:11.990> often<00:03:12.850> make<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.150> image<00:03:14.980> level<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.360> square

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
I often make the image level and square

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.380 
I often make the image level and square
to<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.840> camera<00:03:18.320> these<00:03:19.010> are<00:03:19.220> aspects<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:19.970> are

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
to the camera these are aspects that are

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.970 
to the camera these are aspects that are
similar<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.500> cinema<00:03:22.040> when<00:03:23.290> people<00:03:24.290> see<00:03:24.470> them<00:03:24.710> I

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
similar to cinema when people see them I

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.130 
similar to cinema when people see them I
think<00:03:25.430> they<00:03:25.700> often<00:03:26.150> associate<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:27.110> with

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
think they often associate it with

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.120 
think they often associate it with
cinema<00:03:27.770> and<00:03:29.260> therefore<00:03:30.260> think<00:03:30.710> that<00:03:30.920> there<00:03:31.100> is

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
cinema and therefore think that there is

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.530 
cinema and therefore think that there is
a<00:03:31.430> narrative<00:03:32.710> part<00:03:33.710> of<00:03:33.830> my<00:03:33.980> program<00:03:34.610> let's<00:03:35.240> say

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
a narrative part of my program let's say

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.510 
a narrative part of my program let's say
was<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:37.490> try<00:03:38.270> to<00:03:38.330> point<00:03:38.780> out<00:03:39.080> that<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.740> person's

their exterior appearance and to some
degree<00:03:49.570> life<00:03:50.570> is<00:03:50.870> is<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.200> performance

a<00:04:36.339> person's<00:04:37.339> interior<00:04:38.330> or<00:04:38.479> 'ti<00:04:38.719> is<00:04:39.939> very

I<00:05:06.410> think<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.830> Decorah<00:05:08.490> is<00:05:08.580> really

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
I think that Decorah is really

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.750 
I think that Decorah is really
interested<00:05:09.600> in<00:05:09.630> giving<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.560> viewer<00:05:10.890> a<00:05:11.160> great

the works to call show sets up a

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.080 
the works to call show sets up a

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090
