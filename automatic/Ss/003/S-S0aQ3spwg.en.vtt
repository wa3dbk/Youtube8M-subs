00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.710
 then and no time I do n't 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.960
 the videos promoted and rejected because 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.380
 I heard favorite videos making the video of 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.810
 more than a sprint I realized 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.390
 but that by excluding the products 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.340
 rejected in short and so I decided to 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.800
 make the two separate classic videos 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.779
 these will average the failed products 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.970
 because fortunately they are not many 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.250
 are more promoted but childbirth or immediately 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.989
 because I already have the third battery 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.449
 time, however, to do this video in turn 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.410
 systemic then starts with a super 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.750
 failed 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.220
 and it is this remover of prof 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.950
 I had taken it from carrefour maybe ve 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.940
 I had already shown it and it is one 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.230
 eye makeup remover tricks or scams 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.059
 biphasic is also written was like 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.010
 said by the makeup artist I don't know how it will pass 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.260
 this be recommended by someone 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.399
 because first of all it burns and then not 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.770
 I don't even have to pay for it myself 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.629
 normal skies makeup is mascara instead 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.509
 it is very difficult to remove with this 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.310
 therefore it must continue to download on 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.090
 race to explain why it hurts then 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.890
 super burned for practically it 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.830
 same reason I also do these targets 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.640
 in fairness of the readings are born 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.159
 though 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.950
 which contain the 95 from 100 i 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.500
 ingredients of natural origin are 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.450
 rejected because they burn so much 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.909
 this is really a huge solution 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.100
 and also here a remover power equal to 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.869
 then its zero use 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.420
 practically more like wipes 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.390
 refreshing what else why 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.729
 power on the song of the mind that is not yes 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.720
 they can use absolutely nothing 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:48.890
 a color more useless then to fail 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.759
 surely even the morning is senses 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.130
 nice studio 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.740
 I had done another white rose 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.600
 see an enthusiastic liam video 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.860
 initially because the effect was that 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.289
 that is, I wanted the fact that 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.450
 however long and seemed natural with 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.119
 a slightly fringed handle effect is 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.570
 slow and terrible because it spreads 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.789
 very bad and it is hard to dry yes 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.430
 Sbecca immediately surrender is not that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.459
 obviously I was expecting then 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.140
 the effect is what I would like 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.160
 definitely in this product then 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.160
 absolutely to be rejected 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.239
 then a year produced to reject this 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.049
 elevates sciacca enamel 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.160
 I must say that I tried to use 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.290
 the insertion said what is this body 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.730
 you can use it but mom you go 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.459
 forward always reads because it lasts 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.200
 very little is 70 ml of product and has 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.239
 a really low cost 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.860
 compared to my beloved sephora who 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.510
 actually I continued to 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.820
 buy back because it made me a lot 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.370
 I do n't like this because before 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.600
 all you have to do more passes for 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.940
 remove the enamel with the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.500
 glitter really very difficult to 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.209
 remove only with this while the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.790
 redemption level very well with that of 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.799
 sephora and then especially because the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.500
 sponge leaves the pieces then you 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.600
 find the sponge everywhere and 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.430
 now practically soak finger 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.950
 inside you find yourself said all colored 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.200
 there is then giving effort to remove it e 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.180
 then open to debt is super ubuntu is one 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.590
 terrible thing really super super 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.430
 super uto so i don't like is not the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.810
 product I was looking for here and then 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.880
 the last two products on youtube 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.070
 little products because I can't fail 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.450
 the inter that actually are not like that 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.840
 how bad this is mine is done 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.060
 to see 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.310
 but they left me a bit perplexed 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.989
 the first is the make up for ever to drive 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.620
 which I used a lot in 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.959
 this period 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.640
 however I can't say that I don't like it 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:47.100
 it is absolutely just that already being 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.620
 I thought in something more is a bronze 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.930
 which is very similar to the basic primer of 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.920
 elf which in any case costs a tenth 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.770
 compared to this and the consistency where it is 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.500
 the brush and the classic is slightly 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.000
 a tad more colorful than but not 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.280
 you are not even see a respect to 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.320
 that of f, however, when extended 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.100
 as unique and transparent 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.560
 I think it's the effect we say how it is 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.630
 he says pranger while but so right 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.190
 the base effect is stronger than that 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.860
 the one there surely however does not 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.169
 I'm going to form the fold and transparent 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.940
 like that of memories that ego that 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.640
 china board for tres not just own 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.380
 so sure that it will certainly not go 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:36.479
 buy it back to me 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.540
 would like to try the to face leaving 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.640
 in flight defacer instead of this one 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.320
 even though I prefer it 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.030
 use a prize that also goes 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.210
 even out the eyelid so I like it 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.250
 very much in iris even if it is actually 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.129
 a little too shepherd but I like it 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.800
 very 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:58.539
 the version of barney that for me maybe 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.539
 precisely because it informs a court between 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.360
 sure they would be many reds there and then or 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.099
 it is necessary first to form and then the last 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.080
 product that really made me 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.629
 stay very badly over time because 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.899
 initially I liked it and the lech trek 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:18.279
 by max which is eyeliner cruise line in gel 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:21.399
 that now our if I can do 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:23.669
 review that I realize that it is not 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:26.559
 just simple at this distance 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.089
 basically it got annoyed so I have to 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:30.249
 add a little bit of shocking 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.629
 inside and in my opinion there is a product 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:32.919
 these should have these 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.919
 subterfuge to be able to do it 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.110
 work without the case but above all 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.809
 it is no longer black in fact it has never been black 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.389
 black has always been a laugh I found 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:45.099
 however the right brush that is 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.959
 let's say I'm even getting by for 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.819
 regarding the drafting and its own 

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:51.159
 the effect that I do not like ie there is 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.169
 I'm even now but applying the doors 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:54.369
 of coke there but this is not black 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.129
 and like when you showed the 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:06:00.339
 comparison between the 0 and the perverse of roles 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:02.589
 which through black zero is gray gray 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:04.659
 black and this is the same thing and a 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:06.399
 gray black my opinion therefore 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:09.189
 I will probably take the one from lia 

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:10.539
 I feel that it seems a little bit more 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.329
 nice load 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.519
 it is not a fluid line I know if the pot is a 

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:17.709
 a little bit bigger now I don't remember either 

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:19.149
 what's your name or how much it costs though 

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:21.159
 honestly it seems a little bit more 

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.789
 valid to see the results if it was not beautiful 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.039
 intense 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.389
 if anyone found it advised against 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.550
 obviously tell you before doing 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:29.999
 this silver and simple piece vi 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.289
 recommended something else instead 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:33.810
 let me know what to be if not 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.190
 I like it 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.530
 I really know that someone will explain it 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.180
 ham nicolò to be the one of 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.490
 they don't like one nor the other have 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.550
 have the same effect as this 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.160
 our centers is to be if not 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.500
 I really like the texture and nothing 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.240
 advice of rejected products therefore 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.220
 certainly not many but I had to 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.370
 absolutely say not these products 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.530
 because in my opinion they are not valid 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.690
 to the exclusion of the 2 mirkos and nothing 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.580
 obviously let me know below 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.800
 what are your bocelli products 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:08.210
 maybe even with a video response 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.210
 a kiss to the next hello
