00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 there is a very strange demon a being 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.690
 scary that lives in our world but 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.480
 not in our dimension is called tarot 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.820
 in the ancient Kikapu natives they believed 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.830
 that all of us are beings in flesh 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.379
 and bone and we are destined to live 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.210
 between rocks and matter but there is a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.760
 be that can not be seen by our 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.859
 world and that this being can not be here 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.080
 could only be seen in dreams and in 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 visions of astral travel when the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.519
 mind was out of the matter the otn 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 is not a friendly being actually 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.140
 Suspect that he is responsible for 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.969
 many deaths and diseases otn not 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.160
 has form the otn is an entity 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.840
 independent that can see us but not 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.329
 it can be in the same plane as 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 have you ever looked at a 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.770
 mirror and you've seen how your face 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.379
 it seems unfamiliar the otn is there 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.480
 the mirrors show us a reflection 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.760
 of ourselves but likewise 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.219
 it can also be seen totem loitering 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.199
 out there the old KikapÃº believed that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.300
 is otn had no body and had no 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.010
 strength but in recent years it has 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.439
 presented a supernatural phenomenon 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.659
 thanks to the explosion of technology 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.700
 OTN is being trapped between 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.310
 careers of the physical world and barriers 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.170
 of the metaphysical world his body is 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.079
 thin and has the shape of torn clothes 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.240
 with hands and eyes the otn is not a being 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.429
 vengeful or a being that likes to kill 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.469
 however to those who cross 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.079
 on their way they inadvertently suffer horrible 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.819
 deaths we are all able to play a 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.649
 game counted ten and in this way 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.810
 find him the problem is that he 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.579
 he can also find you first 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.709
 you must find a mirror what 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.049
 big enough to fit your 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.599
 face in the reflection without cutting yourself 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.829
 hair or head when you have the mirror 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.319
 and you can find a room 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.659
 dark or a place with very little light 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.299
 you can start the game consists of 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.459
 three parties invocation containment and 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.289
 farewell at the invocation point 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.599
 You must look your eyes in front of 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.459
 front some believe that the eyes are the 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.950
 window that has the body to see 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.810
 our soul when you are looking at 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.759
 the eyes will notice that after about 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.009
 minutes your face will be deformed 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.409
 you will start to see different faces and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.019
 strangers this is normal and it's just a 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.910
 game of our unconscious if you're 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.630
 very suggestive you should not play anymore 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.060
 silos 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.130
 faces that start to scare you should 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.440
 look in the mirror staring at you 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.530
 the eyes nothing will happen to you while 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.760
 keep yourself looking at your eyes 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.500
 eventually you'll get tired and you're going to 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.990
 force you to look at your eyes more by 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.360
 will that by inertia quote or have 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.700
 decide to play with you then you will go to 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.950
 containment when you stare at 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.380
 your eyes you must be careful not to look 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.910
 Elsewhere you must look in your eyes 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.520
 until your reflection makes you a 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.800
 I blink your reflection will be a blink 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.900
 in front of you and maybe you'll think it's you 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.790
 imagination but for safety take it 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.370
 for fact before the slightest blink 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.080
 that you noticed that blinking did not go 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.480
 you was is or ten who made your 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.310
 reflection will flash in the game you will have 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.530
 passed to containment and from here 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.570
 it will depend how healthy you will finish the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.430
 containment is the most sinister part of 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.710
 all of you will not have noticed anything strange 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.320
 in your room and you will not have noticed either 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.840
 nothing in the environment but have already called you 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.220
 on the other side of the mirror from the moment 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.500
 that you wink this was it or have 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.510
 warning that you no longer belong to your world 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.080
 but you are already in the parallel of your 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.240
 world nothing is different everything is the same 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.340
 there are things upside down because you did not cross 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.410
 to an overturned world but crossed from 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.050
 world side ten now is playing 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.910
 seriously and for nothing in the world you should 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.160
 take out some part of your head from 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.860
 mirror the game consists of three things 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.290
 first you have to find tao ten 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.840
 he is hiding in that world that already 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.670
 you left that means you can only 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.100
 find it with the reflection of your 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.170
 mirror you have to walk all over the 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.240
 land that is around you and that 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.700
 could be visible with your mirror in the 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.250
 moment that I looked into your eyes you should 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.230
 find with the reflection tied have him 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.720
 it can only be found by his eyes 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.030
 somewhere around you he 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.250
 Hidden is waiting to see what the 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.650
 otn is very clever and is sometimes hidden in 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.540
 photographs replaced the eyes of 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.030
 photos for him and that way to 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.980
 You are harder to find when 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.020
 You think you have found it 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.790
 smile before the mirror you have to 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.700
 arm yourself with courage and make your look 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.650
 match that of the eyes of totten and 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.230
 you will have to look at those eyes again 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.450
 but for much longer this time 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.650
 will be huge and long the otn will know that what 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.810
 you found and treat 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.880
 to contain you you're going to feel a lot 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.220
 discomfort you will believe that next to you 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.620
 move people you will think that something else 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.539
 they are looking closely you will feel as if 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.090
 someone breathe for your new and all the 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.100
 world will be uncomfortable for you he is 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.139
 there is tempting you to review your 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.850
 side tries to make you look at fear 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.100
 try to get your eyes off of 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.320
 what you're doing over at him 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.930
 in the eyes is that you are returning to your 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.000
 world to our world actually its 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.830
 Eyes are the pass you're safe 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.229
 again but he does not want you to go 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.570
 He wants you to stay and get lost with 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.850
 him that's why now you feel cold in the 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.669
 hands and that's why every moment his eyes 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.560
 they feel heavier even when only 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.960
 you see his eyes we are sure that he 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.120
 you can see his expression on his face a 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.430
 valid and dead expression as if 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.010
 someone was defeated as if 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.020
 someone was dying the other 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.120
 will make you feel the worst chills and 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.669
 when you least expect it, your eyes will be 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.130
 in front of yours and you wink will make a 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.229
 again when you wink your eyes totem 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.720
 you will see that you are again in front of 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.390
 your eyes your eyes will be fine and it is 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.790
 normal feeling very tired 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.130
 now you just have to say goodbye to tao 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.610
 have when you wink your eyes last 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.500
 time 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.630
 You must fire yourself as you say goodbye 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.510
 someone with much admiration without closing 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.250
 the eyes does not matter as what matters 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.290
 is that you really do it with 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.600
 admiration as if you had beaten 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.640
 someone in a pela very hard the OTN 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.740
 it will go like this because you are already back in your 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.960
 world the funny thing about this is that there 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.970
 people who say they have not felt more 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.580
 of caution when saying goodbye and feel 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.710
 happy about this but there are people who 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.750
 when they say goodbye they realize 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.270
 that in his pupils you can still see a 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.680
 look inside the reflection of their 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.800
 eyes can see that face 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.880
 vanishing is fading 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.520
 slowly until they see nothing else 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.830
 some have seen in mirrors reflections of 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.170
 people or shadows there are even people 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.300
 they claim to have been in front of mirrors and see 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.580
 people looking at them directly from 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.770
 the mirror people who are not even 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.840
 in this place nobody has ever held 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.030
 look at one of the people there 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.730
 because when they look at them they get scared 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.980
 and the reaction is to flip when they try 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.750
 see again there's no one else some 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.790
 we believe that they are the people 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.280
 that they lost the game of ko ten and that 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.260
 they are challenging you now to play the only 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.600
 disadvantage is that there are many reflections 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.400
 in this world and they are getting more 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.880
 people who can see these 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.680
 reflections there looking at us some believe 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.810
 that when we wake up at night it's 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.420
 because someone is not looking from a 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.490
 reflection some others say that the 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.620
 reflections pull us to your world and it's 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.260
 when we feel that we fall into a dream 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.060
 but we wake up some more think that 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.550
 to be in touch with is doten 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.530
 it becomes hypersensitive to that cute some 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.169
 others believe that you are or you have a being nothing 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.940
 more without purpose and very few claim 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:19.190
 that when you see your face and you feel 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.600
 strange as if they did not recognize you for 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.550
 one second is that is was ten or 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.550
 watching you waiting for what games
