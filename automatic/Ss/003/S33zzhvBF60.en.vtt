00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.890
 Today I'll show you how to get one 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.200
 can rebuild battery 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.900
 this requires an acid solid 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.280
 vessel a small motor or a led 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.320
 which is then operated afterwards 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.269
 a copper plate and a few 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.430
 galvanized egl but the most important is 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.630
 I use the acid in my case 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.359
 but I still have sulfuric acid 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.710
 The first thing you have to do is earn the engine 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.480
 one-sided to the copper plate 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.090
 connected and on the other side 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.859
 The galvanized nails The nails are out 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.230
 space reasons have tightly wrapped but 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.700
 a large surface of the copper plates 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.989
 The nails are placed in the glass and 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.579
 should not touch 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.840
 because the current is about the engine 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.000
 drain and not by one 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.039
 short circuit and now the acid must 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.770
 sulfuric acid is important to dilute 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.559
 is very corrosive please try this 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.210
 Do not imitate sulfuric acid too 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.980
 First of all, you have to earn water in it 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.170
 be filled and then the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.489
 Sulfuric acid are added because 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.430
 the reaction with sulfuric acid and 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.019
 Water is very exotic one would water 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.699
 could protect in sulfuric acid 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.039
 the resulting heat is sulfuric acid 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.260
 squirt out of the glass and you can now 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.740
 Detecting the engine turns on what 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.140
 is that 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.330
 Zinc is base as copper and too 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.950
 basement as a hydrogen because of it 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.200
 sinks from the acid attack and leaves 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.060
 in solution 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.100
 one atom gives off two electrons 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.350
 and they flow over the power circuit 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.570
 through the engine on the copper side and 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.520
 There the ions of the acid are waiting 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.930
 to pick up the electrons and that 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.820
 also explains why gas bubbles here 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.920
 ascend as so often in chemistry 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.300
 here arises hydrogen the engine 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.040
 Unfortunately, it will stay because the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.800
 Contacts between the nails and the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.420
 were etched away and that with the 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.130
 Sulfuric acid really not to be joking 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.260
 is showing the following small tries 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.540
 I dive for a sock only completely 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.570
 briefly into the acid and this dissolves 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.010
 completely left on only one remains 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.900
 black viscous mass 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.360
 Visible remains the remains 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.480
 remaining carbon and the rest goes 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.070
 in solving and remember if you ask 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.200
 and suggestions I'm glad about 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.850
 your comments and do not forget 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.690
 subscribe so you do not have any of the others 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.690
