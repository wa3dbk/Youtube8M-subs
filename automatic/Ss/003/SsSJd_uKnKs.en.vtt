00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
you go into the video library it should

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.009 
you go into the video library it should
show<00:00:23.699> up<00:00:23.760> as<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> portable<00:00:24.420> device

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019

so Cheech and Chong up in smoke there we
go<00:00:39.090> what's<00:00:39.540> working<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:41.270> go<00:00:42.270> back<00:00:42.590> now<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
go what's working so go back now if it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.459 
go what's working so go back now if it
wasn't<00:00:44.430> working<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.629> wasn't<00:00:46.079> showing<00:00:46.260> up

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469

wasn't working so it wasn't showing up
play<00:00:46.770> clap<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> memory<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.520> it<00:00:50.520> should

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
play clap go to memory and it should

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.029 
play clap go to memory and it should
show<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.449> USB<00:00:51.809> storage<00:00:52.289> device<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
show up as USB storage device so you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.240 
show up as USB storage device so you
should<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.370> able<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.789> configure<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.500> if<00:00:55.500> well

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
should be able to configure it if well

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.479 
should be able to configure it if well
if<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.789> wanted<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.300> could<00:00:58.100> but<00:00:59.100> even<00:00:59.129> if

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
if you wanted to you could but even if

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.639 
if you wanted to you could but even if
it's<00:00:59.640> not<00:00:59.820> fat<00:01:00.090> feet<00:01:00.329> -<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> should<00:01:00.989> still<00:01:01.410> show

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it's not fat feet - it should still show

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
it's not fat feet - it should still show
up<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.390> if<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.750> correctly

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
up there and if it's not correctly

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.090 
up there and if it's not correctly
partition<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:06.960> over<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.590> my

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
partition so I'm going to go over to my

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.780 
partition so I'm going to go over to my
computer<00:01:08.930> sake<00:01:09.930> let's<00:01:10.860> say<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.040> buy<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
computer sake let's say I buy out of the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:21.510 
computer sake let's say I buy out of the
JTAG<00:01:13.400> plug<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> into<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.080> USB

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.990 

it<00:01:22.520> should<00:01:22.700> now<00:01:24.220> be<00:01:25.520> then

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
it should now be then

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.170 
it should now be then
mine's<00:01:26.720> formatted<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:27.950> both<00:01:29.259> 500<00:01:30.259> gig<00:01:31.090> full<00:01:32.090> PC

that's dead and I'm now on the same desk

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.070 
that's dead and I'm now on the same desk
it<00:02:15.769> should<00:02:15.890> have<00:02:16.069> unallocated<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.959> that

it should have unallocated and on that
same<00:02:18.319> amount<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.340> go<00:02:19.580> create<00:02:19.940> partition<00:02:20.720> and

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
same amount so go create partition and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.830 
same amount so go create partition and
then<00:02:21.140> where<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.349> says<00:02:21.760> create<00:02:22.760> house<00:02:23.060> make

then where it says create house make

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.930 
then where it says create house make
sure<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.079> says<00:02:24.230> primary<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.100> then<00:02:25.670> file

sure it says primary and then file

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.560 
sure it says primary and then file
system<00:02:26.420> path<00:02:26.630> 82<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.970> just<00:02:29.120> make<00:02:29.269> sure<00:02:29.299> it's

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
system path 82 you just make sure it's

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.500 
system path 82 you just make sure it's
taking<00:02:29.930> up<00:02:30.019> all<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.230> space<00:02:30.440> click<00:02:31.070> OK<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:32.269> I

taking up all the space click OK and I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.870 
taking up all the space click OK and I
should<00:02:32.690> do<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.959> for<00:02:33.109> you<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.500> then<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.549> click

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
should do it for you and then just click
