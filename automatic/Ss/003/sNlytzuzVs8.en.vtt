 a little the last ribs that 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.359
 I was buying and they gave me in 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.700
 the last four months if I do not 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.199
 I 'm wrong since March so that 's what 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.640
 I 'm going to show you now good 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.400
 starting with a gift that receives 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.009
 birthday are these jeans with 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.890
 little stars are golden stars and the 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.260
 jean has like a worn out shoes 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.360
 excellent is peach and the truth is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 that added a tone because I love it 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.430
 He loves how it looks with droplets 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.920
 fringes with buccaneers so much to go out 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.809
 the night like for a more casual outing 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.000
 and also peach has a fit of 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.030
 jeans that works for me perfect following 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.480
 with clothes I have this martina blouse 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.050
 trento 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.860
 and forward is like a silk and back 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.260
 It's made of cotton and has the little hands like 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.659
 sports we love it to be floral 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.210
 with a dark one because that makes it more 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.979
 winter and I love how it is with 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.420
 lipsticks because it enhances a 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.060
 heap another item that I love them 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.119
 show is this is a success of Sara that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.040
 it's very finite it's perfect for the days 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.420
 well mid- season and the good thing about 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.970
 Cesar is that it has very good prices 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.340
 for the quality that works then 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.100
 when cloud by buenos aires I said no 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.020
 I can not pass and this was added to my 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.750
 shopping cart and something else that I 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.759
 will compensate was this necklace with gift of 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.649
 my boyfriend this precious necklace ximo that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.590
 I still do not know but I imagine that 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.940
 vary excellent with a black dress 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.970
 smooth or with some shirt with print 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.500
 of phrase or something like that the truth 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.000
 is that I do not usually buy an accessory 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.520
 because as I have a 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.800
 accessories usually use what 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.760
 what do I do but this one seemed very 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.680
 different and very cute so like my 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.820
 boyfriend saw that I liked it said 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.820
 well I give it to you 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.450
 it really is beautiful good happening what 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.420
 which is footwear take advantage of the last 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.160
 hostel a few weeks ago and buy 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.380
 this droplet actually gave me my 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.739
 mom is a bag we do everything and wanted 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.030
 a bag that costs us very masculine 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.390
 let's say, it's something else 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.349
 delicate and I found in ricky sarkany 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.590
 This one is like suede nubuck 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.540
 and now that it is beautiful 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.540
 and it's not like it's pretty 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.160
 delicate and is more feminine as was the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.560
 Consell the valleys half the price 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.569
 so it was a super purchase and I already 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.489
 made a lot was practically 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.099
 amortized going on what the book is the 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.590
 last one I buy is this michelle 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.580
 bread that is a youtube once again 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.460
 important is I believe the world 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.890
 and the book is called makeup is in 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.170
 English and I bought it in Brazil the last 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.150
 Once I traveled because here the truth is 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.340
 that I did not hear it anywhere I think not 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.790
 you get it already I started to read the book 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.380
 I tell a bit of his biography and also 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.740
 makeup tips on how to have a 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.490
 much better skin and how to succeed 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.260
 in general in online life and offline to 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.300
 Although being in English is a very book 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.120
 easy to read I still have not finished it 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.950
 but even what I read I loved all the 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.870
 first part of his biography is very 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.720
 interesting so it's a book that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.709
 I recommend if you can get it be by 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.630
 some online store outside or if 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.880
 someone who travels can bring them is 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.430
 is very good another purchase edition 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.070
 brazil was this content umbrella 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.380
 drama that Brazilian brand launched a 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.780
 new line that is much cheaper and 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.670
 is as directed to teenagers and 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.500
 Well I brought this shady powder 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.630
 which is actually a pigment when I saw 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.320
 the color was fascinated because it has a 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.720
 brightness and a 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.880
 incredible so I brought it to me too 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.400
 because I had nothing like doing a 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.440
 weeks I was in an event of regina and 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.880
 I went to know the brand that the truth 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.160
 is that I did not know any product 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.200
 He knew the brand had heard 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.210
 of the brand let's say but there was never 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.740
 tried any product and good at 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.850
 event they gave me this red enamel 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.370
 I still do not use it but it seems very 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.290
 very nice and I heard good comments 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.240
 of the enamels of regina so I 'm going 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.890
 to try and then I will tell you one 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.990
 friend who went traveling in Europe I 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.340
 brought a lipstick from the Kiko brand that 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.080
 you know that I love it because 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.849
 all my tutorials sure if any 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.520
 product of that brand 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.929
 it seems to me that as I told you in another 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.449
 opportunity has very good 

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:43.029
 cost-benefit products are 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.209
 relatively inexpensive and they are very 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:50.320
 good and this time I brought a 

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:53.170
 lipstick crayon 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.960
 and it's from the new line of matte lipsticks 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.600
 that is creamy also the truth is that 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.840
 I really like the color is incredible is 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.880
 beautiful and very well applied in 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.510
 the lips and it is very easy to pass 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.190
 because being crayon is very easy 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.540
 to delimit the edge of the lips 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.040
 I understand that it is an edition 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.180
 limited 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.580
 this is the color 06 and it is a red 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.080
 well alive let's say a thin one that 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.660
 bought a few months ago is that I 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.380
 he liked a lot this is l'OrÃ©al which is the 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.419
 silk and if I cilic and if I do not know how to 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.229
 pronounces because to put those names so 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.120
 rare that every time it later becomes 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.759
 a little difficult the pronunciation 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.060
 this is a metallic navy blue and has 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.610
 very good duration is creamy but dry 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.810
 very fast then you have to work it 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.000
 very fast so as not to take the risk of 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.039
 stain happening to nature and I have the 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.550
 last two things to show you and you 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:54.460
 He finished first this crayon 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.070
 is a crayon shade of this new 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.039
 line that is something natural the sac launched 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.520
 actually it does very little and I chose 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:06.460
 this color that is the new and is beautiful and 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.830
 It also has good duration 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.169
 I have not had it that long, so I do not know 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.720
 only a couple of times but the truth 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.760
 is that it pigments well 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.400
 lasts quite a while on the eyelid 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.670
 without finally running another product from 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:27.190
 natural is this perfume of the line echoes 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:31.300
 and the flavor let's say the aroma is pitanga 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.790
 I will love the truth that is very cool and is 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.610
 quite soft is not a very scent 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.710
 invasive but it's a bit sweet like that 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.220
 that if you do not like the tones and 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:45.070
 tones if you do not like perfumes 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.960
 Fruit trees a bit sweet probably not 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.310
 this one is not going to like me 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.350
 I love it and that I do not like 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.030
 Very sweet perfumes good and that was it 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.240
 I hope you liked it as you saw 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.530
 it was short because they do not buy many things 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.840
 I hope in the comments what were 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.210
 his purchases and that of all this they liked 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.380
 more if you liked the video do not forget 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.150

 big 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:27.849
 all right
