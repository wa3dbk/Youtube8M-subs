00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:03.120
 in the waters sc 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.830
 first thing before starting 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.649
 I rubbed with bread gum 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.039
 on the drawing 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.839
 why 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.929
 because it's okay that in the lawsuit it's nice that 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:16.999
 drawing 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:21.460
 the pencil line can be seen below because everything must remain so 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.589
 beautiful l0 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:24.480
 but I'm sick 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.460
 weather that is too high I had it 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.699
 competition pelino loaded 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.930
 also because in any case my stroke is heavy I don't have a light stroke 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.629
 paper I am using 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.250
 despite being fine 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.800
 however quite gritty then the pencil stuck boys that yes 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.830
 inserts the results by ante into the paper grain 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.750
 and so I prefer to do this so they tamp it until now 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.350
 and then 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.710
 here you see the drop of hot water with the brush over all the water 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.040
 on the edge 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.880
 and now I start 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.030
 restaurant you won't see anything anymore 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.360
 I don't want to beg you 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.160
 because in short 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.310
 I don't know how else to do text I try to settle down well 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.640
 so I wet it well you have to be careful about getting wet quite well or ansi 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.900
 bathrooms 1 cap because in the meantime meaning 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.190
 this button, which is hotter, requires a moment for more time with this bike 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.270
 operation 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 and above all try to do it 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.120
 to exult evenly 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.960
 chickens not 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.240
 just be careful not to create pools of water on the sheet otherwise 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.930
 horrendous stains are created 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.690
 I take 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.300
 following the pictures which not blocked the first train a 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.090
 lung. I look like a Mongolian, don't speak today in a bit of gray 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.830
 because the adige background begins to post it 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.579
 as you always see 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.209
 toritto 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.209
 very very dark 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.139
 and so so but on this gray 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.030
 practically 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.030
 the background is almost all gray 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.120
 because I suppose it is a side wall with the d 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.719
 behind salamone behind the girl and then I don't even think she is a model 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.609
 to be honest 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:54.779
 I think it is 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.779
 just a normal girl 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.549
 there 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.549
 I'm very leggerina with this gray because 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.679
 no trying to maintain 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.689
 a consistency with the photo 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.389
 more than I canon photo 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.799
 to this gray behind but is a gray the head metello metello metello metello 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.919
 if you are an exception for a couple of 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.869
 of points 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:49.119
 pro
