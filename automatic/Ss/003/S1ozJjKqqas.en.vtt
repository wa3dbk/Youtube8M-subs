00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.620 

really<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:44.280> where<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> problems<00:01:45.180> start

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690 
really that's where the problems start
for<00:01:45.900> tactical<00:01:46.470> command<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.310> move<00:01:47.520> your

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
for tactical command you move your

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
for tactical command you move your
characters<00:01:48.119> by<00:01:48.330> tapping<00:01:48.810> them<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.229> then

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
characters by tapping them and then

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.289 
characters by tapping them and then
tapping<00:01:49.770> an<00:01:50.009> area<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.520> them<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.850> move<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
tapping an area for them to move to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.260 
tapping an area for them to move to
that's<00:01:51.780> fine<00:01:52.140> when<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.040> works<00:01:53.310> problem<00:01:54.090> is

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that's fine when it works problem is

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.690 
that's fine when it works problem is
sometimes<00:01:54.869> doesn't<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.100> tap<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.549> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
sometimes doesn't you can tap all you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.280 
sometimes doesn't you can tap all you
want<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.330> command<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.810> doesn't<00:01:58.170> work

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
want but the command just doesn't work

sometimes<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.040> even<00:01:59.340> when<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.549> does<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.390> just

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
sometimes and even when it does it just

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.710 
sometimes and even when it does it just
feels<00:02:00.810> clunky<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.890> slow<00:02:02.610> fact<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.330> good<00:02:03.509> deal

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
feels clunky and slow fact a good deal

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.899 
feels clunky and slow fact a good deal

is<00:02:19.019> so<00:02:19.230> far<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.400> combat<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.180> looks

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
is so far out the combat just looks

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.240 
is so far out the combat just looks
really<00:02:21.840> unimpressive<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.950> kind<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.160> like

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
really unimpressive it's kind of like

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.370 
really unimpressive it's kind of like
you're<00:02:23.310> watching<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.970> little<00:02:24.480> miniature<00:02:25.170> works

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
you're watching a little miniature works

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.530 
you're watching a little miniature works
for<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.560> tank<00:02:25.800> destroyed<00:02:26.280> shoot<00:02:26.730> water<00:02:27.030> or

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
for the tank destroyed shoot water or

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.380 
for the tank destroyed shoot water or
something

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.059 

the<00:02:33.050> game<00:02:33.200> doesn't<00:02:33.410> look<00:02:33.650> very<00:02:33.680> good<00:02:33.920> either

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
the game doesn't look very good either

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.040 
the game doesn't look very good either
and<00:02:34.550> that's<00:02:34.819> another<00:02:35.150> area<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.569> which<00:02:35.720> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
and that's another area in which the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.350 
and that's another area in which the
camera<00:02:36.500> doesn't<00:02:36.770> help<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:37.910> just<00:02:38.090> it

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
camera doesn't help it really just it

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.570 
camera doesn't help it really just it
shows<00:02:38.600> how<00:02:38.870> barren<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.530> landscapes<00:02:40.100> are<00:02:40.340> and

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
shows how barren the landscapes are and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.100 
shows how barren the landscapes are and
even<00:02:40.640> though<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:40.940> see<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.240> lot<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.750> levels

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
even though you see a lot of the levels

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.960 
even though you see a lot of the levels
you<00:02:42.590> somehow<00:02:42.800> never<00:02:43.100> feel<00:02:43.400> like<00:02:43.580> you've<00:02:43.760> got<00:02:43.790> a

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
you somehow never feel like you've got a

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.360 
you somehow never feel like you've got a
good<00:02:44.240> angle<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:45.080> mean<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:46.040> isn't<00:02:46.340> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
good angle I mean this this just isn't a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.670 
good angle I mean this this just isn't a
very<00:02:46.490> user<00:02:46.819> friendly<00:02:46.940> game<00:02:47.540> now<00:02:48.440> if<00:02:48.500> you're

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
very user friendly game now if you're

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.090 
very user friendly game now if you're
really<00:02:49.040> into<00:02:49.520> strategy<00:02:50.180> games<00:02:50.450> or<00:02:50.840> max<00:02:51.530> you

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
really into strategy games or max you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100 
really into strategy games or max you
might<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.459> able<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.730> see<00:02:52.880> past<00:02:53.090> its<00:02:53.450> issues<00:02:53.840> but

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
might be able to see past its issues but

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.949 
might be able to see past its issues but
even<00:02:54.530> then<00:02:54.770> I<00:02:55.040> mean<00:02:55.520> it's<00:02:56.180> decent<00:02:56.840> at<00:02:56.930> best

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
even then I mean it's decent at best

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.229 
even then I mean it's decent at best
they're<00:02:57.830> probably<00:02:58.070> better<00:02:58.400> options<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
they're probably better options in the

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.870 
they're probably better options in the
app<00:02:59.360> store<00:02:59.390> with<00:02:59.959> bigger<00:03:00.320> explosions<00:03:01.190> than

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
app store with bigger explosions than

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.170 
app store with bigger explosions than

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
mechwarrior tactical command huh finally

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.860 
mechwarrior tactical command huh finally
we're<00:03:05.780> seeing<00:03:06.110> some<00:03:06.380> real<00:03:06.680> action<00:03:07.720> that's<00:03:08.720> the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
we're seeing some real action that's the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.710 
we're seeing some real action that's the
last<00:03:09.050> one<00:03:09.290> let's<00:03:09.739> get<00:03:09.890> out<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.070> here<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.720> wonder

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
last one let's get out of here I wonder

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.300 
last one let's get out of here I wonder
how<00:03:11.840> long<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.200> will<00:03:12.290> take<00:03:12.350> them<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.680> realize<00:03:12.950> we

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
how long it will take them to realize we

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.490 
how long it will take them to realize we
blew<00:03:13.489> up<00:03:13.580> all<00:03:13.730> their<00:03:13.880> stuff<00:03:14.290> nice<00:03:15.290> work
