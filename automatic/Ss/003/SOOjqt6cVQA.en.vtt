opponent's side you know but now with
protein<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.120> easily<00:00:36.690> abuse<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> fact

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that it has good attack it gets powerup

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
least on the special side it's crazy

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.010

good special defense even without

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.190 
good special defense even without
investment<00:00:46.789> so<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.850> thought<00:00:48.059> ok<00:00:48.329> let's<00:00:48.539> give<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
investment so I thought ok let's give it

priority<00:01:02.850> attacks<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.719> actually<00:01:04.650> thought

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
priority attacks now I actually thought

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.679 
priority attacks now I actually thought
would<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:05.400> pointless<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.090> both

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
would be a bit pointless to have both

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.630 
would be a bit pointless to have both
shadow<00:01:06.990> sneak<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.439> Sucker<00:01:07.830> Punch<00:01:07.920> originally

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
shadow sneak and Sucker Punch originally

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.450 
shadow sneak and Sucker Punch originally
but<00:01:09.200> you'd<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.380> surprised<00:01:10.860> even<00:01:11.100> though<00:01:11.280> they

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
but you'd be surprised even though they

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770 
but you'd be surprised even though they
hit<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> same<00:01:11.970> sort<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> type<00:01:12.420> super

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
hit the same sort of type super

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
hit the same sort of type super
effectively<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> definitely<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.939> some

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060

with<00:01:21.840> protein<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.439> become<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.100> particular

to<00:01:26.729> priority<00:01:27.530> type<00:01:28.530> change<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.070> definitely<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
to priority type change is definitely a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.670 
to priority type change is definitely a
good<00:01:29.610> advantage<00:01:30.320> recovers<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.470> just

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
good advantage recovers there just

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.190 
good advantage recovers there just
because<00:01:31.920> kecleon<00:01:32.340> gets<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.720> guess

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
because kecleon gets it and it's I guess

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109 
because kecleon gets it and it's I guess
nice<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.979> option<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.490> recover<00:01:35.909> back

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
nice to have the option to recover back

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.090 
nice to have the option to recover back
some<00:01:36.329> light<00:01:36.509> bulb<00:01:36.750> damage<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.770> you've<00:01:37.950> been

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
some light bulb damage if you've been

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.940 
some light bulb damage if you've been
stalled<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.729> or<00:01:38.939> something<00:01:39.360> by<00:01:39.710> some<00:01:40.710> big

defensive<00:01:41.460> wall<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.320> good

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
defensive wall and it's really good

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.139 
defensive wall and it's really good
because<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.920> keep<00:01:44.250> powerup<00:01:44.729> punching

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
because you can keep powerup punching

easily do some pretty big damage to a

easily do some pretty big damage to a

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.399 
team like get a couple of powerup
punches<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.930> life<00:01:58.110> orb

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.209 
punches up and with that life orb
protein<00:01:59.329> on<00:02:00.329> top<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.689> having<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
protein on top of having you know a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.249 
protein on top of having you know a
really<00:02:02.909> wide<00:02:03.270> spectrum<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.869> moves<00:02:04.110> available

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
really wide spectrum of moves available

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.100 
really wide spectrum of moves available
like<00:02:04.829> even<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.579> wanted<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.810> could<00:02:06.930> run

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
like even if you wanted to you could run

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
like even if you wanted to you could run
a<00:02:07.140> special<00:02:07.380> set<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.890> gets<00:02:08.069> nice<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.459> clot<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
a special set it gets nice to clot and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
a special set it gets nice to clot and
it<00:02:08.879> gets<00:02:09.060> all<00:02:09.239> these<00:02:09.420> different<00:02:10.020> special

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
it gets all these different special

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.290 
it gets all these different special
moves<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.160> think<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:11.970> best<00:02:12.120> way

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
moves but I think this is the best way

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.080 
moves but I think this is the best way
to<00:02:12.330> do<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.050> some<00:02:13.260> serious<00:02:13.500> damage

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
to do it it can do some serious damage

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.309 
to do it it can do some serious damage

here's a clip right here I'm recycling

here's a clip right here I'm recycling
this<00:02:16.650> from<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.920> game<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.160> had<00:02:17.400> earlier<00:02:17.760> which<00:02:18.060> I

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
this from a game I had earlier which I

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.530 
this from a game I had earlier which I
uploaded<00:02:19.220> blaziken's<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.700> destroys<00:02:21.209> my

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
uploaded blaziken's in it destroys my

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.860 
uploaded blaziken's in it destroys my
goth<00:02:22.050> eternal<00:02:22.470> unfortunately<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:24.780> know

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
goth eternal unfortunately and you know

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.650 
goth eternal unfortunately and you know
I<00:02:24.900> guess<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.379> was<00:02:25.500> before<00:02:26.120> Blaziken<00:02:27.150> like

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
I guess this was before Blaziken like

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.720 
I guess this was before Blaziken like
people<00:02:28.260> don't<00:02:28.379> really<00:02:28.560> use<00:02:28.650> Blaziken<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:29.459> but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
people don't really use Blaziken now but

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.820 
people don't really use Blaziken now but
this<00:02:30.569> was<00:02:30.750> right<00:02:30.959> at<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> start<00:02:31.440> when<00:02:31.590> people

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
this was right at the start when people

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.460 
this was right at the start when people
just<00:02:32.010> use<00:02:32.160> their<00:02:32.310> anything<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.200> go<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.349> that

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
just use their anything so go for that

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.500 
just use their anything so go for that
shadow<00:02:34.680> sneak<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.160> thought<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:36.060> might<00:02:36.300> be<00:02:36.330> a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
shadow sneak I thought it might be a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.150 
shadow sneak I thought it might be a
pure<00:02:36.750> special<00:02:37.170> attacker<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:37.680> then<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.980> thought

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
pure special attacker but then I thought

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.820 
pure special attacker but then I thought
well<00:02:38.819> actually<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.180> doesn't<00:02:39.420> really<00:02:39.510> get

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
well actually it doesn't really get

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.460 
well actually it doesn't really get
reliable<00:02:40.830> fighting<00:02:41.640> type<00:02:41.879> special<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.569> it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
reliable fighting type special so it

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.470 
reliable fighting type special so it
probably<00:02:43.620> has<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:43.980> hjk<00:02:44.640> as<00:02:44.790> well<00:02:44.970> maybe<00:02:45.330> it's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
probably has like hjk as well maybe it's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.570 
probably has like hjk as well maybe it's
a<00:02:45.510> mixed<00:02:45.810> set<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.129> definitely<00:02:47.400> works

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
a mixed set and that definitely works

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.979 
a mixed set and that definitely works
out<00:02:47.849> because<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.120> turned<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.420> ghost<00:02:48.540> alive<00:02:48.840> I

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
out because I turned it ghost alive I

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.720 
out because I turned it ghost alive I
avoid<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.500> high<00:02:49.590> jump<00:02:49.860> kick<00:02:49.890> he<00:02:50.310> damages

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
avoid the high jump kick he damages

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.940 
avoid the high jump kick he damages
himself<00:02:51.150> in<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.330> process<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.830> is

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
himself in the process and this is

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.589 
himself in the process and this is
before<00:02:53.099> I<00:02:53.280> got<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.519> life<00:02:53.700> orb<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.239> case<00:02:54.450> you're

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
before I got the life orb in case you're

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.880 
before I got the life orb in case you're
wondering<00:02:54.690> otherwise<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.410> would<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.709> just

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
wondering otherwise I would have just

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.550 
wondering otherwise I would have just
straight<00:02:56.220> killed<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:56.610> from<00:02:56.760> there

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
straight killed it from there

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.690 
straight killed it from there
but<00:02:58.560> take<00:02:58.739> out<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.890> Blaziken<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.550> is

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
but take out the Blaziken that is

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.330 
but take out the Blaziken that is
absolutely<00:03:00.180> sweet<00:03:00.959> now<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:01.890> comes<00:03:02.159> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
absolutely sweet now in comes the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.449 
absolutely sweet now in comes the
Alakazam<00:03:03.379> given<00:03:04.379> that<00:03:04.409> the<00:03:04.650> Blaziken<00:03:05.220> didn't

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
Alakazam given that the Blaziken didn't

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.399 
Alakazam given that the Blaziken didn't
mega<00:03:05.640> evolve<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.690> would<00:03:06.840> expect<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.349> thing

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
mega evolve you would expect this thing

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.619 
mega evolve you would expect this thing
to<00:03:07.620> be<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.890> mega<00:03:08.159> evolution<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.030> what<00:03:09.510> do<00:03:09.569> you

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
to be the mega evolution and what do you

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.350 
to be the mega evolution and what do you
know<00:03:09.780> yes<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.849> but<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:11.909> great<00:03:12.060> thing<00:03:12.120> is

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
know yes it is but the great thing is

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.970 
know yes it is but the great thing is
that<00:03:12.510> like<00:03:12.659> I<00:03:12.720> said<00:03:12.840> cake<00:03:13.170> Leon<00:03:13.440> has<00:03:13.560> such<00:03:13.769> good

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
that like I said cake Leon has such good

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.399 
that like I said cake Leon has such good
natural<00:03:14.280> special<00:03:14.909> defensive<00:03:15.360> bulk<00:03:15.599> not

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
natural special defensive bulk not

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.160 
natural special defensive bulk not
physical<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:16.920> definitely<00:03:17.430> special

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
physical but definitely special

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.570 
physical but definitely special
it<00:03:19.170> can<00:03:19.319> easily<00:03:19.409> take<00:03:19.590> any<00:03:19.920> single<00:03:20.159> here<00:03:20.430> from

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
it can easily take any single here from

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.630 
it can easily take any single here from
this<00:03:20.730> guy<00:03:21.110> even<00:03:22.110> given<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.400> know<00:03:23.430> it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
this guy even given the you know it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.600 
this guy even given the you know it
traces<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.120> protein<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:25.409> a<00:03:25.739> ghost<00:03:26.040> type<00:03:26.310> from

traces the protein and a ghost type from

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.690 
traces the protein and a ghost type from

just<00:03:40.590> cuz<00:03:40.709> I've<00:03:40.830> max<00:03:41.099> HP<00:03:41.569> that<00:03:42.569> in<00:03:42.780> my<00:03:42.900> opinion

just cuz I've max HP that in my opinion
is<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.560> way<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.739> go<00:03:44.040> but

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
is the way to go but

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.480 
is the way to go but
guess<00:03:45.260> if<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.710> really<00:03:45.740> feel<00:03:46.130> like<00:03:46.190> having

guess if you really feel like having
speed<00:03:46.910> investment<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.630> go<00:03:47.780> for<00:03:47.990> it<00:03:48.610> and

that's it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.210 
that's it

you know power up punching and get some

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.230 
you know power up punching and get some
serious<00:03:58.280> damage<00:03:58.430> off<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.910> sucker<00:03:59.150> punch

you<00:03:59.540> really<00:03:59.870> see<00:04:00.020> how<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:00.350> set<00:04:00.560> can<00:04:00.740> actually

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
you really see how this set can actually

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.380 
you really see how this set can actually
be<00:04:01.100> pretty<00:04:01.610> damn<00:04:01.820> effective<00:04:03.040> so<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.460> doubt<00:04:05.180> it's

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
be pretty damn effective so I doubt it's

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.390 
be pretty damn effective so I doubt it's
gonna<00:04:05.540> be<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:06.440> know<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.560> big<00:04:06.890> threat<00:04:07.190> in<00:04:07.310> the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
gonna be you know a big threat in the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.040 
gonna be you know a big threat in the
higher<00:04:07.550> tiers<00:04:07.850> I<00:04:08.150> think<00:04:08.330> at<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.570> moment<00:04:08.720> it's

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
higher tiers I think at the moment it's

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.190 
higher tiers I think at the moment it's
sort<00:04:09.320> of<00:04:09.580> top<00:04:10.580> end<00:04:10.610> you<00:04:11.030> may<00:04:11.300> be<00:04:11.360> low<00:04:11.660> are<00:04:11.960> you

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
sort of top end you may be low are you

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.220 
sort of top end you may be low are you
sore<00:04:12.470> level<00:04:13.120> which<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.510> know<00:04:14.630> is<00:04:14.750> reasonable

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
sore level which you know is reasonable

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.720 
sore level which you know is reasonable
I<00:04:15.350> can<00:04:15.500> see<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.710> settling<00:04:16.130> in<00:04:16.250> sort<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.520> higher

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
I can see it settling in sort of higher

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.720 
I can see it settling in sort of higher
