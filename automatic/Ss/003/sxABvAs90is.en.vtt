that I'm killing all those dudes you
know<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.600> they<00:04:05.690> might<00:04:05.840> be<00:04:05.959> seeing<00:04:06.230> their<00:04:06.380> guys

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
know and they might be seeing their guys

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.470 
know and they might be seeing their guys
drop<00:04:06.860> around<00:04:07.010> them<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.489> they're<00:04:08.150> looking<00:04:08.269> up

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
drop around them and they're looking up

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.199 
drop around them and they're looking up
at<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:09.310> they're<00:04:10.310> looking<00:04:10.549> up<00:04:10.640> at<00:04:10.760> their<00:04:10.910> radar

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
at the they're looking up at their radar

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.310 
at the they're looking up at their radar
trying<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.480> figure<00:04:11.720> out<00:04:11.750> what's<00:04:11.930> going<00:04:11.989> on<00:04:12.260> and

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
trying to figure out what's going on and

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.470 
trying to figure out what's going on and
can't<00:04:13.310> see<00:04:13.459> me<00:04:13.579> because<00:04:13.760> I<00:04:13.790> got<00:04:13.850> that<00:04:14.060> silencer

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
can't see me because I got that silencer

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.390 
can't see me because I got that silencer
I<00:04:14.510> think<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:14.900> really<00:04:15.079> helps<00:04:15.410> out<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.070> used

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
I think that really helps out so I used

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.029 
I think that really helps out so I used
it<00:04:16.579> on<00:04:16.870> almost<00:04:17.870> all<00:04:18.049> my<00:04:18.229> classes<00:04:18.500> other<00:04:18.890> than

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
it on almost all my classes other than

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.219 
it on almost all my classes other than
sniper<00:04:19.850> class<00:04:20.320> because<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.500> just<00:04:21.530> blows<00:04:21.890> but

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
sniper class because that just blows but

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.779 
sniper class because that just blows but
so<00:04:24.229> cranes<00:04:24.500> was<00:04:25.160> supposed<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.520> have<00:04:25.640> this
