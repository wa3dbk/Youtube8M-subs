00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello and welcome to a littel show 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.259
 and what we show you today 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.599
 we'll show you a castle today 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.190
 especially for the built in which place and 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.859
 Although werth had worked on it 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.650
 Of course, and the marius is there 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.300
 sometimes even breakfast wasserburg 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.510
 say yes the castle so is the to 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.490
 rehearsal sentence is now out of two ring 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.330
 but the outer one was here with two 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.279
 leading roles 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.899
 Therefore , the inner choice of the number live 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.010
 has two gates and the bergfried 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.680
 burgfried so where we then ours 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.250
 Armory exactly this castle the trade 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.730
 built 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.950
 after the first with the disappointing 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.270
 the server does not end up with us anymore 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.520
 The server is no longer involved 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.640
 we've got one now 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.750
 a goal made much smaller castle 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.020
 clearly arranged clearly arranged 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.600
 exactly 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.210
 and yes I have the server too 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.830
 stabilized in which I first the the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.049
 drobs from the zombies and so arranged 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.290
 have that as borat is no more 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.460
 so has been so big and yes the server 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.590
 now has four gigabytes of ram 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.320
 So I can get assured 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.540
 that we will last a little longer 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.159
 not like the last time it was like this 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.750
 abruptly that ends sometime the server 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.970
 no longer join in this we do 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.619
 please be a bit taken care of and 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.920
 This energy keeps up, too 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920
 longer 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.340
 We are now also pointing to the construction 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.140
 So we will first have the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.500
 First thing the zombies overcome 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.960
 there must be these cobwebs that is 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.310
 extremely so that we are getting the extreme 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.159
 and then we have the soul centers 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.110
 slows down one more time the submarine 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.540
 but come had enough time to when 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.040
 I would say if you were the exact one 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.320
 only when I reach as a firing 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.619
 big waves are you getting money now yes 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.530
 Exactly and then they have to get this one 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.149
 A way over this moat here 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.409
 tracks 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.390
 she played first time over 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.430
 sneak those are with us yes 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:15.360
 state enemy number one and then have to 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.030
 passing through a 2 blog or two 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.040
 know that more 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.450
 it depends on the main house 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.160
 a bit stronger but the normal one 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.340
 another two here is just a blog well 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.720
 no matter 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.080
 you have to get away with it then 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.080
 to warn 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.819
 and yes, up here on the boy doing that 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.330
 defense case not me 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.500
 Of course, shoot away quite comfortably 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.450
 by the way, we play without big circumstances 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.410
 with the same moz as last time 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.000
 so if deep a clear then here in 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.810
 which place itself also clear and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.730
 Of course our alberta meppen spot the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.739
 We also use bars sap 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.000
 So who has to convince us it 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.580
 sometimes with the plants times tried 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.930
 but that was just too easy 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.000
 on the left, the left ones are actually know 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.900
 and in the video description its like 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.370
 in the other videos house right so 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.600
 to use the buttons power too 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.329
 will be discovered later 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.060
 behemoth eyes look exactly i think 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.140
 Let's take the inner ring 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.200
 survey 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.370
 So exactly who is when the fans 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.680
 really that's how far you are 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.610
 We always conquer the first ring 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.540
 a second ring exactly and that 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:39.180
 Of course it is also by a piste 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:41.280
 the make is actually relative 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.769
 unspectacular is really just 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.209
 then you can sing another song as well 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.780
 go quite formidable high on the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.840
 defense wall and then stop in the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.160
 first race shoot right and now 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.160
 Let's go on to the burgfried 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.620
 secured here with a normal one now 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.940
 I guess if it's something else 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.580
 by the way, that's the way to think of it 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.819
 two blocks thick so two blocks 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.819
 Families because I go through quite quickly 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.780
 Play World has the wrong here 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.790
 I had to set that is completely funny 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.699
 the educated ones can do that big 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.590
 But things are so big blocks 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.120
 then with boxes it is overwhelmed well 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.970
 we keep going up here 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.850
 We also in the warehouse 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.130
 if the lower one is taken exactly 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.370
 right and then let's go to the motto 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.960
 elevator so use the brothel 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.310
 weather because as I said problems with the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.289
 ladders are still not fixed 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.990
 we really do not know why 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:58.300
 get my world from above you can then 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.820
 watch everything and from it about the 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:06.400
 stairs had to go and you come here 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:10.050
 then a next time through there again 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.050
 Extra protection is through metal fences 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:20.050
 is unbelievable that's yes we are 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.460
 already have a little value on design 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.990
 laid as the seed browser should stop 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.979
 that's how I want to portray that 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.979
 one recognizes also quite well or 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.889
 and what's great about it 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.020
 say people that were so far now the 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.240
 main aspects of our castle here 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.979
 Will definitely be the cd 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.139
 even if they rattle off a lot 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.120
 is smaller and much clearer and 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.979
 this would have to the now much 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.130
 better with we have no 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.080
 water in it this time, the need to the extreme 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.169
 pulls down and no lava me 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.410
 Guess if you say yes that's what we got 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.580
 So, here's the last thing you like 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.410
 will likely that let's play fun 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.180
 probably one day after 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.400
 We've been worth the video from here 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.990
 then we will probably do this 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.909
 castle a bit tune so well 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.990
 with spiders who spin even more 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.840
 cobweb 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.700
 Ice under the center still makes 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.830
 slower and then maybe that too 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.300
 fitch is a bit over the top 1 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.680
 but well but if you like it 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.060
 my goodness and then we will 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.180
 probably also a ukas filling 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:27.940
 into the wall a 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:31.240
 we do have to be a receptive 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.810
 without the unis generated because that's easy 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.720
 is more convenient and yes if you like the video 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.770
 then please give us a like and 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.040
 if you want to see more of us 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:46.200
 You also subscribe to us, of course 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:50.290
 Charge, of course, everything for free 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.270
 and write us constructive criticism 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.950
 because we can watch with videos 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.680
 do not do anything when he writes that 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.690
 and that was wrong then we do that 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.360
 so and I would say maybe see 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.040
 us then in the next video introduces me 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.260
 convinced especially the north let's play 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.740
 exactly 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.740
 we're glad
