00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.640
 about that then good then let me 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.050
 all your good vibes let's start 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000
 on this day and we're going to need 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.600
 materials that I think we have all in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.030
 house as discs prints some 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.690
 sachets and things like that so why are we going 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.170
 to see how it is done 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.470
 but today we are going to need enamel let's go 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.420
 to need scissors discs and some 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.509
 impressions of the groups that we like 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.659
 and paper or something to cover the area in 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:18.880
 where are we going to paint and well we are going to 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:23.299
 place the discs in the form rather 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.979
 since they are as parents and we are going to 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.909
 apply them good as to give strokes 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.830
 of enamel to make it look like more 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.780
 hardcore the matter 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.060
 and then until they are as good as 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.370
 stained and as you like collados leaves 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.620
 dry and let's see what else 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.110
 and so where are you with all the colors that 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.030
 we want to put it on our disk and 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.790
 good since nothing I put purple pink and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.200
 black and I was very father and I tell you all 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.900
 that my relative of the dike is going to see 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.230
 super good and after that we're going to 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.760
 do several I did six so good 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.600
 you can do what you need 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.600
 those who like 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.840
 then we are going to cut out the images of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.700
 I work a lot for these names 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.679
 they announced doing this type of videos 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.480
 but let's cut out the images of 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.120
 the bands or favorite groups that we 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.110
 like and there give like part of palette 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.780
 but if we cut back and now yes since the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.910
 let's go let's go to the wall where 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.890
 we would like to put the we are going to hang 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.290
 the way you want with 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.660
 nails with tacks with what you 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.079
 have now that we have them all 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.110
 placed we are going to paste the logo of the 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.470
 band on appointment downstairs where you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.630
 see what is left and this can be all 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.329
 It's not that complicated because it's too long 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.180
 very nice it gives a very father style and 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.879
 well here I put the yes says 15 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.220
 cÃ³rdobas and why it seems like 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.810
 what is that but I do not know I like it very much 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.560
 this day the same and you tell me what is 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.720
 the favorite in the part of just 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.550
 and this the truth is pretty good and 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.410
 begin in my life and cool favorite and the 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.410
 I really liked it a lot earlier 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.430
 and we will need you 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.230
 glue on the rise 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.000
 some magnets that we have in boxes 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.520
 little ones or big ones that you 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.350
 have and pins this is for 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.220
 organize the pins that you already know that 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.260
 we always lose women 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.380
 so then what we are going to do is 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.600
 put the glue and let's put it on 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.970
 the mirror or on the side where we want 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.800
 paste the magnets so that the 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.650
 pins and you can imagine that it's going to 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.530
 happen let's paste the magnets as you 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.560
 I say where you like idea and 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.200
 that would be box and we put the pins and 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.910
 because obviously they will stay there so 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.050
 It looks very nice and it's a way to 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.050
 organize it is very fast 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.310
 so we 're going to need accessories 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.070
 bracelets or things that we already need 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.840
 fix that they will be more flirtatious and we're going 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.180
 to need one of these that I do not know how 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.270
 what they are called but I know they are like 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.010
 kitchen utensils to hang them and 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.930
 We are going to hang our accessories and 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.570
 things that we have and this is father 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.820
 because it turns so it's nice 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.680
 but well after this we're going to go 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.890
 with the next one and we're going to need a 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.930
 bag that you have at home and 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.940
 we're going to hit it with bedbugs in some 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.030
 side of our room and we can save 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.550
 that if the control of the tele lens or what 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.840
 that you want and with the following 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.540
 same day we will need the queue of 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.490
 one of a soda and we're going to burn what 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.210
 from above nothing else so that it is not like 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.520
 how sharp and we put little things 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.770
 I put some things for my collection of 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.810
 makeup and now we go connective 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.390
 be a few baskets that get them in 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.400
 any side I have always seen them and 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.290
 we are going to need some accessories 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.480
 to decorate and the only thing we're going to 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.780
 do is place the 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.880
 mom choir and name but instead of 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.280
 place it here to place it down 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.630
 and I put a gerber I put a droplet 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.910
 with my friend and I put a jack and I 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.120
 perfumes up and looks pretty flirtatious 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.449
 is 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.910
