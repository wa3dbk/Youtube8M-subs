can be broken down in a pretty simple
way<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.780> break<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> down<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.590> this

four<00:00:54.449> steps<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> remember<00:00:56.489> those

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
four steps in the way I remember those

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.119 
four steps in the way I remember those
four<00:00:57.000> steps<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.710> deal<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
four steps is that when we deal with a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.610 
four steps is that when we deal with a
fear<00:00:59.460> we're<00:00:59.640> getting<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.210> prize<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> end<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
fear we're getting a prize at the end of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
fear we're getting a prize at the end of
it<00:01:01.770> we're<00:01:01.949> expanding<00:01:02.340> into<00:01:02.640> which<00:01:02.879> means

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it we're expanding into which means

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.310 
it we're expanding into which means
between<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.600> ultimates<00:01:04.019> little

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
between the ultimates little

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.109 
between the ultimates little
reinforcements<00:01:05.070> would<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.280> an<00:01:05.369> M<00:01:05.519> amount<00:01:05.820> so

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
reinforcements would be an M amount so

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.420 
reinforcements would be an M amount so

what I mean is first you isolate what

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.820 
what I mean is first you isolate what
the<00:01:23.280> heck<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.580> my<00:01:23.729> fear<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.750> am<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.140> afraid<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the heck is my fear what am I afraid of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.070 
the heck is my fear what am I afraid of
what<00:01:26.189> are<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> negative<00:01:26.729> consequences<00:01:27.479> but

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
what are the negative consequences but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.590 
what are the negative consequences but
specifically<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.790> context<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
specifically what in this context is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.370 
specifically what in this context is
making<00:01:31.500> me<00:01:31.680> avoid<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.060> second<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.689> clarifying

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
making me avoid the second is clarifying

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.679 
making me avoid the second is clarifying
what<00:01:34.920> are<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> real<00:01:35.400> risks<00:01:35.850> would<00:01:36.600> have

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
what are the real risks would have

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.020 
what are the real risks would have

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.690 
likelihood that this worst-case is going
to<00:01:39.090> play<00:01:39.270> out<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.600> separating<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.979> possible

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
to play out in separating the possible

to play out in separating the possible

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
from the probable we get a little lost

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.550 
from the probable we get a little lost
in<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.759> tend<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.149> slip<00:01:45.600> into<00:01:46.049> believing

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
in this we tend to slip into believing

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.520 
in this we tend to slip into believing
that<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.399> possible<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.149> probable<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.439> of

that what is possible is probable and of

that what is possible is probable and of

possibilities we increase the likelihood

of those possibilities and we also
reduce<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> likelihood<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> best-case

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
reduce the likelihood of the best-case

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.420 
reduce the likelihood of the best-case
scenario<00:01:57.750> playing<00:01:58.619> out<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.009> here's<00:01:59.250> how<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
scenario playing out and here's how I

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.580 
scenario playing out and here's how I
look<00:01:59.759> at<00:01:59.939> it<00:01:59.969> when<00:02:00.390> we're<00:02:00.540> clarifying<00:02:01.079> risks

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
look at it when we're clarifying risks

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.490 
look at it when we're clarifying risks
like<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.460> approach<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.119> big<00:02:03.600> kitchen<00:02:04.049> sink

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
like you approach a big kitchen sink

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.530 
like you approach a big kitchen sink
full<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.770> stuff<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.909> got<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.240> kinds

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
full of stuff right it's got all kinds

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.570 
full of stuff right it's got all kinds
of<00:02:06.570> dirty<00:02:06.780> dishes<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.710> those<00:02:08.250> dishes

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
of dirty dishes in it in those dishes

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.790 
of dirty dishes in it in those dishes
you've<00:02:08.940> got<00:02:09.270> glasses<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.170> might<00:02:10.349> break<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you've got glasses that might break and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.320 
you've got glasses that might break and
get<00:02:10.890> sharp<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.310> touch<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:11.730> knives

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
get sharp in touch if you have knives

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.809 
get sharp in touch if you have knives
sharp<00:02:12.959> knives<00:02:13.170> could<00:02:13.470> be

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
sharp knives could be

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.660 
sharp knives could be
in<00:02:13.879> there<00:02:14.150> right<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.659> so<00:02:15.290> one<00:02:16.189> way<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.430> deal

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
in there right and so one way to deal

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.270 
in there right and so one way to deal
with<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:16.939> is<00:02:17.030> don't<00:02:17.390> do<00:02:17.689> the<00:02:17.870> dishes<00:02:18.079> and<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:19.129> lot

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
with it is don't do the dishes and a lot

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.339 
with it is don't do the dishes and a lot
of<00:02:19.310> things<00:02:19.609> in<00:02:19.760> life<00:02:19.790> people<00:02:20.420> do<00:02:20.689> they<00:02:20.930> avoid

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
of things in life people do they avoid

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.020 
of things in life people do they avoid
the<00:02:21.409> risk<00:02:21.799> so<00:02:22.099> much<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.730> they're<00:02:22.879> not

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
the risk so much that they're not

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.149 
the risk so much that they're not
dealing<00:02:23.239> with<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.540> necessary<00:02:24.500> components<00:02:24.739> of

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
dealing with the necessary components of

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.860 
dealing with the necessary components of
their<00:02:25.280> life<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.760> build<00:02:26.150> dealing<00:02:26.750> with

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
their life and build dealing with

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.839 
their life and build dealing with
relationship<00:02:27.560> issues<00:02:27.709> all<00:02:28.099> kinds<00:02:28.579> of<00:02:28.670> things

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
relationship issues all kinds of things

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.610 
relationship issues all kinds of things
fall<00:02:29.209> by<00:02:29.359> the<00:02:29.390> wayside<00:02:29.629> because<00:02:30.260> we're

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
fall by the wayside because we're

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.789 
fall by the wayside because we're
avoiding<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.939> knives<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:33.109> the<00:02:33.230> sink<00:02:33.500> if<00:02:33.680> you

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
avoiding so knives in the sink if you

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.059 
avoiding so knives in the sink if you
think<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.159> it<00:02:34.310> if<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.730> have<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.810> few<00:02:36.170> knives<00:02:36.379> but

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
think of it if you have a few knives but

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.460 
think of it if you have a few knives but
mostly<00:02:37.540> objects<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.659> that<00:02:38.870> sink<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.349> are

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
mostly objects in that sink that are

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.979 
mostly objects in that sink that are
perfectly<00:02:39.889> safe<00:02:40.099> not<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> big<00:02:40.909> deal<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.450> just

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
perfectly safe not a big deal you just

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.020 
perfectly safe not a big deal you just
have<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:42.620> think<00:02:42.799> in<00:02:42.980> terms<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.430> where<00:02:43.760> are

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
have to think in terms of where are

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.569 
have to think in terms of where are
those<00:02:44.299> knives<00:02:44.540> what<00:02:45.079> are<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> specific<00:02:45.980> risks

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
those knives what are the specific risks

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.210 
those knives what are the specific risks
so<00:02:47.030> that's<00:02:47.389> clarifying<00:02:48.109> then<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.769> third<00:02:48.980> is

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
so that's clarifying then the third is

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.920 
so that's clarifying then the third is
