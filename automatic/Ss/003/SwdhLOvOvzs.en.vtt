00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
this is a 1994 Johnson 150 ocean runner

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.509 
this is a 1994 Johnson 150 ocean runner
last<00:00:07.799> summer<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:09.000> had<00:00:09.719> some<00:00:10.650> issues<00:00:10.830> with<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.309> it

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
last summer I had some issues with it it

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.390 
last summer I had some issues with it it
wasn't<00:00:11.820> running<00:00:11.880> really<00:00:12.570> great<00:00:13.219> it<00:00:14.219> was

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
wasn't running really great it was

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.580 
wasn't running really great it was
leaking<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.700> little<00:00:14.759> bit<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.030> gas<00:00:15.590> wasn't

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
leaking a little bit of gas wasn't

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.160 
leaking a little bit of gas wasn't
holding<00:00:16.920> Prime<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:19.529> gas<00:00:20.189> line

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
holding Prime in the gas line

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.009 
holding Prime in the gas line
I<00:00:22.760> saw<00:00:23.760> where<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> gas<00:00:24.210> leaking<00:00:24.600> from<00:00:24.750> it's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
I saw where the gas leaking from it's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.769 
I saw where the gas leaking from it's
coming<00:00:25.260> from<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.650> float<00:00:25.859> bowls<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.539> was<00:00:27.539> really

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
coming from the float bowls I was really

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
coming from the float bowls I was really
kind<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.960> weird<00:00:28.140> did<00:00:28.410> some<00:00:28.560> research<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
kind of weird did some research on it

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400 
kind of weird did some research on it
that's<00:00:29.760> probably<00:00:30.150> why<00:00:30.269> you're<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:30.689> now<00:00:30.900> as

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that's probably why you're here now as

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.530 
that's probably why you're here now as
you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.590> see<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.910> should<00:00:33.510> look

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
you can see this is what it should look

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.160 
you can see this is what it should look
like<00:00:34.880> during<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> manufacturing<00:00:36.570> process

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
like during the manufacturing process

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.520 
like during the manufacturing process
after<00:00:37.920> they<00:00:38.129> finished<00:00:38.879> they<00:00:39.290> basically<00:00:40.290> pop

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
after they finished they basically pop

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.090 
after they finished they basically pop
in<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.920> BB<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.790> they<00:00:41.850> seal<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:43.100> keep

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
in a BB here and they seal it in keep

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.209 
in a BB here and they seal it in keep
the<00:00:44.210> just<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> seal<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.570> off<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:46.680> over<00:00:47.010> time

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the just to seal it off but over time

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.779 
the just to seal it off but over time
they<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.210> tendency<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.710> fall<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.920> or

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
they have a tendency to fall out or

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.510 
they have a tendency to fall out or
start<00:00:51.270> leaking<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:52.949> currently<00:00:53.100> able<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
start leaking so I'm currently able to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.160 
start leaking so I'm currently able to
pull<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> also<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.870> also

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
pull this off and I also have to also

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.069 
pull this off and I also have to also
want<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> show<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.780> motors

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
want to show you that this this motors

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.889 
want to show you that this this motors
20<00:00:58.350> years<00:00:58.469> old<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.210> ordered<00:01:00.210> new<00:01:00.390> float<00:01:00.660> bowls

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
20 years old I ordered new float bowls

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.470 
20 years old I ordered new float bowls
and<00:01:01.109> you'll<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> difference<00:01:02.420> when<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and you'll see the difference when I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.030 
and you'll see the difference when I
take<00:01:03.660> these<00:01:03.809> off<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.409> these<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.739> warped

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
take these off and how these have warped

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.179 
take these off and how these have warped
or<00:01:05.250> time<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.560> bolts<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.590> through<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.040> hold

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
or time or the bolts go through and hold

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:08.800 
or time or the bolts go through and hold
it<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.340> place

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
it in place

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
it in place
compared<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.049> new<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:10.740> okay<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.430> don't<00:01:11.549> know

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
compared to a new one okay I don't know

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
compared to a new one okay I don't know
if<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.510> able<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.659> show<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
if I'm going to be able to show this to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260 
if I'm going to be able to show this to
you<00:01:13.409> very<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.979> video<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.119> my

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you very well in video but this is my

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.039 
you very well in video but this is my
old<00:01:15.479> float

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
old float

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.859 
old float
oh<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> new<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:18.200> take<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> look

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
oh this is the new one take a look

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
oh this is the new one take a look
carefully<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.880> old<00:01:27.090> one

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
carefully you can see that the old one

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.190 
carefully you can see that the old one
is<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> big<00:01:28.229> bow<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:30.200> from

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
is that a big bow kind of to it from

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.319 
is that a big bow kind of to it from
point<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> point

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
point to point

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.950 
point to point
gives<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.420> later<00:01:33.600> life<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:35.600> while<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
I'm going to before it to the new ones

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.109 
I'm going to before it to the new ones
on<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:42.000> part<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> problem<00:01:44.119> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
on this part that was a problem and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
on this part that was a problem and
right<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.380> sealed<00:01:46.710> these<00:01:47.009> means<00:01:47.250> are

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
right now is sealed these means are

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.670 
right now is sealed these means are
sealed<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> exact<00:01:48.360> same<00:01:48.509> way<00:01:48.720> before<00:01:49.439> it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
sealed the exact same way before it

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.980 
sealed the exact same way before it
becomes<00:01:49.920> an<00:01:50.040> issue<00:01:50.360> again<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.540> me<00:01:51.689> I'm<00:01:51.869> just

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
becomes an issue again to me I'm just

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.490 
becomes an issue again to me I'm just
going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> take<00:01:52.350> some<00:01:53.390> epoxy<00:01:54.390> or<00:01:54.810> some<00:01:55.020> jb<00:01:55.259> weld

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
going to take some epoxy or some jb weld

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.440 
going to take some epoxy or some jb weld
and<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:56.280> put<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.180> bit<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.630> there

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
and just put a little bit on there

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.209 
and just put a little bit on there
and<00:01:59.570> get<00:02:00.170> rid<00:02:00.259> you<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.530> that's<00:02:00.680> not<00:02:00.979> going<00:02:01.159> to

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
and get rid you that that's not going to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.149 
and get rid you that that's not going to
fall<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.990> I've<00:02:03.110> mixed<00:02:03.259> up<00:02:03.469> some<00:02:03.649> jb<00:02:03.890> weld

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
fall in so I've mixed up some jb weld

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.649 
fall in so I've mixed up some jb weld
and<00:02:04.520> I'm<00:02:04.640> just<00:02:04.789> going<00:02:04.969> to<00:02:05.000> apply<00:02:05.270> it

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
and I'm just going to apply it

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.369 
and I'm just going to apply it
I<00:02:05.689> call<00:02:06.079> this<00:02:06.579> preventive<00:02:07.579> maintenance<00:02:08.379> so

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
I call this preventive maintenance so

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.479 
I call this preventive maintenance so
hopefully<00:02:09.739> I<00:02:09.769> don't<00:02:09.920> have<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.129> worry<00:02:10.310> about

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
hopefully I don't have to worry about

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.900 
hopefully I don't have to worry about
the<00:02:10.780> issues<00:02:11.780> with<00:02:12.080> any<00:02:12.290> leaking<00:02:12.680> from<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.750> BB

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
the issues with any leaking from that BB

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.820 
the issues with any leaking from that BB
there<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.120> already<00:02:17.450> lots<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.230> videos<00:02:18.530> out

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
there is already lots of videos out

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.160 
there is already lots of videos out
there<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:19.340> how<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.550> rebuild<00:02:20.000> your<00:02:20.120> carb<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.630> I'm

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
there on how to rebuild your carb so I'm

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.660 
there on how to rebuild your carb so I'm
not<00:02:21.380> going<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.620> bother<00:02:21.709> going<00:02:21.980> into<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.370> I

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
not going to bother going into that I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.009 
not going to bother going into that I
basically<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.780> wanted<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.530> explain<00:02:26.019> the

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
basically just wanted to explain the

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.030 
basically just wanted to explain the
problems<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:28.010> might<00:02:28.310> be<00:02:28.489> having<00:02:28.730> with<00:02:30.040> your

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
problems you might be having with your

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.479 
problems you might be having with your
float<00:02:31.280> bolt<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:31.880> bearing<00:02:32.299> coming<00:02:32.569> out

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
float bolt and that bearing coming out

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.479 
float bolt and that bearing coming out
so<00:02:34.489> it's<00:02:34.519> all<00:02:34.910> back<00:02:35.060> together<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:37.190> starts

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
so it's all back together and it starts

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.239 
so it's all back together and it starts
up<00:02:37.640> real<00:02:37.790> nice<00:02:38.000> now
