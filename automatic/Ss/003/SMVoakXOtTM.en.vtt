00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.520
 but 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.719
 all new and new jay z 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.719
 and we are again in the store base 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:15.570
 peak 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.689
 I imagine Kiev rubles from these 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.859
 groups 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.899
 today will tell in one more element 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:23.609
 Derzhavina 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.349
 the percentage of which I do not know what is called 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.909
 but it looks like this 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.909
 at 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.420
 in fact 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.420
 remembering looked previous 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 so to speak 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.110
 remember what we did 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.710
 exactly the opposite budgets on a record 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.360
 all blazing flames and 4 times two three four 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.510
 she is a spectrum 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.510
 how does this sound 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.390
 circle of business 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.390
 I agree and omit a piece of Pisarev 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.760
 What is the difference 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.460
 the next opponent is that we let go 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.870
 on the ruins 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.110
 let's start Pushkin's countries 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.020
 plate 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.220
 and at that moment when we have 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.850
 she plays we have time to add a couple 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.540
 sounds 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.350
 Chief 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.400
 for the second plate 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.400
 I believe in Europe 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.650
 in May 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.770
 skipping 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.369
 switch to another point in this 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.820
 case this is the case 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 match hero 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.120
 about a third we omit it 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.139
 track 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.319
 in general, nothing but 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.779
 would have stayed pretty 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.159
 This is another example of Abidjan on which 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.219
 but you can decorate it on your day off 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.219
 arthur compact with religion 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.039
 how else can 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.099
 pinned with the plates still possible 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.539
 had overslept 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:59.349
 can do 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.349
 same thing but like that 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.139
 found a typo 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.949
 I think it will be the third 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.729
 an unexpected visit today at baku business 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.919
 only the guardians are leaving much more interesting 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.870
 looks like 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.519
 as they say 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.829
 so 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.430
 do jarmen do sbu 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.009
 depression will be interesting 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.809
 everything has a DJ price 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.139
 shop base see us still 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:47.629
 will do
