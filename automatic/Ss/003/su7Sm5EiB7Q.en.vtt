00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
um uh I went online found my BMR which

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.080 
um uh I went online found my BMR which
is<00:03:14.630> your<00:03:14.890> basal<00:03:15.890> metabolic<00:03:16.040> rate<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.790> that's

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
is your basal metabolic rate and that's

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.729 
is your basal metabolic rate and that's
how<00:03:17.269> many<00:03:17.450> calories<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:18.019> need<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.200> intake

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
how many calories you need to intake

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.819 
how many calories you need to intake
each<00:03:18.980> day<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.970> maintain<00:03:20.450> your<00:03:20.630> body<00:03:20.840> weight<00:03:21.140> so

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
each day to maintain your body weight so

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.920 
each day to maintain your body weight so
in<00:03:22.549> order<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.880> lose<00:03:23.090> weight<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.360> have<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.690> go

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
in order to lose weight I have to go

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.030 
in order to lose weight I have to go
below<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:24.799> my<00:03:25.040> um<00:03:25.390> BMR<00:03:26.390> was<00:03:26.600> 1,000<00:03:27.170> 1,500

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
below that so my um BMR was 1,000 1,500

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.319 
below that so my um BMR was 1,000 1,500
so<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:28.880> ate<00:03:30.040> 1200<00:03:31.040> every<00:03:31.400> single<00:03:31.760> day<00:03:31.910> so

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
so I ate 1200 every single day so

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.539 
so I ate 1200 every single day so
basically<00:03:32.660> weight<00:03:32.930> loss<00:03:33.140> is<00:03:33.470> just<00:03:33.920> depends<00:03:34.280> on

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
basically weight loss is just depends on

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.990 
basically weight loss is just depends on
uh<00:03:35.950> eating<00:03:36.950> less<00:03:37.130> than<00:03:37.340> what<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.610> need<00:03:37.760> for

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
uh eating less than what you need for

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.150 
uh eating less than what you need for
that<00:03:38.120> day<00:03:38.269> our<00:03:38.480> ever<00:03:38.959> smaller<00:03:39.320> my<00:03:39.829> legs<00:03:40.040> were
