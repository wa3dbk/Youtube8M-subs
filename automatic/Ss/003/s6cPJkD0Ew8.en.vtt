00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello friends this is in one place 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.210
 I extract the first episode of the new 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.880
 series that I'm going to do with the new 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.920
 capture on xbox that will try 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.340
 about good I will teach more or less 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.070
 the hiding places and spots of infected 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.199
 bad refer 3 and today I am the map of if 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.900
 is a team we do not go with the first 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.029
 red hiding place so one of the most 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.410
 common that is between the bushes 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.810
 these you are seeing here you bet 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.900
 and hopefully they will see us and you will stay 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.119
 last 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.710
 many times if you hide you do not kill 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.660
 a lot but as you already know when 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.520
 eliminate one of your from our 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.100
 friends give points to you and the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.420
 end you can have enough points I 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.040
 not only hide a lot but good 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.160
 I will also do it sometimes and is the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.500
 last and then usually art out there good 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.920
 and here we go with the second hiding place 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.449
 of the day and down here in the east turret 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.120
 you can go to bed and I think this is 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.750
 one of my favorites you put here and we 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.220
 they are going to see maybe if they see you they will have 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.170
 lucky them because it's very difficult that 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.049
 I sell you there's no one gets in 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.150
 here almost never and here is the other one of 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.729
 this medium pretty good had not 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.570
 thought and I discovered it you can go to bed 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.340
 behind the boat to see if I get 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.909
 and if I make you are here 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.060
 Let's see 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.640
 Well, it will not leave me, you're back there and we 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.760
 will see 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.470
 well now we go with the other one of the 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.920
 hiding places this is the third and last 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.409
 I think this is quite difficult to 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.000
 go up to how I'm seeing there just 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.869
 in front of these tablecloths there are those 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.700
 awnings of the name all that you 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.280
 you can jump and lie on them and not 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.530
 you will see 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.250
 good to see if I can get on them 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.799
 It's going to cost me but I'll try 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.799
 well when I have uploaded another one I get 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.670
 and well at the end I managed to upload 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.770
 the awning this and as I told you you can 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.619
 to lie down here and they are going to catch us not to be 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.290
 let the enemies know the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.200
 hiding places like me and then you can 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.270
 jump around in awnings for the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.200
 Put these on and you can get in here 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.970
 and hey, he 's pretty cool 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.250
 well now let's go with others with you 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.870
 I know 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.040
 that is about to be I like it is in the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.840
 good hotel around here is worth this is another 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.810
 from the hiding places also that is 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.360
 quite 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.849
 well I do not solve it because I do not 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.569
 like because a lot of people usually go 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.300
 people since they do not want to be anymore 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.340

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.270
