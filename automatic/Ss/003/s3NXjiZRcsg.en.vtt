00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.290
 title for playstation 4 that I'm 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.700
 sure he's going to mark he's going to mark a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.740
 before and after in the world of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.509
 videogames and not listen to me and attentive 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.359
 because when the time comes you will say 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.670
 If you said it, I 'll tell you 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.220
 because to me sincerely this great game 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 that is looming this good this creation 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.660
 guerrilla games captivated me from the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 first moment at the first moment that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.560
 I'm going to show that I saw that sound 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.180
 music the truth is that I knew I was 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.309
 before something epic, well, let's go 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.160
 talk about this horizon 0 down from 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.050
 playstation 4 because after many 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.719
 years with the same saga and style of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.730
 game guerrilla games has changed and in 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.920
 this occasion brings us this horizon 0 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.649
 down a world role and action title 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.020
 open art director jean bart 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.780
 Vandvik and the producer Lambert Mahler 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.899
 have explained the difficulty of giving 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.350
 jump like this the challenge was to pass 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.270
 from a level that takes 45 minutes to a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 time to make an experience that 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.240
 you need to go to dozens of hours with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 dozens of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.110
 to do, of course, the change is very 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.210
 great for kids own 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.649
 guerrilla good the solution that took 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.360
 guerrilla was to hire people 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.610
 experienced in this type of games 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.619
 some of which were already known by 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.509
 different rÃ©sumÃ©s as people from 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.270
 bethesda among which is the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.149
 screenwriter of fallout new vegas and cd 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.490
 projekt red authors you already know of the 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.229
 witcher good attentive because with 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.500
 these developers and their experience 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.810
 the game seems to be and they say textually 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.819
 it's a machine that works where every 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.100
 moment is fun no matter the way 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.720
 to play this is a lesson that 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 we learned to avoid the same 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.789
 errors that others take when making their 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.990
 first open world game what 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.619
 you want me to tell you guys and girls 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.240
 I have full confidence in a game like 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.709
 this horizon if I say it because when a 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.009
 game gets you through the eyes from the 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.840
 first moment I think that means 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.569
 something and I sincerely with this 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.149
 horizon has happened to me so I trust 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.640
 100% in this open world title and 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.530
 the truth 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.010
 to be the first time we see the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.590
 game I saw it quite polished I trust a lot 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.420
 in this title for playstation 4 to the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.970
 I do not know when it will finally arrive I do not know 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.860
 what will be your publication date by me 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.930
 as if it takes 3 years to arrive but that 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.459
 arrive with the same quality as 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.459
 we are seeing that we have seen it in 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.130
 this e3 because I sincerely repeat for 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.070
 I was one of the best things that 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.800
 have shown in this e3 2015 of course 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.160
