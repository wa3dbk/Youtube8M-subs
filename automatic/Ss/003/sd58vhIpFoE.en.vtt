00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.650
 thought that I could click on perfect eyebrows often comes to me 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.579
 asked 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.929
 as a model as I do between my eyebrows and therefore I never made a 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.710
 video on this topic I decided to do it today I'll explain how I do it 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.330
 olive eyebrows practically every day 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.869
 and then I also give you some advice then in practice when I go 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.640
 area to remove 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 the hairs in the basket with the tweezers I'm always careful 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.489
 i love certain things from here a simple joke you can take one 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.370
 so 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.390
 sheet of paper makes me think of lot works to make this kind of 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.540
 try the you have to be careful of the dog 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.040
 all your friends in a while then you have to imagine my visibility 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.000
 from your fennel recipe 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.330
 then eyebrow roast 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.890
 the line 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.610
 more or less than the three letters is the exact point where it should begin 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.240
 eyebrow name 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.180
 tillate - so said so and on the other side 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.680
 if you see it is the exact same thing then 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.380
 maybe the first time it starts with e 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.829
 one makes me do perfect eyebrows for these things here that you karaoke 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.369
 be careful and hairs that grow back remove only those I recommend 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.710
 allow the best campania with tweezers for eyebrows 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.270
 There are also google related ones 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.219
 with the tip veritas the favorite series that is therefore important to the eagle 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.710
 at the beginning stay 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.490
 careful he spoke too closely to you 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.009
 I see many girls like that in the street 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.149
 having the eyebrows finish the eagle's wings begin 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.250
 and the same thing of the other part this makes that 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.630
 the space above the nose I always have much wider and therefore osmosis 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020
 will result in greater optical profit 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.630
 Your eyes will be more detached from flight. 7 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.789
 remove eyebrows too much 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.850
 oh here at the start of the track here for a long time 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.400
 then to define 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 the como that is this little corner then 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.140
 nothing the same with the pencil imagined sailor 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.579
 that always goes to your clarice 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.649
 I ended up raising my eyebrow looking at your pupil practically 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:21.050
 standing upright looking at diamonds our eyes feel sick at the eyes 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.689
 therefore looking straight ahead precisely 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.109
 starting from the manager annamo other 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:29.659
 stop the pupil however the eye 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.859
 read that this is the exact point where it must be found 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:38.139
 and here too I have said so many girls who have no mark dolphins 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.260
 eyebrow I have very right 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.610
 or round cusimano a well-defined corner one night 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.329
 also on this I advise you to be very careful because the eyebrows 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.720
 they are very important 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.030
 for the look especially for spears for the expression ie they can change 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.579
 expression of a star person are 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.940
 makeup or modified too 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.390
 tvb course was also not to be missed to make them too thin 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.700
 rather let yourself be natural 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.700
 and if you have them very very thin because maybe by mistake 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.260
 or at least parquet sentences come back to thin troppoforte you have to grow 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.760
 this is really a piece of advice that will help you grow 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.500
 and then when they grew up he did them again because it's that much 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.920
 very very thin. keep totally changing same people who are on 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.889
 driving license 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.599
 then instead to define where the eyebrow should end up 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.069
 it is always made from the spacecraft 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.229
 always part of the spacecraft tooth creates comment passing by the end of 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.700
 eye so there were no external of the eye 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.279
 with you - they should 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:48.709
 finish the step for cydia 3 with these tricks the first time you can 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.459
 tallin model them well and then. it was enough that 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.339
 studied and defects that I am regrowing what I do and 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.059
 just take a little bit here 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:03.239
 the super cn basket is here very much because my eyebrows are 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.220
 quite a lot of 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.750
 strong 1001 modelplanet practically every day 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.469
 what is not all they do so there are some friends of mine that 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.709
 I go to the beautician once a week bringing sun and a couple of 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.450
 times a week I have to do them 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.530
 almost every day otherwise you see a lot and hairs that are 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.430
 growing back 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.319
 this depends a little bit there are eyebrows things 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:28.059
 then. what I do haha ​​take off with the tweezers below col 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.260
 cappelletto and then here 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.670
 I have adopted several so to create this thing I am currently none 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.910
 eyebrow pencil although used until a few months ago 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.080
 now I don't know why I like it better to leave it so, however, that 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.039
 that advice and the ingrid of martorana dismissal of gasoline 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.689
 and it's a brown 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.000
 but not too much that they love too dark 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.419
 I'm fine if the light brown girls and the blonde is dark blond 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.039
 photo maker 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.930
 dark brown shoulders and anyway there are so many priests as you can 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.249
 use being with eyeshadow that looks very much like the color of yours 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.449
 red-haired eyebrows 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.830
 powerful to use the one with the angled brush 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.159
 protected photos 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.159
 hamster hamleto then with little ones 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.280
 if nothing with little ones 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.760
 with movements you can just fill in the empty sendevent spaces that's why 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.010
 I'm currently not doing it though 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.140
 you know that they had all been here one of those cities of genoa 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.779

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.770
 light and thin movements pollute was very careful this better 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.849
 put a little less 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.689
 that trompa because then the opa effect will be too strong so you will notice 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.319

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.529

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:55.339

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.199
 where they should perhaps be anywhere with a little more sauce with a little more 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.169

 a little bit with the scissors always combing the super I recommend it for

 but because it's hard enough to do s you haven't been risked 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.490
 maybe even a little bit too much 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.620
 I sincerely do not recommend it to me as a last thing if it is in the same 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.740
