usable<00:00:35.399> theme<00:00:35.579> wallpaper<00:00:35.790> which<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.600> actually

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
usable theme wallpaper which I actually

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.810 
usable theme wallpaper which I actually
haven't<00:00:37.140> ran<00:00:37.410> into<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> went<00:00:38.070> through<00:00:38.219> all<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
haven't ran into I went through all the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
haven't ran into I went through all the
themes<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.390> none<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> them<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> wallpaper

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
themes and none of them have a wallpaper

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.979 
themes and none of them have a wallpaper
so<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.300> sure<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.660> that's<00:00:42.780> about

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
so this I'm not sure what that's about

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380
