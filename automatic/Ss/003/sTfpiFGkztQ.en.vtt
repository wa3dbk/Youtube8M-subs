semi-professional pole is actually the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.760 
semi-professional pole is actually the
composition<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.150> tube<00:00:57.390> sections<00:00:57.960> because

somebody<00:00:59.070> who's<00:00:59.220> using<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.610> pole<00:00:59.850> all<00:01:00.090> day

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
somebody who's using the pole all day

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.920 
somebody who's using the pole all day
every<00:01:01.110> day<00:01:01.140> needs<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.580> most<00:01:02.760> rigid<00:01:03.060> lightest

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
every day needs the most rigid lightest

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.990 
every day needs the most rigid lightest
Pole<00:01:04.199> possible<00:01:04.740> but<00:01:05.160> somebody<00:01:05.520> who's<00:01:05.640> using<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
Pole possible but somebody who's using a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.570 
Pole possible but somebody who's using a
pole<00:01:06.270> irregularly<00:01:07.140> doesn't<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.310> same

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
pole irregularly doesn't have that same

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.900 
pole irregularly doesn't have that same
need<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.570> use<00:01:10.470> something<00:01:10.800> that's

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
need so they can use something that's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.520 
need so they can use something that's
marginally<00:01:11.910> heavier<00:01:12.350> marginally<00:01:13.350> more

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
marginally heavier marginally more

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.500 
marginally heavier marginally more
flexible<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.520> we'll<00:01:14.670> demonstrate<00:01:14.880> that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
flexible but we'll demonstrate that

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:26.030 
flexible but we'll demonstrate that
shortly<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> multi<00:01:24.960> pole<00:01:25.170> X<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> hybrid

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
shortly so the multi pole X is a hybrid

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.930 
shortly so the multi pole X is a hybrid
composition<00:01:26.910> of<00:01:27.060> carbon<00:01:27.660> fiber<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.610> fiber<00:01:29.610> X

mixture

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.770 

so<00:01:45.290> hard<00:01:45.710> from<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.400> composition<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.480> tube

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
so hard from the composition of the tube

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.540 
so hard from the composition of the tube
sections<00:01:48.230> everything<00:01:48.740> else<00:01:48.890> about<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.220> moldy

clean<00:02:50.780> those<00:02:50.900> windows<00:02:50.959> there<00:02:51.620> now<00:02:52.340> you'll

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
clean those windows there now you'll

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.190 
clean those windows there now you'll
find<00:02:52.760> also<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.300> if<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.600> do<00:02:53.810> need<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.110> get

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
find also that if you do need to get

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.259 
find also that if you do need to get
over<00:02:54.500> large<00:02:54.709> lips<00:02:55.130> like<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:56.030> can<00:02:56.150> look

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
over large lips like that you can look

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.390 
over large lips like that you can look
up<00:02:56.390> our<00:02:56.510> video<00:02:56.810> on<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.170> Rhino<00:02:57.350> apex<00:02:57.980> and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
up our video on the Rhino apex and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.250 
up our video on the Rhino apex and
you'll<00:02:58.700> see<00:02:58.880> how<00:02:59.000> we<00:02:59.060> do<00:02:59.269> that<00:02:59.420> but<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.110> can

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
you'll see how we do that but you can

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.310 
you'll see how we do that but you can
see<00:03:00.290> easily<00:03:00.650> 20<00:03:01.430> foot<00:03:01.580> pole<00:03:01.850> can<00:03:02.450> reach<00:03:02.630> you

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
see easily 20 foot pole can reach you

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:13.449 
see easily 20 foot pole can reach you
know<00:03:03.440> right<00:03:03.650> up<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.519> gutter

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.270 

so<00:03:14.459> here<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.700> am<00:03:14.819> with<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.569> multipole<00:03:16.260> xx<00:03:17.010> which

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
so here I am with the multipole xx which

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.970 
so here I am with the multipole xx which
is<00:03:17.430> Roman<00:03:17.700> numerals<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.330> xx<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.680> can<00:03:19.800> see

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
is Roman numerals for xx and you can see

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.910 
is Roman numerals for xx and you can see
that<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.280> can<00:03:20.459> reach<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.650> gutter<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.860> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
that it can reach the gutter of a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.890 
that it can reach the gutter of a
two-story<00:03:23.310> building<00:03:24.530> however<00:03:25.530> if<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.569> need<00:03:27.569> to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
two-story building however if I need to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.630 
two-story building however if I need to
reach<00:03:28.020> three<00:03:28.530> storeys<00:03:28.920> either<00:03:29.160> because<00:03:29.489> the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
reach three storeys either because the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.520 
reach three storeys either because the
landscaping<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.330> dropping<00:03:30.720> away<00:03:30.810> well

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
landscaping is dropping away well

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.500 
landscaping is dropping away well
somebody's<00:03:31.890> got<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> basement<00:03:32.310> garage<00:03:32.880> or

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
somebody's got a basement garage or

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.050 
somebody's got a basement garage or
they've<00:03:34.200> got<00:03:34.380> another<00:03:34.620> set<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.580> windows<00:03:35.850> up

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
they've got another set of windows up

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.520 
they've got another set of windows up
above<00:03:36.270> so<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:36.660> actually<00:03:36.780> three<00:03:37.170> storeys

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
above so it's actually three storeys

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.310 
above so it's actually three storeys
residential<00:03:38.160> then<00:03:38.850> we<00:03:39.060> need<00:03:39.270> an<00:03:39.450> extension

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
residential then we need an extension

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.310 
residential then we need an extension
and<00:03:40.470> there<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.130> an<00:03:41.430> XT<00:03:41.940> available<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
and there is an XT available for the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.090 
and there is an XT available for the
multipole<00:03:43.769> xx<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.850> let's<00:03:45.060> grab<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:46.100> extension

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
multipole xx so let's grab the extension

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.590 
multipole xx so let's grab the extension
what<00:03:47.430> I'll<00:03:47.550> do<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.790> I'll<00:03:47.910> actually<00:03:48.000> come<00:03:48.390> round

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
what I'll do is I'll actually come round

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.820 
what I'll do is I'll actually come round
here<00:03:49.100> where<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.280> ceiling<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:51.320> or<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.440> roof<00:03:52.590> is

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
here where the ceiling is or the roof is

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.000 
here where the ceiling is or the roof is
higher<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.470> first<00:03:55.739> thing<00:03:55.890> I'll<00:03:55.980> just

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
higher so the first thing I'll just

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.309 
higher so the first thing I'll just
point<00:03:56.340> out<00:03:56.519> if<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:56.700> ever<00:03:56.910> fitting<00:03:57.420> an<00:03:57.540> XT<00:03:57.989> is

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
point out if you ever fitting an XT is

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.680 
point out if you ever fitting an XT is
that<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.650> always<00:03:58.860> pull<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.700> handle<00:04:00.330> section

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
that you always pull the handle section

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.160 
that you always pull the handle section
out<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:00.930> you'll<00:04:01.080> see<00:04:01.459> this<00:04:02.459> yellow<00:04:03.239> bar<00:04:03.630> here

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
out so you'll see this yellow bar here

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.920 
out so you'll see this yellow bar here
is<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.739> overlap<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:05.970> when<00:04:06.150> we<00:04:06.269> pull<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.510> out<00:04:06.690> we

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
is the overlap so when we pull it out we

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.190 
is the overlap so when we pull it out we
open<00:04:07.380> an<00:04:07.700> area<00:04:08.700> at<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:08.970> other<00:04:09.150> end<00:04:09.420> of<00:04:09.660> an

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
open an area at the other end of an

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.390 
open an area at the other end of an
equal<00:04:10.500> size<00:04:10.739> so<00:04:11.519> when<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:11.700> open<00:04:12.030> this<00:04:12.150> clamp<00:04:13.400> you

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
equal size so when I open this clamp you

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.050 
equal size so when I open this clamp you
can<00:04:14.579> see<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.840> can<00:04:16.380> slip<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.579> is<00:04:17.790> it

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
can see that I can slip and that is it

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.390 
can see that I can slip and that is it
hitting<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:19.079> other<00:04:19.260> tube<00:04:19.620> now<00:04:20.070> we<00:04:20.130> know<00:04:20.370> that

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
hitting the other tube now we know that

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.800 
hitting the other tube now we know that
that's<00:04:20.729> locked<00:04:21.000> off<00:04:21.180> check<00:04:22.079> that<00:04:22.290> and<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:23.810> can

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
that's locked off check that and I can

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.710 
that's locked off check that and I can
raise<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:26.010> pole<00:04:26.310> now<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.030> secret<00:04:27.479> to<00:04:27.510> these

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
raise this pole now the secret to these

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.320 
raise this pole now the secret to these
just<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.260> know<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:29.610> raise<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:30.120> pole

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
just so you know is you raise the pole

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.159 
just so you know is you raise the pole
open<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.110> clamp<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.620> pull<00:04:32.310> this<00:04:32.460> out<00:04:33.169> it's

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
open the clamp and pull this out it's

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.430 
open the clamp and pull this out it's
much<00:04:34.320> easier<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:34.979> way<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.490> then<00:04:36.260> you<00:04:37.260> can

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
much easier that way and then you can

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.390 
much easier that way and then you can
see<00:04:37.680> now<00:04:39.320> we<00:04:40.320> can<00:04:40.500> reach<00:04:40.880> that's<00:04:41.880> actually<00:04:42.300> a

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
see now we can reach that's actually a

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.630 
see now we can reach that's actually a
35<00:04:44.400> foot<00:04:44.700> reach<00:04:44.970> on<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.390> 30-foot<00:04:45.930> pole<00:04:46.200> and<00:04:47.160> it's

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
35 foot reach on a 30-foot pole and it's

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.610 
35 foot reach on a 30-foot pole and it's
completely<00:04:48.210> light<00:04:48.570> like<00:04:48.990> whilst<00:04:49.380> it's

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
completely light like whilst it's

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.740 
completely light like whilst it's
marginally<00:04:50.100> heavier<00:04:50.400> in<00:04:50.580> composition<00:04:50.910> the

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
marginally heavier in composition the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.900 
marginally heavier in composition the
tube<00:04:52.020> sections<00:04:52.440> are<00:04:52.620> narrower<00:04:52.950> then<00:04:53.610> the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
tube sections are narrower then the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.430 
tube sections are narrower then the
reach<00:04:54.060> at<00:04:54.210> range<00:04:54.419> because<00:04:54.750> they're<00:04:54.930> only<00:04:55.050> like

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
reach at range because they're only like

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.830 
reach at range because they're only like
one<00:04:55.680> two<00:04:55.830> three<00:04:56.010> four<00:04:56.280> five<00:04:57.090> four<00:04:57.539> five<00:04:57.570> four

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
one two three four five four five four

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.380 
one two three four five four five four
so<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:58.500> is<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.680> smaller<00:04:58.979> section<00:04:59.220> so<00:05:00.150> it's

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
so this is a smaller section so it's

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.510 
so this is a smaller section so it's
completely<00:05:00.720> light<00:05:01.169> you<00:05:01.500> can<00:05:01.680> see<00:05:01.710> the

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
completely light you can see the

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.140 
completely light you can see the
rigidity<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:04.010> still<00:05:05.010> sensational<00:05:05.850> and

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
rigidity is still sensational and

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:14.480 
rigidity is still sensational and
completely<00:05:06.750> fine

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.010 

okay<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:15.550> now<00:05:16.000> this<00:05:16.210> poll<00:05:16.450> is<00:05:16.480> at<00:05:16.750> three

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
okay so now this poll is at three

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.390 
okay so now this poll is at three
stories<00:05:17.440> we<00:05:17.920> collapse<00:05:18.280> it<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:20.650> can<00:05:20.860> see<00:05:21.130> that

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
stories we collapse it you can see that

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.440 
stories we collapse it you can see that
we<00:05:21.820> can<00:05:21.850> pull<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.240> down<00:05:23.850> drop<00:05:24.850> that<00:05:25.000> on<00:05:25.150> the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
we can pull it down drop that on the

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.400 
we can pull it down drop that on the
grass<00:05:27.090> pull<00:05:28.090> this<00:05:28.210> down<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.750> what<00:05:28.990> we<00:05:29.110> haven't

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
grass pull this down and what we haven't

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.860 
grass pull this down and what we haven't
done<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.800> talk<00:05:30.010> about<00:05:30.040> how<00:05:30.490> we<00:05:30.550> clean<00:05:30.940> the

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
done is talk about how we clean the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.860 
done is talk about how we clean the
ground<00:05:32.140> floor<00:05:32.410> windows<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:33.730> the<00:05:34.420> way<00:05:34.540> we<00:05:34.690> do

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
ground floor windows and the way we do

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.350 
ground floor windows and the way we do
that<00:05:35.110> typical<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.280> our<00:05:36.400> reach<00:05:36.610> its<00:05:36.820> style<00:05:37.090> we

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
that typical to our reach its style we

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.650 
that typical to our reach its style we
open<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.720> top<00:05:37.930> clamp<00:05:38.230> pull<00:05:39.010> out<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.400> number<00:05:40.360> one

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
open the top clamp pull out a number one

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.630 
open the top clamp pull out a number one
section<00:05:41.050> it's<00:05:41.590> also<00:05:41.770> got<00:05:42.010> the<00:05:42.100> end<00:05:42.250> offender

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
section it's also got the end offender

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.950 
section it's also got the end offender
so<00:05:43.000> you<00:05:43.060> know<00:05:43.240> that<00:05:43.420> if<00:05:43.510> it<00:05:43.600> does<00:05:43.750> hit<00:05:43.930> the

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
so you know that if it does hit the

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.420 
so you know that if it does hit the
ground<00:05:44.230> you<00:05:44.590> can't<00:05:44.800> damage<00:05:44.980> your<00:05:45.250> tube

this being a semi-professional pole will
not<00:05:50.650> last<00:05:51.010> any<00:05:51.400> less<00:05:51.970> time<00:05:52.300> it's<00:05:52.450> not<00:05:52.570> got<00:05:52.780> a

built-in obsolescence it's not made of a

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.080 
built-in obsolescence it's not made of a
lower<00:05:54.850> quality<00:05:55.120> it's<00:05:55.690> just<00:05:55.900> made<00:05:56.080> of<00:05:56.320> a

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
lower quality it's just made of a

qualities<00:06:00.310> of<00:06:00.580> rigidity<00:06:01.170> now<00:06:02.170> just<00:06:02.860> with<00:06:03.040> the

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
qualities of rigidity now just with the

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160 
qualities of rigidity now just with the
number<00:06:03.370> one<00:06:03.490> section<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.180> you<00:06:04.810> can<00:06:04.930> do<00:06:05.020> all

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
there you have it the molder pole X 30

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.420 
there you have it the molder pole X 30
foot<00:06:15.760> 20<00:06:16.600> foot<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:16.990> effectively<00:06:17.800> a<00:06:18.010> 10<00:06:18.280> foot
