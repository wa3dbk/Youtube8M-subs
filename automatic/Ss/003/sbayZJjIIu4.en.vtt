then<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.920> top<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.240> dry<00:02:12.450> suits

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
then on top of that I have the dry suits

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.450 
then on top of that I have the dry suits
if<00:02:13.080> you're<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.470> vertical<00:02:13.860> position<00:02:13.950> and

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
if you're in the vertical position and

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.060 
if you're in the vertical position and
you<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.180> go<00:02:15.510> down<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:16.020> lot<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.290> pressure<00:02:16.590> push

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
you just go down a lot of pressure push

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.650 
you just go down a lot of pressure push
the<00:02:17.280> air<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:17.760> suit<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.000> what's<00:02:18.510> that

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
the air on my suit and what's that

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.410 
the air on my suit and what's that
thankfully<00:02:19.850> echo<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.790> tighten<00:02:24.180> up<00:02:24.240> the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
thankfully echo and then tighten up the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.210 
thankfully echo and then tighten up the
belt<00:02:24.540> right<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.350> waist<00:02:25.530> we<00:02:25.830> tend<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.070> wear

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
belt right on the waist we tend to wear

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.500 
belt right on the waist we tend to wear
our<00:02:26.340> belts<00:02:26.610> alright<00:02:26.880> get<00:02:27.030> some<00:02:27.060> wonderful

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
our belts alright get some wonderful

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.670 
our belts alright get some wonderful
things

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:46.750 

it's<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.770> pretty<00:02:35.980> weird<00:02:36.220> looking<00:02:36.550> contraption

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.650 

so<00:02:47.760> be<00:02:48.000> 2500<00:02:48.690> waste<00:02:49.130> three<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.220> each<00:02:50.660> ankle

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
so be 2500 waste three on each ankle

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.200 
so be 2500 waste three on each ankle
maybe<00:02:52.110> three<00:02:52.650> or<00:02:52.680> four<00:02:53.040> at<00:02:53.160> each<00:02:53.280> pocket<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
maybe three or four at each pocket and

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.690 
maybe three or four at each pocket and
that<00:02:55.170> will<00:02:55.380> actually<00:02:55.590> give<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.130> stability<00:02:56.370> in

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
that will actually give you stability in

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.820 
that will actually give you stability in
the<00:02:56.790> water<00:02:56.970> these<00:02:57.900> shoes<00:02:58.110> if<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.320> run<00:02:58.470> into<00:02:58.710> as

the water these shoes if you run into as

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.740 
the water these shoes if you run into as
well<00:02:59.070> as<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.910> under<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.150> water<00:03:00.330> didn't

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
well as you get under the water didn't

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.220 
well as you get under the water didn't
have<00:03:00.900> enough<00:03:01.170> iyong<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:02.280> get<00:03:02.550> back<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
have enough iyong to get back on the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.500 
have enough iyong to get back on the
issue<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:04.920> as<00:03:05.400> because<00:03:05.670> as<00:03:05.820> go<00:03:06.120> deeper

issue is that up as because as go deeper

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.250 
issue is that up as because as go deeper

down<00:03:12.780> you'll<00:03:13.500> have<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.769> work<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.040> lot<00:03:14.159> harder<00:03:14.190> to

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
down you'll have to work a lot harder to

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:45.960 
down you'll have to work a lot harder to
get<00:03:14.670> back<00:03:14.909> up<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.330> right

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.380 

push<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.090> up<00:03:50.500> well<00:03:51.500> what's<00:03:51.710> that

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
push it up well what's that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.950 
push it up well what's that
I'm<00:03:54.140> very<00:03:54.380> buoyant<00:03:54.740> and<00:03:55.270> I'll<00:03:56.270> be<00:03:56.420> snorkeling

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
I'm very buoyant and I'll be snorkeling

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.950 
I'm very buoyant and I'll be snorkeling
definitely<00:03:57.620> on<00:03:57.740> the<00:03:57.830> surface<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.780> key

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
definitely on the surface the the key

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.680 
definitely on the surface the the key
thing<00:04:00.200> is<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.350> keep<00:04:00.590> my<00:04:00.770> feet<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.400> my<00:04:02.000> fins<00:04:02.300> in

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
thing is to keep my feet and my fins in

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.570 
thing is to keep my feet and my fins in
the<00:04:02.959> water<00:04:03.140> column<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:03.770> that<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.040> have<00:04:04.220> strength

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
the water column so that I have strength

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.430 
the water column so that I have strength
when<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:04.880> actually<00:04:05.720> move<00:04:05.930> through<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.200> water

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
when I actually move through the water

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.170 
when I actually move through the water
because<00:04:07.100> if<00:04:07.250> they're<00:04:07.370> flailing<00:04:07.760> about<00:04:07.850> on<00:04:08.090> the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
because if they're flailing about on the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.030 
because if they're flailing about on the
surface<00:04:08.360> I<00:04:08.810> don't<00:04:09.290> have<00:04:09.440> any<00:04:09.620> strength<00:04:09.920> or

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
surface I don't have any strength or

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.729 
surface I don't have any strength or
power<00:04:10.420> so<00:04:11.420> we<00:04:11.600> have<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.870> put<00:04:12.050> ankle<00:04:12.350> weights<00:04:12.530> on

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
power so we have to put ankle weights on

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.340 
power so we have to put ankle weights on
at<00:04:12.890> least<00:04:12.980> 2<00:04:13.220> pounds<00:04:13.580> per<00:04:13.850> ankle<00:04:14.660> extreme

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
at least 2 pounds per ankle extreme

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.990 
at least 2 pounds per ankle extreme
snorkeling<00:04:15.950> in<00:04:16.070> Antarctica<00:04:16.549> is<00:04:16.609> gonna<00:04:16.850> be<00:04:16.970> a

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
snorkeling in Antarctica is gonna be a

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.849 
snorkeling in Antarctica is gonna be a
lot<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.329> work<00:04:17.510> it's<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.989> lot<00:04:18.140> easier<00:04:18.380> when<00:04:18.709> you

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
lot of work it's a lot easier when you

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.650 
lot of work it's a lot easier when you
can<00:04:18.890> just<00:04:19.130> put<00:04:19.370> on<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.519> three-quarter<00:04:20.299> shorty

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
can just put on a three-quarter shorty

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.870 
can just put on a three-quarter shorty
wetsuit<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:21.500> go<00:04:21.650> I<00:04:21.919> think<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.430> suit<00:04:22.760> is

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
wetsuit and go I think the suit is

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.150 
wetsuit and go I think the suit is
really<00:04:23.120> comfortable<00:04:23.750> feels<00:04:24.350> really<00:04:24.680> good<00:04:24.860> a

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
really comfortable feels really good a

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.680 
really comfortable feels really good a
big<00:04:25.610> part<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.940> it<00:04:26.060> is<00:04:26.150> just<00:04:26.419> trying<00:04:26.660> to

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
big part of it is just trying to

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.990 
big part of it is just trying to
understand<00:04:27.110> how<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.290> suit<00:04:27.590> performs<00:04:28.100> because

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
understand how the suit performs because

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.190 
understand how the suit performs because
I<00:04:29.090> really<00:04:29.330> don't<00:04:29.540> want<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.780> be<00:04:29.900> in<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.050> position

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
I really don't want to be in a position

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.960 
I really don't want to be in a position
where<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.620> can't<00:04:31.040> do<00:04:31.220> anything<00:04:31.430> when<00:04:31.669> I<00:04:31.700> get<00:04:31.880> in

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
where I can't do anything when I get in

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.390 
where I can't do anything when I get in
the<00:04:32.030> water<00:04:32.060> down<00:04:32.390> there<00:04:32.919> but<00:04:33.919> I<00:04:33.950> still<00:04:34.220> think

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
the water down there but I still think

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.500 
the water down there but I still think
it's<00:04:34.490> gonna<00:04:34.580> be<00:04:34.730> a<00:04:34.760> learning<00:04:34.880> curve<00:04:35.090> for<00:04:35.270> me

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
it's gonna be a learning curve for me

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.020 
it's gonna be a learning curve for me
even<00:04:35.720> so
