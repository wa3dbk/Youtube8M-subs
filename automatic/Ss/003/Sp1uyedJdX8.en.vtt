00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:10.099
 hello to all living community 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.519
 I want to make a small announcement 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.519
 test I have long wanted to test 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.270
 representative 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.260
 well, or let's say one of the best 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.510
 Representative outside the Russian Federation and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.570
 one representative exactly Russian 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 federation that is comes domestic 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.090
 knife yes and not a good knife from calling him 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.719
 Western representatives need all the time 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.850
 I wanted to do it because everything 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.149
 Nozhemany for some reason do not like 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:55.460
 our knives love except ours 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:59.160
 cities and loves exactly some kind of outside 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:04.559
 Well, I do not know myself for me this is a new potion 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.260
 not as I have never done such tests 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.479
 like yes we never compare ours 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:17.340
 knives from our western but I've always been 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:21.630
 it's curious here recently was 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:30.170
 news to the wizard bought from the wedge 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:34.110
 masters papakhi here is damask steel 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:43.380
 and of course everyone respected and all 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:51.770
 favorite knife fallkniven f1 to all too 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:54.299
 he is known in the prize winners 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.619
 Granny in my opinion ranked second 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:03.160
 if my memory serves me well 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:06.490
 I want to test these two knives 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.910
 test for sustainability 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:17.770
 cutting edge on some side 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:28.240
 load cut control 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:35.770
 on hold ergonomics 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:40.030
 straight some hard as Sasha will not 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:44.260
 it's a pity to test because it's a knife for 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.360
 knife, I think it is not decent money worth 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.090
 straight in the trash kill him I do not know enough 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:56.530
 do i have a spirit well try try u 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:01.730
 touch you button-type cut products 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:06.470
 scratch with the opening holes can not 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:10.970
 be even a tin hide tin well and 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.830
 Well, that kind of look at 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.410
 who as well as what opportunities will be and who 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.940
 how to behave 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.350
 than from all over here for a long time I wanted 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.070
 I make this announcement 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:32.420

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.760
 converged on these two knives well of course u 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.920
 this knife of the wedge then steamed 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.360
 more centimeters but I think nothing 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.940
 scary but who has any thoughts 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.470
 write 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.050

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.430
 how to check or go necessarily 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.819
 do or 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.910
 write write is not interesting if someone 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.150
 it is also interesting that's as it should be the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.640
 maybe broad tests have been lead 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.370

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.790
