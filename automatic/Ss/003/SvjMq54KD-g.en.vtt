00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.120
 as gathered around by the pc games 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.870
 hardware and it's almost there and me 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.330
 show you today the dell op 27 15 k 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.460
 this is the first 5km monitor for 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.199
 PC users and certainly for players 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.210
 suitable so that is the dell op 27 15 km 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.500
 visually reminiscent in all its splendor 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.539
 the strong in the apple thunderbolt 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.769
 displays with the big difference that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.620
 the resolution is twice as high 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.670
 namely 5120 times 2880 pixels 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.200
 you can see well that the whole 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.540
 neatly small is at 100 degrees 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.450
 percent of scribes in windows me 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.910
 show you the steam window that is 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.090
 in the standard library 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.969
 Detailansicht here on the left is a list 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.070
 which consists of over 150 games and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.030
 nevertheless you do not have to scroll anymore 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.789
 so every amount of content fits on this 27 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.129
 inch big screen slightly easier 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.799
 you can tell the whole thing when you have the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.119
 Raster view chooses the team 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.780
 Even then, the games fit very well 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.180
 Conveniently on a screen and you can 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.990
 find everything much easier 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.390
 back to the desktop and now 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.119
 I'll show you the browser and that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.970
 in my case google chrome at 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.689
 Standard 100 scale the pc games 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.689
 hardware side 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.630
 very bright all very clearly much 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.340
 content on one side but just 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.780
 because of the small font size then 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.759
 also difficult to read 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.170
 either the 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.369
 scribes at windows high too 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.500
 set or even just in the browser 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.229
 to use the zoom function 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.509
 that's now the sum of 200 that 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.110
 then corresponds approximately to the view as 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.100
 would you get the resolution 2.560 x 14 40 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.659
 use pixel 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.910
 But we come to the actual 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.610
 interesting to play the goalgetter 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.470
 told me we need more pixel 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.229
 and that's why I have here now 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.330
 the native resolution is set 5120 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.580
 times 2880 pixels 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.130
 Let's go into the game and see if 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.140
 the whole the ball 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:21.019
 play god wants the standard map room uk 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.000
 Let's go in the upper left corner 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.060
 Let's take a look at the frame 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.790
 counter throw that's about 35 to 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.459
 40 fps that is quite bearable and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.780
 the picture is drawn pleasantly sharp 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.700
 even if you are here at the fence 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.110
 For example, still quite a 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.720
 can recognize a little bit of edge flicker 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.610
 That is the fact that I owe 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.880
 no no edge smoothing no anti 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.700
 Aliasing use that is on the one hand in 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.799
 gold simulator a little bit magic and to 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.570
 The whole thing would not be the same to others 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:55.070
 more playable but very fun 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.019
 goat simulation is definitely one 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.299
 example that you also in 5 k 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.850
 can play fluently if the thing 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.370
 is desired slides again briefly me 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.600
 down 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.380
 and after that I show you that too 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.380
 can look very different 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.010
 classic skyrim this time by the way 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.519
 completely without mods that's why it looks 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.120
 all a bit sad for it but in 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.099
 five k 3 k and eight times msa so all 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.870
 really did look like licked 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.150
 and if I get moving now 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.250
 then you see if, for example 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.620
 an archway here or 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.720
 in the gate and on the tree in the background 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.739
 that there really is no flicker too 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.439
 Discover is and the performances with 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:42.769
 about between 30 and 50 fps depending on 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:46.480
 playing situation for leisurely play 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.919
 how it came out that was still acceptable 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.510
 who made it difficult , though 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.790
 that's why, of course , most of them have it 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.730
 likely to meet players could 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.780
 possibly at its limits 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.900
 by the way, kraftkarte is currently sitting down 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.900
 then heavily overclocked geforce gtx 79 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.420
 he is shift we stand at the cliff 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.530
 together with Lara croft and look us 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.410
 trader the reboot in 53 can without 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.560
 edge smoothing and without traffics h 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.900
 effects and we can see and rapeseed 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.370
 counter in the upper left corner and 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.380
 it is still a picture in itself 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.560
 very happy even if it is 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.860
 impressive but looks tomb raider 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.450
 time very clear that far from it 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.770
 all play chosen ready for 5 ks 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.780
 there is just the framerate yet 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.700
 framerate still too low there it 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.290
 need for optimization da resp 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.220
 you need sli or crossfire 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.830
 system always reasonably acceptable 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.490
 frame rates to come that was it 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.610
 as far as the del op 27 15 k extreme guy 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.040
 lofalk gaming monitor more to the 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.750
 Technology details like no type pc 3 lest 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.820
 her in the article we attach to this video 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.260
 and see you at the next monitor 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.260
 or other check until then
