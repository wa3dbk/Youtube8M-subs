okay let me introduce our tangible earth

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.730 
okay let me introduce our tangible earth
is<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.500> word<00:00:19.859> first<00:00:20.279> interactive<00:00:21.000> digital

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
is a word first interactive digital

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.359 
is a word first interactive digital
globe<00:00:23.990> its<00:00:24.990> interactive<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.070> sense<00:00:26.279> that

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
globe its interactive in the sense that

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.689 
globe its interactive in the sense that
you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:27.060> spin<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:28.560> any<00:00:28.830> direction<00:00:29.220> like

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
you can spin it to any direction like

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.170 
you can spin it to any direction like
this<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.630> rotate<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.700> borderline

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
this you can rotate the borderline

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.830 
this you can rotate the borderline
between<00:00:33.210> daylight<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.340> shade<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:36.210> real<00:00:36.540> time

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
between daylight in shade it's real time

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.880 
between daylight in shade it's real time
so<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.280> tell<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:39.360> which<00:00:39.719> area<00:00:39.989> the

around<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.910> whole<00:03:23.910> globe<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.560> see<00:03:25.769> it's

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
around the whole globe you can see it's
