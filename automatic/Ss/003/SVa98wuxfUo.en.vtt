00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.530 
good thing though is that the rockers
all<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.220> way<00:02:39.310> across<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.730> top<00:02:39.760> I<00:02:40.180> smash<00:02:40.510> it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
all the way across the top I smash it

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.780 
all the way across the top I smash it
with<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.840> screwdriver<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.590> they're<00:02:42.160> solid<00:02:42.580> so

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
with a screwdriver and they're solid so

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.750 
with a screwdriver and they're solid so
I'm<00:02:43.090> hoping<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.510> only<00:02:43.600> have<00:02:43.750> placed<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.380> bottom

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
I'm hoping I only have placed the bottom

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.510 
I'm hoping I only have placed the bottom
the<00:02:45.760> bottom<00:02:45.910> half<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.480> rockers<00:02:47.520> but

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
the bottom half of the rockers but

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.550 
the bottom half of the rockers but
that's<00:02:48.640> going<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:48.940> another<00:02:49.120> day<00:02:49.560> but

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
that's going to be another day but

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.940 
that's going to be another day but
that's<00:02:50.739> that's<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.310> for<00:02:51.610> today<00:02:51.850> we<00:02:52.060> got<00:02:52.180> -<00:02:52.950> we
