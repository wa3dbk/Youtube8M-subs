00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello on this occasion we will set 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.160
 and install the bnc server service for 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.879
 that then first we open our 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.879
 terminal window 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.769
 we enter as superuser 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.000
 and once blocked as superuser 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.830
 we are going to install the package 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.030
 We can do it with yum install 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.760
 the name of the stnc rnc package 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.329
 then asterisk so that auto completes and 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.770
 do not 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.220
 the argument for him to tell him everything 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.450
 pressed enter and then he will start the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.690
 our installation process 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.690
 package 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.620
 says he installed two ready 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.180
 when finished, we verify that if 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.770
 be complete 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.200
 after that 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.030
 let's edit the file 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.740
 configuration this file what 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.520
 we found in 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.520
 etc 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.619
 cisco 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.060
 BNC be bills and there we will find 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.470
 the venice configuration file 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.860
 then the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.170
 let's add two lines similar to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 these from here 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.830
 but we will add our 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.740
 own parameters then they 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.730
 we comment and the first thing will be then 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.870
 bnc server 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.130
 I'll just quote the port number 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.130
 which I want to enter, I want 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.110
 enter through port 1 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.550
 the username that I want what 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.200
 guide me through the user student 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.200
 why I am what at this moment 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.530
 I also put on toiletry 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
 lgs 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.800
 the brackets 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.360
 equal the port number for what 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.360
 I want to enter 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.650
 same 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:33.010
 in what is the size that I want that 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.189
 be in the window I want it to be a 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.549
 window just like the one that says there of 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.549
 800 x 600 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.110
 I close the quotes verified that everything 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.150
 be well and once this is done pressure 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.819
 escape two points and the X for 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.189
 save the changes well 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.329
 after having done this in the 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.329
 next step will be 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.920
 to open the port, then from the user 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.040
 why we want to achieve us then 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.600
 we take home as a student and now 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.640
 that I'm like studios I 'm going to open the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.820
 port for which I want to achieve that 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.490
 I do it with bnc servert spaces two 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.350
 points and the port number whereby 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.270
 me in this case is 1 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.270
 he pressed enter and in the company i 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.849
 and he will start to charge us 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.849
 archive 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.480
 well now I will put it nc peace w 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.160
 points 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.560
 again 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.570
 I want to put a password to this 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.320
 soccer check to this port 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.330
 then I put the password verify 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.630
 password 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.940
 and he comes and tells me that he's ready 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.450
 now I believe it again as 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.450
 Super user 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.930
 well once achieved as superuser 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.200
 then the next step 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.170
 to download our firewall service 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.750
 imputable stop 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.980
 then there is already our 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.690
 firewall and followed this is going to be 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:28.010
 restart or look at the was at service 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.200
 interest service bnc server status 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.520
 to look at what he was in service 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.880
 at that moment he tells me that he is 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.160
 running then I want it 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:42.400
 restart because I made changes 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.400
 then restart it start 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.510
 well once done this once this 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.919
 then I'm going to look at the adapter because 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.680
 I am with virtual machine then 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.169
 I need a static ip then I'm going to 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.000
 adapter settings look me 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:08.360
 I'm going to the route etc if it's config network - 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.110
 script 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.110
 and there 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.100
 name 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.330
 of the card 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:23.680
 enter and he opens the file to me then 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:28.650
 I here had already added my ip the ip 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.650
 from the server and added the mask 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.620
 static ok now I'm going to my machine 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.620
 client 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.260
 here and then equally I have to 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.260
 put it if you're by 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.410
 per virtual machine then make sure 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.410
 that is erased internal 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:59.360
 and put a static ip 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:03.139
 and already with our in that alive 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.230
 I'm going to put the server ip 160 x 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.290
 points 0.1 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:11.680
 and two points and the port whereby 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.050
 I want you to know what I tell you then 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.640
 I do not say Chinese and asks me 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.130
 verification password that has 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.870
 put previously I put my password and 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.870
 as you can see the here already shows me 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.530
 the machine from my windows machine me 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.530
 sample 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.930
 to my machine that I told him to 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.720
 what will make my server good that has been 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.030
 all for now remember that you have to 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.800

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.879
 leave at the bottom
