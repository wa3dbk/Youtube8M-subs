00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.780 

okay<00:00:05.140> so<00:00:05.200> you're<00:00:05.560> going<00:00:05.740> to<00:00:05.890> start<00:00:06.310> by<00:00:06.550> taking

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
okay so you're going to start by taking

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.690 
okay so you're going to start by taking
your<00:00:07.320> 3/4<00:00:08.320> yard<00:00:08.590> lengths<00:00:09.100> of<00:00:09.280> different

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
your 3/4 yard lengths of different

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.109 
your 3/4 yard lengths of different
colors<00:00:10.120> and<00:00:10.389> bringing<00:00:10.990> it<00:00:11.139> underneath<00:00:11.469> and

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:12.119 
colors and bringing it underneath and

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.359 
colors and bringing it underneath and
then<00:00:13.119> double<00:00:14.110> check<00:00:14.139> to<00:00:14.559> make<00:00:14.709> sure<00:00:14.770> that<00:00:15.190> it's

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:15.369 
then double check to make sure that it's

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.150 
then double check to make sure that it's
centered<00:00:16.240> more<00:00:16.840> or<00:00:17.020> less<00:00:17.289> it<00:00:17.529> doesn't<00:00:17.860> have<00:00:18.010> to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
centered more or less it doesn't have to

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.370 
centered more or less it doesn't have to
be<00:00:18.279> perfect<00:00:18.880> then<00:00:19.840> you're<00:00:19.990> going<00:00:20.110> to<00:00:20.170> make

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
be perfect then you're going to make

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.370 
be perfect then you're going to make
your<00:00:20.620> first<00:00:20.920> stitch<00:00:21.520> so<00:00:22.450> keeping<00:00:23.110> your

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
your first stitch so keeping your

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.880 
your first stitch so keeping your
threads<00:00:24.040> on<00:00:24.190> either<00:00:24.370> side<00:00:25.710> you're<00:00:26.710> going<00:00:26.830> to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
threads on either side you're going to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.069 
threads on either side you're going to
take<00:00:27.270> your<00:00:28.270> left<00:00:28.480> end<00:00:29.760> bring<00:00:30.760> it<00:00:30.910> across<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
take your left end bring it across and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.390 
take your left end bring it across and
underneath<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.320> right<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:37.090> so<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:38.400> then

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
underneath the right like so and then

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.500 
underneath the right like so and then
you're<00:00:39.520> going<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:39.700> take<00:00:39.940> your<00:00:40.120> right<00:00:42.510> grouping

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
you're going to take your right grouping

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.510 
you're going to take your right grouping
and<00:00:43.720> bring<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.320> underneath<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:45.130> through<00:00:45.370> so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
and bring it underneath and through so

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.130 
and bring it underneath and through so
I'm<00:00:45.610> going<00:00:45.820> underneath<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.510> leather<00:00:46.720> and

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
I'm going underneath the leather and

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.090 
I'm going underneath the leather and
through<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:48.340> Q<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:48.970> you<00:00:49.090> just<00:00:49.329> made<00:00:49.600> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
through the Q that you just made and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.290 
through the Q that you just made and
bringing<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.250> through<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:53.040> then<00:00:54.040> pulling<00:00:55.030> it

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
bringing it through and then pulling it

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.010 
bringing it through and then pulling it
tight<00:00:56.880> and<00:00:57.880> you're<00:00:58.120> gonna<00:00:58.239> do<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.660> same

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
tight and you're gonna do the same

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.330 
tight and you're gonna do the same
direction<00:00:59.469> each<00:01:00.100> time<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.719> again<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:02.320> have<00:01:03.309> my

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
direction each time so again I have my

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.080 
direction each time so again I have my
two<00:01:04.320> groupings<00:01:05.320> on<00:01:05.560> either<00:01:05.710> side<00:01:07.649> you<00:01:08.649> bring

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
two groupings on either side you bring

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.379 
two groupings on either side you bring
your<00:01:10.090> left<00:01:10.329> across<00:01:10.929> the<00:01:11.200> leather<00:01:11.439> and

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:12.389 
your left across the leather and

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:14.879 
your left across the leather and
underneath<00:01:13.389> your<00:01:13.689> right<00:01:13.869> hand<00:01:14.170> grouping<00:01:14.709> and

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:14.889 
underneath your right hand grouping and

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:17.660 
underneath your right hand grouping and
then<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.819> take<00:01:16.090> your<00:01:16.270> right<00:01:16.479> hand<00:01:16.509> grouping

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
then you take your right hand grouping

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.519 
then you take your right hand grouping
and<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:19.209> see<00:01:19.389> how<00:01:19.539> it<00:01:19.630> forms<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:19.990> cross<00:01:20.259> right

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:20.529 
and you see how it forms a cross right

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:23.940 
and you see how it forms a cross right
here<00:01:20.590> or<00:01:21.219> a<00:01:21.249> t<00:01:21.789> plus<00:01:22.299> sign<00:01:22.709> you're<00:01:23.709> going<00:01:23.859> to

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
here or a t plus sign you're going to

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.289 
here or a t plus sign you're going to
bring<00:01:24.159> it<00:01:24.369> through<00:01:24.819> the<00:01:25.270> plus<00:01:25.569> sign<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:27.299> out

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
bring it through the plus sign and out

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.279 
bring it through the plus sign and out
the<00:01:29.020> loop

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.529 

and<00:01:33.289> then<00:01:33.409> pull<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.070> taut<00:01:34.340> make<00:01:34.670> sure<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.420> you

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
and then pull it taut make sure that you

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.420 
and then pull it taut make sure that you
don't<00:01:35.719> have<00:01:35.840> any<00:01:36.110> looping<00:01:36.500> out<00:01:36.710> because<00:01:37.250> that

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
don't have any looping out because that

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.499 
don't have any looping out because that
will<00:01:37.670> affect<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.270> way<00:01:38.770> your<00:01:39.770> ladder<00:01:40.509> forms

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
will affect the way your ladder forms

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.359 
will affect the way your ladder forms
and<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.929> might<00:01:42.079> move<00:01:42.320> up<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.679> down<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:43.189> little

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
and it might move up and down a little

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.100 
and it might move up and down a little
bit<00:01:43.640> as<00:01:43.789> you<00:01:43.909> start<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.600> farther<00:01:44.869> down

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
bit as you start but the farther down

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.700 
bit as you start but the farther down
you<00:01:45.140> go

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
you go

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.169 
you go
it'll<00:01:45.950> get<00:01:46.130> locked<00:01:46.369> in<00:01:46.549> place<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.090> will

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
it'll get locked in place and it will

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.990 
it'll get locked in place and it will
stop<00:01:47.420> moving<00:01:47.600> around<00:01:49.750> so<00:01:50.890> left<00:01:51.890> over<00:01:52.789> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
stop moving around so left over the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.429 
stop moving around so left over the
leather<00:01:54.640> under<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.789> right<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.360> then<00:01:57.170> bring

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
leather under the right and then bring

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.749 
leather under the right and then bring
the<00:01:57.590> right<00:01:59.170> through<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.319> plus<00:02:00.590> sign<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.280> out

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
the right through the plus sign and out

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.529 
the right through the plus sign and out
the<00:02:02.030> Q<00:02:05.470> okay<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:07.490> since<00:02:07.729> you're<00:02:07.880> using<00:02:08.119> three

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
the Q okay and since you're using three

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.389 
the Q okay and since you're using three
do<00:02:08.959> just<00:02:09.229> stop<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.619> take<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.799> time<00:02:09.950> to

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
do just stop and take the time to

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.470 
do just stop and take the time to
tighten<00:02:10.840> all<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:12.200> your<00:02:12.380> threads<00:02:13.209> otherwise<00:02:14.209> it

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
tighten all of your threads otherwise it

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.720 
tighten all of your threads otherwise it
will<00:02:14.569> be<00:02:14.720> lumpy<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:16.250> can<00:02:16.400> see<00:02:16.579> it's

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
will be lumpy and you can see it's

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:26.039 
will be lumpy and you can see it's
already<00:02:16.940> starting<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.569> spiral

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.620 

over

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.040 

and<00:02:30.990> then<00:02:31.440> your<00:02:32.160> chords<00:02:32.820> are<00:02:33.090> going<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.480> end<00:02:33.810> up

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and then your chords are going to end up

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.080 
and then your chords are going to end up
flipping<00:02:34.530> around<00:02:34.860> because<00:02:35.520> you're<00:02:35.670> making<00:02:35.820> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
flipping around because you're making a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.270 
flipping around because you're making a
spiral<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.860> want<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.160> keep<00:02:40.280> making

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
spiral and you just want to keep making

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.670 
spiral and you just want to keep making
the<00:02:41.940> knot<00:02:42.120> on<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.780> same<00:02:42.990> side<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:44.000> eventually

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
the knot on the same side so eventually

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.240 
the knot on the same side so eventually
it's<00:02:46.680> going<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.950> flip<00:02:47.130> around<00:02:47.310> entirely<00:02:49.250> so

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
it's going to flip around entirely so

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.480 
it's going to flip around entirely so
right<00:02:50.520> here<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:54.240> can<00:02:54.270> see<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:55.080> twist<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.220> just

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
right here you can see the twist is just

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.890 
right here you can see the twist is just
bringing<00:02:56.970> these<00:02:57.150> cords<00:02:57.480> around<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.780> other

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
bringing these cords around the other

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.410 
bringing these cords around the other
side<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.890> want<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.130> go<00:02:59.280> with<00:02:59.460> it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.380 

accomodate<00:03:03.420> for<00:03:03.600> your<00:03:03.720> spiral<00:03:04.070> and<00:03:05.390> keep

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
accomodate for your spiral and keep

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.080 
accomodate for your spiral and keep
going<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.860> same<00:03:08.070> side<00:03:08.370> don't<00:03:08.820> switch

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
going on the same side don't switch

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.820 
going on the same side don't switch
sides<00:03:09.390> otherwise<00:03:09.930> you're<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.380> reverse

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
sides otherwise you're going to reverse

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:25.080 
sides otherwise you're going to reverse
your<00:03:11.010> spiral<00:03:11.990> and<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.110> will<00:03:13.290> look<00:03:13.500> funny

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.920 

when<00:03:25.660> in<00:03:25.810> doubt<00:03:25.959> always<00:03:26.500> reverse<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:28.540> easier

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
when in doubt always reverse it's easier

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.140 
when in doubt always reverse it's easier
to<00:03:29.200> undo<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.739> on<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.040> spot<00:03:30.340> than<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.760> realize

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
to undo it on the spot than to realize

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.540 
to undo it on the spot than to realize
that<00:03:31.420> you've<00:03:32.349> made<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.620> mistake<00:03:32.800> when<00:03:33.370> you're

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
that you've made a mistake when you're

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.780 
that you've made a mistake when you're
four<00:03:34.000> stitches<00:03:34.330> down
