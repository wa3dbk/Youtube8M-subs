00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
that was born out of being in the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.689 
that was born out of being in the
moments<00:00:54.500> where<00:00:54.649> I<00:00:54.680> almost<00:00:54.890> forgot<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.399> level

of depression when I was going through a

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.720 
of depression when I was going through a
lot<00:00:57.199> of<00:00:57.260> purchases<00:00:57.890> but<00:00:58.100> then<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.309> lot<00:00:58.579> of
