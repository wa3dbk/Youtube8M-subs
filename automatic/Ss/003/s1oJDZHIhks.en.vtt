00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.360
 hi guys and between 2015 is the show 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.750
 Microsoft operators have just approved 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.730
 elite dangerous in xbox one version 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.139
 you know that I love this game madly 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.820
 and I must say that the frontier boys 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.040
 they really did an excellent job 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.960
 to bring this game to the console 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.789
 of microsoft the pad of xbox one 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.020
 surprisingly control and mine more 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.230
 optimistic expectations 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.730
 it works really well i don't 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.280
 I thought the game would be 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.219
 easily adaptable because i 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.190
 true eric d'angelis fans normally 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.440
 they play with a hotas type joystick in 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.069
 this case everything must be played 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.139
 on the xbox one pad because the joystick 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:52.260
 hotas is not compatible with the console 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:54.239
 microsoft but the way in which i 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.809
 developers have mapped the controls 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.929
 on the bug the xbox one really works at 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.719
 great I played the tutorial so I have 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.120
 made some fights and I have to say 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.399
 that I was really impressed 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.110
 from how everything works in a way 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.430
 really fluid 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.950
 moreover it must be said that at the level 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.799
 graph is clearly not a 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.479
 game with tremendous graphics for strained but 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.259
 on a graphic level he makes his own figure 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.549
 so we can say of a conversion 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.840
 were successful at those fronts were 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.079
 really done a great job 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.990
 unfortunately there will not be a shared world 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.890
 despite the growing integration between 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.409
 xbox one and pc players not pc 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.109
 will be able to share the same world with 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.210
 xbox swan players and also are two 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:44.670
 separate games so if you have the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.700
 pc version you will not be able to pass 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.520
 free to the xbox one version but 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.100
 if you haven't tried this game yet 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.590
 you have an xbox one and you are curious about 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.740
 try it well the conversion makes 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.899
 really justice to the original product 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.319
 for PC then you can play it safe 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.280
 the title works great also on 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.439
 xbox fan 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.649
 I believe I have said everything if you are 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.860
 waiting for this game on consoles 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.590
 we can say that 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.900
 finally, we are calm 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.130
 because it works really well and the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.310
 passage to the pad 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.340
 not so traumatic see you at 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.340
 next
