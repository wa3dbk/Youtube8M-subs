close-up talking about using a thing

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.299 
close-up talking about using a thing
called<00:00:44.149> one<00:00:44.390> finger<00:00:44.809> per<00:00:44.840> fret<00:00:44.989> rule<00:00:45.530> which

called one finger per fret rule which

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.680 
called one finger per fret rule which
helps<00:00:46.579> you<00:00:46.730> navigate<00:00:46.969> around<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.540> fretboard

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
helps you navigate around the fretboard

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.690 
helps you navigate around the fretboard
and<00:00:47.989> play<00:00:48.170> things<00:00:48.469> it<00:00:48.680> much<00:00:48.829> more<00:00:49.430> smoothly

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
and play things it much more smoothly

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.340 
and play things it much more smoothly
than<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:50.510> does<00:00:50.629> flying<00:00:50.899> around<00:00:51.050> with<00:00:51.200> one

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
than it does flying around with one

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.630 
than it does flying around with one
finger<00:00:51.559> all<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:51.860> time<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.309> it's<00:00:52.460> pretty

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
finger all the time and it's pretty

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.100 
finger all the time and it's pretty
essential<00:00:52.879> technique<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:53.660> although<00:00:53.870> this<00:00:54.050> is

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
essential technique so although this is

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.380 
essential technique so although this is
quite<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.500> simple<00:00:55.430> little<00:00:55.670> tune<00:00:55.850> for<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.149> two

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
quite a simple little tune for you two

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.310 
quite a simple little tune for you two
to<00:00:57.320> get<00:00:57.500> hopefully<00:00:58.899> you'll<00:00:59.899> get<00:01:00.020> something<00:01:00.199> a

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
to get hopefully you'll get something a

to get hopefully you'll get something a
bit<00:01:00.500> as<00:01:00.590> well

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
maybe classical guitar this would be

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.050 
maybe classical guitar this would be
called<00:01:45.619> like<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:45.920> second<00:01:46.310> position<00:01:46.759> don't

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
called like the second position don't

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.340 
called like the second position don't
get<00:01:47.479> too<00:01:47.630> much<00:01:47.780> involved<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.259> but

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
get too much involved in it but

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.020 
get too much involved in it but
basically<00:01:48.680> your<00:01:48.829> first<00:01:49.040> finger<00:01:49.399> because

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
basically your first finger because

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.980 
basically your first finger because
you're<00:01:50.119> not<00:01:50.180> playing<00:01:50.390> anything<00:01:50.540> at<00:01:50.689> fret<00:01:50.840> one

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
you're not playing anything at fret one

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.389 
you're not playing anything at fret one
your<00:01:51.140> first<00:01:51.320> finger<00:01:51.590> can<00:01:51.710> take<00:01:51.890> up<00:01:52.070> care<00:01:52.310> of

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
your first finger can take up care of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.730 
your first finger can take up care of
all<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.579> notes<00:01:52.759> of<00:01:52.970> fret<00:01:53.180> -<00:01:53.390> second<00:01:54.380> finger<00:01:54.619> of

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
all the notes of fret - second finger of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.310 
all the notes of fret - second finger of
the<00:01:55.369> fret<00:01:55.579> three<00:01:55.880> third<00:01:56.420> finger<00:01:56.780> at<00:01:56.899> fret<00:01:57.079> four

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
the fret three third finger at fret four

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.719 
the fret three third finger at fret four
and<00:01:57.560> if<00:01:57.649> we<00:01:57.860> were<00:01:57.950> gonna<00:01:58.250> but<00:01:58.460> we're<00:01:58.549> not

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
and if we were gonna but we're not

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.219 
and if we were gonna but we're not
playing<00:01:58.939> at<00:01:59.329> fret<00:01:59.479> 5<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.840> could<00:01:59.990> use<00:02:00.140> your

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
playing at fret 5 you could use your

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.010 
playing at fret 5 you could use your
little<00:02:00.380> finger<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.460> by<00:02:01.880> doing<00:02:01.939> this<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.750> stops

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
little finger so by doing this it stops

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.870 
little finger so by doing this it stops
you<00:02:03.170> flying<00:02:03.500> all<00:02:03.770> around<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:04.159> fretboard<00:02:04.369> with

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
you flying all around the fretboard with

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.130 
you flying all around the fretboard with
one<00:02:05.090> finger<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.969> other<00:02:08.000> reason<00:02:08.899> for<00:02:08.929> not

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
one finger and the other reason for not

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.449 
one finger and the other reason for not
flying<00:02:09.350> around<00:02:09.470> one<00:02:09.709> finger<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.040> as<00:02:10.220> soon<00:02:10.340> as

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
flying around one finger is as soon as

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.160 
flying around one finger is as soon as
you've<00:02:10.549> made<00:02:10.759> no<00:02:11.030> move<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.629> next<00:02:11.780> one<00:02:11.989> that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
you've made no move to the next one that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.449 
you've made no move to the next one that
note<00:02:12.500> guys<00:02:12.739> because<00:02:13.010> you've<00:02:13.129> lifted<00:02:13.250> your

lesson up on how to read tab and rhythm

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.410 
lesson up on how to read tab and rhythm
on<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.580> site<00:02:38.790> so<00:02:39.030> check<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.270> out

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
on the on the site so check that out

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.920 
on the on the site so check that out
first

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
first

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.780 
first
but<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:41.040> think<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.400> fret<00:02:41.550> rule<00:02:41.730> is

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
but this one think of a fret rule is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.890 
but this one think of a fret rule is
quite<00:02:41.940> useful<00:02:42.120> because<00:02:42.360> if<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.569> start<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
quite useful because if I start the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.930 
quite useful because if I start the
third<00:02:43.080> fret<00:02:43.290> my<00:02:43.470> on<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> string<00:02:44.489> with<00:02:44.910> my

third fret my on the a string with my
second<00:02:45.450> finger<00:02:45.600> when<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> go<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.130> next<00:02:47.310> note

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
second finger when I go to the next note

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.979 
second finger when I go to the next note
which<00:02:47.730> happens<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.120> be<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.390> second<00:02:48.720> fret<00:02:48.870> of
