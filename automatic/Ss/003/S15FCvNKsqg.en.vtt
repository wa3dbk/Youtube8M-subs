part<00:01:05.660> of<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.930> pair<00:01:06.640> Rocha<00:01:07.640> my<00:01:07.880> colleague<00:01:08.270> from

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
part of a pair Rocha my colleague from

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.230 
part of a pair Rocha my colleague from
BBC<00:01:08.780> Persian<00:01:09.380> TV<00:01:09.770> join<00:01:10.130> me<00:01:10.310> on<00:01:10.400> court<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:11.000> try

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
BBC Persian TV join me on court to try

BBC Persian TV join me on court to try
it<00:01:11.300> out

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
it out

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.670 
it out
well<00:01:13.550> I<00:01:13.580> think<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.180> best<00:01:14.360> tip<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:15.020> doubles

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
well I think the best tip a doubles

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.680 
well I think the best tip a doubles
partnership<00:01:16.220> like<00:01:16.400> yourself<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:17.000> probably<00:01:17.420> to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
partnership like yourself is probably to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.720 
partnership like yourself is probably to
be<00:01:17.900> great<00:01:18.380> communicators<00:01:19.220> with<00:01:19.370> each<00:01:19.490> other

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
be great communicators with each other

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:30.690 
be great communicators with each other
so<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:21.020> think<00:01:21.320> there's<00:01:21.530> only<00:01:21.560> two<00:01:21.860> words<00:01:22.040> then

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.190 

it's<00:01:31.700> soon<00:01:32.119> clear<00:01:32.150> there's<00:01:32.900> room<00:01:33.170> for

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
it's soon clear there's room for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.340 
it's soon clear there's room for
improvement

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.960 

once<00:01:39.350> we<00:01:39.590> warm<00:01:39.800> up<00:01:39.920> though<00:01:40.160> we<00:01:40.400> really<00:01:40.670> get

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
once we warm up though we really get

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:51.140 
once we warm up though we really get
into<00:01:41.330> it

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.060 

well<00:01:52.150> we've<00:01:52.750> got<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:52.930> way<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.200> go<00:01:53.500> Roche<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.950> I
