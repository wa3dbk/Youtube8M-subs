00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
to get out of the house because it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.069 
to get out of the house because it's
amazing<00:00:32.759> how<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.360> kind<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.840> in

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
amazing how you can kind of get up in

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.299 
amazing how you can kind of get up in
your<00:00:34.110> head<00:00:34.230> with<00:00:34.649> kind<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> issues<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
your head with kind of issues and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.770 
your head with kind of issues and
thinking<00:00:35.880> about<00:00:35.969> all<00:00:36.210> these<00:00:36.329> things<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.630> have

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
thinking about all these things you have

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.010 
thinking about all these things you have
to<00:00:36.899> accomplish<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:38.300> staying<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.989> place

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
to accomplish and staying in one place

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.470 
to accomplish and staying in one place
and<00:00:40.710> trying<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> get<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.640> work<00:00:41.910> done<00:00:42.180> can

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and trying to get all that work done can

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.779 
and trying to get all that work done can
often<00:00:42.960> sometimes<00:00:43.860> end<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.309> being<00:00:44.550> detrimental

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
often sometimes end up being detrimental

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.720 
often sometimes end up being detrimental
to<00:00:45.270> actually<00:00:45.840> achieving<00:00:46.230> those<00:00:47.160> goals<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
to actually achieving those goals and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.069 
to actually achieving those goals and
making<00:00:48.030> progress<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:48.960> it's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
making progress so I think it's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.360 
making progress so I think it's
important<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.500> kind<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.739> give<00:00:49.920> yourself<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
important to kind of give yourself a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.920 
important to kind of give yourself a
break<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.789> walk<00:00:51.030> out<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.360> honestly<00:00:51.629> get

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
break just walk out and honestly get

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.139 
break just walk out and honestly get
fresh<00:00:52.199> air<00:00:52.440> even<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:52.980> cold<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.460> because

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
fresh air even if it's cold out because

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.200 
fresh air even if it's cold out because
if<00:00:54.270> nothing<00:00:54.570> else<00:00:54.719> it'll<00:00:55.320> make<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.579> warmth<00:00:56.969> of

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
if nothing else it'll make the warmth of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.160 
if nothing else it'll make the warmth of
your<00:00:57.329> home<00:00:57.890> feel<00:00:59.149> much<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.390> inviting<00:01:00.719> and

your home feel much more inviting and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.149 
your home feel much more inviting and
conducive<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.550> producing<00:01:03.510> work<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
conducive to producing work so I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.000 
conducive to producing work so I
definitely<00:01:06.049> benefit<00:01:07.049> from<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.560> taking<00:01:07.920> a
