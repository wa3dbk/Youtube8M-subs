shredding of the car and the second is

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.410 
shredding of the car and the second is

begins the shredding process by being

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
begins the shredding process by being
lifted<00:01:44.490> onto<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.940> shredder<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.960> it's

lifted onto the shredder here it's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.900

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.440 
enters the separation process certain
metals<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.190> iron<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.700> steel<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.119> removed

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
metals like iron and steel are removed

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.270 
metals like iron and steel are removed
as<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.810> shredded<00:02:10.259> material<00:02:10.649> passes<00:02:11.009> under<00:02:11.250> a

powerful magnet these metals stick to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.140 
powerful magnet these metals stick to
the<00:02:13.560> magnet<00:02:13.709> while<00:02:14.220> all<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.459> other<00:02:14.610> materials

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the magnet while all the other materials

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.880 
the magnet while all the other materials
continue<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.170> other<00:02:16.320> separation

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
continue on to the other separation

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.520 
continue on to the other separation
processes<00:02:17.360> then<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.690> non-magnetic<00:02:19.260> metals

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
processes then the non-magnetic metals

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.650 
processes then the non-magnetic metals
like<00:02:19.860> copper<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.610> aluminum<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.150> separated

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
like copper and aluminum are separated

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.810 
like copper and aluminum are separated
what<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.260> left<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.770> plastics<00:02:23.250> rubber<00:02:23.580> and

what is left the plastics rubber and
glass<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:24.390> called<00:02:24.600> fluff<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.100> then

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
glass are called fluff this is then

as<00:02:37.980> scrap<00:02:38.070> metal<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.910> turned<00:02:39.150> into<00:02:39.299> new

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
as scrap metal and turned into new

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.199 
as scrap metal and turned into new
products<00:02:39.989> maybe<00:02:40.230> even<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.680> new<00:02:40.709> car<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.180> I

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
products maybe even a new car so I

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.030 
products maybe even a new car so I
actually<00:02:42.450> turned<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:42.959> my<00:02:43.080> own<00:02:43.260> family<00:02:43.500> vehicle

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
actually turned in my own family vehicle

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.030 
actually turned in my own family vehicle
to<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.250> program<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.940> was<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> 1995<00:02:46.260> Honda<00:02:46.530> Accord

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
to the program I was a 1995 Honda Accord

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.680 
to the program I was a 1995 Honda Accord
that<00:02:47.220> my<00:02:47.280> wife<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.700> owned<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.209> nine<00:02:48.360> or<00:02:48.390> ten

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
that my wife and I owned for nine or ten

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.750 
that my wife and I owned for nine or ten
years<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.500> actually<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.920> was<00:02:50.040> difficult<00:02:50.250> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
years it actually it was difficult to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.009 
years it actually it was difficult to
turn<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.150> in<00:02:51.299> because<00:02:51.570> there<00:02:51.690> was<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.840> lot<00:02:51.989> of

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
turn it in because there was a lot of

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.680 
turn it in because there was a lot of
family<00:02:52.470> memories<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.519> car<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.420> was<00:02:54.570> our

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
family memories in the car it was our

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
hospital in it so when I went to to see

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.300 
hospital in it so when I went to to see
it<00:03:00.690> shredded<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.350> didn't<00:03:01.590> really<00:03:01.890> know<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> tooth

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
it shredded I didn't really know a tooth

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.100 
it shredded I didn't really know a tooth
spec<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.970> thought<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.450> was<00:03:03.630> hoping<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:03.989> I

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
spec that I thought I was hoping that I

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.500 
spec that I thought I was hoping that I
could<00:03:04.170> hold<00:03:04.680> back<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.010> tears<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.820> actually<00:03:06.450> I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
could hold back the tears and actually I

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.690 
could hold back the tears and actually I
was<00:03:06.959> able<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.739> knew<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.130> what<00:03:08.489> we<00:03:08.580> were

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
was able to and I knew that what we were

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.990 
was able to and I knew that what we were
doing<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.060> was<00:03:09.150> what's<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> right<00:03:09.900> choice
