00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.510
 member and tell your cat that can make it 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.059
 2 plays two examples of the card 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.240
 this one 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.640
 in the race 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.800
 at the same time the party states 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.429
 but I am something else 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.429
 the last years of the country 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.339
 the water is 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.339
 this one is a bit easier to use, it has nothing left 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.930
 is not that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.530
 and you have a rustic you agree 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.580
 they demand that he go fast mine so that he can fire 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.380
 the air I attached here 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.190
 and this would have been made here and the claim is not over yet 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.270
 and so if you attract attention 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.350
 zuidplas shoot through the complaint of 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.390
 at first you don't always feel like it 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.980
 look behind now 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.990
 and sits in a tower 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.720
 the tight white dots that you get there on time 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.410
 but probably goes up 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.060
 that was 11 percent that state this site that is in eighth place 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.100
 this actually 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.500
 goes flat 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
 and then you have to start again 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.090
 therefore goes fast 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.110
 it's here 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.810
 and no that can run 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.940
 making this program 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.520
 you must do you can 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.450
 two pieces smaller 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.480
 and put out tea bags in the mp3 dot klm 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.230
 that's why i think 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.230
 sit in it and can turn and pull 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.570
 second class stronger 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.650
 marca at this resumes for the first time 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.010
 wherever I am and from there with a lot worse cut 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.290
 and all this rule 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.590
 these are a few clever ways and then on this blog it was done with 4 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.450
 m 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.359
 this test is easy to clean 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:14.279
 you have now retained your own, so you are going to make percent 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:18.989
 and then with the leader everything was picking up again how difficult it is 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.759
 although these two are falling apart 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.759
 and there are years to follow how they don't make each other disappear 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.079
 the starting times the weekly that the 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.539
 and you can of course put a lot of effort into becoming the us 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.489
 what the children learn 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.469
 to crawl 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.469
 that goes here like that 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:44.839
 please 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:46.540
 these tuttlingen praise
