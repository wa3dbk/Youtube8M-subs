00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:14.689
 Halo Reach as well as possible show as they the start bar of Windows 7 its 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.609
 wish to be able to adapt accordingly 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.789
 a video that the same theme for XP and Vista but not 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.769
 Are you ready for the online 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.920
 she is supposed to perform this and that Windows 7 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.179
 who occasionally wait for the start 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.909
 so it wants a vacant apprenticeship from this approve next to these own this 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:32.620
 position 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.530
 because clicking on the right mouse button then get into the context here 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.110
 a 3 3 managed since you can not get big result is the only answer 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.020
 we get 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.290
 against it again 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.360
 then get the properties of taskbar in the start menu so far 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420
 Of course she is also on this topic 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.540
 But control can be so much faster 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.630
 if they come into the control panel then of course now in Qatar that 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.630
 Click Start Menu and at the end click here to customize 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.710
 we are already there we can push that the right side can not do that 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.600
 is hidden because we can simultaneously 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.230
 the stable states and now just want to see what we want to remove speak here 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.850
 for example matter pictures 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 Next to it we also have the entry Pictures 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.300
 Being able to vote in joke as few ads has luck of ads 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.920
 or the item never shows 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.340
 What do you think of statements then just want 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.340
 Element never show 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.550
 Still, of course, is still going on, but Edin is on 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.440
 what about you with this computer 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.130
 since the drives on and other shot 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.090
 connected hardware well that can be quite useful 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.160
 Documents 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.770
 One can think about downloading documents from the Reds the above 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.780
 Download so for example each displayed because that may need 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.730
 because many download from the internet 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.730
 otherwise we still have that in the world 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.909
 Devices and brokers you probably do not need that often 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.640
 not necessarily be here directly in the start menu 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.069
 if I ever want to access a printer you guys that we reforms 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.649
 Applications 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.879
 or even if I add something new then I have one too 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.619
 the time to control the whole system 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.669
 So far, the shock in the adolescents only makes sense if I the 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.139
 Standard printer 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.769
 or just want to change a stone on the other standard program 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.689
 Rider under or how it really is not sooner or later 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.009
 more 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.859
 All programs started so Ten let completely rest based on individual music 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.989
 otherwise Iran is involved 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.510
 assorted musicians like here the water sometimes menacing even way 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.469
 toss out 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.239
 personal folders 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.469
 after that with another 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.239
 Programs - search the gallery m 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.549
 Games are not displayed their system administration 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.469
 tv recordings are also not displayed as far as they are 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.750
 Tv record here around the rubble want 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.750
 you have to show something 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.769
 We do not have videos in there 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.669
 and then 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.769
 last in the wind Â»highlight program okay let's do that 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.479
 so have been the kicker on the hotel buildings 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.779
 take over 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.779
 and now we should already have the first change here 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.889
 Now we can see very well that we at least download them 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.129
 should have specified and how much downloads from the Internet the Galician 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.129
 much faster 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.359
 access it 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.359
 Of course you could also directly from the browser 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.329
 doubled in this case but not bad 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.579
 Of course we are not limited to these entries 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.859
 but we can also adapt them elsewhere, for example 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.859
 two here on the example of music that's why I just let it in 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.220
 click here on the right mouse button arrived in the context menu on the one hand the 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.539
 Possibility to name the whole 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:57.669
 that's what we music, too 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.199
 my 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.469
 legal 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.849
 security 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.459
 Copy 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.749
 can do 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:11.430
 and of course you can do the whole thing on a completely different one as well 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.719
 refer to how to right-click on the mouse 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.699
 then on the properties then they see here and where this Shopgate mine 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.490
 Songs themselves as copies Insight and that at the moment quite normal in Mainhausen 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.009
 Directory or in a user directory 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.650
 and there in the folder own music 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.759
 but not everybody necessarily wants his complete one 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:31.800
 backups 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.520
 lie on the CD disc but the lie may be connected in the 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.920
 Old buildings or on any USB hard drive or even on an external hard drive 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.420
 but not necessarily always there 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.420
 furthermore, natural ones can easily add another folder 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.909
 it's just 15m away 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:51.790
 Take hope 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.720
 Now ZMP is now there and if I want that then points then 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.559
 I have to do it all 1 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.689
 Set storage location 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.960
 One has the catch at this moment of some music 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.080
 demanded ten percent 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.029
 then the adopted mothers will be okay clicked 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.629
 why no now 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.239
 the Bartnik left then of course opens Explorer and I'm right 

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:18.159
 on september 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.469
 actually in my library 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.469
 but this points beside it now 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.900
 so in honor of change possibilities because start
