Tiago so was I'm gonna go ahead and say

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.709 
Tiago so was I'm gonna go ahead and say
that<00:02:45.340> right<00:02:45.459> now<00:02:45.489> Thiago<00:02:45.909> Silva<00:02:45.939> is<00:02:46.329> a<00:02:46.359> better

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:46.719 
that right now Thiago Silva is a better

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.659 
that right now Thiago Silva is a better
possible<00:02:47.230> because<00:02:47.439> Thiago<00:02:47.709> Silva<00:02:47.799> is<00:02:48.129> insane

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:48.669 
possible because Thiago Silva is insane

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.089 
possible because Thiago Silva is insane
passer<00:02:48.969> but<00:02:49.719> it<00:02:49.840> was<00:02:49.989> decent<00:02:50.200> his<00:02:50.650> passing<00:02:51.069> was

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099

I mean it was a bit inconsistent as

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.129 
I mean it was a bit inconsistent as
dribbling<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.269> know<00:02:58.359> sometimes<00:02:58.750> you'd<00:02:58.930> find

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
dribbling you know sometimes you'd find

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.599

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
it easy you'd be able to beat five or

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.879 
it easy you'd be able to beat five or
six<00:03:00.760> players<00:03:00.969> sometimes<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.290> just<00:03:02.530> feel<00:03:02.829> a

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
six players sometimes you just feel a

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.679 
six players sometimes you just feel a
bit<00:03:03.159> sluggish<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.760> you'd<00:03:03.909> lose<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.299> ball<00:03:04.449> on

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689
