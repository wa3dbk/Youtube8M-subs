this<00:00:08.910> new<00:00:09.090> 8800<00:00:09.719> GT<00:00:09.750> s<00:00:10.139> from<00:00:10.349> EVGA<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.070> not<00:00:11.250> just

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
this new 8800 GT s from EVGA is not just

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.150 
this new 8800 GT s from EVGA is not just
fast<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:12.269> super<00:00:12.660> super<00:00:12.840> clocked<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.980> is

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
fast it's super super clocked and it is

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.240 
fast it's super super clocked and it is
in<00:00:14.509> sane<00:00:15.509> now<00:00:16.109> way<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> specs<00:00:17.100> on

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
in sane now way to here the specs on

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.760 
in sane now way to here the specs on
this<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:18.090> 8800<00:00:18.720> GT<00:00:18.779> s<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.350> end<00:00:19.500> all

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
this one it is the 8800 GT s to end all

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.070 
this one it is the 8800 GT s to end all
8800<00:00:20.640> GT<00:00:20.670> s<00:00:21.060> cards<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.720> know<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> thought<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
8800 GT s cards you know I thought that

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.080 
8800 GT s cards you know I thought that
was<00:00:22.170> gonna<00:00:22.260> be<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> fatality<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.670> this

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
was gonna be the fatality but then this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.429 
was gonna be the fatality but then this
one<00:00:24.269> came<00:00:24.390> out<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> super<00:00:25.019> super<00:00:25.260> clock

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
one came out it's the super super clock

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.650 
one came out it's the super super clock
it<00:00:25.800> has<00:00:25.949> more<00:00:26.099> RAM<00:00:26.369> than<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> fatality<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.510> has

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it has more RAM than the fatality it has

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.870 
it has more RAM than the fatality it has
more<00:00:27.810> RAM<00:00:28.080> than<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> 8800<00:00:28.980> GT<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.789> it

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
more RAM than the 8800 GT and it

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.650 
more RAM than the 8800 GT and it
actually<00:00:30.359> beats<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.289> 8800<00:00:32.009> GT<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.510> about

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
actually beats the 8800 GT in just about

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.160 
actually beats the 8800 GT in just about
every<00:00:33.989> test<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:35.010> beats<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.550> crisis<00:00:36.180> not

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
every test and it beats it in crisis not

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.799 
every test and it beats it in crisis not
by<00:00:37.320> much<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.800> enough<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.640> make<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.270> difference

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
by much but enough to make a difference

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.270 
by much but enough to make a difference
so<00:00:40.020> let's<00:00:40.440> talk<00:00:41.280> about<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.239> EVGA<00:00:43.050> 8800<00:00:43.800> GT<00:00:43.829> s

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
so let's talk about the EVGA 8800 GT s

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.029 
so let's talk about the EVGA 8800 GT s
SSC<00:00:45.210> Edition<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:47.070> card<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.520> clocked<00:00:48.390> at

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
SSC Edition now this card is clocked at

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.310 
SSC Edition now this card is clocked at
576<00:00:50.039> megahertz<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.910> 1<00:00:51.420> mega<00:00:51.600> hurt<00:00:51.870> 1

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
576 megahertz that is 1 mega hurt 1

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
576 megahertz that is 1 mega hurt 1
megahertz<00:00:52.620> higher<00:00:52.920> than<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> stock<00:00:53.789> clock<00:00:54.059> on

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
megahertz higher than the stock clock on

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.950 
megahertz higher than the stock clock on
the<00:00:54.719> 8800<00:00:55.289> GTS<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.100> mean<00:00:56.340> GTX<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the 8800 GTS I mean GTX so it's a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
the 8800 GTS I mean GTX so it's a
monster<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.460> else<00:00:59.550> does<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.940> well

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
monster now what else does it have well

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.170 
monster now what else does it have well
it<00:01:00.420> has<00:01:00.570> GD<00:01:01.370> ddr3<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.550> has<00:01:02.670> six<00:01:02.879> hundred

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
it has GD ddr3 and it has six hundred

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.609 
it has GD ddr3 and it has six hundred
and<00:01:03.239> forty<00:01:03.390> megabytes<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.229> more

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and forty megabytes of it that's more

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
and forty megabytes of it that's more
that's<00:01:05.280> more<00:01:05.700> than<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.540> GT<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.799> that's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that's more than the GT so that's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.170 
that's more than the GT so that's
awesome<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.610> well

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
awesome as well

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.859 
awesome as well
now<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.340> bandwidth<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> 320<00:01:12.270> bits<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
now the bandwidth on this is 320 bits so

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.770 
now the bandwidth on this is 320 bits so
you<00:01:12.900> got<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> higher<00:01:13.880> bandwidth<00:01:14.880> as<00:01:15.030> well<00:01:15.240> so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
you got a higher bandwidth as well so

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.510 
you got a higher bandwidth as well so
that<00:01:15.930> also<00:01:16.170> helps<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> stream

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that also helps and the stream

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
that also helps and the stream
processors<00:01:18.240> let's<00:01:18.420> talk<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> stream

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
processors let's talk about the stream

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.840 
processors let's talk about the stream
processors<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.920> actually<00:01:20.250> started<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> big

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
processors I actually started a big

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.700 
processors I actually started a big
argument<00:01:21.030> today<00:01:21.479> about<00:01:21.659> stream<00:01:22.229> processors

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
argument today about stream processors

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.090 
argument today about stream processors
now<00:01:23.299> on<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.780> websites<00:01:25.020> you're<00:01:25.740> gonna<00:01:25.830> see

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
now on all the websites you're gonna see

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.330 
now on all the websites you're gonna see
that<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> says<00:01:26.729> 96<00:01:27.210> stream<00:01:27.990> processors<00:01:28.619> well

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
that it says 96 stream processors well

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.719 
that it says 96 stream processors well
it<00:01:29.670> has<00:01:30.150> 112<00:01:30.990> I'm<00:01:31.500> saying<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.610> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it has 112 I'm saying it right here it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.200 
it has 112 I'm saying it right here it
has<00:01:33.320> 112<00:01:34.320> stream<00:01:34.650> processors<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
has 112 stream processors that's the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.510 
has 112 stream processors that's the
same<00:01:36.450> amount<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.810> stream<00:01:36.990> processors<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
same amount of stream processors as you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.690 
same amount of stream processors as you
see<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.720> 8800<00:01:40.619> GT<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.310> that's<00:01:41.430> where<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
see on the 8800 GT and that's where the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
see on the 8800 GT and that's where the
GT<00:01:42.030> had<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.540> little<00:01:43.259> bit<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> an<00:01:43.590> edge<00:01:43.799> before

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
GT had a little bit of an edge before

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.420 
GT had a little bit of an edge before
well<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:45.149> anymore<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.079> now<00:01:46.320> has<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
well not anymore this one now has the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
well not anymore this one now has the
edge<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.210> everybody<00:01:48.990> else's<00:01:49.200> website<00:01:49.409> on

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
edge now on everybody else's website on

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.100 
edge now on everybody else's website on

our website and even on EVGA website it

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.920 
our website and even on EVGA website it
says<00:01:52.259> 96<00:01:52.979> plus<00:01:53.460> why<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:54.840> the

ones<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.770> only<00:02:04.890> has<00:02:05.070> 96<00:02:05.430> stream<00:02:05.820> processors

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
ones that only has 96 stream processors

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210 
ones that only has 96 stream processors
when<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.899> run<00:02:07.049> those<00:02:07.200> two<00:02:07.380> together<00:02:07.530> it'll

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
when you run those two together it'll

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.400 
when you run those two together it'll
run<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> card<00:02:09.420> with<00:02:09.660> 96<00:02:10.200> stream

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
run like a card with 96 stream

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.080 
run like a card with 96 stream
processors<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.250> order<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.489> eliminate<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
processors so in order to eliminate the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.890 
processors so in order to eliminate the
confusion<00:02:12.239> they<00:02:12.540> put<00:02:12.720> 96

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
confusion they put 96

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.229 
confusion they put 96
but<00:02:14.260> we<00:02:14.799> know<00:02:14.920> what<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.159> plus<00:02:15.370> means<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.970> means

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
but we know what the plus means it means

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.770 
but we know what the plus means it means
power<00:02:16.659> all<00:02:17.530> right<00:02:17.709> now<00:02:18.250> also<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.879> memory

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
power all right now also the memory

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.339 
power all right now also the memory
clock<00:02:19.989> on<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.319> is<00:02:20.500> at<00:02:21.810> 1800<00:02:22.810> megahertz<00:02:23.019> and

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
clock on this is at 1800 megahertz and

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.740

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
the shader clock is at 1350 so all in

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.809 
the shader clock is at 1350 so all in
all<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:26.200> an<00:02:26.349> insane<00:02:26.709> card<00:02:27.040> it's<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.310> fastest

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
all it's an insane card it's the fastest

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.880 
all it's an insane card it's the fastest
GTS<00:02:28.209> out<00:02:28.420> there<00:02:28.599> it's<00:02:28.959> got<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.140> most<00:02:29.349> RAM<00:02:29.590> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
GTS out there it's got the most RAM the

most stream processors and yeah it's you

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.069 
most stream processors and yeah it's you
know<00:02:33.790> when<00:02:33.909> you<00:02:33.970> look<00:02:34.060> at<00:02:34.209> this<00:02:34.269> card<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.599> of

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
know when you look at this card and of

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.539 
know when you look at this card and of
think<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.590> doesn't<00:02:35.859> look<00:02:35.950> any<00:02:36.099> faster<00:02:36.430> than

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
think it doesn't look any faster than

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.190 
think it doesn't look any faster than
the<00:02:36.609> other<00:02:36.730> ones<00:02:36.879> looks<00:02:37.359> are<00:02:37.480> deceiving<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:38.079> is

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
the other ones looks are deceiving it is

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.420 
the other ones looks are deceiving it is
let's<00:02:38.470> take<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.620> look<00:02:38.739> at<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:38.890> specs<00:02:39.129> and<00:02:39.310> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
let's take a look at the specs and the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.039 
let's take a look at the specs and the
benchmarks<00:02:39.939> all<00:02:40.569> right

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
benchmarks all right

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.830 
benchmarks all right
first<00:02:42.040> off<00:02:42.250> let's<00:02:42.970> talk<00:02:43.239> about<00:02:43.299> what's<00:02:43.780> going

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
first off let's talk about what's going

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.809 
first off let's talk about what's going
on<00:02:44.170> with<00:02:44.530> crisis<00:02:45.310> that's<00:02:45.400> what<00:02:45.549> everybody

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
on with crisis that's what everybody

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.860 
on with crisis that's what everybody
wants<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> know<00:02:46.150> that's<00:02:46.450> what<00:02:46.540> everybody's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
wants to know that's what everybody's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.640 
wants to know that's what everybody's
playing<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.769> crisis<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:48.430> 1920<00:02:49.209> by<00:02:49.329> 1200<00:02:49.659> with

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
playing in crisis at 1920 by 1200 with

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.369 
playing in crisis at 1920 by 1200 with
2x<00:02:51.209> anti-aliasing<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.269> 8x<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.049> sharbat

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
2x anti-aliasing and 8x and sharbat

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.240 
2x anti-aliasing and 8x and sharbat
filtering<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:54.220> card<00:02:54.549> gets<00:02:55.530> 17.5<00:02:56.530> frames<00:02:57.010> per

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
filtering this card gets 17.5 frames per

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.759 
filtering this card gets 17.5 frames per
second<00:02:57.670> now<00:02:58.180> let's<00:02:58.420> compare<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.260> GT

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
second now let's compare that to the GT

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.440 
second now let's compare that to the GT
the<00:02:59.980> 8800<00:03:00.579> GT<00:03:00.609> that<00:03:00.939> everybody's<00:03:01.299> been

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the 8800 GT that everybody's been

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.399 
the 8800 GT that everybody's been
talking<00:03:01.569> about<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.989> everybody's<00:03:02.290> been

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
talking about and everybody's been

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.110 
talking about and everybody's been
buying<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:03.129> card<00:03:03.370> only<00:03:03.519> gets<00:03:03.760> thirteen

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
buying that card only gets thirteen

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.030 
buying that card only gets thirteen
point<00:03:04.389> nine<00:03:04.450> frames<00:03:04.900> per<00:03:05.049> second<00:03:05.349> so<00:03:05.409> this<00:03:05.530> GTS

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
point nine frames per second so this GTS

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.360 
point nine frames per second so this GTS
beats<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.670> GT<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.750> crisis<00:03:08.260> at<00:03:08.379> high<00:03:08.500> res<00:03:08.739> okay

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
beats the GT in crisis at high res okay

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.039 
beats the GT in crisis at high res okay
what<00:03:09.549> if<00:03:09.639> we<00:03:09.790> turn<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.329> resolution<00:03:10.810> down<00:03:10.989> a

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
what if we turn the resolution down a

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.050 
what if we turn the resolution down a
little<00:03:11.319> bit<00:03:11.500> then<00:03:12.159> does<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.459> still<00:03:12.730> beat<00:03:12.909> it

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
little bit then does it still beat it

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.839 
little bit then does it still beat it
all<00:03:13.659> right<00:03:13.959> yes<00:03:14.379> it<00:03:14.560> does<00:03:14.829> with<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.579> filters

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
all right yes it does with the filters

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.550 
all right yes it does with the filters
turned<00:03:16.030> off<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.599> gets<00:03:16.810> twenty<00:03:17.109> one<00:03:17.260> point

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
turned off it gets twenty one point

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.390 
turned off it gets twenty one point
seven<00:03:18.040> frames<00:03:18.639> per<00:03:18.790> second<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.900> 8800<00:03:20.560> GT<00:03:20.739> gets

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
seven frames per second the 8800 GT gets

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.220 
seven frames per second the 8800 GT gets
twenty<00:03:21.760> point<00:03:22.000> five<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:22.629> very<00:03:22.930> still

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
twenty point five so it's very still

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.650 
twenty point five so it's very still
barely<00:03:23.440> beats<00:03:23.680> it<00:03:23.829> even<00:03:24.609> there<00:03:25.090> all<00:03:25.540> right

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
barely beats it even there all right

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.000 
barely beats it even there all right
let's<00:03:25.780> talk<00:03:25.840> about<00:03:25.930> half-life<00:03:26.290> 2<00:03:26.410> episode<00:03:26.440> 2

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
and traffic filtering so all the filters

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.580 
and traffic filtering so all the filters
up<00:03:35.139> now<00:03:36.099> this<00:03:36.280> card<00:03:36.549> got<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:36.940> hundred<00:03:37.389> and<00:03:37.629> 3.1

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
up now this card got a hundred and 3.1

the 8800

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.020 
the 8800
and<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:28.050> about<00:04:28.229> all<00:04:28.439> the<00:04:28.710> tests<00:04:29.099> and<00:04:29.280> all<00:04:29.939> the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
and just about all the tests and all the

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.309 
and just about all the tests and all the
way<00:04:30.120> down<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.449> line<00:04:30.629> and<00:04:30.749> a<00:04:30.840> lot<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.169> that's

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
way down the line and a lot of that's

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.890 
way down the line and a lot of that's
because<00:04:31.469> of<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.909> 112<00:04:32.909> stream<00:04:33.479> processors

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
because of the 112 stream processors

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.929 
because of the 112 stream processors
also<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.319> has<00:04:34.439> the<00:04:34.620> higher<00:04:35.279> bandwidth<00:04:35.729> it's<00:04:35.909> a

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:35.939 
also it has the higher bandwidth it's a

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.480 
also it has the higher bandwidth it's a
320<00:04:36.629> bit<00:04:36.749> card<00:04:37.020> as<00:04:37.169> opposed<00:04:37.379> to<00:04:37.439> 256<00:04:37.979> so<00:04:38.310> all

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
320 bit card as opposed to 256 so all

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.879 
320 bit card as opposed to 256 so all
around<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:39.270> specs<00:04:39.569> are<00:04:39.749> better<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.229> it<00:04:40.650> does

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
around the specs are better and it does

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.769 
around the specs are better and it does
run<00:04:41.129> a<00:04:41.189> little<00:04:41.370> cooler<00:04:41.669> thanks<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.599> fact

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:42.779 
run a little cooler thanks to the fact

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.179 
run a little cooler thanks to the fact
that<00:04:42.810> it's<00:04:42.990> got<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.169> larger<00:04:43.710> cooling<00:04:44.009> unit

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
that it's got a larger cooling unit

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.249 
that it's got a larger cooling unit
remember<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.789> 8800<00:04:45.449> GT<00:04:45.479> is<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:45.870> single

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
component on this you plug this in and

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.219 
component on this you plug this in and
then<00:05:33.029> you<00:05:33.120> have<00:05:33.270> component<00:05:33.719> it's<00:05:33.870> capable<00:05:34.020> of

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
then you have component it's capable of

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.740 
then you have component it's capable of
sending<00:05:34.469> a<00:05:34.620> 1080i<00:05:35.009> signal<00:05:35.490> to<00:05:35.610> your<00:05:35.729> TV<00:05:36.000> so
