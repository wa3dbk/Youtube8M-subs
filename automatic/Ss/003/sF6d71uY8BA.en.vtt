00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.470
 unfortunately from Russian soldiers 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.460
 Russian soldiers brought to our house on 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.090
 my bayonets 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:37.270
 not calm much grief much 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.640
 unrealistic hopes and my family to 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:47.469
 unfortunately did not stay away from this 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:53.140
 grief war which was started half a year 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:57.010

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.190
 my family in my house and took the most 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.000
 the expensive thing you can take from your mother is 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.009
 only son when he went to defend 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.149
 his land he had no choice 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:14.229
 he had only one choice 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:16.110
 go protect your family protect your country 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:21.100

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.709
 protect your honor dear same Russian 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.950
 women do you have another choice if you 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:31.390
 think your boys just play 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.240
 virtual game or somewhere shoot at 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.259
 training grounds and these are tactical exercises 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.890
 you are very mistaken we see here that 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:45.780
 What kind of teaching is this? 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.470
 teaching I call you to one 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.489
 I can not rewind time ago not 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.539
 I can change something in the choice 

00:01:54.489 --> 00:02:01.119
 in solutions and you can still you can 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:06.819
 explain to your sons where they are going 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:11.069
 what they do and why they do it I 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:15.580
 I am sure that not all Russian mothers and not 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.040
 all Russian soldiers are killers they 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.940
 it is also possible and sometimes not have 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:27.910
 opportunities to retreat left or right 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:31.570
 but you still have the opportunity 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.570
 a unique opportunity to find out where your 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.720
 sons today what they do and the most 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:42.870
 the main thing is to take them away if you can 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:48.930
 take away stop this stream flow 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:52.410
 echelon flow of people who are not always 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.840
 come back and not always something is possible and 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:00.790
 you and they change believe if they 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.370
 come with a sword upon us and into our land we 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.650
 We will not stand like sheep and wait until 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.190
 they will kill us we still have 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.320
 powder 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.720
 we have guys who know what 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.970
 such a war and will go well to the end 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.310
 if you do not want to load 200 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.060
 trains went to your side while you still 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:30.239
 think that only here they explode 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.550
 bombs and there are losses here I assure you 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.930
 it's not at all like that if you don't want 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:41.380
 drown in an ocean of tears in an ocean of sorrow and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.980
 in the ocean to sweat also as it touched 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.900
 me and not only you still have 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.390
 unique chance to stop it at least in 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.430
 ask your family 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.600
 tear yourself away from your kitchens pans and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.360
 entertainment programs ask 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.709
 where are your children today what are they doing and 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.019
 why are they dressed in military uniform and 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.130
 give machines believe 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:17.100
 they do n't play war games here 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:20.739
 here is a real war I'm still 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.720
 I urge you to prudence and to the fact that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:28.690
 we have connections and family ties with 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.990
 Russia we do not want war we do not want 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:37.030
 of your deaths we want peace and we want 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.789
 sovereignty of your country let us live 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.229
 quietly let us raise children and 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:48.570
