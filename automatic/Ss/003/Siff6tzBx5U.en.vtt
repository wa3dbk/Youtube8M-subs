00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.770
 listen no I was not surprised 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.450
 oddly when I was offered 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.080
 to play the beast that will seem pretty 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.710
 logical and I said yes pretty quickly 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.210
 I thought it was a good idea 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.800
 I could see this character well I 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.640
 understand why in blue I get it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.150
 proposed I find that there is a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.150
 certain logic 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.010
 I think it's a bit of my fault 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.720
 we propose this kind of role why I 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.399
 think that's the picture that I finished 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.739
 to establish through the roles that I have 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.410
 made my choices and that's rh when I was 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.450
 proposed this finally I told myself that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.000
 it was pretty enough right behind that 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.860
 for that I very quickly accepted 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.480
 I read the script anyway but already 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.380
 the idea of ​​christophe gans realizing this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.160
 movie I think it was a very 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.620
 good idea 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.460
 it was completely his universe the air 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.450
 anything that makes it twice 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.770
 call me to do the beast since 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.990
 in the pact of the wolves even though I was 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.730
 not the same beast I was the master of the 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.750
 stupid and there was something there 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.460
 had something of that ilk 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.840
 and then as soon as the name of the airy 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.400
 of arrival I thought it was 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.650
 it was completely logical and 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.450
 finally you know there are projects 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.640
 like that they have very quickly a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.320
 balance and evidence and that one 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.030
 was part of it suddenly things 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.030
 have for once been relatively fast 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.420
 I thought it was a very good 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.509
 idea yeah I found she was and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.829
 is a moment in his life of his career 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.850
 or haye again something 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.310
 I would not say a child of tain but in 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.350
 any case of almost teenagers in 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.340
 the face 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.579
 a freshness like that and at the same time 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.130
 she is a woman and so she had that 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.890
 she had this mix know after we got 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.970
 does everything does not have an explanation of 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.079
 funds reacted quite 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.210
 epidermal and there as soon as I heard 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.539
 his name I found it was a very 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.539
 good idea 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.460
 so first of all so we talk it's not 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.740
 really a mask it's a mask 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.510
 digital and for me that's the whole thing 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.740
 difference because I think if the 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.240
 project had been that I wear a mask 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.100
 actually still does jean marsh 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.290
 or as did I do not know martin 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.500
 roth in the war in the planet of 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.460
 monkeys I would not have done the movie 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.750
 that's what interested me 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.310
 it was that thanks to the new 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.900
 technology to these new technologies 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.140
 we could actually make a 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.500
 motion capture so picking up my 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.910
 actual expressions of actors and then to 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.610
 from there make a digital mask 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.620
 with which we would animate the mask 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.930
 digital of the beast 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.320
 so all of this is actually pretty faithful 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.300
 to what I did on the set then 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.770
 of course there are hairs there is a form 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.480
 of face that is different etc but 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.790
 but still I think I 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.790
 recognize more in the final result 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.690
 which is the one of the movie that if I had 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.940
 really wear a mask 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.570
 and then a mask necessarily forces to 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.340
 play everything in the eyes all in the 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.080
 voice a little bit what was laughing 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.370
 at the time and I think I kind of 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.430
 game today is completely obsolete 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.430
 and and would go very very badly 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.280
 listen, it's true that I'm not 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.780
 specialized in roles in movies 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.310
 family but yes it's good it's good 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.050
 I know I do it besides I 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.390
 want it's the first time I'm doing 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.980
 a movie like this and the first thing 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.790
 what I did is that the day we go 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.470
 show you the movie for the first 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.180
 I took my children 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.530
 I said I could not do it before 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.340
 a saw the son the type of movie that I 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.860
 did because it's open their 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.170
 violent or so with scenes a little 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.510
 explicit or with languages ​​a little 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.650
 believed and that's me it's a little bit my mark 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.410
 of all this so there all of a 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.730
 kick you were playing in something or via 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.739
 small animals running with 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.150
 big ears and where the prince 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.190
 charming takes a rose and offers it to the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.310
 Princess inevitably that's what makes me 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.310
 vacation
