 car 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.659
 2 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.870
 me 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.200
 me 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.560
 me 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.210
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.840
 Hello Be the first to start a guitar in super easy guitar Mon lecture Hiroshi was after the Kamina of 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.510
 is 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:28.530
 This time I will talk about the theme of the timing of code change 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:33.600
 Though we told way of the three faint lokes most often used in last program 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:40.019
 It's time to get a goal change way 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.380
 It would be nice if I could do a code change in an instant, but it is quite difficult in the beginning 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.670
 is 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:48.270
 Not say so 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.990
 When to change code 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.190
 When switching the code 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:01:02.480
 We will tell today that the successful or 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.019
 First of all, it's not a code change in an instant, but rather a code in front of you 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.360
 Change 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.560
 It is to say 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.820
 Specifically, for example, when changing code from c to d 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.990
 is not it 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.970
 I'm doing with power cord 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.690
 c of the end of a sentence to better it'll move to the step of d 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.690
 I will ask you 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.170
 ni 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.310
 Did you understand 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.310
 I have pulled it one more time 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:51.360
 Also Nde to La at the last up of the Jean Ja Jean Well then Chanko of up 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.700
 I'm starting to lucy to green 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.420
 Still 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.920
 So uncomfortable 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.920
 I do not think it 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.689
 In other words , if you don't care about that pansy 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.990
 It is said that I put it a little in front 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:19.470
 It is a knack of code change 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:23.610
 Because the first note is more important than the last one 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.830
 The fact that the first sound want to play as clean as possible 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:33.550
 Is it 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:36.360
 So , this time it was a very simple content, but please try it as a reference 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.360
 tai 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.950
 This show draws together the image of the future 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.950
