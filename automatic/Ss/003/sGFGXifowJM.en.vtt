00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
but - have a regular food scale and I

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880 
but - have a regular food scale and I
made<00:00:18.240> sure<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.660> weighed<00:00:18.960> them<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.560> grams

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890

so<00:00:21.560> you<00:00:22.560> know<00:00:22.680> there's<00:00:22.890> an<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.430> off<00:00:23.520> button

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
so you know there's an on and off button

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.760 
so you know there's an on and off button
here

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.310 

and<00:00:29.770> you<00:00:29.920> turn<00:00:30.130> it<00:00:30.250> on

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 

just<00:00:35.130> make<00:00:35.280> sure<00:00:35.490> it's<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.760> gram<00:00:35.970> you<00:00:36.360> know

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
just make sure it's and gram you know

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.990 
just make sure it's and gram you know
you<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:37.220> figure<00:00:38.220> out<00:00:38.250> your<00:00:38.400> buttons<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.820> have

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you just figure out your buttons I have

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.810 
you just figure out your buttons I have
anagram<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.710> use<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> small<00:00:41.340> carrier

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
anagram and then I use a small carrier

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
anagram and then I use a small carrier
there's<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.270> travel<00:00:42.660> carrier<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.740> can

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to weight them but this is how I do it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.280 
to weight them but this is how I do it
so<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.750> sure<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:49.050> scale<00:00:49.320> set<00:00:49.650> on<00:00:49.830> zero

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
so you make sure the scale set on zero

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.630 
so you make sure the scale set on zero
you<00:00:52.290> want<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> put<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> travel<00:00:53.040> carrier<00:00:53.460> on
