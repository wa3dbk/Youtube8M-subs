obviously gets some some walk rock and
you<00:02:02.539> know<00:02:02.689> for<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.590> price<00:02:03.829> I<00:02:04.819> think<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.450> is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
you know for the price I think this is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.179 
you know for the price I think this is
like<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.780> hundred<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.200> twenty-five<00:02:06.500> bucks<00:02:06.950> or

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
like a hundred and twenty-five bucks or

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.460 
like a hundred and twenty-five bucks or
something<00:02:07.310> like<00:02:07.579> that<00:02:07.929> it's<00:02:08.929> not<00:02:09.049> worth<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.410> to

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
something like that it's not worth it to

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.350 
something like that it's not worth it to
me<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.489> definitely<00:02:10.910> going<00:02:11.030> back<00:02:11.180> I
