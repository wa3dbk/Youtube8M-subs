00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.220
 how are you welcome to my channel i am 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.900
 that cozy and for avilÃ©s I bring 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.970
 new a technical video that I know that 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.099
 these videos like it very much and they 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.110
 I'm going to show my technique of how to withdraw 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.840
 the enamel to make color change 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.270
 so let's see and go to the workshop 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.240
 well I already have two red colors 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.570
 one darker than the other I have cotton 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.700
 and I'll start cutting bits 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 small the size of my nails 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.360
 I have this remover container and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.739
 you can apply it on a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 Tarrito filis apply cotton with 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.989
 remover and they will put it on their 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.989
 nails with a little pressure 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.000
 in this way they will do it in each 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.650
 one of your nails 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.490
 and we cut the cotton 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.140
 we put remover and press it 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.660
 this we are going to do in all the nails 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.760
 we wait maybe one minute two minutes 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.070
 no more because if it dries on our 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.580
 nails is going to be much more complicated than 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.920
 withdraw so let's wait 1 or 2 minutes 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.900
 we retired with a little bit of pressure and 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.150
 with a cotton that is clean with 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.020
 remover we will remove the excess 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.780
 color that we have but if you notice it and 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.060
 many of you who have then I do not know 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.970
 remove the enamel as there is no leave 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.580
 spots will be very quick to make 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.860
 our enamel change something else that 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.750
 I want to tell you here is the way 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.240
 how to remove it I see it I am 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.930
 doing with my two fingers elevate that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.970
 It makes me not ruin my enamel on 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.500
 enamel on the other side let's say in case 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.410
 that I'm removing the enamel to 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.750
 someone else if they see it in no time 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.810
 the remover or the cotton is 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.180
 catching my dreams and ready here now 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.830
 we have our nails clean I hope they 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.110
 have really liked this technique and give it 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.060
 like to this video 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.590
 for me it's a very easy technique and very 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.420
 clean of doing you in the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.610
 comments are going to tell me if they 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.470
 seemed like it or if you have a new 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.510
 technique that they can teach us all 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.520
 since I want to send you many kisses 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.330
 and hugs wholesale we'll see you in the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.330
 next video
