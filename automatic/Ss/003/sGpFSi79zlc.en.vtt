00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.380
 Warner Bros and New Line Cinema know 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.000
 as you wait for us on the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.740

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.580
 San Diego takes place in San Diego

 Want to get all the info from the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.000
 comic-con directly on our site 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.530
 okay people the story now it comes 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.240
 unbelievably sad but also somehow 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.500
 unbelievably beautiful it is determined 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.790
 indescribable as must be 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.590
 especially if losing one's parent 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.850
 you're only six then you can 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.140
 you might still share the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.030
 short time you remember with his 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.740
 parent has still spent and one 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.150
 Yeah, that's exactly what happened and he 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.460
 tells us his heartbreaking 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.950
 story when I was four years old 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.170
 my father bought me an xbox one 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.790
 from 2001 we were crazy 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.770
 a lot of fun all sorts of things 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.869
 to play games together said two 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.220
 I died years later 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.910
 the console no longer ten years 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.680
 touch 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.600
 but when I could do it again I did 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.400
 What did we notice at the time? 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.500
 Racing Rally Sports Tennis Played 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.239
 and when I restarted the round 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.100
 I found a mind in the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.570
 truest sense of the word you know 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.100
 determines that during a race the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.670
 fastest lap recorded as a guest 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.560
 becomes 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.840
 and it is exactly this spirit that still turns today 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.370
 his rounds i played and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.830
 I played the ghost once 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.330
 had passed and thus not exactly before 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.650
 the finish line stopped so that the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.019
 my father's mind not overwritten 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.120
 but now again something 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.290
 happier it will soon be new dota 2 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.120
 give characters 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.560
 eric johnson from white confirms that 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.030
 dota 2 is step by step 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.690
 correct number of the original there 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.549
 should feed 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.489
 Also, there is no reason one 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.350
 continue development or 13 because there 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.930
 two still offers enough possibilities 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.799
 to be expanded 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.450
 activision apparently about 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.709
 agree that there is a good idea it three 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.360
 years or longer at a game too 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.019
 work and sometimes too 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.340
 different 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.260
 In concrete terms, that means for us 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.230
 route network inklusion comes only on 21 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.280
 november 2014 and be with battlefield 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.739
 we can not do this year anymore 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.170
 Count Vice President Patrick SÃ¶derlund 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.430
 explains what makes activisionvalue mimics 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.930
 a certain degree that's what we too 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.549
 think more time used correctly 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.320
 the ride becomes a better one product 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.760
 So I would say that we are similar 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.290
 are aligned and that we have one 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.120
 pursue a similar approach 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.680
 but we do not quite put it down 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.010
 like he has the battlefield 4 addon 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.359
 Finals are announced for this year 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.040
 And now the news finally comes to the 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.290
 I've been so longing all the time 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:04:20.280
 I waited a good mood for the next one 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:04:21.870
 three hours at least with the 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.490
 most important gaming is last week 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.110
