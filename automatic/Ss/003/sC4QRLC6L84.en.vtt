00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.990
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.660
 another tutorial today shows you how 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.500
 your internet up to 40 times 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:30.040
 We can open faster 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.730
 our editor opened there we go 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.170
 then this code 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:49.120
 I 'm just getting bigger with it, too 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:51.910
 read font size must echo the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 taste of interface 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:01:00.629
 gcpc global autotuning level disabled 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.250
 next line break 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.080
 that's the code then he would have to 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:19.660
 is File Save As such 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:24.310
 So that's not what he calls it 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.650
 there must be only one point beati 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.980
 behind it are because otherwise saves the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.350
 Parents doubt file 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.540
 then we have the file comes the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.060
 exclude 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.040
 then I'll show you again 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.180
 So it works now 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.370
 file error 5 so I've got that 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.470
 made 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.850

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.770
 I already have internet speed here 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.550
 Singer I've already started it 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.570
 and that's why it's not so with me 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.140
 but I can pull you like it 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.050
 joke 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.220
 there comes stop now then 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.410
 came now with you after me 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.379
 come ok point and please press please 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.440
 Any key will do that 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.990
 you hit it advances just somehow taste 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:26.650
 eg duck or spacebar 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:33.600
 and then yes yes I bike short 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:37.660
 distracted I have to write advice here 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.730
 pressed any key and then 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.310
 shows how fast that is with the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.180
 download is currently still a 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.820
 a bit longer because I'm just still 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.190

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.710
 modern warfare 2 download what is there 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:58.480
 But that also helps this around 100 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.580
 kilometer part that 's already done 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.710
 and that's really shit fast 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.890
 I have to say because my internet is that 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:12.600
 otherwise la marché is just la 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:17.140
 marché and that's what I believe for everyone 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.920
 what is really cool I would think about 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.500
