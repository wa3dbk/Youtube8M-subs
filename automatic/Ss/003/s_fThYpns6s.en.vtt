00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.430 

I<00:00:37.480> recommend<00:00:38.480> creating<00:00:38.629> a<00:00:38.899> separate<00:00:39.199> calendar

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.799 
I recommend creating a separate calendar
for<00:00:39.829> each<00:00:39.980> course<00:00:40.399> if<00:00:40.579> you<00:00:40.670> teach<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.660> it's

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
for each course if you teach so it's

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.150 
for each course if you teach so it's
best<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.079> have<00:00:42.290> a<00:00:42.320> separate<00:00:42.649> calendar<00:00:42.890> for

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
best to have a separate calendar for

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.130 
best to have a separate calendar for

their due dates and assignments will be

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.729
