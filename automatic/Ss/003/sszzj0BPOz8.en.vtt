00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
original over the Nintendo Entertainment

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.679 
original over the Nintendo Entertainment
System<00:06:42.919> version<00:06:43.610> and<00:06:43.759> I<00:06:44.119> haven't<00:06:44.329> played<00:06:44.509> the

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:44.689 
System version and I haven't played the

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:46.659 
System version and I haven't played the
Atari<00:06:45.049> versions<00:06:45.679> but<00:06:45.860> I<00:06:45.889> can't<00:06:46.159> imagine<00:06:46.279> it

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
Atari versions but I can't imagine it

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.329 
Atari versions but I can't imagine it
there<00:06:46.849> any<00:06:46.999> good<00:06:47.179> the<00:06:47.749> 2600<00:06:48.559> was<00:06:48.679> not<00:06:48.860> good<00:06:49.189> for

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:49.339 
there any good the 2600 was not good for

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:51.219 
there any good the 2600 was not good for
these<00:06:49.489> kind<00:06:49.729> of<00:06:49.819> games<00:06:50.059> and<00:06:50.839> hopefully

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
these kind of games and hopefully

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:52.809 
these kind of games and hopefully
someone<00:06:51.499> gets<00:06:51.739> around<00:06:52.039> to<00:06:52.249> making<00:06:52.610> another

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
someone gets around to making another

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.600 
someone gets around to making another
one<00:06:53.029> because<00:06:53.299> I<00:06:53.509> think<00:06:53.689> it's<00:06:53.929> time<00:06:54.319> it's<00:06:55.309> time

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
one because I think it's time it's time

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.519 
one because I think it's time it's time
for<00:06:55.849> more<00:06:56.059> meatheads<00:06:56.509> with<00:06:56.749> bandanas<00:06:57.169> and

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:57.529 
for more meatheads with bandanas and

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:58.990 
for more meatheads with bandanas and
machine<00:06:57.860> guns<00:06:58.129> don't<00:06:58.429> you<00:06:58.549> think
