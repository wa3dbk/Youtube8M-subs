gun rights I respect gun rights but the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.469 
gun rights I respect gun rights but the
idea<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.580> example<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.150> couldn't<00:01:09.420> even

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
idea that for example we couldn't even

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.260 
idea that for example we couldn't even
get<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> background<00:01:10.170> check<00:01:10.680> bill<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.119> to<00:01:12.119> make

get a background check bill in to make

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.340 
get a background check bill in to make
sure<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.750> you're<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> buy<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
sure that if you're going to buy a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.830 
sure that if you're going to buy a
weapon<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.460> actually<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.570> through<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
weapon you have to actually go through a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.660 
weapon you have to actually go through a
fairly<00:01:16.320> rigorous<00:01:16.470> process<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.490> know

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
fairly rigorous process so that we know

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.450 
fairly rigorous process so that we know
who<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.939> are<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.049> can't<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.500> walk<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
who you are so you can't just walk up to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.510 
who you are so you can't just walk up to
a<00:01:20.490> store<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:23.840> buy<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> semi-automatic<00:01:25.590> weapon

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.060 

it<00:01:29.520> makes<00:01:30.000> no<00:01:30.180> sense<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:31.530> been<00:01:31.740> in

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
it makes no sense I have been in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.010 
it makes no sense I have been in
Washington<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.840> while<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:36.020> most

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
Washington for a while now and most

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.560 
Washington for a while now and most
things<00:01:37.320> don't<00:01:37.409> surprise<00:01:37.710> me<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:40.020> fact<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
things don't surprise me the fact that

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.230 
things don't surprise me the fact that
26<00:01:42.570> year<00:01:42.750> olds<00:01:43.250> were<00:01:44.250> gunned<00:01:44.579> down<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
26 year olds were gunned down in the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.280 
26 year olds were gunned down in the
most<00:01:45.479> violent<00:01:45.810> fashion<00:01:46.320> possible<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:48.290> this

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
most violent fashion possible and this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.740 
most violent fashion possible and this
town<00:01:49.590> couldn't<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.070> anything<00:01:50.250> about<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.750> was

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
town couldn't do anything about it was

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.359 
town couldn't do anything about it was
stunning<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.860> question

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
stunning to me and and so the question

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.690 
stunning to me and and so the question
then<00:01:56.399> becomes<00:01:56.790> what<00:01:57.119> can<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:57.869> about<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.700> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
then becomes what can we do about it the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
then becomes what can we do about it the
only<00:02:00.060> thing<00:02:00.240> that's<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.840> change<00:02:01.079> is

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
only thing that's going to change is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.819 
only thing that's going to change is
public<00:02:02.130> opinion<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:03.200> public<00:02:04.200> opinion<00:02:04.649> does

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
public opinion if public opinion does

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.199 
public opinion if public opinion does
not<00:02:04.979> demand<00:02:05.520> change<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.950> Congress<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.970> will

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
not demand change in Congress it will

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.330 
not demand change in Congress it will
not<00:02:09.330> change<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.020> I've<00:02:10.560> initiated<00:02:10.860> over

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
not change we have I've initiated over

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.559 
not change we have I've initiated over
20<00:02:11.730> executive<00:02:12.690> actions<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> try

20 executive actions to try

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.849 
20 executive actions to try
tighten<00:02:13.930> up<00:02:14.049> some<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.469> rules<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:14.829> the

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.879 
tighten up some of the rules in the
walls<00:02:15.099> but<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.909> bottom<00:02:16.180> line<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.989> we

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:17.889 
walls but the bottom line is is that we

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.940 
walls but the bottom line is is that we
