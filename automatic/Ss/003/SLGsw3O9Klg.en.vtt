let us start heating up and one of the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.330 
let us start heating up and one of the
more<00:01:19.920> important<00:01:20.400> things<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
more important things here is that you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.330 
more important things here is that you
don't<00:01:23.340> let<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.210> water<00:01:24.869> touch<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.680> bottom<00:01:26.189> of

don't let the water touch the bottom of
the<00:01:26.490> bowl<00:01:26.869> alright<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> next<00:01:28.140> step<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the bowl alright so the next step is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.620 
the bowl alright so the next step is
that<00:01:28.740> we're<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.369> add<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.880> tablespoon<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
little more even consistency and then

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.460 
little more even consistency and then
we're<00:01:38.790> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.150> continue<00:01:39.780> stirring<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.350> in

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
we're going to continue stirring it in

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.010 
we're going to continue stirring it in
and<00:01:40.890> let<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.070> melt<00:01:44.390> alright<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> next<00:01:45.840> step

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and let it melt alright so the next step

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.770 
and let it melt alright so the next step
is<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> we're<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.740> spray<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:48.570> wax

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
is that we're going to spray the wax

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.420 
is that we're going to spray the wax
paper<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.770> sheet

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.020 

and<00:01:53.020> now<00:01:54.020> we're<00:01:54.230> going<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.620> add<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:55.160> tablespoon

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
and now we're going to add a tablespoon

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.190 
and now we're going to add a tablespoon
of<00:01:57.430> coconut<00:01:58.430> shreds<00:01:59.980> to<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:02.420> place<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.020> wax

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
of coconut shreds to to place on the wax

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.499 
of coconut shreds to to place on the wax
paper<00:02:04.060> for<00:02:05.060> when<00:02:05.180> we<00:02:05.300> put<00:02:05.480> the<00:02:05.570> chocolate<00:02:05.750> on

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509

paper for when we put the chocolate on
all<00:02:08.509> right<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.899> next<00:02:08.929> step<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.560> once

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
all right so the next step is that once
