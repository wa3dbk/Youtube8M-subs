00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
piggy and this should have really been

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.789 
piggy and this should have really been
in<00:01:07.920> Minecraft<00:01:08.490> there's<00:01:09.180> really<00:01:09.750> no<00:01:10.020> point<00:01:10.290> for

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
in Minecraft there's really no point for

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.990 
in Minecraft there's really no point for
the<00:01:10.979> saddle<00:01:11.340> until<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> uh<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.790> not

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the saddle until now so uh I think not

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.999 
the saddle until now so uh I think not
should<00:01:15.330> implement<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.610> Minecraft<00:01:17.610> but

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
should implement this in Minecraft but

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.969 
should implement this in Minecraft but
I'm<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:20.520> missing<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.350> command<00:01:22.350> line<00:01:22.439> mod

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
I'm really missing the command line mod

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.690 
I'm really missing the command line mod
I<00:01:23.310> will<00:01:23.759> try<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.360> install<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.700> previous

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
I will try and install the previous

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.789 
I will try and install the previous
version<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> command<00:01:27.509> line<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.350> I'm<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.770> sure

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
version of command line but I'm not sure

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.300 
version of command line but I'm not sure
it<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.400> work<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.360> can't<00:01:30.689> spawn<00:01:31.310> pigs

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
