00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.169
 auxiliary is a table that serves both 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.860
 as a bedside table with wheels 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:33.309
 can serve for a child's room 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:36.940
 It can serve as a small table 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.850
 center or a corner table 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.220
 is a genre that is national have the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.800
 considerable courses may be 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.650
 overhead woods and those on the sides 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.830
 is they are 30 millimeters and only the 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.790
 15 mm center are wheels 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.790
 They are of very good quality 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.589
 by taking advantage of it being a genre that is 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.140
 National has an after-sales service 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.860
 very good since if some wood 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.590
 that is damaged by transportation 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.690
 or manufacturing or just do not 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 like how it's finished that we change the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.740
 wood at the door of your house so that 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.710
 we would send the wood to your door 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.810
 house keeping in mind that all the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.360
 woods are numbered as explained 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.940
 here in the instructions the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.710
 instructions are very simple that's why 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.950
 is that we did not do the assembly only 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.060
 it is a single leaf in short is very few 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.260
 woods 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.330
 and good 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.540
 comes with a warranty too 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.520
 where this possibility a number of 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.430
 series where they will ask you in case 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.800
 that there is some claim of all 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.080
 modes this I'm saying does not want 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.490
 say that the bed table but everything 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.160
 opposite but I'm saying that the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.970
 way and the table comes in handy and has 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.610
 an excellent after-sales service comes 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.560
 in this box that we see here 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.390
 in the box since this morning now what 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.430
 I'm raising one hand because 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.590
 obviously it's empty 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.470
 and the carriers that will take it to 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.750
 house and they will leave you in a low one or 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.470
 in the portal they will not upload them or you 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.320
 will mount on the price that you see in the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.480
 micro and I have point is they have the postage 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.570
 included home to everything that is the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.560
 Spanish peninsula we take it with the 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.850
 prices listed on the website 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.890
 let's see the measures that this likes 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.130
 much always with a human meter has 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.700
 40 centimeters 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:43.170
 background has another 40 centimeters and of 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.780
 height is about 46 47 centimeters 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.849
 it's a little table that I really like 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.220
 a lot because they are a target that are a 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.739
 white shine now we will make a few 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.700
 two first planes where we will see that 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.319
 as I would see the white is not lacquered is my 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.980
 Melamine foil is shipped from the factory 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.720
 it is not the cause it is not painted gun 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.819
 and it is once this that we repeat again 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.849
 It serves as much as a bedside table 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.049

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.670
