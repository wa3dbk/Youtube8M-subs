00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.370
 we have not hesitated to play with the request to do this thing together 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.569
 a 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:14.139
 for various reasons first of all because it's a few years ago but really 2 years 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.759
 ago it would have been unthinkable to think that in this park in this place where 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.130
 we are here and now something like this could take place 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.670
 this package was impractical even revolutionized thanks 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.630
 self-management 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.949
 from the neighborhood committee we also searched for another reason 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.949
 because today here we have the example of the true integration of the sense of 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.879
 identity and belonging to the parish we have made paths 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.410
 over the years, even with schools, these are the moments you can 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.350
 they go to seal the whole journey done previously maybe even done 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.420
 the silence that then has a public moment of this kind I want only 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.220
 remember that as for children you as a neighborhood committee 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.970
 we have put up the project friendly neighborhoods involving all the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.520
 local merchants 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.020
 in fact if you turn to the shop windows you will find a logo 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.350
 yellow you tell me if you need help get in there is a circuit that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.150
 we have created with the traders to support children 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.900
 should they need anything of any kind and this is it 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.350
 circuit we thank also gave us today's products 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.640
 here you will naturally taste all the simple and traditional products 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.720
 I believe that in the end without going beyond simplicity is the term 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.390
 just to invite this we do not expect anything in return have it 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.350
 shown and we will continue to do so always with great pleasure it will be only the beginning 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.700
 because in the summer here will be held cineforum sagre and all 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.900

 the neighborhood committee proud to have given this some availability 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.660

 almost inaccessible 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.019
