00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
but if not even on chip the fake it

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.620 
but if not even on chip the fake it
wasn't<00:01:43.570> another<00:01:43.840> kick<00:01:44.789> remote<00:01:45.789> you<00:01:46.000> so<00:01:46.300> good

it's<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.450> discouraging<00:02:00.930> situations<00:02:01.830> where

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
it's very discouraging situations where

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.190 
it's very discouraging situations where
you<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.430> ultra<00:02:02.880> focus<00:02:03.660> of<00:02:03.810> doing<00:02:04.020> all

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
you have that ultra focus of doing all

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.840 
you have that ultra focus of doing all
this<00:02:04.350> stuff<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.890> then<00:02:04.980> getting<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.520> extra

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
this stuff and then getting that extra

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.490 
this stuff and then getting that extra
chip<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.330> then<00:02:06.420> momochi<00:02:06.840> still<00:02:07.110> wins<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
chip and then momochi still wins it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.109 
chip and then momochi still wins it
after<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.860> expended<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.429> your<00:02:08.670> resources

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
after you expended all your resources

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.540 
after you expended all your resources
like<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:12.440> see<00:02:13.440> if<00:02:13.530> Tiger<00:02:13.740> can<00:02:13.920> recover<00:02:14.340> from

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
like that see if Tiger can recover from

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.280 
like that see if Tiger can recover from
that<00:02:14.760> oh<00:02:17.810> wow

that oh wow

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.980 
that oh wow
slow<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.250> fireball<00:02:25.520> damage<00:02:26.520> output<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:27.870> I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
slow can fireball damage output like I

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.480 
slow can fireball damage output like I
was<00:02:28.110> looking<00:02:28.290> for<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.680> wake-up<00:02:28.950> VP<00:02:29.460> or

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.900 
was looking for a wake-up VP or
something<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.830> oh<00:02:31.830> we<00:02:32.370> got<00:02:32.520> through<00:02:32.730> ad

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
something like that oh we got through ad

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.880 
something like that oh we got through ad
in<00:02:33.120> ultra<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.959> that's<00:02:34.260> probably<00:02:34.530> good<00:02:34.860> for

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
in ultra and that's probably good for

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.570
