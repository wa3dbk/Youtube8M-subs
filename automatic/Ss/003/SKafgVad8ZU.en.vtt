00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
down students sit down let's study math

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.369 
down students sit down let's study math
today<00:00:53.210> ok<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:56.210> I'm<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.420> start<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.899> our

today ok so I'm going to start with our

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.340 
today ok so I'm going to start with our
graphs<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.039> functions<00:00:59.120> wait<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:01.020> did<00:01:01.199> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
graphs of functions wait you did that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.160 
graphs of functions wait you did that
last<00:01:01.530> year<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.370> remember<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:03.170> and

yeah let's do our favorite topic check
the<00:01:13.290> battery<00:01:13.710> let's<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.820> started<00:01:15.180> okay<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the battery let's get started okay so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.399 
the battery let's get started okay so
it's<00:01:16.979> very<00:01:17.130> simple<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:18.390> very<00:01:18.540> easy<00:01:18.900> he's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it's very simple it's very easy he's

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.190 
it's very simple it's very easy he's
just<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> show<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.960> show

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.080 

triangle<00:01:29.240> hypotenuse<00:01:31.670> something<00:01:32.670> something

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
triangle hypotenuse something something

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.359 
triangle hypotenuse something something
you<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.930> come<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.890> studied<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you all know that come on we studied it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.120 
you all know that come on we studied it
do<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.909> need<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> tell<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.360> everything<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
do I need to tell you everything then it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.260 
do I need to tell you everything then it
in<00:01:38.250> cos<00:01:38.430> theta<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.320> x<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:42.119> all

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
in cos theta and then we have x we all

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.910 
in cos theta and then we have x we all
know<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.869> okay<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.439> don't<00:01:43.619> need<00:01:43.799> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
know on this okay so we don't need to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.149 
know on this okay so we don't need to
study<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.600> this<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.780> very<00:01:45.990> easy<00:01:46.200> what<00:01:47.040> did
