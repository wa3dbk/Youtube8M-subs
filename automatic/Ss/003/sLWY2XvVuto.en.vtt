00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
 do not 

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.790
 and you had listened to the statements of 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.900
 Yesterday 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.900
 we are watching the program 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.550
 Now I'm listening to you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.129
 you found out through twitter nothing is 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.590
 tell 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.910
 it's not that nothing nothing only by 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.140
 you and yesterday that I had been 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.419
 made a note but then there was no 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.369
 heard nothing for approving that there is 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.949
 read like good and other people too 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.349
 I was saying yesterday I think it was an angel that 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.809
 prior to you and actually what 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.220
 it was before the previous what happened here is 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.220
 that they were not fighting 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.149
 and what I had proposed to the 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.649
 people who come to live in each one of 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.850
 our houses to check that 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.839
 we are really waiting and that in 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.839
 truth really 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.539
 it's not your projection and your problem but 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.320
 I am really in anguish and I was 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.089
 really bad now for the first time 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.710
 because I separated girls for the first time 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.809
 I have worked together and what was 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.269
 the incorporation to the dancing is 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.039
 they find because now they are both in 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.080
 screen to paste the two together 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.850
 then what was the fight are 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.550
 fought among you or are still 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.490
 friends 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.240
 Yesterday they listened to us and listened to them 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.130
 good afternoon, good afternoon to say 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.409
 the barbie 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.380
 the truth is that it does not change the face when 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.250
 they mention him because he changes her but he is 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.390
 all right second I did not start it 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.539
 I did not start it on channel 13 varying 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.439
 me and saying of all of me and third the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.390
 third that I loved how I dance 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.369
 I liked how I dance and I love it but 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.720
 ailén that happened yesterday with the twitter 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.640
 because I was watching a tweet that you 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.110
 ponés when they are talking about 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.689
 issue of the breakup that are 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.619

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.069

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.659

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.759
 because it was fun but good 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.500
 people in them I did not believe it but I put it 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.990
 in fuck 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.110

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.310
 take classes they never saw each other again 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.870

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.390

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.220

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.390

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.300

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.050
 because yes because he always considers it 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.230
 well but it 's a not a stick for me it's 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.030
 a compliment to say that now now we follow 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.390
 girls almodóvar me the same with zero desire 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.240

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.650
 ailén on the mobile together face to face 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.209
 where you can say everything you want 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.720

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.190
 program but I would like to know if the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.510
 Internal between you two beyond 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.950
 the things that we have already known has 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.900
 what to do with a man who have shared 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.190
 a man who have had in common tell 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.640

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.640

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.010
 did not you share any man you 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.250
 because we still do not understand what the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.470
 verbal fight and is that there is no 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.049
 fight is all well in better solution and 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.430

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.560
 in common we do not share any name 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.370
