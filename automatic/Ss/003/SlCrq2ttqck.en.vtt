00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.320

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.580
 in the description of the video what 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.580
 download this file 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.990
 good once downloaded 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.159
 we pass it to the desk 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.190
 we open this 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.670
 and unzip it here 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.119
 good 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.590
 we go to the team we open the panel 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.250
 control 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.250
 we go to the folder 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.130
 here we let you show files and 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.490
 look at those cults 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.820
 and we uncheck this one that looks like this and 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.870
 we would apply and it would show us 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.340
 give them the file extensions 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.369
 as a result of which we copy all this 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.140
 good in different operating systems 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.659
 this file is in different 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.630
 places then so there is not 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.299
 problem we go on c and we look for them 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.909
 here the search is going to be a bit 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.770
 delayed 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.130
 we make sure we're going to find the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.130
 archive 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.950
 well here we wait for it to look like 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.390
 this file is what we have in the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.960
 desk but if it 's where we're going to 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.780
 replace as you see is in project this 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.330
 folder is the number of extras when 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.540
 we click right 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.160
 and open location here is where we're going to 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.320

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.800
 has a backup first of our 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.800
 departure 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.990
 we do not copy 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.340
 and we paste it with that 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.340
 that is the file 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.130

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.530
 unlocked our characters 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.910
 in combat then we open the game 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.910
 and we hope to finish 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.870
