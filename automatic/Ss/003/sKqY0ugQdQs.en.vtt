merchandised TVs and all that so for

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.400 
merchandised TVs and all that so for
that<00:02:56.459> means<00:02:56.700> care<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.060> makes<00:02:57.269> no<00:02:57.450> sense<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:58.019> me

I think this is just a smarter choice

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.240 
I think this is just a smarter choice
for<00:03:00.390> them<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.470> take<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.829> to<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> different

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
for them to like take it to a different

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.400 
for them to like take it to a different
place<00:03:02.459> maybe<00:03:02.819> like<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.150> somewhere<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.630> Disney

place maybe like it somewhere at Disney

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.170 
place maybe like it somewhere at Disney
where<00:03:04.680> people<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.130> come<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.400> see<00:03:05.730> exclusive

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
