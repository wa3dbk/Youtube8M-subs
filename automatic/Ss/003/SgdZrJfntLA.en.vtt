 hi my name is alberto guil and i am 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.500
 with my friend Mariana and her house and we are going to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.049
 continue doing one we started 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.360
 in the channel you have to leave the first 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.170
 part of the video that is the book tag 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.900
 fax sacrum then if you have not seen in your 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.789
 video go the first verb to see 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.150
 half of the first half of life 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.179
 and let's continue the third question 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.250
 from the tag sad a classic 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.010
 let's say you're in a class and you 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.440
 teacher literature is talking about 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.600
 how this classic changed the world as 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.520
 revolutionized literature and is being 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 tired of that you grab a limit 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.079
 classic and you break it in front of your face 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.600
 because you know something that that classic is 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.059
 stupid and it 's worth punishing you 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.760
 just to show everyone how you 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.559
 you feel that classic would destroy the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.880
 I have lived processes have already liked 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.540
 I would also be very weird that a classic 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.410
 I believe that the man does not know who you are 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.440
 I thought when reading that question I thought about 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.780
 the edge between the rye ' I liked it 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.060
 a lot of book but like it was not what 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.060
 I imagined to make a classic 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.850
 that is, it's super famous and when I read it, 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.170
 I liked it a lot but it was not what I 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:39.130
 I was hoping to make a good classic 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.000
 question says your favorite book of your 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.950
 lifetime 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.140
 let's say you 're easy between a 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.990
 bookstore and new bookstore when it goes 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.150
 global increase explode and the world 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.880
 outside it becomes a land 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.590
 frozen you're stuck in your only 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.920
 opportunity to survive is burning a 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.050
 book what books would you choose your book 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.420
 least favorite of your whole life that the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.690
 book would be ready suddenly 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.250
 burn skills already since a book 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.860
 that there really was a lot very much 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.220
 I think it would be the city book 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.709
 and the dogs because or diesel and hard to 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.989
 the theme of this is a good book 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.209
 written but the theme itself you know 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.410
 what is good is to say that it can military 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.820
 but it's all that being in the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.820
 which military are very in action 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.110
 maybe it would just be a rumor of the and 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.760
 chronic because it's not my kind of books or 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.040
 if I like books like that of 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.830
 normalitos like the club of the hearts 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:50.610
 lonely or a star but that's me 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.610
 did a little bit of everything 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:02.920
