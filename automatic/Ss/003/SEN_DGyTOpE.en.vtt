00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.779
 oh my goodness am i really the driver myself 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.859
 back to the beginnings of the series and what 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.810
 understand this matter on the example of a lady 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.219
 lecture for their assembly 360 by the way halimovsky 

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.659
 all your ivan train the trigger on the floor and forth 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.920
 after the launch was a game immediately to us 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.840
 tell me if you can enter 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.060
 made in the manner of this someone action movie 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.950
 Or simply ordinary movies prokopov by the way 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.600
 you can see at once one important 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.359
 chip game in a new area sat so 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:18.259
 licensed this is an excellent move I'm sure 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.049
 that all players will enjoy chasing 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.259
 on real 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.630
 car rather than wall copies 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.819
 after the screensavers of course we are planted for 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.820
 purebred american husband 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.240
 Apparently the Americans are 400 pluses cool 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.680
 In general, do not judge and the main thing is that we 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.299
 we start the game and here I have the first 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.890
 sorrow and joy at the same time with us 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.440
 I told myself 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.380
 finally the cars became tolerable 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.260
 be controlled but then my eyes began 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.350
 peer pictures and then i 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.920
 I realized that the developers 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.950
 Halal repeat 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.480
 never before 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.280
 yes, I tell you the cars are drawn well 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.610
 Salon of course this is not a fountain let's say 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.820
 example who knows the panels of the year has grown 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.790
 2008 year salon but who will be arrested 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.570
 much better and the environment driver san francisco 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.760
 what a boring and monophonic team 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.800
 poppy grated in sport is not at all 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.800
 the best quality 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.749
 but apparently developed an analysis 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.900
 smiled and corrected the Savings Bank 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.210
 another new chip is part of the game 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.680
 the so-called function 6 which 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.910
 can move us to any car on 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.570
 road who is clearly on the go and let's say it 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.270
 really fresh yes and it looks cool though 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.880
 honestly it was something like assure 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 reception 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.620
 Well, there we have blocked the hunt and 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.309
 she crashed moldova we intersect in 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:47.340
 victim's car 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.120
 and our previous car and 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.099
 continues on the road 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.749
 involuntarily creeps in thought a 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.880
 what kind of ghost highway 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.800
 so if you look nagging 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.830
 Kashcheev this is cool but a bit not thought out 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.440
 and at the same time, the evaluation of the game we are offered 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.830
 perform such actions to 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.340
 finish for mac and this is get away from the chase 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.949
 perform tricks and win 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.399
 and honestly 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.600
 not impressed 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.470
 how it will all be sad and how it will not 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.069
 suing the Varyag 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.999
 by the way supposedly creative indie races 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.279
 will have to switch between 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.359
 two cars Vova and also not impressive 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.509
 as they say you want except meat and spectacles but 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.509
 apparently not the right game 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.019
 In general, summing up, I will play San Francisco 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.180
 has a decent incident car fleet on 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.579
 repeat very average mediocre 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:43.230
 graphics 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.360
 as well as a little raw chips game 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.030
 which supposedly should attract the player but here to 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.999
 Unfortunately, I was not carried away 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.239
 but on the other hand it is just straight and 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.139
 the situation may change 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.329
 the output of the game very soon 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.609
 all showing their past polka 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.519
 forget to put stripes and thumb up 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.809
 comment and do not forget playing 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.199
 only good games
