Archie family I'll show you how to use a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.080 
Archie family I'll show you how to use a
smoke<00:00:16.049> machine<00:00:16.200> to<00:00:16.470> try<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.770> finally<00:00:17.130> first

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
smoke machine to try and finally first

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.460 
smoke machine to try and finally first
thing<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.510> where<00:00:18.750> do<00:00:18.840> they<00:00:18.960> hook<00:00:19.110> up<00:00:19.290> to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
thing is where do they hook up to

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470 
thing is where do they hook up to
different<00:00:20.220> places<00:00:20.580> where<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.210> doing

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
different places where I like doing

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.200 
different places where I like doing
these<00:00:21.630> vehicles<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> first<00:00:22.860> cell<00:00:23.210> so

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
these vehicles is that the first cell so

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.179 
these vehicles is that the first cell so
if<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.390> come<00:00:24.570> down<00:00:24.600> right<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.410> see<00:00:26.040> your

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
if we come down right in here see your

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.500 
if we come down right in here see your
purge<00:00:26.369> solenoid<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.000> there's<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.300> lines

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
purge solenoid and there's two lines

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.310 
purge solenoid and there's two lines
going<00:00:27.870> into<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:30.470> I'll<00:00:31.470> pop<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.830> off<00:00:33.110> take<00:00:34.110> my

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
going into it I'll pop this off take my

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.650 
going into it I'll pop this off take my
fittings<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:34.830> my<00:00:34.920> smoke<00:00:35.160> machine

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
fittings for my smoke machine

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
fittings for my smoke machine
which<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.140> there<00:00:37.620> insert<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
which is right there insert that in

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.820 
which is right there insert that in
there<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.210> I'm<00:00:39.720> going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> put<00:00:40.080> smoke<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.650> now

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
there so I'm going to put smoke in now

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.310 
there so I'm going to put smoke in now
right<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.030> before<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.780> after

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
right here you can go in before or after

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.290 
right here you can go in before or after
the<00:00:43.770> purge<00:00:44.010> solenoid<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.790> smoke<00:00:45.060> both

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the purge solenoid so you smoke both

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.660 
the purge solenoid so you smoke both
sides<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> machine

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
sides of the machine

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.820 
sides of the machine
okay<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.120> we're<00:00:48.240> hooked<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.630> now<00:00:49.560> we're<00:00:49.710> gonna

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
okay so we're hooked up now we're gonna

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.380 
okay so we're hooked up now we're gonna
look<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.010> smoke<00:00:51.620> activated

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
look for smoke activated

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.240 
look for smoke activated
I<00:00:54.420> think

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.850 

if<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.700> smoke<00:01:00.940> coming<00:01:01.300> out

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.080 

darlink<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.850> back<00:01:05.059> in<00:01:05.270> this<00:01:05.390> area

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
darlink is back in this area

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.999 
darlink is back in this area
so<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:07.750> went<00:01:07.930> up<00:01:08.020> kind<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.380> zoomed<00:01:08.590> down<00:01:08.680> in

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
so we went up kind of zoomed down in

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.030 
so we went up kind of zoomed down in
here<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.990> if<00:01:11.049> we<00:01:11.110> can<00:01:11.350> see<00:01:11.530> where<00:01:11.680> it's<00:01:11.829> coming

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
here see if we can see where it's coming

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:21.820 
here see if we can see where it's coming
from

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.330 

-<00:01:22.160> here

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.039 

therefore<00:01:28.729> fitting<00:01:28.909> right<00:01:29.210> in<00:01:29.360> there<00:01:29.570> we

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
therefore fitting right in there we

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.660 
therefore fitting right in there we
can't<00:01:30.290> see<00:01:30.500> much<00:01:30.680> from<00:01:30.740> here<00:01:31.189> because<00:01:31.369> there's

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
can't see much from here because there's

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.700 
can't see much from here because there's
too<00:01:31.759> many<00:01:31.850> things<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.390> way<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.409> we're

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
too many things in the way so we're

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.289 
too many things in the way so we're
gonna<00:01:33.799> have<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.220> take<00:01:34.399> our<00:01:34.549> air<00:01:34.729> breather<00:01:35.030> box

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
gonna have to take our air breather box

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.359 
gonna have to take our air breather box
off<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.200> we<00:01:36.320> can<00:01:36.439> see<00:01:36.470> what's<00:01:36.799> happening<00:01:37.159> down

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
off so we can see what's happening down

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.399 
off so we can see what's happening down
there

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
there

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.749 
there
okay<00:01:39.409> we've<00:01:39.619> taken<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.009> breather<00:01:40.220> box<00:01:40.520> out<00:01:40.729> of

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
okay we've taken the breather box out of

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.520 
okay we've taken the breather box out of
the<00:01:40.850> way<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.509> that<00:01:41.539> you<00:01:41.780> can<00:01:41.930> see<00:01:42.140> what<00:01:42.350> we're
