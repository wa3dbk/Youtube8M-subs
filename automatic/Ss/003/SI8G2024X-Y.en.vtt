00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.590 
enjoying the game for the game I enjoy
the<00:01:26.520> game<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.880> challenges<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> presents

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the game for the challenges it presents

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.490 
the game for the challenges it presents
me<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.590> game<00:01:28.799> itself<00:01:29.509> has<00:01:30.509> stopped<00:01:31.079> being

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
me but the game itself has stopped being

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.350 
me but the game itself has stopped being
something<00:01:31.890> engaging<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.670> me<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> very<00:01:33.090> long

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
something engaging for me a very long

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
something engaging for me a very long
time<00:01:33.600> ago<00:01:33.869> what<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> enjoyed<00:01:35.159> about<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.460> was

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
time ago what I enjoyed about it was

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.249 
time ago what I enjoyed about it was
making<00:01:36.030> content<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.570> game<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.990> now<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
making content for the game but now that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.260 
making content for the game but now that
it's<00:01:37.380> become<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.979> prohibitively<00:01:38.640> hard<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.119> do

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
it's become so prohibitively hard to do

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.050 
it's become so prohibitively hard to do
anything<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:40.250> remotely<00:01:41.250> polished<00:01:41.880> or

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
anything like remotely polished or

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
anything like remotely polished or
engaging<00:01:42.619> plus<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.799> fact<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
engaging plus the fact that the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.490 
engaging plus the fact that the
community<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.360> slowly<00:01:45.750> folding

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
community is just like slowly folding

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.649 
community is just like slowly folding
into<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.310> maelstrom<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.060> hate<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
into this maelstrom of hate and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.639 
into this maelstrom of hate and
 misinformation<00:01:50.930> I'm<00:01:51.930> cooling<00:01:52.439> off

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
 misinformation I'm cooling off

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.999 
 misinformation I'm cooling off
NL<00:01:52.950> sword<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.689> basically<00:01:55.110> marks<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
NL sword and so this basically marks the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.310 
NL sword and so this basically marks the

content for the games that I'm really

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.559 
content for the games that I'm really
interested<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:08.220> right<00:02:08.399> now<00:02:08.429> elsword<00:02:09.149> hasn't

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
interested in right now elsword hasn't

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.180 
interested in right now elsword hasn't
been<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> place<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.110> me<00:02:10.259> for<00:02:10.470> some<00:02:10.649> time<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
been the place for me for some time and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.059 
been the place for me for some time and
I<00:02:11.580> think<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.120> reason<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.480> took<00:02:12.599> me<00:02:12.750> this

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
I think the reason it took me this

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.209 
I think the reason it took me this
to<00:02:13.280> move<00:02:13.430> away<00:02:13.579> is<00:02:13.939> because<00:02:14.629> i<00:02:15.319> don't<00:02:16.159> know

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.219 
to move away is because i don't know

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.640 
to move away is because i don't know
maybe<00:02:16.489> I<00:02:16.609> was<00:02:16.879> afraid<00:02:17.749> of<00:02:17.900> finally<00:02:18.439> stepping

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
maybe I was afraid of finally stepping

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.520 
maybe I was afraid of finally stepping
out<00:02:18.859> of<00:02:18.889> the<00:02:19.010> goddamn<00:02:19.129> comfort<00:02:19.760> zone<00:02:20.290> I'm<00:02:21.290> not
