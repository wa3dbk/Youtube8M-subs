00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello and welcome to our 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.770
 small video tutorial here on xbox from 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.130
 DE we want to show you today how 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.990
 it is possible in the kv videos on the xbox 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.609
 one and also on the xbox 360 too 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.419
 Most people are streaming 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.189
 opinion that would not work 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.070
 but it is wrong then works 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.409
 let's do the right things 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.779
 after all, the athlete could be quite easy 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:30.179
 signals are we need an xbox one 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.280
 a tv and a computer resp 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.900
 a tablet with windows 8 8.10 important 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.460
 Both devices must be in the same network 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.040
 work with each other 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.230
 to be able to communicate 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.750
 We are here from the windows store 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.630
 downloaded a video that is called 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.660
 mobile age which costs three euros but is 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.820
 also a free trader offers in kv 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.470
 Support and network support 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.750
 that means you can do it too 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.420
 network drives or to access from load 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.829
 and there the video stream the story 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.920
 just works we start 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.110
 The app will go up in the case browser 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.600
 rows up change case 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.540
 oh we are already in ours 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.010
 network drive just go to the video 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.180
 was downloaded several times in the trailer too 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.240
 especially if two is 1080p in the kv third 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 Let's see how open we are 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.020
 on the tray now we know once 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.780
 from the side go in the shame bar 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.950
 on devices go on play and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.860
 select from 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.060
 watch the xbox one as well as streaming the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.110
 xbox wan connection is established 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.049
 does not always work right away 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.070
 whole story sometimes you have to 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.330
 maybe again stop again 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.500
 start but saw video runs the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.010
 very handy you can video it over 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.520
 controlling the tablet can pause here 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.070
 or start again 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.140
 or people continue the whole story 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.890
 looks good picture quality is okay 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.140
 had a little disadvantage the video 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.090
 does not work with 24 pictures but also 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.979
 60 hertz and it would be and stereo signal 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.940
 passed through but I think so just 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.680
 collect somewhere full hd video 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.750
 this solution is okay 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.630
 the same story works too 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.240
 with the xbox 360 we stop here 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:28.250
 just a short shot I change 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:30.530
 very fast times 360 on the xbox 360 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.470
 dashboard is therefore quite normal 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.130
 start here again in our 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:43.180
 movie app also select video 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.810
 open came bar redirect devices 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.220
 give again 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.590
 select the xbox 360 this time and we 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.360
 Miracles wonder the same as with 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.510
 The Xbox One at Education is being set up 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.560
 takes a bit 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.420
 By the way, this fluffy thing you are here 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.890
 video seht does not come from the xbox it 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.959
 is simply the problem that you the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.810
 Camera here with 25 pictures running and that 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.490
 picture but on the tv with 60 picture 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.070
 with 60 pictures per second 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:18.610
 played back to the theme of video running 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:22.060
 quality also good and without problems 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.440
 here are the videos art so that's it 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.760
 We thank you for your hope 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.890

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.230
