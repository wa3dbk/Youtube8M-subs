00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.629
 Now that he supports he presented his most awaited 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.730
 to powers the fanboys have no more 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.340
 to direct your attention to the next 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.680
 product of manzanita and apparently already 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.590
 began to circulate the rumors about 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.840
 the features of the next iPhone a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.280
 that we want more than others as they are 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.260
 We were greeted by you, giving you the desire to 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.710
 schiller in Spanish with the top 5 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.930
 What's new in the iPhone 6s 7 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.149
 whatever it is going to be called and how to 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.460
 custom we start with number 5 in 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.410
 the list more storage if you're 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.720
 paying for a luxury phone and not 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.630
 has expandable memory unless you 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.940
 Give enough internal storage 32 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.399
 gigabytes at least as the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.559
 galaxy s 6 from samsung because the current 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.720
 16 gigabyte option is almost a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.640
 insult with the amount of photos videos 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.680
 and music that we carry in our 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.649
 pockets and since we're dreaming that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 better start at 64 gigabytes because 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.520
 we know that paul does not cost 100 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.070
 dollars plus put a chip with more 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.110
 memory and believe me they will appreciate the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.240
 extra memory for number 4 in 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.670
 our list best camera and I do not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.920
 I mean only the number d 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.290
 pixels that would not fall bad in fact 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.240
 neither since I observe the same 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.390
 number of megapixels in the cameras of the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.580
 iPhone 5 and 6 but also more 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.920
 resolution how about a 10 style look 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.259
 cell phone for photos this could be 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.869
 the iphone that will compete with the cameras 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.930
 professionals with a similar double lens 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.930
 to the concept of lenses and one m 8 with zoom 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.539
 optical and maybe video in 4k if they go 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.000
 generous and in third place for being 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.369
 google translates it as a contact to 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.470
 forces but I better explain them to 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.300
 that not think more is the same 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.850
 technology that comes on the screen 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.369
 the uach and on the mattress cited tactile 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.830
 the new macbook detects the range of 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.530
 contact and react according to the pressure 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.899
 that you apply on the surface does not sound 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.880
 very sexy but it could be the most 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.429
 important that comes in these new 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.409
 iphones since that would change the way the 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.500
 that you control the interface of your phone 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.550
 and certain functions might be obsolete 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.220
 as the start button 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.500
 2 best battery this is one that we ask 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.260
 every year but it seems that never 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.480
 supplies because with better battery comes 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.090
 better performance and the ability to do 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.400
 even more things with our phones and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.830
 at the end of the day we are desperate 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.080
 by squeezing every last drop of 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.840
 charging the phone about to sell a 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.500
 organ by a portable charger in this 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.110
 model nothing of 20% more we want 100% more 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.510
 battery or wireless charging and stations 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.610
 load in all bathrooms but the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.430
 Novelty who else we want in the next 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.680
 iphone sapphire crystal screen us 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.050
 they tempted with this concept last year 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.000
 but we were disappointed so it's already 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.820
 being time that they do not deliver this 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.740
 promise a screen so tough that 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.230
 not even a lovelorn lover 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.110
 throwing it against the wall would be able 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.880
 to break the although it awaits them the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.380
 screen repair business to 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.240
 Stern 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.310
 remember that these are just rumors and 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.800
 that we can not confirm anything with 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.720
 certainty until the next event of 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.760
 launch and well not even that we know 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.470
 when will it be exactly 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.599
 write a message on twitter with more 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.849
 of your wishes for the next iphone and 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.370
 from a pasadita by puntocom cinema 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.299
 of that to see more top 5 is like this 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.299
 until next time
