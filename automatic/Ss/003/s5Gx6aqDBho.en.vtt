00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 tells crowd beauty here who speaks is 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.919
 lucas vivas and I'm here to be able to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.690
 talk a little more about this bike here than 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:17.039
 a good xre300 when I was in a hurry 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.680
 motorcycle watch many lives there on youtube 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.500
 to know a little more know 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 more fashion is not just that it had a lot of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.410
 People said it was not good to get back on the bike there. 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 I spoke very badly about the bike and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.649
 to speak well enough to praise 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.960
 bikes is but it is after I eat as I am 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.579
 Realistic face I bought the bike and got some 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.070
 2 thousand for more than 2 thousand kilometers 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.379
 with her and I could see that she did not 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 well it has all its pros and cons 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.320
 cons like everything in life right said the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.710
 powders and cons 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.410
 anyway what I did not like the most was 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.920
 the question of the rain and the mud it right 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.489
 for your motor a high motorcycle a motorcycle 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.890
 track should have an athlete should 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.059
 be extra careful about this 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.140
 success is not for being a trail bike 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.380
 should not throw as much mud at the pilot 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.979
 sure a new front muddle or 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.060
 down and down he should 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.759
 be a little bigger 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.290
 right and there is even a 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.540
 stretcher is to sell a total of l 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.020
 staff calls it realistic 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.030
 country sells it's long here and it does 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 with which he does not play mud but originally 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.619
 without walking with her in the rain she will play 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.439
 mud up here is going to get better 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.520
 all this part here the whole luscious lighthouse 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.710
 right here is the whole luscious part 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.229
 including a dent in the driver's face 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.149
 Sure if you have to say abecs is like and mud 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:54.299
 It's in addition to that she plays one for 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.540
 all here O plays there for up to 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.790
 carla melani this part from here 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.460
 in it all this lower part of the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.469
 fairing all over there is difficult 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.789
 to wash and put your hand here to wash 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.259
 her suitcase to the right panel as it is 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.870
 with the high speed and the track is 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.830
 wet she plays even breathes a lot 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.880
 mud 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.700
 a lot of water on top that is brought from the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.060
 Front wheel rear wheel also 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.130
 Throw the mud up, it's alright. 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.040
 If you have a croup, it will melt your back. 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.650
 all of the croup because I say that because 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.810
 Why did you notice me in the rain? 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.150
 just released in the same whole backpack 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.340
 the 1 china is all honeyed including the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.020
 helmet predicts she throws the mud too 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.440
 on top of that bike is it also should 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.320
 have six marches 1 due to getting rid of 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.580
 of it of 13 of 300 displacements should 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:02.030
 have six gears right and maybe this 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:05.310
 is the cause of the head gasket , and 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.500
 melt in the oil 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.780
 some first bikes always happened 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.990
 this is not it 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.010
 the rubber here and leaked oil through the 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.170
 eraser 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.920
 the staff keeps talking about that noise but 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.769
 this mass at least mine is not 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.989
 leaking oil arrow and look that effort 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.150
 enough she throws our loud prayer 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.580
 very high rotation rotation 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.780
 and it did not happen if I took the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.750
 road right there 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.640
 liked long maybe hot, who 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.750
 stay longer on the fifth gear or 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.200
 can melt and leak oil. 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.170
 right 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.489
 well she does not mean that the bike 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.780
 economic 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.760
 she is not another economic one and I found 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.970
 until it was even more economical 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.050
 it is not an economic is I put 20 to 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.140
 gasoline and rode 200 kilometers with it 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.769
 10 ten dollars can give 100 and so 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.920
 go 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.310
 it should be cheaper then 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.380
 because I've had other bikes and 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.720
 250 cylinders and they all walked 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.370
 much more than that was much more 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.720
 economic sure good account 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.660
 I found her now let's talk about the pros. 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.240
 She's a very good bike because of her touch. 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.190
 for you have another city 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.310
 'how excellent her touch is 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.870
 It's fantastic to walk a lot and walk really well. 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.889
 she sure has a wonderful touch is to have 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.680
 a very good game 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.710
 She has a nice waistband game. 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.569
 you deviate from the obstacles 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.240
 easily right 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:51.569
 so that's what I had to talk about 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.319
 specs with the pros are exactly those 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:58.319
 The bike is fantastic for this item. 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:00.870
 I'm glad I made the purchase 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.270
 then you are there to be able to 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.560
 answer any questions and someday 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.080
 Someone who wants to know a little more 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.909
 Not if I did not say something. 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.560
 specific thing that will be your 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.800
 I doubt're taking your question can 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.599
 ask down the channel that I 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.389
 I will be willing to answer 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.289
 good is it guys stay here until 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.740

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.740
 strong hug
