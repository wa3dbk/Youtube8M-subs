felt<00:00:24.730> to<00:00:24.880> find<00:00:25.150> it<00:00:25.329> now<00:00:26.200> I'm<00:00:26.980> going<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.340> start

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
felt to find it now I'm going to start

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.850 
felt to find it now I'm going to start
with<00:00:28.000> the<00:00:28.090> porn<00:00:28.329> pieces<00:00:28.900> now<00:00:29.560> as<00:00:29.619> we<00:00:29.829> know

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
with the porn pieces now as we know

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.850 
with the porn pieces now as we know
normal<00:00:30.849> chess<00:00:31.090> pieces<00:00:31.599> these<00:00:32.200> pieces<00:00:32.500> can

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
normal chess pieces these pieces can

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.889 
normal chess pieces these pieces can
move<00:00:33.010> either<00:00:33.220> one<00:00:33.370> or<00:00:33.850> two<00:00:34.210> spaces<00:00:34.720> at<00:00:34.870> the

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
move either one or two spaces at the

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.920 
move either one or two spaces at the
start<00:00:35.260> so<00:00:35.980> I<00:00:36.310> can<00:00:36.579> even<00:00:36.790> move<00:00:36.880> this<00:00:37.149> PC<00:00:37.780> over

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
start so I can even move this PC over

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.479 
start so I can even move this PC over
here<00:00:38.230> or<00:00:38.980> here<00:00:39.840> lastly<00:00:40.840> normal<00:00:41.289> Yeso<00:00:41.739> but<00:00:42.309> in

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
here or here lastly normal Yeso but in

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.639 
here or here lastly normal Yeso but in
tri-dimensional<00:00:43.030> chess<00:00:43.780> I<00:00:44.079> can<00:00:44.260> even<00:00:44.440> move

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
tri-dimensional chess I can even move

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.729 
tri-dimensional chess I can even move
them<00:00:44.800> there<00:00:45.039> or<00:00:46.530> there<00:00:47.530> or<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:49.750> because

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
them there or there or here because

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.520 
them there or there or here because
these<00:00:51.129> two<00:00:51.550> layers<00:00:51.789> here<00:00:52.179> and<00:00:52.809> here<00:00:53.199> are

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
these two layers here and here are

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.209 
these two layers here and here are
exactly<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.609> same<00:00:54.640> as<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.690> can<00:00:55.719> see<00:00:56.219> that's

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
exactly the same as I can see that's

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.939 
exactly the same as I can see that's
what<00:00:57.489> it's<00:00:57.579> like<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.960> these<00:00:59.410> two<00:00:59.710> are<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.859> same

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
what it's like so these two are the same

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.009 
what it's like so these two are the same
therefore<00:01:00.550> they<00:01:01.149> can<00:01:01.359> be<00:01:01.390> believe<00:01:01.690> they're

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
therefore they can be believe they're

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.820 
therefore they can be believe they're
the<00:01:02.739> or<00:01:03.429> here<00:01:04.120> so<00:01:05.050> hopefully<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.620> makes

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
the or here so hopefully that makes

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.290 
the or here so hopefully that makes
sense<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.659> same<00:01:07.870> also<00:01:08.140> applies<00:01:08.650> here<00:01:09.070> because

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
sense the same also applies here because

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.300 
sense the same also applies here because
these<00:01:10.300> here<00:01:10.870> are<00:01:11.380> exactly<00:01:11.650> the<00:01:11.830> same<00:01:11.860> for

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
these here are exactly the same for

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.050 
these here are exactly the same for
these<00:01:12.610> two<00:01:13.060> layers<00:01:13.360> here<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:15.070> can<00:01:15.220> move<00:01:15.400> one

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
these two layers here so it can move one

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.010 
these two layers here so it can move one
two<00:01:16.780> or<00:01:17.110> they<00:01:17.950> can<00:01:18.130> move<00:01:18.310> one<00:01:18.940> two<00:01:19.540> because

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
two or they can move one two because

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.470 
two or they can move one two because
these<00:01:20.260> two<00:01:20.590> layers<00:01:20.830> here<00:01:21.010> or<00:01:21.910> exactly<00:01:22.390> the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
these two layers here or exactly the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.230 
these two layers here or exactly the
same<00:01:22.750> as<00:01:23.110> here<00:01:23.770> exactly<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:24.850> same<00:01:25.000> as<00:01:25.150> the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
same as here exactly the same as the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.070 
same as here exactly the same as the
bottom<00:01:25.420> part<00:01:25.780> right<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:28.360> is<00:01:28.540> something<00:01:28.900> you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
bottom part right that is something you

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.650 
bottom part right that is something you
can<00:01:29.110> do<00:01:29.650> this<00:01:30.010> is<00:01:30.160> something<00:01:30.550> you<00:01:30.640> cannot<00:01:30.910> some

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
can do this is something you cannot some

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.930 
can do this is something you cannot some
people<00:01:32.080> may<00:01:32.200> think<00:01:32.230> that<00:01:32.950> if<00:01:33.190> you're<00:01:33.550> there

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
people may think that if you're there

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.660 
people may think that if you're there
you<00:01:34.420> can<00:01:34.600> move<00:01:34.810> this<00:01:35.020> piece<00:01:35.400> forward<00:01:36.400> up<00:01:36.610> to

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
you can move this piece forward up to

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.720 
you can move this piece forward up to
here<00:01:37.390> but<00:01:37.960> theoretically<00:01:38.650> that<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.370> not<00:01:39.700> a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
here but theoretically that is not a

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.700 
here but theoretically that is not a
move<00:01:40.060> you've<00:01:40.360> just<00:01:40.600> moved<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:41.050> from<00:01:41.170> exactly

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
move you've just moved it from exactly

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.580 
move you've just moved it from exactly
the<00:01:41.800> same<00:01:41.980> space<00:01:42.400> in<00:01:42.760> a<00:01:43.480> different<00:01:43.510> layer<00:01:44.080> but

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
the same space in a different layer but

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.630 
the same space in a different layer but
you<00:01:44.620> can't<00:01:44.920> do<00:01:45.160> that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
you can't do that

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.130 
you can't do that
the<00:01:45.940> only<00:01:46.060> thing<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.330> can<00:01:46.510> do<00:01:46.690> is<00:01:46.840> move<00:01:46.960> it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
the only thing you can do is move it

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.760 
the only thing you can do is move it
forward<00:01:47.710> there<00:01:48.400> or<00:01:48.910> move<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.390> up<00:01:49.570> from<00:01:50.260> the

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
forward there or move it up from the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.630 
forward there or move it up from the
forward<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:51.910> there<00:01:52.120> as<00:01:52.810> classes<00:01:53.260> one<00:01:53.590> move<00:01:54.130> it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
forward to there as classes one move it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.810 
forward to there as classes one move it
cannot<00:01:55.000> do<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.660> hopefully<00:01:56.410> that<00:01:57.100> also<00:01:57.310> makes

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
cannot do that hopefully that also makes

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.370 
cannot do that hopefully that also makes
sense

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
sense

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.200 
sense
now<00:01:59.380> people<00:01:59.830> may<00:01:59.950> get<00:02:00.280> really<00:02:00.490> confused<00:02:01.060> about

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
now people may get really confused about

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.090 
now people may get really confused about

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
if they make a mistake which is very

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.350

very unlikely but I've moved the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.480 
very unlikely but I've moved the
tablecloth<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:48.770> easier<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.340> see<00:02:49.460> the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490

they can move in inverted l-shape so it

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.370 
they can move in inverted l-shape so it
I'm<00:03:01.310> going<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.850> go<00:03:01.970> forward<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:02.930> what<00:03:03.290> I'm

going to do is here this horse is
practically<00:03:06.800> there<00:03:07.250> but<00:03:07.610> also<00:03:07.790> here<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:08.750> it

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
practically there but also here so it

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.490 
practically there but also here so it
can<00:03:09.860> move<00:03:10.070> like<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:10.820> in<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.660> shape<00:03:11.930> here<00:03:12.260> I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
can move like this in this shape here I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.540 
can move like this in this shape here I
can<00:03:13.100> even<00:03:13.220> move<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.610> there<00:03:14.060> or<00:03:15.160> moving<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.280> shape

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
can even move it there or moving a shape

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.250 
can even move it there or moving a shape
like<00:03:17.120> this<00:03:17.180> switch<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:18.020> equals<00:03:18.650> up<00:03:19.010> here

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
like this switch this equals up here

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.380 
like this switch this equals up here
evilly<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.560> can<00:03:21.680> put<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:23.030> that's<00:03:23.180> what<00:03:23.300> I'm

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
evilly I can put this so that's what I'm

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.300 
evilly I can put this so that's what I'm
going<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.630> do<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.410> if<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.560> see<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.860> this<00:03:25.130> is

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
going to do so if you see it this is

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.850 
going to do so if you see it this is
practically<00:03:25.820> here<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.380> it's<00:03:27.500> going<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.709> go

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
practically here so it's going to go

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.180 
practically here so it's going to go
from<00:03:28.310> form<00:03:29.240> fever<00:03:29.660> stays<00:03:29.870> beer<00:03:30.200> or<00:03:30.740> go<00:03:30.950> up<00:03:31.070> a

from form fever stays beer or go up a

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.550 
from form fever stays beer or go up a
level<00:03:31.340> or<00:03:31.670> this<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.660> exactly<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.170> same<00:03:33.380> as

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
level or this is exactly the same as

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.230 
level or this is exactly the same as
this<00:03:33.740> so<00:03:34.550> it's<00:03:34.700> going<00:03:34.850> to<00:03:34.940> go<00:03:35.290> home<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.850> if<00:03:38.180> you

like say this way from here to here give

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.470 
like say this way from here to here give
it<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.520> or<00:03:44.830> underneath<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:46.040> which<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.550> here<00:03:46.940> so

I'm<00:03:47.540> going<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.750> do<00:03:47.980> which<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:49.130> still<00:03:49.400> exactly

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
I'm going to do which is still exactly

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.390 
I'm going to do which is still exactly
the<00:03:50.060> same<00:03:50.420> move<00:03:51.140> I've<00:03:51.440> just<00:03:51.709> moved<00:03:51.920> down<00:03:52.070> a

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the same move I've just moved down a

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.810 
the same move I've just moved down a
layer<00:03:52.610> of<00:03:53.150> these<00:03:53.660> two<00:03:54.050> pieces<00:03:54.470> here<00:03:54.920> exactly

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
layer of these two pieces here exactly

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.310 
layer of these two pieces here exactly
the<00:03:56.150> same<00:03:56.390> as<00:03:56.720> here<00:03:58.450> also<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.720> found<00:04:00.020> so<00:04:00.140> now

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
the same as here also I found so now

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.990 
the same as here also I found so now
that<00:04:00.500> confused<00:04:00.920> me<00:04:01.010> but<00:04:01.220> figured<00:04:01.640> out<00:04:01.760> now

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
that confused me but figured out now

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.360 
that confused me but figured out now
okay<00:04:02.360> so<00:04:02.420> if<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.260> want<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.500> move<00:04:03.620> this<00:04:03.920> Bishop

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
okay so if I want to move this Bishop

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.770 
okay so if I want to move this Bishop
piece<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:05.600> way<00:04:05.930> down<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.920> here<00:04:07.580> some<00:04:08.450> people

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
piece this way down to here some people

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.290 
piece this way down to here some people
think<00:04:09.020> you<00:04:09.260> can<00:04:09.440> go<00:04:09.650> forward<00:04:10.130> down<00:04:10.730> onto<00:04:11.150> this

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
think you can go forward down onto this

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.199 
think you can go forward down onto this
way<00:04:11.540> because<00:04:11.900> it's<00:04:12.290> diagonal<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.940> move<00:04:14.090> it

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
way because it's diagonal the to move it

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.300 
way because it's diagonal the to move it
to<00:04:14.330> here<00:04:14.360> but<00:04:15.080> you<00:04:15.140> can't<00:04:15.380> do<00:04:15.650> that<00:04:15.860> because

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
to here but you can't do that because

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.870 
to here but you can't do that because

I'll do another video describing the

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.070 
I'll do another video describing the
same<00:06:03.919> method<00:06:04.339> and<00:06:04.550> go<00:06:05.120> in<00:06:05.270> more<00:06:05.449> depth<00:06:05.870> in

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
same method and go in more depth in

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.529 
same method and go in more depth in
detail<00:06:06.529> I<00:06:06.740> know<00:06:07.219> that<00:06:07.610> this<00:06:07.789> video<00:06:08.000> isn't<00:06:08.330> the

best<00:06:08.810> on<00:06:09.110> YouTube<00:06:09.649> and<00:06:09.949> sometimes<00:06:10.490> it<00:06:10.610> blows

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
best on YouTube and sometimes it blows

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.570 
best on YouTube and sometimes it blows
out<00:06:11.240> in<00:06:11.599> some<00:06:12.080> parts<00:06:12.439> of<00:06:12.529> the<00:06:12.649> clips<00:06:12.889> but

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
out in some parts of the clips but

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.249 
out in some parts of the clips but
hopefully<00:06:14.029> I'll<00:06:14.149> get<00:06:14.270> a<00:06:14.330> huge<00:06:14.629> new<00:06:14.839> video

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259
