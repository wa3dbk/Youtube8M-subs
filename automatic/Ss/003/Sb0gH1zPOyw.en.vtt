for you but this is kind of some of the
things<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> find<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:30.449> helpful<00:00:30.750> that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
things that I find that are helpful that

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.610 
things that I find that are helpful that
he<00:00:31.199> didn't<00:00:31.470> mention<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.070> his<00:00:32.309> video<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:34.200> first

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
he didn't mention in his video the first

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.330 
he didn't mention in his video the first
one<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.399> think<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:38.059> yeah<00:00:39.829> your<00:00:40.829> finger

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
one I think is yeah your finger

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.130 
one I think is yeah your finger
curvature<00:00:42.120> especially<00:00:42.540> when<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.840> higher

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
curvature especially when you go higher

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.910 
curvature especially when you go higher
up<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> neck

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
up the neck

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.639 
up the neck
now<00:00:44.670> most<00:00:44.940> bass<00:00:45.660> players<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.350> start

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
now most bass players when they start

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.040 
now most bass players when they start
they'd<00:00:47.250> only<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:47.879> flat<00:00:48.180> fingers<00:00:48.570> like

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
they'd only have very flat fingers like

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.500 
they'd only have very flat fingers like
like<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.789> quite<00:00:51.059> flat<00:00:53.510> especially

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
like this really quite flat especially

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.080 
like this really quite flat especially
the<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.530> which<00:00:56.280> i<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.640> horrible

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the like that which i think is horrible

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.860 
the like that which i think is horrible
I'm<00:00:57.420> now<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.699> a<00:00:59.699> fret<00:01:00.090> bass<00:01:00.359> doesn't<00:01:00.750> really

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
I'm now on a fret bass doesn't really

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.090 
I'm now on a fret bass doesn't really
matter<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:02.010> we'll<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> fret<00:01:03.149> is

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
matter so much because we'll the fret is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.450 
matter so much because we'll the fret is
it's<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.430> too<00:01:06.320> it's<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.380> definite<00:01:07.799> pitch<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it's there too it's a definite pitch of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.000 
it's there too it's a definite pitch of
that<00:01:08.970> note<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:09.990> you're<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.470> tune<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.799> course

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that note if you're in tune of course

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.270 
that note if you're in tune of course
make<00:01:11.700> sure<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.090> tune<00:01:12.270> that's<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.630> thing

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
make sure you in tune that's one thing

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.640 
make sure you in tune that's one thing
but<00:01:15.680> with<00:01:16.970> fretless<00:01:17.970> bass<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:19.110> best<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> have

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
but with fretless bass it's best to have

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.100 
but with fretless bass it's best to have
you<00:01:20.340> fingers<00:01:21.210> curved<00:01:21.860> like<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.900> see<00:01:24.900> this

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you fingers curved like this see this

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.280 
you fingers curved like this see this
slightly<00:01:25.950> curved<00:01:27.229> see<00:01:28.640> slightly<00:01:29.640> curved

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
slightly curved see slightly curved

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.380 
slightly curved see slightly curved
there's<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.409> curvature<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.189> finger<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.490 

this<00:01:36.390> helps<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.140> tuning<00:01:38.030> internation

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
this helps with tuning internation

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.749 
this helps with tuning internation
purposes<00:01:40.500> especially<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> higher<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
purposes especially the higher you go of

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.149 
purposes especially the higher you go of
the<00:01:41.850> neck<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.060> were<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.259> spacing

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the neck that were they the spacing

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.280 
the neck that were they the spacing
between<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> notes<00:01:44.880> where<00:01:45.750> where<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> frets

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
between the notes where where the frets

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.149 
between the notes where where the frets
would<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.979> lot<00:01:50.490> smaller<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> I'll

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
would be is a lot smaller so I'll

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.330 
would be is a lot smaller so I'll
demonstrate<00:01:53.399> I'll<00:01:53.939> start<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.920> on<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> G

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
demonstrate I'll start on the on the G

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.330 
demonstrate I'll start on the on the G
which

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
which

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.580 
which
be<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.719> 12th<00:01:59.049> fret<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.619> frets<00:01:59.890> but<00:02:01.320> most<00:02:02.320> most

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
be the 12th fret of frets but most most

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
fourth finger you know I will

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.900 
fourth finger you know I will
demonstrate<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.430> using<00:02:29.069> flat<00:02:30.069> fingers<00:02:30.610> and

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
demonstrate it using flat fingers and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.670 
demonstrate it using flat fingers and
using<00:02:31.239> curved<00:02:31.540> fingers<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.440> show<00:02:32.620> you

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
using curved fingers just to show you

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:41.070 
using curved fingers just to show you
the<00:02:32.860> differences<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.519> flat<00:02:33.880> fingers

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.660 

and<00:02:41.620> our<00:02:41.800> curved<00:02:42.220> fingers<00:02:47.340> now<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.400> can<00:02:48.550> only

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
and our curved fingers now you can only

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.780 
and our curved fingers now you can only
notice<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.150> slight<00:02:49.600> tonal<00:02:50.380> difference<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.700> it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
notice a slight tonal difference but it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.490 
notice a slight tonal difference but it
does<00:02:51.940> give<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.360> much<00:02:52.780> much<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> much

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
does give you that much much a much

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.560 
does give you that much much a much
clearer<00:02:53.860> sound<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.550> it's<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:55.000> good<00:02:55.180> technique

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
clearer sound and it's a good technique

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.960 
clearer sound and it's a good technique
to<00:02:55.780> learn<00:02:55.930> anyway<00:02:56.710> even<00:02:57.520> if<00:02:57.640> you're<00:02:57.790> playing
