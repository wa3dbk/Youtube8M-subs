00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
but also it's really it is to be broken

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.249 
but also it's really it is to be broken
but<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> crema<00:01:38.280> has<00:01:38.549> its<00:01:38.789> own<00:01:39.030> taste<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.630> own

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
annual crema so it's a really it depends

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.389 
annual crema so it's a really it depends
on<00:01:53.429> how<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> put<00:01:54.569> the<00:01:54.690> milk<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.170> there<00:01:58.250> if<00:01:59.250> you

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
on how to put the milk in there if you

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.310 
on how to put the milk in there if you
put<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> milk<00:01:59.909> too<00:02:00.149> far<00:02:00.420> from<00:02:00.539> coffee<00:02:01.159> see

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.080 

aww

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.369 

can<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.750> see<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:13.989> color<00:02:15.840> it's<00:02:16.840> not<00:02:17.019> golden

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
can you see this color it's not golden

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.200 
can you see this color it's not golden
color

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.540 

and<00:02:22.720> if<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.050> pour<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.350> milk<00:02:23.620> too<00:02:24.070> close<00:02:24.310> to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
and if you pour the milk too close to

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.870 
and if you pour the milk too close to
coffee

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.540 

are<00:02:32.060> also<00:02:33.710> it's<00:02:34.710> not<00:02:34.800> really<00:02:35.160> good<00:02:35.310> coating

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
are also it's not really good coating

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.510 
are also it's not really good coating
for<00:02:35.880> them<00:02:39.260> because<00:02:40.260> when<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.010> put<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.310> milk

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
for them because when you put the milk

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.030 
for them because when you put the milk
from<00:02:41.670> 25<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.630> has<00:02:43.110> some<00:02:43.320> jumping<00:02:43.710> energy

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
from 25 but it has some jumping energy

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.130 
from 25 but it has some jumping energy
then<00:02:44.490> jumping<00:02:44.910> energy<00:02:45.240> breaks<00:02:45.510> all<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.750> crema

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
then jumping energy breaks all the crema

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.130 
then jumping energy breaks all the crema
and<00:02:46.760> if<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.940> put<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.210> milk<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.690> close<00:02:48.930> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
and if you put a milk to close the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.470 
and if you put a milk to close the
coffee<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:50.280> doesn't<00:02:50.730> even<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:50.970> enough<00:02:51.210> edge

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
coffee it doesn't even have enough edge

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.860 
coffee it doesn't even have enough edge
to<00:02:51.750> get<00:02:51.930> into<00:02:52.380> crema<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:54.090> froth<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.690> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
to get into crema so the froth is to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.780 
to get into crema so the froth is to
stand<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.010> surface<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.520> crema

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
stand on this on the surface of crema

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.830 
stand on this on the surface of crema
and<00:02:57.030> cover<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:57.960> everything<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> what<00:03:00.810> are

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
and cover up everything so what are

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.160 
and cover up everything so what are
going<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.050> know<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:02.310> best<00:03:02.520> way<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:03.170> linking

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
going to know the best way is linking

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.550 
going to know the best way is linking
them<00:03:04.320> together<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:09.300> when<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.840> begin<00:03:10.230> pouring

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
them together so when you begin pouring

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.590 
them together so when you begin pouring
milk<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.400> start<00:03:11.640> from<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:12.000> little<00:03:12.300> bit<00:03:12.390> close

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
milk just start from a little bit close

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.440 
milk just start from a little bit close
spot<00:03:12.990> Ludacris<00:03:13.800> pot<00:03:14.100> case<00:03:14.550> then<00:03:14.850> there's<00:03:15.210> no

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
spot Ludacris pot case then there's no

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.970 
spot Ludacris pot case then there's no
