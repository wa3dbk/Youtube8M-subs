the<00:00:00.329> first<00:00:00.539> piece<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.780> on<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.290> materials<00:00:01.800> and

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
the first piece is on the materials and

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.169 
the first piece is on the materials and
you'll<00:00:02.070> see<00:00:02.280> that<00:00:02.460> we've<00:00:02.580> got<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.730> new<00:00:02.939> color

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
you'll see that we've got a new color

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.480 
you'll see that we've got a new color
here<00:00:03.270> we<00:00:03.510> call<00:00:03.659> dark<00:00:03.870> number<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.650> we<00:00:05.190> created

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
here we call dark number and we created

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.970 
here we call dark number and we created
this<00:00:05.609> color<00:00:05.850> by<00:00:06.060> basically<00:00:06.420> looking<00:00:06.720> at

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
this color by basically looking at

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.230 
this color by basically looking at
different<00:00:07.980> aspects<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.490> architecture<00:00:08.790> or

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
different aspects of architecture or

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.740 
different aspects of architecture or
furniture

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
furniture

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.549 
furniture
and<00:00:10.490> with<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.210> expect<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.110> new<00:00:13.320> color

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
and with that we expect this new color

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.140 
and with that we expect this new color
to<00:00:13.650> fit<00:00:13.889> very<00:00:14.160> gracefully<00:00:14.639> within<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> home

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
to fit very gracefully within the home

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.750 
to fit very gracefully within the home
and<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:16.080> think<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> new<00:00:16.890> black<00:00:17.160> on

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and we think this is the new black on

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.910 
and we think this is the new black on
the<00:00:19.820> on<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> other<00:00:21.119> parts<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.920> Meuse

usability that are also very convenient
which<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.879> instead<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.940> LEDs<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.800> typically

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
which is instead of LEDs that typically

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.900 
which is instead of LEDs that typically
have<00:00:49.950> been<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> product<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> past

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
those been now moved to the side which

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.459 
those been now moved to the side which
is<00:00:53.969> very<00:00:54.180> convenient<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:54.719> watch<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.110> movie

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
is very convenient when watch a movie

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.970 
is very convenient when watch a movie
and<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> lights<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.949> also<00:01:00.829> on<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and the lights and also on the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.100 
and the lights and also on the
experience<00:01:02.550> side<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:03.300> we've<00:01:03.449> done<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.780> we've

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
experience side what we've done is we've

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
experience side what we've done is we've
built<00:01:04.559> upon<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> relationship<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.820> dr.<00:01:06.180> Dre

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
built upon a relationship with dr. Dre

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080 
built upon a relationship with dr. Dre
and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.900> aligned<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.820> built<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.970> be

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and I aligned and built to be

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.420 
and I aligned and built to be
exceptional<00:01:09.720> audio<00:01:09.960> solution<00:01:10.530> typically

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
exceptional audio solution typically

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.780 
exceptional audio solution typically
notebooks<00:01:12.299> will<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.960> two<00:01:13.590> driver<00:01:14.490> one

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
notebooks will have a two driver one

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
notebooks will have a two driver one
location<00:01:15.150> solution<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.170> we've<00:01:16.380> done<00:01:16.590> if

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
location solution but we've done if

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.160 
location solution but we've done if
we've<00:01:16.890> done<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.100> poor<00:01:17.759> driver<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.600> location

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
we've done a poor driver to location

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.160 
we've done a poor driver to location
system<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.640> two<00:01:20.990> very<00:01:21.990> powerful

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
system so we have two very powerful

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.010 
system so we have two very powerful
speakers<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> front<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> second

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
speakers in the front and then a second

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140 
speakers in the front and then a second
set<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> speakers<00:01:25.530> towards<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> back<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
set of speakers towards the back and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.590 
set of speakers towards the back and
this<00:01:27.509> adds<00:01:28.280> an<00:01:29.280> exceptional<00:01:29.790> audio<00:01:30.060> solution

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this adds an exceptional audio solution

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 
this adds an exceptional audio solution
what's<00:01:31.229> nice<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.130> design<00:01:32.400> actually

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
what's nice is that the design actually

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.350 
what's nice is that the design actually
has<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> little<00:01:33.180> elevation<00:01:33.720> feature<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.360> on

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
has a little elevation feature on the on

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.690 
has a little elevation feature on the on
the<00:01:36.509> side<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> does<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the side and what that does is that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.929 
the side and what that does is that
allows<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.390> audio<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.020> project<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:41.040> little<00:01:41.850> bit

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
allows the audio to project a little bit

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.910 
allows the audio to project a little bit
better<00:01:42.090> towards<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> user<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.500> same

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
better towards the user that same

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.609 
better towards the user that same
curvature<00:01:44.520> as<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.210> nice<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.810> holding

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
curvature as a nice little holding
