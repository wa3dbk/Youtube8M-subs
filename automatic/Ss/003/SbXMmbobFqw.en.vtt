00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.660 

now<00:00:31.740> we've<00:00:32.010> gotten<00:00:32.310> to<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> real

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:32.670 
now we've gotten to the real

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.640 
now we've gotten to the real
nitty-gritty<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.510> our<00:00:33.720> engine<00:00:34.020> teardown<00:00:34.440> we

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
nitty-gritty of our engine teardown we

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.650 
nitty-gritty of our engine teardown we
have<00:00:34.800> pulled<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> cylinder<00:00:35.790> head<00:00:35.970> off<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.540> if

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
have pulled the cylinder head off and if

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.300 
have pulled the cylinder head off and if
you<00:00:36.780> look<00:00:36.990> right<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.650> where<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> lot

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
you look right here this is where a lot

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.430 
you look right here this is where a lot
of<00:00:38.460> work<00:00:38.610> goes<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.330> engine<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.900> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
of work goes on in this engine in the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
of work goes on in this engine in the
cylinder<00:00:40.920> area<00:00:41.310> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.700> where<00:00:41.880> the<00:00:42.060> piston

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
cylinder area this is where the piston

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.330 
cylinder area this is where the piston
goes<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.020> down<00:00:43.080> but<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.740> want<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.130> to<00:00:44.220> look

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
goes up and down but I want you to look

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.310 
goes up and down but I want you to look
real<00:00:44.580> closely<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.480> piston<00:00:45.930> right<00:00:46.110> here

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
real closely at this piston right here

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.530 
real closely at this piston right here
look<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.460> carbon<00:00:48.000> buildup<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
look at all the carbon buildup the

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.600 
look at all the carbon buildup the
deposit<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.290> that<00:00:49.680> comes<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.190> cup<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
deposit and that comes from a cup of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.610 
deposit and that comes from a cup of
things<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.120> comes<00:00:51.330> from<00:00:51.480> fuel<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> other

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
things it comes from fuel but the other

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
things it comes from fuel but the other
thing<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.010> comes<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.790> we<00:00:54.239> start<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.540> get

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
thing it comes from is we start to get

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.690 
thing it comes from is we start to get
where<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.260> engine<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.830> starts<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> creep

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
where on this engine all starts to creep

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.430 
where on this engine all starts to creep
by<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> ring<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> gets<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.960> top<00:00:58.200> of<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
by the ring and gets on top of the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.130 
by the ring and gets on top of the
piston<00:00:58.650> now<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.520> does<00:00:59.879> several<00:01:00.390> things<00:01:00.629> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
piston now this does several things it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.720 
piston now this does several things it's
going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> hurt<00:01:01.559> fuel<00:01:01.860> mileage<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
going to hurt fuel mileage it's going to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.150 
going to hurt fuel mileage it's going to
hurt<00:01:02.879> horsepower<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.810> eventually<00:01:04.680> probably

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
hurt horsepower and eventually probably

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.859 
hurt horsepower and eventually probably
lead<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.339> failure<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> look

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
lead to failure now I want you to look

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.630 
lead to failure now I want you to look
at<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.140> brand<00:01:07.500> new<00:01:07.590> piston<00:01:08.160> here<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.550> the

perfect world this is what we would love
the<00:01:10.410> piston<00:01:10.800> looked<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.310> because<00:01:11.910> this<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the piston looked like because this is

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.150 
the piston looked like because this is
when<00:01:12.660> it'll<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.200> most<00:01:13.410> efficient<00:01:14.009> let's

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
when it'll be the most efficient let's

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.680 
when it'll be the most efficient let's
take<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> look<00:01:14.700> at<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> couple<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> cylinder

connecting rod it's going to coat that
above<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.490> engine<00:01:56.850> oil<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.210> protect<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
above your engine oil and protect it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.929 
above your engine oil and protect it
from<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.380> deposit<00:01:59.010> and<00:01:59.159> carbon<00:01:59.549> buildup

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
from all this deposit and carbon buildup

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.060 
from all this deposit and carbon buildup
so<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> way<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.020> using<00:02:01.500> slick<00:02:01.740> 50

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
so the way I see it using slick 50

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.399 
so the way I see it using slick 50
supercharge<00:02:02.670> yeah<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.119> reduces<00:02:03.570> heat<00:02:03.869> wear

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
supercharge yeah it reduces heat wear

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.140 
supercharge yeah it reduces heat wear
friction<00:02:05.070> all<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.369> things<00:02:05.610> we're<00:02:05.760> trying<00:02:05.909> to

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
friction all the things we're trying to

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.850 
friction all the things we're trying to
accomplish<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.930> also<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.590> perfect

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
accomplish but it's also the perfect

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.729 
accomplish but it's also the perfect
storm<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.610> protects<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.619> increases<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
storm it protects and increases the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.289 
storm it protects and increases the
efficiency<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.310> your<00:02:11.459> engine<00:02:11.850> which<00:02:12.000> leads<00:02:12.209> to

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
efficiency of your engine which leads to

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.810 
efficiency of your engine which leads to
more<00:02:12.480> horsepower<00:02:13.049> you<00:02:13.500> know<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> line<00:02:14.040> pour

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
more horsepower you know the line pour

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.010 
more horsepower you know the line pour
it<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.090> order

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.080
