00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.469 
enough to really war where are you if
you<00:02:07.800> bring<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.129> skill<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.429> prevents<00:02:09.300> knocked

that's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.220 
that's

of<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.490> run<00:02:46.700> you're<00:02:46.940> getting<00:02:47.150> low<00:02:47.270> drops<00:02:47.570> maybe

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
of a run you're getting low drops maybe

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.260 
of a run you're getting low drops maybe
you<00:02:48.020> want<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.230> go<00:02:48.320> kill<00:02:48.530> some<00:02:48.830> more<00:02:49.270> stuff

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
you want to go kill some more stuff

you want to go kill some more stuff
which<00:02:50.570> is<00:02:50.720> what<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.410> was<00:02:51.680> doing<00:02:51.950> because<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.670> did

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
which is what I was doing because I did

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.820 
which is what I was doing because I did
a<00:02:53.450> test<00:02:53.720> run<00:02:53.900> before<00:02:53.959> this<00:02:54.350> just<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.650> find

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
a test run before this just to find

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.680 
a test run before this just to find
where<00:02:54.980> all<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.190> spawn<00:02:55.430> spawns<00:02:56.000> were<00:02:56.300> where<00:02:56.660> I

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
where all the spawn spawns were where I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.760 
where all the spawn spawns were where I
got<00:02:56.989> like<00:02:57.640> 12<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:59.150> then<00:02:59.750> all<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.260> runs<00:03:00.590> where

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
got like 12 and then all the runs where

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.760 
got like 12 and then all the runs where
I'm<00:03:00.860> trying<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.160> record<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:01.820> don't<00:03:02.239> get<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> lot

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
I'm trying to record I don't get a lot

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.310 
I'm trying to record I don't get a lot
so<00:03:03.770> and<00:03:04.150> there<00:03:05.150> was<00:03:05.330> one<00:03:05.360> run<00:03:05.810> where<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.020> died

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
so and there was one run where I died

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.340 
so and there was one run where I died
because<00:03:06.590> like<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.070> said<00:03:07.130> they<00:03:07.580> can<00:03:08.350> interrupt

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
because like I said they can interrupt

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.590 
because like I said they can interrupt
anyway<00:03:10.220> this<00:03:10.940> last<00:03:11.239> group<00:03:11.330> right<00:03:11.570> here

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
anyway this last group right here

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.550 
anyway this last group right here
usually<00:03:12.170> has<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.560> boss<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.230> really

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
usually has a boss in it and it's really

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.960 
usually has a boss in it and it's really
far<00:03:15.709> away<00:03:15.860> from<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.250> other<00:03:16.370> groups<00:03:16.700> you

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
far away from the other groups you

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.789 
far away from the other groups you
probably<00:03:17.239> didn't<00:03:17.989> really<00:03:18.170> notice<00:03:18.380> how<00:03:18.620> far

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
probably didn't really notice how far

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.800 
probably didn't really notice how far
away<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.220> because<00:03:19.519> I<00:03:19.549> have<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.940> video<00:03:20.420> sped

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
away it is because I have the video sped

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.199 
away it is because I have the video sped
up<00:03:21.070> but<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.489> little<00:03:22.670> bit<00:03:22.820> out<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.060> way

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
up but it is a little bit out the way

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.300 
up but it is a little bit out the way
but<00:03:23.450> after<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.380> just<00:03:24.410> run<00:03:24.799> back<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.190> the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
but after that you just run back to the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.940 
but after that you just run back to the
portal<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:26.000> rezone<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:27.140> that's<00:03:27.620> all<00:03:27.799> there<00:03:27.920> is

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
portal and rezone so that's all there is

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.670 
portal and rezone so that's all there is
to<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.430> week
