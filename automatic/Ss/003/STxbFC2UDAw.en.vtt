00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 I 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.230
 and we do not know how they are so well 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.800
 I think for not having been your cute 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.960
 video but because of school issues 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 of tasks and that has not had much 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.910
 time is good but we're back 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.920
 today I bring you a new world the former king 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.679
 why many people already owe it 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.040
 know if you do not know it because you're going to 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.350
 meet in this video and we start at 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.350
 line of the description we choose the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 we are going to save and well 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.809
 we will have downloaded already closed the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.020
 browser 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.820
 let's press the letter windows + ere 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.430
 and here we have to write percent 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.730
 app data percent 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.730
 enter 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.610
 and ok let's go to minecraft point 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.190
 let's mods and let's drag today and 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.080
 let's drag the ex king towards the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.720
 window towards the folder of more worth 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 well it is already in draft we are going to 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.800
 close it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.480
 now let's open the micro 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.240
 well then once open while we go 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.659
 to select the profile of spots and go 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.479
 to start and strong 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.899
 in it once opened let's give go 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.390
 to put a game and ready 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.539
 We are already in minecraft and well 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.679
 let's try the mode we have to 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.679
 press the letter x 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.229
 Look 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.540
 what piece of mode do we have all the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.119
 blocks that we want from any 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.050
 any material whatever which 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.270
 this is a lot this mod 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.880
 today this is quite quite useful for 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.590
 look for diamonds for example look there 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.470
 there is there there is a lot of love 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.680
 there are diamonds there we go a little bit 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.050
 for example another one that has and gold 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.830
 there is more of the before also 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.330
 let's find 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.330
 it's a bit of diamond 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.820
 Well, I do not know, we're going to produce here 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.820
 ok to see let's put this 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.050
 and let's open this for example 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.420
 and here we have diamonds we will continue 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.420
 here breaking 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.660
 and well we got to diamonds worth 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.180
 let's press again the X 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.330
 you want more diamonds or you just 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.330
 you go 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.000
 because it does not matter 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.629
 all lime 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.489
 and we have songs of meters and other 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.489
 very important thing we are pushing the 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.730
 letter l gives us this vision effect 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.730
 night 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.840
 without this you can not see anything but with 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.739
 him and we can see good follow 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.739
 digging and searching 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.990
 now it's too useful 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.819
 ok this experiment was until the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.500
 last almost the last level to the layer of 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:36.890
 the earth and we broke 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:41.319
 well 48 that I am educational 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:45.080
 but it will not be possible if it is not in diamond 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.520
 come on I do not know what they want that he wants 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.520
 find what you want 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.130
 god maybe this 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.270
 wait how the rest can be in 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.569
 under of 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.480
 as it is not very useful this is how 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.490
 and well, already 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.590
 and I showed you what torch here 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.269
 in the procedure I wanted this 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.060
 nobody that are my constructions 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.980
 and that I do not remember where and good what 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.880
 important 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.880
 let's go out 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.399
 the salsero 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.200
 well then I'll make a small cut 

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:36.540
 until you exit it 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.540
 Well, I've already managed to get out 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.220
 It really is there for me 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.980
 ok then as I told them 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.380
 If you remove the letter l, then it's no longer 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.540
 you have this night vision sector of 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:55.270
 the room ny you have vision 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.689
 night and you can see perfectly everything 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.999
 today we are dead 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.999
 you can see everything with vision 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:09.989
 so then the world is squeezing 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.939
 the x you have all all the blocks what 

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:15.389
 what you want there there is my house that 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:19.439
 receive we will be and well then you can search 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:22.409
 your two diamonds the achievement for example 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.869
 here I see gold quickly here here is a 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:30.360
 little diamond lapis lazuli 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:31.169
 coal all all well with the letter l 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.310
 we already know 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.140
 we see we put the night vision 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.960
 and well if after that is a way 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.180
 pretty pretty useful to light up and 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.750
 if we combine it with the back mode 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:49.950
 pack mode that is also on my channel 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:52.140
 It would be fabulous to combine those 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.690
 ways to accumulate the greatest 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.300
 amount of diamonds gold everything 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.610
 that you want is worth then well then 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.310
 I hope you like it a lot this way 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.650
 pretty good and then nothing guys 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.320
