about when you're young you know I think

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.150 
about when you're young you know I think
that<00:00:55.750> when<00:00:55.870> I<00:00:55.930> was<00:00:56.050> 12<00:00:56.320> years<00:00:56.410> old<00:00:56.620> you<00:00:56.860> always

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
that when I was 12 years old you always

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.870 
that when I was 12 years old you always
thought<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.239> dreamt<00:00:58.630> what<00:00:58.900> if<00:00:59.430> at<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.520> moment

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
thought and dreamt what if at the moment

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.010 
thought and dreamt what if at the moment
it<00:01:00.940> happened<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.420> was<00:01:01.510> kind<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.780> such<00:01:01.989> a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
it happened it was kind of such a

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.109 
it happened it was kind of such a
surreal<00:01:02.290> moment<00:01:02.410> that<00:01:03.010> I<00:01:03.430> don't<00:01:03.790> even<00:01:03.880> sleep

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
surreal moment that I don't even sleep

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.110 
surreal moment that I don't even sleep
that<00:01:04.299> night<00:01:04.420> I<00:01:04.479> stayed<00:01:04.869> awake<00:01:05.140> all<00:01:05.290> night<00:01:05.530> just

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
that night I stayed awake all night just

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.430 
that night I stayed awake all night just
laying<00:01:07.120> in<00:01:07.210> my<00:01:07.270> bed<00:01:07.300> going<00:01:07.780> like<00:01:07.930> wow<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.290> you

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
laying in my bed going like wow it you

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.040 
laying in my bed going like wow it you
know<00:01:08.530> it's<00:01:08.680> real<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.040> it<00:01:09.280> was<00:01:09.370> a<00:01:09.400> very<00:01:10.050> special

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
know it's real and it was a very special

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.050 
know it's real and it was a very special
I<00:01:11.340> think<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.430> might<00:01:12.520> have<00:01:12.610> been<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.790> little<00:01:12.850> bit

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
I think it might have been a little bit

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.640 
I think it might have been a little bit
at<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.180> beginning<00:01:13.360> but<00:01:13.840> right<00:01:14.170> now<00:01:14.350> no<00:01:14.380> I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
at the beginning but right now no I

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.990 
at the beginning but right now no I
don't<00:01:14.920> think<00:01:14.979> it's<00:01:15.220> anything<00:01:15.580> different<00:01:15.940> than

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
don't think it's anything different than

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.300 
don't think it's anything different than
a<00:01:16.210> black<00:01:16.659> background<00:01:16.930> or<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.620> white<00:01:18.100> background

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
a black background or a white background

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.120 
a black background or a white background
or<00:01:18.640> red<00:01:18.790> ones<00:01:19.000> so<00:01:19.240> I<00:01:19.900> actually<00:01:20.500> like<00:01:20.770> the

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
or red ones so I actually like the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.010 
or red ones so I actually like the
feeling<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:21.549> having<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:22.299> control<00:01:22.420> so<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:22.870> think

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
feeling of having the control so I think

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.780 
feeling of having the control so I think
that<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:23.950> get<00:01:24.190> back<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:24.460> control<00:01:24.549> this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790

the<00:01:46.770> rest<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.010> year<00:01:47.190> hopefully<00:01:47.850> getting<00:01:48.120> have

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the rest a year hopefully getting have

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.970 
the rest a year hopefully getting have
more<00:01:48.600> wins<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:48.900> in<00:01:48.990> Supercross<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.470> I'd

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
more wins here in Supercross and I'd

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.290 
more wins here in Supercross and I'd
love<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.400> my<00:01:50.430> first<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.120> that'd

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
love to get my first one out but that'd

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.560 
love to get my first one out but that'd
be<00:01:51.390> huge<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.690> me<00:01:51.900> I<00:01:51.930> think<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
be huge for me I think that's a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.420 
be huge for me I think that's a
realistic<00:01:54.570> goal<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.260> for<00:01:55.710> me<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.010> need<00:01:56.310> k

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
realistic goal so for me I just need k

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.680 
realistic goal so for me I just need k
the<00:01:56.520> momentum<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.970> have<00:01:57.120> from<00:01:57.210> Supercross

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
the momentum that I have from Supercross

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.360 
the momentum that I have from Supercross
