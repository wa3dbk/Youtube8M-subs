00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.980
 development 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.390
 arable farms the acquisition 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.339
 these parents 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.470
 we wanted to keep the grounds and the buildings and therefore have them 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.240
 yes some selected 9 activity 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.080
 keep the world profitable 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.010
 we knew that those beach huts for sale to me do resent cda 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.830
 Monday worth extra photo anp 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.930
 in addition 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.090
 then when the social call the address 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 the perpetrator and the cell that the beach draw 2 2 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.530
 I think they did a test and they are mother and father 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.390
 have leaked out 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.390
 arable farming the final wall street 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.420
 and meanwhile also have a ruling 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.909
 upon return and we have a mini camping the cars try to cook it 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.909
 We had expanded 25 years and renewed everything 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.800
 55 and 25 places 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.760
 we are now just the last 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 dwm does not get this 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.390
 yolanthe my wife from emmen 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.410
 the activity for tourists who no longer wanted to get hands on during a beach 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.490
 bike ride to pick a bunch of flowers or some small fruit 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.010
 and then in combination with 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.460
 we thought it would be known by e-mail 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.290
 in the time that with that business take over in our mind frolic value 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 it is that feasible yes or no it said 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 that says he was on the bar that she was an advertisement from beau bulb farmers 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.630
 building on landscape and if you had plans for new construction or for a new one 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.640
 shed then you could 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.660
 offenders receive a subsidy 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.840
 we thought when I am here I would not just be eligible 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.180
 but thought we were trying with 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.180
 And that turned out to be the grant for the architect 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.419
 and 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:15.359
 matter again very much what normally that money is not completely super 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.859
 publisher 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.339
 but not because the building until since I nobody we are really felt 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.120
 made use of because actually a total plan officials with a campsite in 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.059
 the tearoom candy bed and breakfast did make it our head and also 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:34.010
 put everything on a drawing, someone then put it into something more 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.879
 sight that has that you yourself became third 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.569
 we are not together to come to that design and we saw the man too 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.379
 save 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.200
 the red in the minus the booklet with everything from him to a lot 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.530
 different styles had arrived and then the hard drive and therefore also to 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:52.099
 picked out but we thought what is nobody who also takes their bill anymore 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.609
 stop the people he just said everything but it is not that 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.679
 completely free hand 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.479
 we still have a building of falls in another place in his head 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:03.290
 but deeds 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.819
 yes those men all have a better understanding of that than you yourself 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.200
 but few people have had it put on at a certain time and then he said 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.099
 according to Secretary General 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.280
 Dennis Bergkamp with quartets shows that I am reselling of course 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:19.969
 must stand there completely 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.969
 also positive because 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.999
 the 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.659
 you must have it yourself if you have no idea, you can 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.059
 nothing with it but because we dive now it is an important part and wanted to do 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.569
 then 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.929
 with a helping hand and yes I want 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:38.790
 m 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.030
 you yourself sometimes look too much from your own property, I think you also think outside of it 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.839
 but deeds 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:48.160
 msn architect diouf is looking at the world that is more like a man 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.729
 so can come and if there is a gang always better 66 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:54.729
 a little attention and that they have a disease that counts 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.629
 yes that was tested positive to pick up then 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.110
 we do that the agent could change the suspicious things from touareg 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.769
 few people have all changed here from dam to dam run and we are real 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.349
 we are a real transition to luxury 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.110
 instead has cable TV and 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.849
 talk it off 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.299
 corine wireless internet internet where countless places are evelyn stevens 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.349
 big 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.249
 and when those people got there some of his son's tonight, that's it 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.919
 she jacob van zanten something of the year we half fine and the toilet block what 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.020
 confusing and so on 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.060
 yes so every all buildings finally end what color 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.740
 those that exist 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.199
 and apart from the things you look at yellow cities and something has played 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.400
 taken from 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.169
 I know of zzlag he would there you have blue shake and there he has her 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.599
 with the blue today 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.020
 personally you think what exactly business manager sÃ¶ren lerby who they are 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.680
 and what they want 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.740
 but that could do and we still have a nice idea with the 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.449
 teahouse to then 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.099

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.690
 that we organized some together 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.620
 things like that not only do you get to bologna 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.650
 and that is really the intention to really yes we think we put that posture 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.539
 we really want to have one 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.139
 Friday tried to retain one hundredth 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.290
 it is that of the bend culture 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.259
 valencia 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.599
 and a bit you pay company buildings and stuff 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.300
 and it wants a lot of smoke and the family of landscapes is in it 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.870
 also 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.400
 wife and children and that is always so there is not always everything 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.089
 usually not involving this not obvious that the military actions did say that 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.819
 the work and third that also belongs to loss of ball 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.689

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:50.919
 to keep our doctor at the company 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.050
 we have more capacity to live next to the company so that is what it has 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.080

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.460
 and we stay in british that my parents can come there as long as possible 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.479
 in the short term 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.809
 the road is not necessary 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:09.969

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:24.639
 nature and 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.270
