00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
with 1943 which that controller works

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.249 
with 1943 which that controller works
absolutely<00:01:21.840> perfect<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:23.630> back<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:25.020> is

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
absolutely perfect for that back here is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.100 
absolutely perfect for that back here is
rob<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> robot<00:01:26.130> also<00:01:26.820> known<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.540> robotic

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
rob the robot also known as the robotic

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.160 
rob the robot also known as the robotic
operating<00:01:28.530> buddy<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.360> there<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.900> game

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
operating buddy and there is the game

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.160 
operating buddy and there is the game
that<00:01:31.229> he<00:01:31.409> works<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.869> gyro<00:01:33.869> might

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that he works with which is gyro might

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.460 
that he works with which is gyro might
as<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:36.229> really<00:01:37.229> cool

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
as you can see right there really cool

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.719 
as you can see right there really cool
if<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.799> find<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.130> cheap<00:01:38.159> somewhere

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
if you can find a cheap somewhere

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.100 
if you can find a cheap somewhere
luckily<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.689> did<00:01:40.310> right<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.270> NES<00:01:42.780> max

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
luckily I did right there is the NES max

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
luckily I did right there is the NES max
controller<00:01:43.560> which<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.920> pretty<00:01:44.070> much<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> same

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
controller which is pretty much the same

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.300 
controller which is pretty much the same
thing<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.600> advantage<00:01:46.170> right<00:01:46.350> there<00:01:46.590> but

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
thing as the advantage right there but

and the adjustable you know auto-fire

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.660 
and the adjustable you know auto-fire
speed<00:01:54.210> function<00:01:55.020> thing<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.680> still<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> really

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
speed function thing but still a really

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.430 
speed function thing but still a really
cool<00:01:56.850> controller

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
cool controller

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.270

well if you can find a cheap because it

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.390 
well if you can find a cheap because it
is<00:02:28.420> also<00:02:28.630> sort<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.200> hard<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.440> find<00:02:29.800> like<00:02:30.070> the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
rob the robot back there but i would got

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.100 
rob the robot back there but i would got
lucky<00:02:33.520> enough<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.910> find<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.270> in<00:02:34.360> its<00:02:34.480> box<00:02:34.720> and

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
lucky enough to find it in its box and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.870 
lucky enough to find it in its box and
there's<00:02:35.739> one<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.130> games<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.640> works

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
there's one of the games that it works

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
least these two guys right here we have

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.240 
least these two guys right here we have
the<00:02:48.940> NES<00:02:49.450> satellite<00:02:50.020> which<00:02:50.320> is<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.530> four<00:02:51.010> player

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
the NES satellite which is a four player

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.910 
the NES satellite which is a four player
adapter<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:52.570> plug<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.110> receiver<00:02:53.590> thing

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
adapter you plug this receiver thing

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.729 
adapter you plug this receiver thing
into<00:02:54.220> your<00:02:54.340> nes<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.959> becomes<00:02:56.320> your<00:02:56.440> four

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
into your nes and this becomes your four

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.670 
into your nes and this becomes your four
player<00:02:56.920> adapter<00:02:57.250> with<00:02:57.790> auto<00:02:58.660> fire<00:02:59.110> functions

player adapter with auto fire functions

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.670 
player adapter with auto fire functions
built<00:02:59.920> right<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:02.110> know<00:03:02.230> wireless

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
built right in and you know wireless

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.240 
built right in and you know wireless
capabilities<00:03:03.340> obviously<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:05.220> right<00:03:06.220> over

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
capabilities obviously and right over

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.850 
capabilities obviously and right over
here<00:03:06.580> next<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.330> nes<00:03:08.260> for<00:03:08.560> score

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
here next to it is the nes for score

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.250 
here next to it is the nes for score
which<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.250> essentially<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.850> same<00:03:09.940> thing<00:03:10.260> it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
which is essentially the same thing it

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.350 
which is essentially the same thing it
just<00:03:11.769> has<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> wire<00:03:12.430> on<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.790> that's<00:03:12.940> really<00:03:13.269> the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
just has a wire on it that's really the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.970 
just has a wire on it that's really the
only<00:03:13.420> difference<00:03:13.959> but<00:03:14.350> they<00:03:14.440> kept<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.799> same

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
only difference but they kept the same

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.610 
only difference but they kept the same
things<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.400> made<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.970> satellite<00:03:16.510> cool<00:03:16.780> like

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
things that made the satellite cool like

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.860 
things that made the satellite cool like
the<00:03:17.860> auto<00:03:18.160> fire<00:03:18.310> functions<00:03:19.090> for<00:03:19.480> controller

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
the auto fire functions for controller

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.780 
the auto fire functions for controller
ports<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.769> know<00:03:20.890> all<00:03:21.010> other<00:03:21.250> really<00:03:21.640> cool
