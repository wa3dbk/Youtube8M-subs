how<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:17.130> made<00:01:17.399> this<00:01:17.610> game<00:01:17.880> I'm<00:01:18.270> just

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
how they made this game I'm just

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.630 
how they made this game I'm just
wondering<00:01:18.929> myself<00:01:19.259> how<00:01:20.009> are<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.310> supposed<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
wondering myself how are you supposed to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.149 
wondering myself how are you supposed to
move<00:01:20.789> around<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.390> doesn't<00:01:21.600> make<00:01:21.659> any<00:01:21.750> sense

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
move around it doesn't make any sense

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.960 
move around it doesn't make any sense
it's<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.399> you<00:01:23.759> move<00:01:24.000> around<00:01:24.569> the<00:01:25.259> city<00:01:26.009> like

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it's like you move around the city like

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.139 
it's like you move around the city like
around<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.479> outskirts<00:01:27.780> innocent<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.149> just

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
around the outskirts innocent and just

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.830 
around the outskirts innocent and just
that<00:01:30.330> little<00:01:30.539> shot<00:01:30.960> made<00:01:31.679> me<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that little shot made me think about the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.520 
that little shot made me think about the
future<00:01:34.080> of<00:01:34.319> Pokemon<00:01:35.039> games<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:36.149> this<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.899> very

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
future of Pokemon games now this is very

future of Pokemon games now this is very
very<00:01:37.890> good<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:39.300> thinking<00:01:39.569> of<00:01:39.810> myself<00:01:39.960> well

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
very good I'm thinking of myself well

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.700 
very good I'm thinking of myself well
with<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> 3ds<00:01:41.399> being<00:01:41.880> released<00:01:42.299> uh<00:01:42.560> not<00:01:43.560> too
