37 how's your week been as and you came
to<00:06:55.659> the<00:06:55.809> ballroom<00:06:56.429> you<00:06:57.429> know<00:06:57.549> what<00:06:57.669> I<00:06:57.699> didn't

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:58.029 
to the ballroom you know what I didn't

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:59.789 
to the ballroom you know what I didn't
even<00:06:58.059> have<00:06:58.239> time<00:06:58.449> to<00:06:58.689> sort<00:06:59.259> of<00:06:59.349> enjoy<00:06:59.619> the

00:06:59.789 --> 00:06:59.799 
even have time to sort of enjoy the

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:01.289 
even have time to sort of enjoy the
moment<00:07:00.129> go<00:07:00.369> straight<00:07:00.849> back<00:07:00.969> into<00:07:01.209> the

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:01.299 
moment go straight back into the

00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:02.850 
moment go straight back into the
training<00:07:01.599> room<00:07:01.659> anyway<00:07:01.899> but<00:07:02.199> I<00:07:02.349> think<00:07:02.769> was

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
training room anyway but I think was

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.049 
training room anyway but I think was
important<00:07:03.279> because<00:07:03.339> a<00:07:03.489> lot<00:07:03.669> of<00:07:03.699> people<00:07:03.969> have

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:04.059 
important because a lot of people have

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:05.369 
important because a lot of people have
scored<00:07:04.360> highly<00:07:04.569> and<00:07:04.779> then<00:07:04.869> you<00:07:04.929> get<00:07:05.049> a<00:07:05.110> little

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:05.379 
scored highly and then you get a little

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.350 
scored highly and then you get a little
bit<00:07:05.469> carried<00:07:05.709> away<00:07:05.829> so<00:07:06.009> I<00:07:06.159> may<00:07:06.579> have<00:07:06.699> hopefully

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 
bit carried away so I may have hopefully

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.729 
bit carried away so I may have hopefully
I've<00:07:07.689> learnt<00:07:07.899> a<00:07:07.959> lesson<00:07:08.079> from<00:07:08.319> that<00:07:08.409> Chester
