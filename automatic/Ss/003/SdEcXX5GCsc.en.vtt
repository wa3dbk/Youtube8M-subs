00:00:01.952 --> 00:00:04.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:19.770
Just pick a note in your head.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.290
Think of it.

00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:25.310
It can be high, it can be low.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.241
Deep breath, and
just hum your note.

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:31.223
[HUMMING]

00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:41.660
[HUMMING]

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.290
Change to a different note.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.690
[HUMMING]

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.610
Step up [INAUDIBLE] tone.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.580
That's a lovely chord.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.040
New note.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.768
Go the other direction.

00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:05.660
[HUMMING]

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.530
OK, don't try and be the leader.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.159
Just sing it so that you don't
feel your notes poking out more

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:16.950
than anyone else's.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.510
But when I do a count down from
four like this, and by the time

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.370
I get to zero, I want everyone
to be singing the same note.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.620
So find a random note.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.480
And when I start
doing this, you just

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.420
very slowly go from
your note to the note

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.420
that you think everyone
else is singing, and see

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.810
if we all go to the same place.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.360
Deep breath.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.590
Here's the note in your head.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.130
Got it?

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.480
Breathe in.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.450
[HUMMING]

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.222
Sing that note.

00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:51.168
[HUMMING]

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.830
I can hear some
voices poking out.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.530
So try not to let me hear
your voice in particular.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.373
Just blend with
people around you.

00:02:01.373 --> 00:02:04.740
[HUMMING]

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.626
More volume.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:10.512
[HUMMING]

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.860
OK.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.320
Go to a different low note now.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.740
And we'll do the
same thing again.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.720
And--

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.150
[HUMMING]

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.060
Take a breath when you need one.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.410
