00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that piece in half and then you unfold

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.920 
that piece in half and then you unfold
it<00:01:18.030> make<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.960> pyramid<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:20.150> fold<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.600> way

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it make a pyramid like fold so that way

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.240

it<00:01:25.259> looks<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:26.210> then<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
it looks like this then what you do is

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
it looks like this then what you do is
you<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.280> draw<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.820> Olaf's<00:01:30.329> face<00:01:30.630> because

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you just draw on Olaf's face because

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.109 
you just draw on Olaf's face because
it's<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.619> easier<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.189> draw<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.490> walls<00:01:32.700> flat

it's a lot easier to draw it walls flat
rather<00:01:33.509> than<00:01:33.840> women<00:01:34.100> blown<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.960> drawn<00:01:36.960> on

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
rather than women blown up drawn on

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.410 
rather than women blown up drawn on
eyebrows<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.700> poked<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.090> hole<00:01:39.210> where

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420

eyebrows then I just poked a hole where
his<00:01:39.509> nose<00:01:39.720> would<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.170> cuz<00:01:41.009> I'll<00:01:41.100> meet<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
his nose would be cuz I'll meet that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.780

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.889 
step-by-step instruction below once you
fold<00:02:05.280> those<00:02:05.460> little<00:02:05.820> pieces<00:02:06.000> into<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.420> pocket

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
fold those little pieces into the pocket

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.169 
fold those little pieces into the pocket
what<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.310> blow<00:02:08.520> into<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.819> hole

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
what you do is you blow into that hole

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.360 
what you do is you blow into that hole
and<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.989> does<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.289> I'm<00:02:10.920> gonna<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.700> face

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
and it does that I'm gonna the face

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.220 
and it does that I'm gonna the face
putting<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.730> aside<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:13.180> do<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.959> exact<00:02:14.200> same

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
putting it aside you do the exact same

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.740 
putting it aside you do the exact same
step<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:15.030> skipped<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.120> all<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.390> way<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
step I skipped it all the way to the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.800 
step I skipped it all the way to the
triangular<00:02:17.680> spot<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.370> drew<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.180> his<00:02:19.629> little

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
triangular spot I drew on his little

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.130 
triangular spot I drew on his little
button<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.909> I'm<00:02:21.909> just<00:02:22.360> doing<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.720> exact<00:02:22.959> same

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
button and I'm just doing the exact same

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.970 
button and I'm just doing the exact same
step<00:02:23.500> as<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.709> did<00:02:23.890> for<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.220> head<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.680> will<00:02:26.799> have

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
step as I did for the head you will have

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.059 
step as I did for the head you will have
two<00:02:27.549> bigger<00:02:29.430> circle<00:02:30.430> square<00:02:30.819> looking<00:02:31.360> things

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
two bigger circle square looking things

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.720 
two bigger circle square looking things
they're<00:02:33.069> pretty<00:02:33.519> interesting<00:02:33.849> looking<00:02:34.209> and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
they're pretty interesting looking and

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.850 
they're pretty interesting looking and
you<00:02:36.730> fold<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.420> piece<00:02:37.629> in<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.470> fold<00:02:38.799> that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
you fold that piece in and you fold that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.960 
you fold that piece in and you fold that
piece<00:02:39.159> in<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:40.290> blow<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.500> up<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:44.790> all<00:02:45.790> right

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
piece in and blow it up and all right

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.330 
piece in and blow it up and all right
there<00:02:46.329> we<00:02:46.420> go<00:02:46.569> took<00:02:47.109> a<00:02:47.140> little<00:02:47.290> while<00:02:47.440> what

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
there we go took a little while what

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.559 
there we go took a little while what
you're<00:02:48.459> going<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.640> do<00:02:48.760> now<00:02:48.910> is<00:02:49.090> fold<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.390> piece

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
you're going to do now is fold a piece

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.559 
you're going to do now is fold a piece
in<00:02:49.720> half<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.290> do<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:51.000> fold<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> one<00:02:52.299> piece

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
in half and do that fold the one piece

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.830 
in half and do that fold the one piece
up<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.109> make<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.440> perfect<00:02:53.650> square<00:02:54.250> again<00:02:54.840> but

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
up and make it perfect square again but

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.349 
up and make it perfect square again but
this<00:02:56.049> time<00:02:56.260> it's<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.650> lot<00:02:56.799> smaller<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:58.030> do<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
this time it's a lot smaller you do the

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.809 
this time it's a lot smaller you do the
exact<00:02:58.599> same<00:02:58.629> steps<00:02:59.140> as<00:02:59.319> you've<00:02:59.470> been<00:02:59.819> doing

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
exact same steps as you've been doing

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.349 
exact same steps as you've been doing
and<00:03:01.500> also<00:03:02.500> I'll<00:03:02.739> put<00:03:02.799> a<00:03:03.010> link<00:03:03.280> below<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.970> show

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
drew another button onto that piece and

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.690 
drew another button onto that piece and
kept<00:03:17.859> going<00:03:19.859> suck<00:03:20.859> into<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.130> pieces<00:03:21.519> in

you're<00:03:51.849> going<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.000> do<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.419> you're<00:03:52.930> going<00:03:52.959> to

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.559 
you're going to do is you're going to
fish<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.769> pipe<00:03:54.340> cleaner<00:03:54.639> hopefully<00:03:55.419> it's

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
fish a pipe cleaner hopefully it's

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.080 
fish a pipe cleaner hopefully it's
straight<00:03:55.959> cuz<00:03:56.349> it's<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.769> lot<00:03:56.949> easier<00:03:57.160> through

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
straight cuz it's a lot easier through

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.460 
straight cuz it's a lot easier through
the<00:03:58.389> bottom<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:59.139> piece<00:04:00.099> and<00:04:00.489> then<00:04:01.389> you<00:04:02.019> kink<00:04:02.349> it

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
the bottom of piece and then you kink it

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.259 
the bottom of piece and then you kink it
at<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.680> bottom<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.190> make<00:04:03.370> sure<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:03.669> it<00:04:04.090> just

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
at the bottom to make sure that it just

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.659 
at the bottom to make sure that it just
stays<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:05.079> you<00:04:05.230> fish<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.620> through<00:04:05.859> all<00:04:06.609> three

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
stays and you fish it through all three

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.750 
stays and you fish it through all three
pieces<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.829> had<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:08.919> most<00:04:09.069> problems<00:04:09.459> with<00:04:09.579> this

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
pieces I had the most problems with this

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.110 
pieces I had the most problems with this
piece<00:04:10.090> for<00:04:10.870> some<00:04:11.079> odd<00:04:11.260> reason<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:14.280> okay<00:04:15.280> take
