00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
reason this is called the pick method

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.680 
reason this is called the pick method
instead<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.609> throw<00:01:02.820> method<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.539> can

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
instead of the throw method is you can

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.490 
instead of the throw method is you can
just<00:01:03.809> sort<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.549> pick<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.850> yarn<00:01:06.060> up<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:07.320> this

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
to do this in through the front door

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.440 
to do this in through the front door
once<00:01:33.270> around<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.780> back<00:01:35.000> peek<00:01:36.000> through<00:01:36.420> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and going down into the stitch this is

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.980 
and going down into the stitch this is
the<00:02:02.610> challenge<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.180> continental<00:02:03.810> knitting

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
the challenge and continental knitting

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.279 
the challenge and continental knitting
is<00:02:04.740> getting<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.700> yarn<00:02:06.060> somehow<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
is getting this yarn somehow in the

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.509 
is getting this yarn somehow in the
between<00:02:09.129> these<00:02:09.310> needles<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:09.939> then<00:02:10.119> pushed

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
between these needles and then pushed

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.600 
between these needles and then pushed
over<00:02:12.519> enough<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.939> get<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.209> through<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.480> stitch

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
over enough to get it through the stitch

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.890 
over enough to get it through the stitch
and<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:15.879> do<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.180> with<00:02:16.360> your<00:02:16.510> index

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and you can do that with your index

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.890 
and you can do that with your index
finger<00:02:17.200> that's<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.500> most<00:02:17.680> common<00:02:18.629> way<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.659> do

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
finger that's the most common way to do

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.830 
finger that's the most common way to do
it<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.370> find<00:02:21.579> I<00:02:21.730> become<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.329> tight<00:02:22.599> knitter

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
it but I find I become a tight knitter

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.350 
it but I find I become a tight knitter
if<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.170> have<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.680> do<00:02:23.829> that<00:02:24.450> use<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.629> finger

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
if I have to do that use this finger

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.589 
if I have to do that use this finger
