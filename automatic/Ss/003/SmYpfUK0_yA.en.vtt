00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.910
 satisfaction 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.130
 I see how this experience 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.599
 enthusiasm is not the English course in 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.870
 itself but it is how they acquire English 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.840
 it is the motivation that comes from this 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.510
 brief intense experience 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.410
 an experience that will open their minds and 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.160
 that will accompany them throughout life

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.630
 affective mind of the clear that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.630

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.880
