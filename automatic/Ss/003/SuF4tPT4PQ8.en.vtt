that's right and very good you know it's
a<00:02:39.270> it's<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.900> ODE<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.980> know<00:02:41.190> basically<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.970> a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
a it's the ODE you know basically it's a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.590 
a it's the ODE you know basically it's a
concept<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.130> not<00:02:44.280> new<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:45.180> a

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
concept that's and it's not new as a

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.449 
concept that's and it's not new as a
property<00:02:46.170> but<00:02:46.440> new<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.740> concept<00:02:47.100> we<00:02:47.280> have<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
property but new as a concept we have a

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.280 
property but new as a concept we have a
basically<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> bed-and-breakfast<00:02:49.230> hotel

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
which is sydney house in london in

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.960 
which is sydney house in london in
chelsea<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.380> it's<00:02:53.010> got<00:02:53.130> no<00:02:53.250> food<00:02:53.400> beverage<00:02:53.820> so

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
chelsea and it's got no food beverage so

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.430 
chelsea and it's got no food beverage so
it<00:02:54.030> can't<00:02:54.209> be<00:02:54.330> an<00:02:54.390> abode<00:02:54.660> because<00:02:55.170> food<00:02:55.320> and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
it can't be an abode because food and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.979 
it can't be an abode because food and
beverage<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.920> all<00:02:56.310> about<00:02:56.580> abode<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.750> case

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
beverage is all about abode so my case

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.660 
beverage is all about abode so my case
restaurants<00:02:58.410> be<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.709> heart<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.100> what<00:02:59.580> an

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
restaurants be in the heart of what an

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
abode food beverage offer is so it's

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.020 
abode food beverage offer is so it's
really<00:03:01.980> appropriate<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.459> we<00:03:02.580> call<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.850> baby

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
really appropriate that we call it baby

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.250 
really appropriate that we call it baby
abode<00:03:03.360> because<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.840> didn't<00:03:03.989> have<00:03:04.080> any

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
abode because it didn't have any

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.170 
abode because it didn't have any
restaurants<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:05.760> where<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.000> name

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
restaurants so that's where that name

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.660 
restaurants so that's where that name
come<00:03:06.390> from<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.680> yeah<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.310> going<00:03:08.550> very

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
come from and so yeah it's going very

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.100 
come from and so yeah it's going very
well<00:03:08.790> we'd<00:03:09.120> like<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.480> expand<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:09.959> perhaps

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
well we'd like to expand that perhaps

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.650 
well we'd like to expand that perhaps
through<00:03:10.440> London<00:03:10.650> possibly<00:03:11.459> for<00:03:11.640> anywhere

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
through London possibly for anywhere
