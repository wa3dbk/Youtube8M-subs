guys<00:00:15.000> how<00:00:15.180> to<00:00:16.020> do<00:00:16.230> shove<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.650> reverts

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.179 

the<00:00:20.630> shove-it<00:00:20.900> revert<00:00:21.349> is<00:00:21.529> kind<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.830> an<00:00:21.980> odd

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
the shove-it revert is kind of an odd

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.009 
the shove-it revert is kind of an odd
little<00:00:22.550> trick<00:00:22.849> it's<00:00:23.150> kind<00:00:23.449> of<00:00:23.539> one<00:00:23.750> that's

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
little trick it's kind of one that's

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.310 
little trick it's kind of one that's
just<00:00:24.320> fun<00:00:24.500> to<00:00:24.529> mess<00:00:24.800> around<00:00:24.949> with<00:00:25.220> and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
just fun to mess around with and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.080 
just fun to mess around with and
basically<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.710> idea<00:00:28.130> behind<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:28.669> is<00:00:28.759> that<00:00:28.970> you

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
basically the idea behind it is that you

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.929 
basically the idea behind it is that you
do<00:00:29.270> a<00:00:29.300> shove<00:00:29.689> it<00:00:29.840> while<00:00:30.590> turning<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.369> upper

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
do a shove it while turning the upper

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.490 
do a shove it while turning the upper
half<00:00:32.150> of<00:00:32.329> your<00:00:32.419> body<00:00:32.570> in<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.050> front<00:00:33.320> side

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
half of your body in the front side

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.799 
half of your body in the front side
one-eighty<00:00:33.829> position<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:35.180> land<00:00:35.449> on<00:00:35.660> your

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
one-eighty position you land on your

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.900 
one-eighty position you land on your
nose<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.440> then<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:36.890> just<00:00:37.100> pivot<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.640> front

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
nose and then you just pivot the front

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.720 
nose and then you just pivot the front
side<00:00:38.089> one-eighty<00:00:38.470> it's<00:00:39.470> kind<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:39.800> a<00:00:39.949> weird<00:00:40.250> and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
side one-eighty it's kind of a weird and

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.810 
side one-eighty it's kind of a weird and
really<00:00:41.210> involved<00:00:42.080> trick<00:00:42.530> for<00:00:43.129> kind<00:00:43.670> of

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
really involved trick for kind of

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.810 
really involved trick for kind of
seeming<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.390> be<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:44.809> simple<00:00:45.309> but<00:00:46.309> it's<00:00:46.489> strange

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
seeming to be so simple but it's strange

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.200 
seeming to be so simple but it's strange
feeling<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.809> like<00:00:48.050> throw<00:00:48.769> your<00:00:49.430> left<00:00:49.699> shoulder

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
feeling to like throw your left shoulder

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.509 
feeling to like throw your left shoulder
the<00:00:50.750> front<00:00:51.019> side<00:00:51.199> one-eighty<00:00:51.470> position<00:00:51.980> while

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
the front side one-eighty position while

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.090 
the front side one-eighty position while
shoving<00:00:53.089> your<00:00:53.210> board<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.260> then<00:00:54.379> pivoting<00:00:54.949> off

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
shoving your board and then pivoting off

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.020 
shoving your board and then pivoting off
the<00:00:55.309> nose<00:00:57.010> so<00:00:58.010> that's<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.369> basic<00:00:58.699> theory

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
the nose so that's the basic theory

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.030 
the nose so that's the basic theory
about<00:00:59.150> how<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.600> trick<00:00:59.900> works<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:00.890> let's

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
about how this trick works so let's

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.429 
about how this trick works so let's
break<00:01:01.220> it<00:01:01.280> down<00:01:01.400> into<00:01:01.699> its<00:01:01.909> parts<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:03.199> trick

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
break it down into its parts the trick

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.229 
break it down into its parts the trick
is<00:01:03.589> basically<00:01:03.769> a<00:01:04.159> shove<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:04.820> then<00:01:05.210> a

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
is basically a shove it and then a

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.090 
is basically a shove it and then a
frontside<00:01:05.750> 180<00:01:05.960> where<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.439> pivot<00:01:06.650> off<00:01:06.890> your

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
frontside 180 where you pivot off your

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.570 
frontside 180 where you pivot off your
nose<00:01:07.960> put<00:01:08.960> those<00:01:09.140> two<00:01:09.409> together<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.460> have

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
nose put those two together and you have

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.890 
nose put those two together and you have
the<00:01:10.700> shove<00:01:10.909> it<00:01:11.060> reverb<00:01:13.000> so<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.090> get<00:01:14.420> started<00:01:14.840> on

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
the shove it reverb so to get started on

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.570 
the shove it reverb so to get started on
this<00:01:15.110> trick<00:01:15.350> just<00:01:15.590> put<00:01:15.770> your<00:01:15.920> feet<00:01:16.130> in<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.369> pop

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
this trick just put your feet in the pop

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.330 
this trick just put your feet in the pop
shuvit<00:01:16.880> position<00:01:17.360> notice<00:01:17.900> my<00:01:18.110> back<00:01:18.530> foot<00:01:18.860> is<00:01:19.100> a

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
shuvit position notice my back foot is a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.370 
shuvit position notice my back foot is a
little<00:01:19.909> bit<00:01:20.060> off<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:20.570> side<00:01:20.780> of<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.140> tail

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
little bit off the side of the tail

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.380 
little bit off the side of the tail
that's<00:01:21.650> just<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.130> can<00:01:22.400> get<00:01:22.549> that<00:01:22.729> scoop<00:01:23.150> and

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's just so I can get that scoop and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.959 
that's just so I can get that scoop and
my<00:01:23.960> front<00:01:24.259> foot<00:01:24.320> is<00:01:24.590> slanted<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:25.249> always<00:01:25.789> do<00:01:25.939> my

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
front foot stay on it so it can just

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.899 
front foot stay on it so it can just
glide<00:01:35.149> right<00:01:35.179> over<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.979> yeah<00:01:37.130> just<00:01:37.159> do<00:01:37.609> a<00:01:37.640> few

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
we're going to keep it low for this

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.029 
we're going to keep it low for this
tutorial<00:01:52.179> so<00:01:53.179> just<00:01:53.210> do<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.780> on<00:01:53.960> shove<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.619> don't

so<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.470> got<00:01:58.619> your<00:01:58.680> shove<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.220> in<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
so now that you got your shove it's in a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.090 
so now that you got your shove it's in a
good<00:01:59.939> spot

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
good spot

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.640 
good spot
you<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.250> practice<00:02:02.759> landing<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> nose<00:02:03.659> you

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
you can practice landing on the nose you

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.679 
you can practice landing on the nose you
don't<00:02:04.830> have<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.310> necessarily<00:02:05.460> go<00:02:05.909> into<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.360> full

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
don't have to necessarily go into a full

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.290 
don't have to necessarily go into a full
nose<00:02:06.990> manual<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.680> I'm<00:02:07.890> doing<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.209> you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
nose manual like I'm doing here but you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.600 
nose manual like I'm doing here but you
have<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.720> able<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.020> at<00:02:10.140> least<00:02:10.170> land<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
have to be able to at least land on the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.940 
have to be able to at least land on the
nose<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.300> order<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.170> pivot<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.650> little

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
nose in order to do that pivot a little

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.130 
nose in order to do that pivot a little
bit<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.819> recommend<00:02:15.270> just<00:02:15.330> practicing<00:02:15.989> doing

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
bit so I recommend just practicing doing

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.010 
bit so I recommend just practicing doing
the<00:02:16.350> shove<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:16.830> landing<00:02:17.250> up<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.640> nose

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
the shove it and landing up on the nose

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.210 
the shove it and landing up on the nose
you'll<00:02:19.020> notice<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.440> some<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.860> shove<00:02:20.069> it

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
you'll notice in some of the shove it

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.309 
you'll notice in some of the shove it
reverts<00:02:20.489> shots<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.000> don't<00:02:21.209> even<00:02:21.330> lift<00:02:21.810> up<00:02:22.020> my

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
reverts shots I don't even lift up my

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.520 
reverts shots I don't even lift up my
back<00:02:22.590> trucks<00:02:22.920> fully<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:25.170> enough

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
back trucks fully but I just have enough

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.440 
back trucks fully but I just have enough
weight<00:02:25.830> on<00:02:26.100> my<00:02:26.250> front<00:02:26.489> foot<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:27.000> where<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> can

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
weight on my front foot to where I can

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.110 
weight on my front foot to where I can
just<00:02:27.660> do<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.840> pivot<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.700> after<00:02:29.970> you've<00:02:30.090> got

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
just do that pivot so after you've got

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640 
just do that pivot so after you've got
comfortable<00:02:30.840> with<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.110> you're<00:02:31.380> just<00:02:31.530> going

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
comfortable with that you're just going

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.229 
comfortable with that you're just going
to<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:31.860> comfortable<00:02:32.190> with<00:02:32.340> pivoting<00:02:32.940> off<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
to get comfortable with pivoting off the

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.420 
to get comfortable with pivoting off the
nose<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:35.010> sure<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.280> guys

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
nose just like this I'm sure you guys

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.800 
nose just like this I'm sure you guys
won't<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.819> too<00:02:36.030> much<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.420> hard<00:02:36.600> time<00:02:36.660> with

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
won't have too much of a hard time with

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.470 
won't have too much of a hard time with
this<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.380> super<00:02:37.709> simple<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.910> just<00:02:38.940> put<00:02:39.269> more

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
this it's super simple you just put more

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.630 
this it's super simple you just put more
of<00:02:39.569> your<00:02:39.720> weight<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:39.930> your<00:02:40.260> front<00:02:40.470> foot<00:02:40.680> lift

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
of your weight on your front foot lift

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.300 
of your weight on your front foot lift
up<00:02:41.819> your<00:02:41.940> back<00:02:42.150> leg<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.080> little<00:02:43.110> bit<00:02:43.530> while

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
up your back leg just a little bit while

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.160 
up your back leg just a little bit while
turning<00:02:44.730> your<00:02:44.880> shoulders<00:02:45.360> front<00:02:45.660> side<00:02:45.900> and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
turning your shoulders front side and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.820 
turning your shoulders front side and
then<00:02:46.590> just<00:02:46.799> turn<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.190> body<00:02:48.470> as<00:02:49.470> soon<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:49.739> you

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
then just turn your body as soon as you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.920 
then just turn your body as soon as you
turn<00:02:50.040> your<00:02:50.190> body<00:02:50.340> your<00:02:50.610> legs<00:02:50.819> will<00:02:51.060> follow

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.210 

so<00:02:54.930> that's<00:02:55.050> all<00:02:55.230> there<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.800> step<00:02:58.220> like

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
so that's all there is to that step like

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.770 
so that's all there is to that step like
I<00:02:59.340> said<00:02:59.580> earlier<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.120> really<00:03:00.180> good<00:03:00.570> if<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
I said earlier it's really good if you

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.690 
I said earlier it's really good if you
have<00:03:00.900> your<00:03:01.080> frontside<00:03:01.470> 180's<00:03:01.950> down<00:03:02.100> because

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
have your frontside 180's down because

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.190 
have your frontside 180's down because
the<00:03:02.850> motion<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.330> you're<00:03:03.570> doing<00:03:03.840> with<00:03:04.020> your

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the motion that you're doing with your

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.170 
the motion that you're doing with your
arms<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.950> front<00:03:05.190> side<00:03:05.370> one-eighty<00:03:05.640> motion

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
arms is the front side one-eighty motion

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.450 
arms is the front side one-eighty motion
and<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.930> good<00:03:07.110> if<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.350> get<00:03:07.530> used<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.890> popping

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
and it's good if you get used to popping

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.160 
and it's good if you get used to popping
and<00:03:08.700> then<00:03:08.880> lining<00:03:09.270> on<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.480> nose<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.900> doing

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
and then lining on the nose and doing

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.840 
and then lining on the nose and doing
that<00:03:10.320> pivot<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:10.950> we<00:03:11.130> went<00:03:11.700> over<00:03:11.970> prior<00:03:13.850> good

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
that pivot that we went over prior good

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.790 
that pivot that we went over prior good
so<00:03:15.060> putting<00:03:15.300> this<00:03:15.480> all<00:03:15.720> together<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.590> can<00:03:16.620> see

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
so putting this all together you can see

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.790 
so putting this all together you can see
I'll<00:03:17.370> just<00:03:17.460> do<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.850> nice<00:03:18.470> low<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.710> ground

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
I'll just do a nice low to the ground

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.880 
I'll just do a nice low to the ground
shove<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.660> catch<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.690> right<00:03:22.080> on<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.350> nose<00:03:22.560> and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
shove it catch it right on the nose and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.460 
shove it catch it right on the nose and
turn<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.550> front<00:03:23.760> side<00:03:24.000> one-eighty<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:25.200> trick

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
turn the front side one-eighty the trick

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.920 
turn the front side one-eighty the trick
to<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.740> is<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:26.790> keep<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.240> nice<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.510> low

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
to this is to just keep it nice and low

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.440 
to this is to just keep it nice and low
and<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.860> got<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.280> able<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.520> turn<00:03:30.180> your

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
and you got to be able to turn your

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.300 
and you got to be able to turn your
shoulders<00:03:30.960> while<00:03:31.410> you're<00:03:31.680> shoveling<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
shoulders while you're shoveling the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.560 
shoulders while you're shoveling the
board<00:03:34.220> don't<00:03:35.220> get<00:03:35.490> too<00:03:35.670> complicated<00:03:36.090> with

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
board don't get too complicated with

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.720 
board don't get too complicated with
like<00:03:36.780> all<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.320> different<00:03:37.470> steps<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.250> know<00:03:38.490> it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
like all the different steps I know it

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.520 
like all the different steps I know it
seems<00:03:39.000> like<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.210> lot<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.840> once<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.140> put<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.410> all

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
seems like a lot but once you put it all

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.610 
seems like a lot but once you put it all
together<00:03:40.740> it's<00:03:41.130> just<00:03:41.220> one<00:03:41.610> gradual<00:03:42.240> motion<00:03:42.750> so

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
together it's just one gradual motion so

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.540 
together it's just one gradual motion so
your<00:03:44.540> left<00:03:45.540> shoulder<00:03:46.350> is<00:03:46.620> going<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.980> be<00:03:47.100> coming

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
your left shoulder is going to be coming

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.940 
your left shoulder is going to be coming
out<00:03:47.840> forward<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.230> front<00:03:49.440> side<00:03:49.680> one-eighty

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
out forward in the front side one-eighty

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.030 
out forward in the front side one-eighty
motion<00:03:50.490> as<00:03:50.810> you're<00:03:51.810> shooting<00:03:52.440> your<00:03:52.740> board

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
motion as you're shooting your board

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.900 
motion as you're shooting your board
into<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.460> shove-it

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
into the shove-it

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.390 
into the shove-it
so<00:03:54.690> as<00:03:54.870> soon<00:03:55.140> as<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.590> land<00:03:55.770> with<00:03:56.040> your<00:03:56.160> front

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
can just follow it'll be a nice gradual

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.220 
can just follow it'll be a nice gradual
smooth<00:04:05.360> transition<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.660> can<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.050> get

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
smooth transition and you can just get

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.320 
smooth transition and you can just get
it<00:04:07.380> right<00:04:07.560> over<00:04:07.860> there<00:04:10.670> shove<00:04:11.670> it<00:04:11.700> revert<00:04:14.330> one

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
it right over there shove it revert one

front foot and then land it just up on

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.030 
front foot and then land it just up on
the<00:04:41.370> nose<00:04:41.610> or<00:04:41.940> near<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.780> nose<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.710> can<00:04:43.740> see

the nose or near to the nose you can see

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.280 
the nose or near to the nose you can see
on<00:04:44.160> a<00:04:44.190> lot<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.490> these<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.760> don't<00:04:45.150> even<00:04:45.300> like<00:04:45.720> lift

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
on a lot of these I don't even like lift

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.050 
on a lot of these I don't even like lift
my<00:04:46.500> back<00:04:46.740> trucks<00:04:47.070> completely<00:04:47.610> off<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.880> air

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
my back trucks completely off the air

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.590 
my back trucks completely off the air
but<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.419> just<00:04:48.630> drag<00:04:49.080> my<00:04:49.980> back<00:04:50.250> wheels<00:04:50.760> across

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
but I just drag my back wheels across

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.580 
but I just drag my back wheels across
the<00:04:51.840> ground

the ground

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.430 
the ground
and<00:04:52.680> pivot<00:04:53.100> that<00:04:53.250> position<00:04:54.170> so<00:04:55.170> you<00:04:55.230> don't

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
and pivot that position so you don't

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.470 
and pivot that position so you don't
have<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.860> land<00:04:56.100> fully<00:04:56.520> on<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.880> nose<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:57.360> go

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
have to land fully on the nose and go

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.960 
have to land fully on the nose and go
into<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.780> full<00:04:58.170> nose<00:04:58.500> manual<00:04:58.980> but<00:04:59.700> you<00:04:59.790> can

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
into a full nose manual but you can

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.910 
into a full nose manual but you can
simply<00:05:00.180> just<00:05:00.660> have<00:05:00.900> enough<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.500> your<00:05:01.650> weight

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920

up<00:05:02.220> near<00:05:03.120> the<00:05:03.330> nose<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:04.470> can<00:05:04.500> even<00:05:04.800> have<00:05:05.040> your

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
up near the nose you can even have your

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.400 
up near the nose you can even have your
front<00:05:05.460> foot<00:05:05.670> on<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.210> front<00:05:06.480> truck<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:07.110> still

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
to have to put some a little more force

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.340 
to have to put some a little more force
into<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.150> because<00:05:12.390> your<00:05:12.660> wheels<00:05:12.900> are<00:05:13.170> going<00:05:13.290> to

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
into it because your wheels are going to

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.760 
into it because your wheels are going to
be<00:05:13.470> dragging<00:05:13.770> on<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.100> ground<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:16.470> more<00:05:16.500> you

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
be dragging on the ground the more you

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.500 
be dragging on the ground the more you
practice<00:05:17.160> this<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.400> smoother<00:05:18.030> you'll<00:05:18.210> get

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
practice this the smoother you'll get

practice this the smoother you'll get
and<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.990> more<00:05:19.260> easy<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:20.040> transition<00:05:20.250> between

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
and the more easy the transition between

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.030

weight<00:05:33.720> from<00:05:33.930> your<00:05:33.990> left<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.470> right<00:05:34.740> foot<00:05:35.010> or

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
weight from your left to right foot or

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.270 
weight from your left to right foot or
either<00:05:35.550> way<00:05:35.910> is<00:05:36.180> is<00:05:36.930> good<00:05:37.350> practice<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:38.190> it

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
either way is is good practice and it

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.220 
either way is is good practice and it
just<00:05:38.460> helps<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:38.940> to<00:05:39.000> build<00:05:39.330> board<00:05:39.630> control<00:05:40.080> in

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
just helps you to build board control in

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.920 
just helps you to build board control in
general<00:05:40.740> and<00:05:40.950> things<00:05:41.730> like<00:05:41.880> this<00:05:42.120> just<00:05:42.480> being

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
general and things like this just being

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.510 
general and things like this just being
able<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.230> shove<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.710> board<00:05:43.950> and<00:05:44.160> land<00:05:44.370> it

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
able to shove it the board and land it

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.330 
able to shove it the board and land it
in<00:05:44.640> a<00:05:44.730> certain<00:05:45.030> position<00:05:45.360> is<00:05:45.690> good<00:05:46.560> because<00:05:46.830> it

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
in a certain position is good because it

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.780 
in a certain position is good because it
helps<00:05:47.520> you<00:05:47.820> just<00:05:48.630> build<00:05:49.020> up<00:05:49.290> that<00:05:49.610> control<00:05:50.610> of

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
helps you just build up that control of

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.190 
helps you just build up that control of
your<00:05:50.880> board<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.330> know<00:05:51.390> I<00:05:51.510> throw<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:51.930> term

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
your board I know I throw that term

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.200 
your board I know I throw that term
around<00:05:52.260> a<00:05:52.650> lot<00:05:52.830> but<00:05:53.100> it<00:05:53.190> is<00:05:53.340> super<00:05:53.550> important

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
around a lot but it is super important

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.910 
around a lot but it is super important
because<00:05:54.900> when<00:05:55.170> you<00:05:55.260> go<00:05:55.440> on<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.770> do<00:05:55.890> other

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
because when you go on to do other

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.250 
because when you go on to do other
tricks<00:05:56.490> when<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:57.180> go<00:05:57.360> on<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:57.570> learn<00:05:57.690> different

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
tricks when you go on to learn different

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.870 
tricks when you go on to learn different
combinations<00:05:58.920> of<00:05:59.070> tricks<00:05:59.370> and<00:05:59.550> things<00:05:59.700> like

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
combinations of tricks and things like

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.210 
combinations of tricks and things like
this<00:06:00.090> I<00:06:00.330> always<00:06:01.170> think<00:06:01.470> of<00:06:01.560> the<00:06:01.740> tricks<00:06:02.040> in

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
this I always think of the tricks in

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.760 
this I always think of the tricks in
terms<00:06:02.430> of<00:06:02.640> like<00:06:02.820> what<00:06:03.360> trick<00:06:03.960> is<00:06:04.170> this<00:06:04.410> trick

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
terms of like what trick is this trick

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.100 
terms of like what trick is this trick
like<00:06:05.900> like<00:06:06.900> if<00:06:07.110> I'm<00:06:07.260> going<00:06:07.440> to<00:06:07.500> do<00:06:07.740> this<00:06:09.110> 360

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
like like if I'm going to do this 360

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.920 
like like if I'm going to do this 360
flip<00:06:10.380> Reaver<00:06:10.830> it's<00:06:11.430> just<00:06:11.880> like<00:06:12.180> a<00:06:12.210> pop<00:06:12.600> shuvit

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
flip Reaver it's just like a pop shuvit

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.260 
flip Reaver it's just like a pop shuvit
or<00:06:13.230> a<00:06:13.260> shove<00:06:13.650> it<00:06:13.800> reverts<00:06:14.190> except<00:06:14.790> for<00:06:14.970> instead

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
or a shove it reverts except for instead

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.050 
or a shove it reverts except for instead
of<00:06:15.390> the<00:06:15.510> shove<00:06:15.750> it<00:06:15.900> you're<00:06:16.050> doing<00:06:16.170> a<00:06:16.380> 360<00:06:16.950> flip

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
of the shove it you're doing a 360 flip

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.270 
of the shove it you're doing a 360 flip
which<00:06:18.060> might<00:06:18.390> seem<00:06:18.900> crazy<00:06:19.350> hard<00:06:19.800> but<00:06:20.160> it's

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
which might seem crazy hard but it's

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.780 
which might seem crazy hard but it's
actually<00:06:20.670> very<00:06:20.910> simple

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
actually very simple

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.480 
actually very simple
so<00:06:23.780> if<00:06:23.960> you<00:06:24.080> get<00:06:24.290> this<00:06:24.440> trick<00:06:24.740> down<00:06:24.950> well<00:06:25.250> and

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
so if you get this trick down well and

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.970 
so if you get this trick down well and
then<00:06:25.880> you<00:06:26.030> learn<00:06:26.240> your<00:06:26.420> 360<00:06:26.840> flips<00:06:27.320> you<00:06:27.800> will

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
then you learn your 360 flips you will

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.230 
then you learn your 360 flips you will
be<00:06:28.160> able<00:06:28.280> to<00:06:28.400> do<00:06:28.750> 360<00:06:29.750> flip<00:06:29.990> reverts<00:06:30.880> I'm<00:06:31.880> sure

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
be able to do 360 flip reverts I'm sure

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.640 
be able to do 360 flip reverts I'm sure
of<00:06:32.420> it<00:06:32.570> you<00:06:33.200> just<00:06:33.410> have<00:06:33.530> to<00:06:33.650> practice<00:06:33.860> it<00:06:34.250> out

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
of it you just have to practice it out

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.050 
of it you just have to practice it out
so<00:06:36.650> yeah<00:06:36.740> that's<00:06:37.010> basically<00:06:37.190> all<00:06:37.520> there<00:06:37.640> is<00:06:37.910> to

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
so yeah that's basically all there is to

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.420 
so yeah that's basically all there is to
this<00:06:38.210> trick<00:06:38.540> just<00:06:38.810> practice<00:06:39.590> it<00:06:39.740> a<00:06:39.830> lot<00:06:39.860> make

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
this trick just practice it a lot make

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.700 
this trick just practice it a lot make

like<00:07:21.200> I<00:07:21.410> mentioned<00:07:21.800> the<00:07:21.920> 360<00:07:22.460> flip<00:07:22.490> reverb<00:07:23.230> so

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
like I mentioned the 360 flip reverb so

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.770 
like I mentioned the 360 flip reverb so
