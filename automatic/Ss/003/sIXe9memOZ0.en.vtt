00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.789
 hello to all these plates are for 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.640
 today we will do the express test 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.070
 duo norsys so we'll start all of 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.580
 suite with design side design we sleep 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.259
 6 does not really change the design 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.800
 current ie that we will have 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.879
 a square smartphone on board finally have 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.430
 even rather rectangle but one does not 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.690
 does not really stand out from others 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.940
 so little tour of the owner so 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.070
 we have a full hd 5 inch screen 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.530
 with buttons so sensitive except here 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.370
 we have a gray plastic band 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.909
 so faux metal but really 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.479
 plastic 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:04.839
 here we have the possibility via one here 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:07.210
 to put a micro sim or a micro sd 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.860
 the doubs is plexiglass so 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.049
 unfortunately it will take a lot 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.540
 fingerprints we also have a 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.110
 13 megapixel camera with double 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.750
 flash led 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.299
 Brand north somewhere very 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.000
 classical rather tensile besides the 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.220
 mark to the north that we can see and this 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.189
 will be pretty much everything we have too 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.340
 on top the port jack 3.5 the port 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.179
 infrared with the second microphone for a 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.170
 ambient noise 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.820
 in all we will have the absence of the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.890
 gore promises then stops at the bottom 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.689
 strange left and right and we 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.759
 will have the usb port as well as the first 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.329
 micro no to be able to talk and that the 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.840
 so people hear us in version 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.990
 white 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.310
 he will tend to be more how 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.899
 say knowing how to handle a little bit the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.039
 white version but then it will have 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.569
 tend to be a little more cheap in 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.759
 black version is more classy but 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.469
 the more the more banal one will happen a 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.789
 little more everywhere we'll see 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.270
 obviously that fingerprints are 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.050
 very quickly 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.580
 visible when we can see it here a 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.140
 day obliged to clean very often 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.770
 for it to be here to be the most 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.690
 clean possible 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.470
 something that I'm trying to improve 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.470
 besides in my tests 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.379
 side overlouche we will end up with 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.780
 4.2 and the overlay is ugly night 3.0 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.220
 the big difference from 2.3 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.080
 and well it will be the design most of 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.700
 things will be exactly the same just 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.330
 with a redesign of the design for all 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.480
 applications 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.750
 we will end up with an overlay 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.400
 without application drawers but rather 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.750
 complete with a lot of small options 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.160
 the whole is rather design that we 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.349
 could see it since we are 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.819
 with something really very 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.140
 clean and very pretty to look at 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.110
 things was really very very fast 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.730
 set up this is the side a date 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.590
 that is to say that in the end we end up 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.359
 with a little timeline like you 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.220
 can see it here on the left with the 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.690
 hours that scroll by what there is 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.010
 usually it's pretty right here 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.870
 it's left with a scroll 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.420
 chronological something very 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.010
 different from the competitors we find 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.079
 also for the gallery and others 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.609
 small applications 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.629
 there are still some small bugs etc at 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.629
 overconsumption 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:21.410
 I'll talk about it again on the side 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.450
 of autonomy but strongly 5.0 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.140
 lollipop that should arrive from here 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.140
 a few weeks 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.030
 performance side 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.000
 mobile and that will be rather upscale 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.850
 the 920 cry being very powerful since 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.170
 is endowed with a four oct accord not four 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.709
 cortex hearts a15 and four hearts 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.280
 cortex a7 a mali t604 8mp kate and 3 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.560
 giga of ram 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.640
 we can see here that he does a little score 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.730
 of 45 1561 the score of the institute on this 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.990
 pedestal are a little bit high we're on 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.350
 good product but still in 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.580
 under a snapdragon 800 we will arrive 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.580
 to run just about every game 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.800
 no problem justin in sfax 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.330
 xcom or a world of tanks for example 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.650
 on the other hand, there will be a 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.660
 big worry so we have a battery 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.000
 first two 100 million father but 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.739
 unfortunately due to worries and 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.590
 software or driver I do not know 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.829
 still there is a decline in autonomy 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.000
 consistent with ie8 2.3 then 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.600
 on the six does not touch every 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.840
 users 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.340
 but some only and more 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.650
 especially months having a 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.330
 intensive use a small 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.060
 quick explanation 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.450
 we will go to gallery shown a 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.280
 little screenshot and then there 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.660
 exists on this overlayer a 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.080
 opportunity to see alerts from 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.760
 overconsumption and during the test of 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.560
 of the part I overcome is the angelus 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.660
 in consumption you should know that 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.030
 normal consumption is more of the style 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.580
 5 7 or 10 million grandfather maximum 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.530
 we often have this type of problem 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.580
 on various applications what is 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.140
 rather problematic 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.870
 so that auld reaches 7 to 8 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.479
 hours screen lit on a single charge 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.240
 we will be more that 4-5 hours or six 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.580
 great maximum hours and I could have a 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.200
 pic is really very very low of 2h30 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.150
 on a single charge 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.590
 I hope something to settle 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.180
 that a fix or update 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.380
 lollipop will arrive quickly to settle 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.130
 this problem that could affect 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.130
 some users 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.410
 multimedia side we can 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.080
 and a screen of very good quality and 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.160
 it drives me full hd are very nice 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.650
 to watch for videos 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.050
 we will also have the opportunity to 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.840
 take pictures of 13 megapixels that 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.300
 will make pictures of 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.870
 rather good quality we will meet again 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.240
 with absolutely correct accuracy 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.940
 even if we are far from a very 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.400
 high-end galaxy style notes that 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.630
 all galaxy and five side we will have 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.000
 right to a music player rather 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.450
 nice to look much better than 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.080
 his ancestor of 2.3 and we will have the right 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.900
 also to use the background of who 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.300
 so will improve the sound and 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.950
 especially so at the bass and 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.250
 to have something deeper more 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.110
 rich 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.510
 despite inspecting who misses a little 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.670
 little clarity side I will not have any 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.260
 real problem we can do I turn 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.120
 and all the little games and even the big ones 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.340
 games since xcom and warda time of 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.750
 pass we will have against the unpleasant 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.340
 surprise to see that on the breastplate 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.540
 modern combat bag is not compatible 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.620
 on the other hand brothers in arms is 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.620
 compatible and falls very well 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.400
 how to conclude this express test and 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.139
 it's simple it's a mobile that for 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.780
 300 euros fulfilled all the conditions 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.860
 of a lambda user it's like 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.250
 than a simple layer of very good 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.039
 quality 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.800
 a rather compact device the micro port 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.960
 SD which is a plus one on the 4g 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.060
 even the 4g plus what is in 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.590
 so it's a very good mobile 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.050
 will regret all the same worries 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.599
 software related to autonomy that 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.340
 I hope will not settle very quickly 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:59.960
 it will be possible also to 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.750
 find better mobiles but in 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.389
 import so to what1 are willing to do 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.099
 of the import and well do not hesitate 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:08.300
 those who are not ready to do 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:10.430
 the import and well it will be a very 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.560
 very good kobe who will live up to a 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.599
 galaxy's ate Katte the focus 5 a little bit between 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.210
 both so I can only advise 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:18.800
 mobilize my tommy worries who 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.330
 are a little bit particular and who 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.039
 might be layers and thus 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.020
 attention on it but normally 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:25.569
 this is this software will be set on 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.500
 the next updates 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:30.400
 see you soon for next 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.400
 will park games fr
