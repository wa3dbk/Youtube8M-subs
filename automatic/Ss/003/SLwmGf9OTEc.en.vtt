00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.440
 Yes you can when building no wet 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.870
 processes therefore low temperature is not 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.730
 interference with the foundation can also be 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.650
 produce in the cold season 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.180
 since easy home vulture panels can 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.180
 even put on screw piles 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 osb-3 plates as russian 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.630
 manufacturer kalevala and imported 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.489
 the games of slims match the european 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 standard i n300 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.870
 this suggests that formaldehyde 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.610
 contains the limits of valid values 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.590
 products safe and can 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 used in indoor spaces 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.600
 around formaldehyde created a lot 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.879
 frightening myths because this stuff 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.850
 formaldehyde surrounds us everywhere 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.280
 found in paints plastics in horses and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.949
 even in cosmetics and all this we 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.690
 use without thinking often scaring 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.070
 gives an example of a chipboard Russian 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.739
 manufacturers percentage of content 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.589
 formaldehyde in which about 10 14 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.290
 milligram however in slabs at sb which 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.119
 we use in intercity no more than 8 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.240
 milligrams it is absolutely safe for 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240
 health 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.700
 supporters of other technologies 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.399
 construction often scare the builder 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.649
 fire danger of vulture panels like any 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.560
 wooden construction of the vulture without finishing 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.539
 has a third degree of fire resistance but 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.399
 material supporting burning in 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.670
 Canadian house is much less than 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.799
 plain wooden besides 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.210
 modern vulture used 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.159
 self-extinguishing polystyrene foam which 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.220
 ignites at most almost two 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.350
 times the temperature than wood you know 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.240
 that any houses burn if it burns 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.369
 brick foundation and wall structure 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.500
 will almost certainly remain but will 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.799
 subject to demolition due to loss of strength on 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.170
 60 70 percent so when we say 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.119
 about fire safety of a private house 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.549
 better to discuss enough time for 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.500
 evacuation of people to the destruction of power 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.420
 designs in the house of vulture panels in 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.789
 lags are destroyed first 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.100
 the floors they wall so they need 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.890
 sure to handle boost 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.049
 fire resistance of plates osb-3 can not be painted 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.330
 flame retardants but better 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.940
 additional plasterboard or 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.970
 gypsum chip board without the use of 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.130
 guide profiles that is so that 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.650
 there was no air between the surfaces 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.560
 this wall can withstand 45 minutes 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.180
 exposure to open fire 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.310
 of course a set of fire prevention measures 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.190
 it is necessary both in wooden and in any 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.750
 friend the structure of the good today exists 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.650
 fire alarm system 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.570
 fire extinguishing 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.570
 set them up and sleep well 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.530
 expanded polystyrene inedible for rodents 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.560
 that is, the nutritional value for them is not 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.420
 rodents present as humans are drawn to 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.180
 heat therefore can climb under 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.980
 panels to warm up 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.200
 or make no moves therefore 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.750
 polystyrene as any insulation on 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.120
 it is necessary to protect the b axis of the slab in sip 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.040
 the panels tightly close the foam if 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.780
 I want to take the additional measures it 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.120
 You can certainly lay under the outside 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.829
 wall decoration metal mesh but 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.290
 there is not much point in this 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.079
 case of low-rise building many others 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.790
 items and food interesting mice therefore 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.500
 protect the house from rodents anyway 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.030
 have to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.389
 effective preventive measures are known 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.389
 to all
