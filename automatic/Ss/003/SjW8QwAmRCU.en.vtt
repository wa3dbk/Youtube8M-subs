00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.630
 the girls comment today 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.940
 I hope very well, because today I bring you 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.170
 a tutorial about how it is that I 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:21.099
 I do to be able to desinflamar good this 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.700
 Eye area of the known dark circles 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.320
 or also how to reduce our 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.919
 face when we get up because to 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.710
 sometimes done for various reasons the 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.540
 stress that we have slept badly or why not 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.880
 we can sleep at the time 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.010
 we used to when we got up 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.309
 we get up then and see you at 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.379
 mirage or days that happens here but this 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.079
 but nothing is not it is not that we 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.679
 we are in this evil but there is 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.800
 suddenly an imbalance is there some some 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.960
 kind of mess in our food in 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.539
 our feeding in our rest 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.149
 etcetera different factors that can 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.819
 influence so that when we wake up not 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:07.120
 Let's be kings and perfect girls 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:09.520
 that we are always but we can 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.620
 combat that in different ways and there are 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.580
 two very easy ways that I'm going to 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.160
 explain 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.620
 what is one of those using things 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.330
 light teaspoons the slices of 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.970
 cucumber and also a natural toning 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.100
 made with chamomile for later 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.860
 use these also technical gestures this 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.750
 that was resting and that suddenly 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.730
 We can not use it but we are going to make a 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.770
 natural tonic made from 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.960
 chamomile and that will serve us for 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.270
 refresh our face to give this 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.520
 tonicity something that I recommend 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.100
 is also that when getting up in treat 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.200
 to bathe in very cold water, good 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.030
 I used to do this but now good 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.890
 with the cold and all that because I do not 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.320
 he chickened a little but he's always 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.040
 good once in a while take a bath 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.270
 cool cold cold cold water or in any case 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.979
 if the one that takes it hot then go 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.080
 going down a few 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.020
 the intensity of the heat until reaching the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.180
 colder so that our skin will 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.560
 tonifique and restore circulation 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.390
 blood that is what water does 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.830
 freeze that makes us activate and we 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.270
 let's put tough 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.490
 because that's what helps the skin 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.060
 become more successful both in the face 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:25.269
 as in the trail 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:27.519
 this video that I explain a little myself 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.980
 I like this cream at night is a 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:35.500
 cream for the eye area and it 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.500
 call that is so suicidal this good me 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.859
 I bought it in Peru that is sublime 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.000
 expression of what I bought in mont something like that 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.000
 that suddenly they can get it 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.170
 if it really lasts for a long time because I do not 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.070
 is to throw more song only about three 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.280
 droplets to the contour and then massage 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.540
 outside inward and that I do all 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.490
 the nights so that it helps to erase 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.430
 Marquita that we already have the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.840
 late-night makeup and so on 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.420
 and I was putting a little 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.760
 moradito by teams that helps 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.400
 prevent and help make dark circles 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.110
 environment go down in tepito then girls 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.180
 Well I hope you like it today 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.040
 well fine natural because it's nothing of 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.340
 makeup first something about the care 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.130
 of our skin and how to recover 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.530
 the attention these killers that we have 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.050
 in the psychic face left forgetfulness I hope 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.320
 like it and instead of then you 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.510
 you wake up and you're not the same as always 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.740
 because you feel that your face is 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.050
 swollen and out of focus if your circles more 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.710
 pronounced 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.780
 that we can make a flight to fight 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.380
 this malaise of the morning we need 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.580
 the next two teaspoons two 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.680

 a cup of boiled water and two 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.620
 other sachets of chamomile 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.010
 the first thing is that we are going to put the two 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.569
 teaspoons in our frozen while 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:16.919
 that we split the two slices of cucumber 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:19.989
 remember 15 minutes in the freezer 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.449
 we are also going to put in a cup the 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.850

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.070

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.410
 place the two slices of cucumber in 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.690
 our eyes and try to rest a 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.900
 little I lay in bed for 15 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.570
 minutes 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.070
 once we have finished 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.280
 We will collect the two teaspoons that 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.590
 They must have been frozen 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.050
 we will remove the cucumber slices and 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.270

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.810
 face washing us deeply and 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.630
 applying those with little touches remember 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.520
 which is a tonic and the tonics are 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.880

 relaxing movements and also with 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.159
 movements in a circle remember all the 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:53.390
 area of ​​the eyes and of our jaw 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:56.360

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.940
 and that's it, we're done with this 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.490
 cleaning process and desinflamación del 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.190
 good face girls as they saw nothing 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.080

 super super comfortable in your house so 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.030
 I think we can all do it if 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.130
 they do twice a week very much 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.070
 better to be able to have a 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.200
 intensity but at least make it from 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.480
 chamomile tonic because obviously 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.880
 it is a cup and you will not leave it 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.850
 all in one application but you can 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.520
 have in your voice between springs with gel 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.680

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.400

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.230

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.860
 say without any makeup have it 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.200
 Make up completely and be like this 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.930

 I'm not eating a lot 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.120

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.740
 water a day that could take 8 but 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.000

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.210
 replaced with fruit is liquid as per 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:41.250
