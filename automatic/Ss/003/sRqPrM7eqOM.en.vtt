it for you and I'm also wearing it on my
lips<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.250> top<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.880> talks<00:02:00.210> watched

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
lips but here is top that talks watched

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.760 
lips but here is top that talks watched
and<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> retro<00:02:02.820> matte<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> tad

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770

bit drying but I think the color payoff
is<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.920> worth<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.569> again<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.379> wearing<00:02:10.679> it

second glance it looks to be like an
orange<00:02:34.710> color<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.460> this<00:02:35.760> color<00:02:36.450> is

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
orange color but this color is

that<00:03:08.400> was<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:08.610> surprise<00:03:08.820> for<00:03:09.090> me<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.720> bunch

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
that was a surprise for me in the bunch

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.630 
that was a surprise for me in the bunch
because<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.260> wasn't<00:03:10.620> looking<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.010> like<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.430> and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
because I wasn't looking to like it and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.050 
because I wasn't looking to like it and
then<00:03:12.180> last<00:03:12.450> step<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.990> nude<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
then last step is nude and that's the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.970 
then last step is nude and that's the
name<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.930> new<00:03:16.200> lipstick<00:03:16.770> and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
name of it and it is a new lipstick and

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.750 
name of it and it is a new lipstick and
this<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.280> what<00:03:17.489> nude<00:03:17.730> looks<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:20.430> will

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
this is what nude looks like and I will

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.000 
this is what nude looks like and I will
swatch<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.390> for<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:22.920> a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
swatch it for you and it is just a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.590 
swatch it for you and it is just a
really<00:03:23.370> really<00:03:23.820> pretty<00:03:25.760> nude<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:27.269> right

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
really really pretty nude it's right

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.290 
really really pretty nude it's right
there<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.200> do<00:03:28.560> think<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.550> will<00:03:29.850> flatter

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
there I do think that this will flatter

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
there I do think that this will flatter
more<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.769> tan<00:03:32.190> deeper<00:03:32.910> skin<00:03:33.209> tones<00:03:33.540> so

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
more of the tan deeper skin tones so

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.070 
more of the tan deeper skin tones so
much<00:03:34.590> then<00:03:34.950> on<00:03:35.220> my<00:03:35.489> lighter<00:03:35.820> skin<00:03:36.269> sisters<00:03:36.840> I

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
much then on my lighter skin sisters I

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.199 
much then on my lighter skin sisters I
just<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.680> think<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.310> may<00:03:38.489> be<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.700> little<00:03:38.880> too

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
just I think it may be a little too

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.080 
just I think it may be a little too
muddy<00:03:39.600> I'm<00:03:40.280> considering<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.459> know<00:03:41.489> how<00:03:41.760> pale

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
muddy I'm considering you know how pale

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.540 
muddy I'm considering you know how pale
or<00:03:42.390> light<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.840> are<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.260> think<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.769> one<00:03:44.040> may

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
or light you are so I think this one may

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.370 
or light you are so I think this one may
be<00:03:44.610> geared<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.300> little<00:03:45.600> bit<00:03:45.750> towards<00:03:46.320> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
be geared a little bit towards the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.410 
be geared a little bit towards the
deeper<00:03:46.920> spectrum<00:03:47.459> but<00:03:47.850> that's<00:03:48.030> just<00:03:48.209> my

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
deeper spectrum but that's just my

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.759 
deeper spectrum but that's just my
opinion<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.959> course<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.350> can<00:03:49.500> go<00:03:49.620> out<00:03:49.709> and

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
opinion of course you can go out and

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.280 
opinion of course you can go out and
swatch<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.459> try<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.670> for<00:03:50.880> yourself<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:51.510> also

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
swatch it and try it for yourself I also

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
swatch it and try it for yourself I also
get<00:03:52.769> um<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.670> valix<00:03:54.209> brow<00:03:55.140> liner<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:55.860> this<00:03:56.070> is

but you're basically just getting the
cute<00:04:01.019> packaging<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.800> wanted<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.340> anyway<00:04:02.610> I

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
figured why not get it with the

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.530 
figured why not get it with the
packaging<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.550> comes<00:04:05.700> with<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> spoolie<00:04:06.300> on

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.920 
one in and then the pencil on the other
and<00:04:09.750> this<00:04:10.049> one<00:04:10.290> is<00:04:10.709> in<00:04:10.950> deep<00:04:11.280> dark<00:04:11.580> brunette<00:04:11.930> so

and this one is in deep dark brunette so
I<00:04:12.959> also<00:04:13.380> watch<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:14.100> really<00:04:14.790> really<00:04:14.970> pretty

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560
