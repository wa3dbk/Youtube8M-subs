00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
some tips or tricks to use software with

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.270 
some tips or tricks to use software with
their<00:01:29.759> eardrums<00:01:30.289> but<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.649> only<00:01:31.799> thing<00:01:32.039> I<00:01:32.130> can

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
their eardrums but the only thing I can

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.309 
their eardrums but the only thing I can
say<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.639> that<00:01:32.789> the<00:01:32.880> RET<00:01:33.359> drums<00:01:33.719> they<00:01:34.139> work

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
say is that the RET drums they work

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.959 
say is that the RET drums they work
great<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.710> modules<00:01:35.219> but<00:01:35.759> they<00:01:35.909> were

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
great with modules but they were

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.599 
great with modules but they were
designed<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.450> work<00:01:36.600> with<00:01:36.780> software<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:38.340> just

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
designed to work with software it just

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.190 
designed to work with software it just
makes<00:01:38.789> sense<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> use<00:01:39.479> something<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.840> has<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
makes sense to use something that has a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.770 
makes sense to use something that has a
real<00:01:40.530> look<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.249> a<00:01:41.819> real<00:01:42.030> feel<00:01:42.389> if<00:01:42.659> you're

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.129 
real look and a real feel if you're
gonna<00:01:42.899> use<00:01:43.049> real<00:01:43.319> sounds<00:01:44.509> what<00:01:45.509> makes<00:01:45.719> virtual

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.139 
gonna use real sounds what makes virtual

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.379

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
right how loud are these drums without

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.070 
right how loud are these drums without
them<00:02:40.870> plugged<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:42.030> no<00:02:43.030> software<00:02:43.540> whatsoever

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
so here's a Tom and plan pretty hard

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:04.770 
so here's a Tom and plan pretty hard
I've<00:02:54.310> got<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.360> rim<00:03:02.069> in<00:03:03.069> tell<00:03:03.400> how<00:03:04.150> quiet<00:03:04.540> that

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
I've got the rim in tell how quiet that

sound like I don't know like a roto Tom

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.030 
sound like I don't know like a roto Tom
or<00:03:10.450> something<00:03:10.690> like<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.620> they<00:03:11.829> don't

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
or something like that but they don't

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.430 
or something like that but they don't
they're<00:03:12.310> they're<00:03:12.640> muffled<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.540> they're

quieted 60 decibels from an actual drum

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.600 
quieted 60 decibels from an actual drum
which<00:03:18.220> is<00:03:18.250> huge<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:19.510> renders<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.049> like<00:03:20.349> a

tons<00:03:56.860> of<00:03:56.980> questions<00:03:57.069> here<00:03:57.520> on<00:03:58.650> what<00:03:59.650> is<00:03:59.740> it

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
tons of questions here on what is it

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.449 
tons of questions here on what is it
used<00:04:00.040> for<00:04:00.130> what<00:04:01.000> do<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.120> use<00:04:01.360> it<00:04:01.720> for<00:04:02.459> zero

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
used for what do you use it for zero

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.180 
used for what do you use it for zero
latency<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:05.580> will<00:04:06.580> repeat<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.000> zero<00:04:07.510> latency

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
latency I will repeat that zero latency

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.660 
latency I will repeat that zero latency
that's<00:04:09.190> unheard<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.270> in<00:04:10.450> in<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.870> Ihram<00:04:11.319> world

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
that's unheard of in in the Ihram world

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.940 
that's unheard of in in the Ihram world
so<00:04:12.670> if<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.420> can<00:04:13.690> get<00:04:13.810> zero<00:04:14.170> latency<00:04:14.350> with<00:04:14.800> the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
so if I can get zero latency with the

so if I can get zero latency with the
personas<00:04:15.459> firebox<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:16.120> will<00:04:16.660> be<00:04:16.780> using<00:04:16.959> a

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
can go into a house system if I'm using

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.760 
can go into a house system if I'm using
it<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.360> know<00:04:52.450> at<00:04:52.660> a<00:04:52.690> church<00:04:53.050> if<00:04:53.320> I'm<00:04:53.440> using<00:04:53.560> it

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
it you know at a church if I'm using it

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.250 
it you know at a church if I'm using it
at<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.340> bigger<00:04:54.610> event<00:04:55.000> I<00:04:55.480> can<00:04:55.660> just<00:04:55.810> go<00:04:55.990> right

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
at a bigger event I can just go right

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.860 
at a bigger event I can just go right
into<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:56.500> main<00:04:56.710> system<00:04:57.480> hooked<00:04:58.480> up<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.750> way

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
into a main system hooked up that way

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.270 
into a main system hooked up that way
and<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:58.990> have<00:04:59.020> got<00:04:59.230> I've<00:04:59.590> got<00:04:59.740> all<00:04:59.830> my<00:04:59.860> control

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
and I have got I've got all my control

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.330 
and I have got I've got all my control
right<00:05:00.430> there<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:01.780> is<00:05:02.290> pretty<00:05:02.620> awesome<00:05:02.830> in

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
right there so that is pretty awesome in

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.190 
right there so that is pretty awesome in
itself<00:05:03.820> but<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.870> zero<00:05:05.169> latency<00:05:05.919> is<00:05:06.760> big<00:05:07.390> it's

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
itself but the zero latency is big it's

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.860 
itself but the zero latency is big it's
huge<00:05:08.590> thank<00:05:09.130> you

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.420 

we've<00:05:15.870> got<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.199> external<00:05:16.620> hard<00:05:16.830> drive<00:05:17.040> which

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
we've got the external hard drive which

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.770 
we've got the external hard drive which
actually<00:05:17.760> is<00:05:17.880> housing<00:05:18.300> bfd2<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:21.060> is<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.180> 250

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
actually is housing bfd2 this is a 250

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.270 
actually is housing bfd2 this is a 250
gigabyte<00:05:22.280> hard<00:05:23.280> drive<00:05:24.080> so<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.260> 55<00:05:25.680> gigs<00:05:26.040> of

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
gigabyte hard drive so the 55 gigs of

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.159 
gigabyte hard drive so the 55 gigs of
stuff<00:05:27.150> from<00:05:27.449> bfd2

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
stuff from bfd2

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.760 
stuff from bfd2
fits<00:05:28.889> nicely<00:05:29.130> on<00:05:29.280> there<00:05:30.080> really<00:05:31.080> sweet<00:05:31.320> so<00:05:31.530> I'm

fits nicely on there really sweet so I'm
just<00:05:32.130> triggering<00:05:32.460> it<00:05:32.639> basically<00:05:32.940> off<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:34.470> this

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
just triggering it basically off of this

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.159 
just triggering it basically off of this
hard<00:05:35.550> drive<00:05:35.690> which<00:05:36.690> comes<00:05:36.900> pre-loaded

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
hard drive which comes pre-loaded

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.010 
hard drive which comes pre-loaded
actually<00:05:37.889> from<00:05:38.160> ret<00:05:38.729> percussion<00:05:39.180> they'll

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
actually from ret percussion they'll

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.159 
actually from ret percussion they'll
load<00:05:40.199> whatever<00:05:40.500> software<00:05:40.800> you<00:05:41.639> want<00:05:41.880> with<00:05:42.570> the
