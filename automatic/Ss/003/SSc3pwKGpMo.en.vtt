00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
down on the a string this is the tip of

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.660 
down on the a string this is the tip of
the<00:02:35.970> fat<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.780> finger<00:02:38.269> second<00:02:39.269> finger

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
the fat of the finger second finger

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.039 
the fat of the finger second finger
third<00:02:41.670> finger<00:02:43.099> fourth<00:02:44.099> finger<00:02:44.840> now<00:02:45.840> an

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
third finger fourth finger now an

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.699 
third finger fourth finger now an
example<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.830> doing<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.340> wrong<00:02:48.319> would<00:02:49.319> be<00:02:49.500> like

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
example of doing it wrong would be like

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.030 
example of doing it wrong would be like
this<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.140> be<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.560> tip<00:02:52.829> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
this so you want it to be on the tip of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.250 
this so you want it to be on the tip of
the<00:02:53.160> fat<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.579> finger<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.000> if<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.930> think

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
the fat of the finger and if you think

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.979 
the fat of the finger and if you think
about<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:56.299> everything<00:02:57.299> else<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
about that everything else is in the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.390 
about that everything else is in the
right<00:02:58.170> position<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.160> little

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
right position you have a little

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.039 
right position you have a little
platform<00:02:59.760> here<00:03:02.090> here's<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.329> platform<00:03:03.870> for

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
platform here here's the platform for

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.039 
platform here here's the platform for
the<00:03:04.110> second<00:03:04.530> finger<00:03:05.420> platform<00:03:06.420> for<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> third

the second finger platform for the third
finger<00:03:07.640> platform<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.970> fourth<00:03:09.239> finger<00:03:09.480> if

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
finger platform for the fourth finger if

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.240 
finger platform for the fourth finger if
it's<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.970> there's<00:03:12.780> no<00:03:13.049> platform<00:03:13.349> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
it's like this there's no platform the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.660 
it's like this there's no platform the
pizza<00:03:14.670> will<00:03:15.209> fall<00:03:15.569> right<00:03:15.930> off<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.170> platform
