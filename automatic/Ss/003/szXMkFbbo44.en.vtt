but<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:57.260> key<00:03:57.440> was<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:57.980> also<00:03:58.430> infuse<00:03:58.730> it

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
but the the key was to also infuse it

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.490 
but the the key was to also infuse it
with<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.450> know<00:03:59.540> this<00:03:59.720> kind<00:03:59.900> of<00:03:59.959> energy<00:04:00.350> and

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
with you know this kind of energy and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.640 
with you know this kind of energy and
pace<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.900> action<00:04:02.900> adventure<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
pace and action adventure so that the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.240 
pace and action adventure so that the
movie<00:04:03.950> has<00:04:04.280> both<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:04.940> balance<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:05.959> both<00:04:06.250> and

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
movie has both the balance of both and

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.069 
movie has both the balance of both and
this<00:04:07.489> is<00:04:07.579> what<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:07.760> think<00:04:08.030> Damon<00:04:08.450> was<00:04:08.540> referring

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
this is what I think Damon was referring

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.930 
this is what I think Damon was referring
to<00:04:09.109> earlier<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.889> the<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.190> action<00:04:10.790> and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
to earlier the the the action and

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.029 
to earlier the the the action and
thrills<00:04:11.510> but<00:04:11.930> also<00:04:12.109> the<00:04:13.030> what<00:04:14.030> Star<00:04:14.930> Trek<00:04:15.039> was

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
thrills but also the what Star Trek was

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.220 
thrills but also the what Star Trek was
in<00:04:16.489> its<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:17.720> know<00:04:17.840> early<00:04:18.169> days<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.530> in

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
in its you know early days and in

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.900 
in its you know early days and in
the<00:04:19.650> stuff<00:04:19.830> that<00:04:19.860> though<00:04:20.340> his<00:04:20.460> mother<00:04:20.670> loved

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
the stuff that though his mother loved

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.900 
the stuff that though his mother loved
and<00:04:21.810> in<00:04:22.440> terms<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.740> Star<00:04:23.430> Wars<00:04:23.460> it's<00:04:23.700> early

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
and in terms of Star Wars it's early

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.520 
and in terms of Star Wars it's early
days<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.210> going<00:04:24.300> forward<00:04:24.570> but<00:04:24.840> obviously

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
days and going forward but obviously

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.590 
days and going forward but obviously
it's<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.430> completely<00:04:26.880> different<00:04:27.030> universe<00:04:27.420> and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
it's a completely different universe and

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.500 
it's a completely different universe and
feels<00:04:27.750> like<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.930> very<00:04:28.080> very<00:04:28.230> different<00:04:29.510> tone

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
feels like a very very different tone

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.510 
feels like a very very different tone

know I mean that's a great gresham that
would<00:04:54.090> take<00:04:54.300> too<00:04:54.570> long<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.780> think<00:04:54.990> about<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.320> to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
would take too long to think about it to

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.730 
would take too long to think about it to
come<00:04:55.560> up<00:04:55.650> with<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.770> good<00:04:55.860> answer<00:04:56.040> but<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:57.740> pretty

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
come up with a good answer but I pretty

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.940 
come up with a good answer but I pretty
chuffed<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.370> think<00:04:59.610> I<00:04:59.790> mean<00:04:59.940> I<00:05:00.030> I<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.810> know<00:05:00.950> what

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
chuffed I think I mean I I you know what

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.880 
chuffed I think I mean I I you know what
was<00:05:02.070> I<00:05:02.130> think<00:05:02.310> when<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.460> was<00:05:02.580> ten<00:05:03.380> yeah<00:05:04.380> i<00:05:04.590> was<00:05:04.710> i

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
was I think when I was ten yeah i was i

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.350 
was I think when I was ten yeah i was i
was<00:05:05.070> probably<00:05:05.340> playing<00:05:05.460> an<00:05:05.820> in<00:05:06.030> half<00:05:06.210> a

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
was probably playing an in half a

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.260 
was probably playing an in half a
sixpence<00:05:06.560> at<00:05:07.560> school<00:05:07.860> at<00:05:08.010> that<00:05:08.070> time<00:05:08.130> so<00:05:08.550> the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
sixpence at school at that time so the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.790 
sixpence at school at that time so the
idea<00:05:09.420> of<00:05:09.660> being<00:05:09.720> in<00:05:09.930> his<00:05:10.050> star<00:05:10.260> trek<00:05:10.500> film<00:05:10.680> was

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
idea of being in his star trek film was

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.220 
idea of being in his star trek film was
probably<00:05:11.040> very<00:05:11.100> far<00:05:11.430> from<00:05:11.610> Anne's<00:05:11.940> mind<00:05:12.270> I

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
probably very far from Anne's mind I

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.650 
probably very far from Anne's mind I
think<00:05:14.010> he<00:05:14.100> was<00:05:14.220> just<00:05:14.340> very<00:05:14.460> worried<00:05:14.820> about<00:05:14.940> you

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
think he was just very worried about you

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.810 
think he was just very worried about you
know<00:05:15.900> but<00:05:16.200> she<00:05:16.410> it<00:05:17.040> gets<00:05:17.280> confusing<00:05:17.460> when

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
know but she it gets confusing when

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.050 
know but she it gets confusing when
you're<00:05:18.000> costing<00:05:18.330> thank<00:05:18.690> girls<00:05:18.960> at<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.110> age

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
you're costing thank girls at that age

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.410 
you're costing thank girls at that age
Peppa<00:05:21.060> hangs<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.480> tale<00:05:21.660> um<00:05:22.110> yeah<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.420> yeah

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
Peppa hangs a tale um yeah and I I yeah

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.180 
Peppa hangs a tale um yeah and I I yeah
I<00:05:24.780> think<00:05:25.290> he<00:05:25.440> would<00:05:25.500> have<00:05:25.590> been<00:05:25.710> he<00:05:25.980> would<00:05:26.100> have

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
I think he would have been he would have

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.070 
I think he would have been he would have
been<00:05:26.280> really<00:05:26.430> really<00:05:26.760> surprised<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:27.720> and

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
been really really surprised and and

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.130 
been really really surprised and and
wouldn't<00:05:28.980> quite<00:05:29.190> believed<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.840> he<00:05:30.840> still

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
wouldn't quite believed it he still

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.350 
wouldn't quite believed it he still
doesn't
