00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
disc differences between the md80 - and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.839 
disc differences between the md80 - and
the<00:00:10.530> md80<00:00:11.280> -<00:00:11.820> plus<00:00:12.450> D<00:00:12.840> s<00:00:13.110> version<00:00:13.820> the<00:00:14.820> version

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
the md80 - plus D s version the version

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.740 
the md80 - plus D s version the version
we're<00:00:15.240> looking<00:00:15.450> at<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:15.719> as<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.680> see<00:00:17.070> is

you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.590> there<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:24.420> main<00:00:24.600> difference

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
you can see there the main difference

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.339 
you can see there the main difference
immediately<00:00:27.180> when<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.689> look<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> screen

here is that you will see this all reset
button<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.809> then<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:34.980> which<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
button and then this one here which is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.010 
button and then this one here which is
the<00:00:35.340> electronic<00:00:36.059> parking<00:00:36.300> brake<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.870> also

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the electronic parking brake so it also

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.190 
the electronic parking brake so it also
deals<00:00:37.860> with<00:00:38.040> those<00:00:38.340> particular<00:00:38.730> functions

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
deals with those particular functions

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.470 
deals with those particular functions
whereas<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> original<00:00:40.770> release<00:00:41.030> md80<00:00:42.030> -<00:00:42.239> does

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
whereas the original release md80 - does

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.569 
whereas the original release md80 - does
not<00:00:42.719> deal<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.170> these<00:00:43.260> two<00:00:43.559> things<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.460> we'll

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
not deal with these two things so we'll

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.510 
not deal with these two things so we'll
just<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> quick<00:00:44.910> look<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> oil<00:00:45.780> reset

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
just have a quick look at the oil reset

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.029 
just have a quick look at the oil reset
which<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> quick<00:00:48.059> look<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
which can have a quick look at the

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.260 
which can have a quick look at the
vehicles<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.430> cover<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.940> look<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
level these are vehicles which can be

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.080 
level these are vehicles which can be
well<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> light<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.310> reset<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> oil

brake<00:01:28.310> shows<00:01:29.310> some<00:01:30.150> variations<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
brake shows some variations so there it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.940 
brake shows some variations so there it
is<00:01:48.930> that's<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> main<00:01:49.439> difference<00:01:49.860> between

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
is that's the main difference between

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.609 
is that's the main difference between
the<00:01:50.810> md80<00:01:51.810> -<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> md80<00:01:53.520> -<00:01:54.119> D<00:01:54.720> s<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.530> you
