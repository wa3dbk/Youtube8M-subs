and it's not too steep Thanks it has the
rocker<00:00:43.230> concave<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.129> even<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.059> you're

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
rocker concave but even when you're

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.750 
rocker concave but even when you're
riding<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.960> kind<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.320> feel<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.950> w<00:00:47.520> kind

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
riding you can kind of feel this w kind

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.630 
riding you can kind of feel this w kind
of<00:00:47.820> kick<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:49.100> definitely<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> don't<00:00:50.550> like

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
of kick in definitely what I don't like

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.119 
of kick in definitely what I don't like
is<00:00:50.969> where<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.270> comes<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.710> nice

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
is where it comes in here it's nice

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.520 
is where it comes in here it's nice
because<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.210> does<00:00:54.480> come<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
because it does come in but I think it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.439 
because it does come in but I think it
comes<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> little<00:00:56.129> too<00:00:56.250> much<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:57.149> doesn't

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
comes with a little too much it doesn't

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.939 
comes with a little too much it doesn't
let<00:00:57.539> your<00:00:57.690> feet<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.469> part<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
let your feet really use that part of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.310 
let your feet really use that part of
the<00:00:59.010> board<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.670> see<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.140> just<00:01:01.140> kind

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the board you can see it here just kind

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.070 
the board you can see it here just kind
of<00:01:01.410> yeah<00:01:02.090> I<00:01:05.030> don't<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.119> yeah<00:01:06.900> it's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
of yeah I don't know yeah it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
of yeah I don't know yeah it's
definitely<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.189> change<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.700> make<00:01:08.970> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
definitely what I would change I make it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.510 
definitely what I would change I make it
wider<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.720> sure<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> size<00:01:10.680> 7<00:01:11.010> foot<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:11.490> foot

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
wider for sure I'm a size 7 foot my foot

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.160 
wider for sure I'm a size 7 foot my foot
just<00:01:11.760> fits<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:14.070> bit<00:01:14.220> tight<00:01:14.610> but

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
just fits it it's a little bit tight but

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.380 
just fits it it's a little bit tight but
then<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> probably<00:01:16.530> make<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.759> steep<00:01:18.119> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
then I probably make this not as steep I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.690 
then I probably make this not as steep I
could<00:01:18.720> come<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> bit<00:01:19.530> more<00:01:19.740> uh<00:01:21.229> yeah

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
could come out a bit more uh yeah

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700 
could come out a bit more uh yeah
overall<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.970> great<00:01:24.000> board<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> good

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
overall it's a great board it's a good

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.730 
overall it's a great board it's a good
price<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:27.270> expensive<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.960> whatever<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
price a bit expensive but whatever and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.240 
price a bit expensive but whatever and
just<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:30.030> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.570> problem<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.409> grip<00:01:31.710> tape<00:01:31.979> I

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
just one kind of problem the grip tape I

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
just one kind of problem the grip tape I
don't<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.150> their<00:01:33.450> fault<00:01:33.659> where<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
don't know if it's their fault where I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.920 
don't know if it's their fault where I
got<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.610> gas<00:01:35.850> pedals<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.689> comes

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
got it but the gas pedals it just comes

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.950 
got it but the gas pedals it just comes
off<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.579> be<00:01:38.579> sure<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.150> flip<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.689> board

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
off and be sure when you flip your board

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.740 
off and be sure when you flip your board
when<00:01:40.140> you're<00:01:40.290> riding<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> flips<00:01:41.100> over<00:01:41.750> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
when you're riding if it flips over the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.289 
when you're riding if it flips over the
grip<00:01:42.960> tape<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.470> come<00:01:43.680> off<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.299> will

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
grip tape will come off of all this will

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.999 
grip tape will come off of all this will
walk<00:01:45.509> them<00:01:45.659> off<00:01:45.750> fast<00:01:46.079> I've<00:01:46.439> probably<00:01:46.619> done<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
walk them off fast I've probably done it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.789 
walk them off fast I've probably done it
a<00:01:47.040> few<00:01:47.130> times<00:01:47.630> but<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.930> don't<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.619> still

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
a few times but I don't know it's still

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.730 
a few times but I don't know it's still
sticking<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.399> uh<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.390> paint<00:01:51.750> chips<00:01:51.899> really

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
sticking and uh the paint chips really

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.800 
sticking and uh the paint chips really
easy<00:01:52.890> yeah<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.729> kind<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.149> this

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
easy yeah here you can kind of see this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.260 
easy yeah here you can kind of see this
isn't<00:01:55.140> even<00:01:55.290> from<00:01:55.409> curbing<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.040> that's<00:01:56.790> just

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
isn't even from curbing it that's just

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.649 
isn't even from curbing it that's just
from<00:01:57.899> kicking<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.250> grab<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.549> yeah<00:02:00.270> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
from kicking it up to grab it yeah this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.380 
from kicking it up to grab it yeah this
up<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.290> don't<00:02:01.979> know<00:02:02.180> overall<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.360> great

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
up to I don't know overall it's a great

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.539 
up to I don't know overall it's a great
board<00:02:03.750> probably<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> best<00:02:04.590> paint<00:02:05.250> but

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
board probably not the best paint but

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.180 
board probably not the best paint but
it's<00:02:05.939> fine
