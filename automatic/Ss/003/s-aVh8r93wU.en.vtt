that's<00:02:33.450> how<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.049> it<00:02:34.290> does<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:35.099> seem

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
that's how it is so it does really seem

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.399 
that's how it is so it does really seem
to<00:02:35.400> be<00:02:35.609> like<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.819> black<00:02:36.180> ops<00:02:36.420> system<00:02:36.810> with<00:02:37.260> the

to be like the black ops system with the

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.470 
to be like the black ops system with the
cop<00:02:37.620> points<00:02:37.950> except<00:02:38.250> they<00:02:38.519> have<00:02:38.849> renamed<00:02:39.239> cop

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
cop points except they have renamed cop

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.170 
cop points except they have renamed cop

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
points to level up tokens so that's

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.250 
points to level up tokens so that's
pretty<00:02:42.450> cool<00:02:42.629> in<00:02:42.780> my<00:02:42.810> opinion

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
pretty cool in my opinion

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.380 
pretty cool in my opinion
I'm<00:02:43.470> thinking<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.150> because<00:02:45.269> I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
I'm thinking that I like that because I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.449 
I'm thinking that I like that because I
really<00:02:45.720> enjoy<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.109> black<00:02:46.319> ops<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:47.250> black

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
really enjoy the black ops if the black

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.789 
really enjoy the black ops if the black
ops<00:02:47.670> system<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:48.629> whole<00:02:48.840> confines<00:02:49.409> thing

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
ops system with the whole confines thing

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.440 
ops system with the whole confines thing
I<00:02:50.010> thought<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.700> was<00:02:50.790> unique<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.299> innovative

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
I thought it was unique and innovative

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.379 
I thought it was unique and innovative
so<00:02:52.440> I'm<00:02:52.590> hoping<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.700> will<00:02:53.819> be<00:02:53.879> similar

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
so I'm hoping that this will be similar

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.360 
so I'm hoping that this will be similar
except<00:02:54.959> better<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.409> think<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.980> would<00:02:56.069> be<00:02:56.190> very

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
except better I think that would be very

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.830 
except better I think that would be very
cool<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.879> course<00:02:56.909> you<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.359> to<00:02:57.480> wait<00:02:57.629> till

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
cool and of course you have to wait till

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.649 
cool and of course you have to wait till
certain<00:02:58.109> levels<00:02:58.409> to<00:02:58.829> get<00:02:58.980> certain<00:02:59.370> things

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
certain levels to get certain things

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.530 
certain levels to get certain things
just<00:03:00.659> like<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.019> black<00:03:01.260> ops<00:03:01.530> also<00:03:02.540> apparently

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
just like in black ops also apparently

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.179 
just like in black ops also apparently
you<00:03:03.750> won't<00:03:03.989> be<00:03:04.109> able<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.349> unlock<00:03:04.590> everything

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
you won't be able to unlock everything

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.000 
you won't be able to unlock everything
until<00:03:05.939> you<00:03:06.269> prestige<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.349> that's<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.889> to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
until you prestige so that's going to

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.589 
until you prestige so that's going to
make<00:03:08.129> proceeding<00:03:08.730> worse<00:03:08.970> something

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
make proceeding worse something

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.379 
make proceeding worse something
I<00:03:09.629> guess<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.109> only<00:03:10.230> get<00:03:10.409> 55<00:03:10.799> tokens<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:12.329> the

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
I guess you only get 55 tokens in the

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:13.910 
I guess you only get 55 tokens in the
first<00:03:12.689> procedure<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.260> there<00:03:13.409> are<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> total<00:03:13.769> of
