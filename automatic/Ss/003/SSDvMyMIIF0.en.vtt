cosplayers<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:46.480> don't<00:03:47.480> put<00:03:47.720> on<00:03:47.810> my<00:03:47.989> wig<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.320> way

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
cosplayers I don't put on my wig the way

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.500 
cosplayers I don't put on my wig the way
your<00:03:48.560> spoke<00:03:48.800> to<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.100> and<00:03:49.340> for<00:03:50.239> me<00:03:50.420> that's

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
your spoke to you and for me that's

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.690 
your spoke to you and for me that's
because<00:03:50.870> all<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.380> times<00:03:51.620> because<00:03:52.310> my<00:03:52.489> hair

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
because all of the times because my hair

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.300 
because all of the times because my hair
is<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.000> long<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.420> does<00:03:53.720> pull<00:03:54.050> in<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.290> back<00:03:54.440> so

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
is so long it does pull in the back so

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.350 
is so long it does pull in the back so
when<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:55.910> try<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.420> put<00:03:56.570> it<00:03:56.660> on<00:03:57.070> like<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.130> way<00:03:58.430> it

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
when I try to put it on like this way it

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.479 
when I try to put it on like this way it
just<00:03:59.600> doesn't<00:03:59.870> work<00:03:59.930> for<00:03:59.989> my<00:04:00.170> head<00:04:00.320> shape<00:04:00.560> so

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
just doesn't work for my head shape so

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.760 
just doesn't work for my head shape so
for<00:04:02.060> me<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.480> actually<00:04:03.350> do<00:04:04.660> pull<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.810> on<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.140> so

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
for me I actually do pull it on and so

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.430 
for me I actually do pull it on and so
you<00:04:07.760> kind<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.030> take<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.300> part<00:04:08.660> pull<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.410> up

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
you kind of take this part pull it up

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.170 
you kind of take this part pull it up
against<00:04:09.709> your<00:04:09.800> head<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.190> then<00:04:10.670> pull<00:04:10.910> forward

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
against your head and then pull forward

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.360 
against your head and then pull forward
and<00:04:11.450> down<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:13.060> then<00:04:14.920> you'll<00:04:15.920> pull<00:04:16.130> back<00:04:16.340> a

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
and down and then you'll pull back a

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.409 
and down and then you'll pull back a
little<00:04:16.489> bit<00:04:16.700> because<00:04:16.820> usually<00:04:17.180> goes<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.330> little

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
little bit because usually goes a little

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.449 
little bit because usually goes a little
too<00:04:17.600> poor<00:04:17.810> for<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.290> now<00:04:18.980> it's<00:04:19.190> really

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
too poor for it and now it's really

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.340 
too poor for it and now it's really
awfully<00:04:20.000> styled<00:04:20.419> but<00:04:20.630> that's<00:04:20.840> not<00:04:21.080> too<00:04:21.229> bad

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
awfully styled but that's not too bad

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.620 
awfully styled but that's not too bad
because<00:04:21.530> it's<00:04:21.710> usually<00:04:21.830> just<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.190> bangs<00:04:23.110> and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.970 

voila

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
voila

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.120
