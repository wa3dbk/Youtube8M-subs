got obviously you go into here you go
through<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.550> chest<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.090> something<00:00:21.750> obvious

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
through the chest and something obvious

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.560 
through the chest and something obvious
from<00:00:22.289> inside<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.640> obviously<00:00:24.000> cover<00:00:24.449> up

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
from inside and you obviously cover up

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.660 
from inside and you obviously cover up
the<00:00:24.720> outside<00:00:24.900> pots<00:00:25.289> here<00:00:25.529> make<00:00:26.130> under<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> sling

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the outside pots here make under a sling

I<00:00:26.760> know<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> piston<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.599> I'm<00:00:27.689> doing<00:00:27.930> this

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
I know what a piston is I'm doing this

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.310 
I know what a piston is I'm doing this
long<00:00:28.140> enough<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.640> then<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.480> destroy<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
long enough and then you destroy the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.500 
long enough and then you destroy the
blocks<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:33.180> will<00:00:33.329> start

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
blocks up here and the will start

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.940 
blocks up here and the will start
closing<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.989> I'm<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.320> gonna<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.590> yet

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
closing on you I'm not gonna do that yet

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.330 
closing on you I'm not gonna do that yet
because<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.670> can't<00:00:36.450> reset<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> system<00:00:37.340> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
because I can't reset the system the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.290 
because I can't reset the system the
only<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> do<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> eggs<00:00:39.210> without

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
only way to do it is to eggs without

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.889 
only way to do it is to eggs without
saving<00:00:39.690> because<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.340> know<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.660> big

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
saving because you know it's a big

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.569 
saving because you know it's a big
system<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.559> doesn't<00:00:43.829> release<00:00:44.010> reset<00:00:44.370> itself

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
system and doesn't release reset itself

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.479 
system and doesn't release reset itself
very<00:00:44.850> easily<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.410> i<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:46.920> these<00:00:47.039> gravel

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
very easily so i can see these gravel

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.200 
very easily so i can see these gravel
stacks<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.510> things<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.820> will<00:00:50.820> first

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
stacks are the things that will first

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.369 
stacks are the things that will first
thing<00:00:51.239> happens<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> destroy<00:00:52.260> this

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
thing happens when you destroy this

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.220 
thing happens when you destroy this
thing<00:00:52.699> i'll<00:00:53.699> go<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> back<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.660> show

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
thing i'll go on to the back see show

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.229 
thing i'll go on to the back see show
you<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.070> strongest<00:00:56.489> thing<00:00:56.670> makes<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you how the strongest thing makes the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.819 
you how the strongest thing makes the
same<00:00:57.420> thing<00:00:57.840> will<00:00:57.960> happen<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> look

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
same thing will happen or what I look

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.920 
same thing will happen or what I look
that<00:00:59.670> probably<00:00:59.879> makes<00:01:00.059> sense<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.570> so

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that probably makes sense they are so

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.200 
that probably makes sense they are so
destroy<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.440> those<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.699> any<00:01:02.940> one<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> those

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
destroy one of those so any one of those

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.719 
destroy one of those so any one of those
snap<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.690> both<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.739> them<00:01:04.830> then

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
snap you both it can be one of them then

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
snap you both it can be one of them then
it'll<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.720> rid<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.260> these

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
it'll get rid of this one of these

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 
it'll get rid of this one of these
signals<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.920> since<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.460> needs<00:01:08.580> both<00:01:08.939> these

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
signals and since it needs both these

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.740 
signals and since it needs both these
signals<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:10.770> off<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.640> off<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.180> keep<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.510> on

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
signals to off to be off to keep this on

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
signals to off to be off to keep this on
if<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:13.860> gets<00:01:13.979> taken<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.640> single

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
if one of them gets taken out one single

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.300 
if one of them gets taken out one single
turns<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.840> turns<00:01:16.049> off<00:01:16.290> engine<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.189> you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
turns on that turns off engine out you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.260 
turns on that turns off engine out you
both<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.110> goes<00:01:19.490> big<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:20.790> gate<00:01:21.000> tower

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
both so this is goes big not gate tower

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.760 
both so this is goes big not gate tower
or<00:01:21.680> it's<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.130> getting<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.119> here

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
or it's like not getting up to here

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.410 
or it's like not getting up to here
which<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.070> powers<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:26.939> these<00:01:27.119> people

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
which then powers all these people

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
which then powers all these people
unpause<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.020> these<00:01:28.140> Pistons<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:28.710> they

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
unpause all these Pistons really they

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
unpause all these Pistons really they
will<00:01:29.280> pull<00:01:29.460> back<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.420> start<00:01:30.900> this

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
will pull back and then start this

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.330 
will pull back and then start this
restaurant<00:01:31.380> clock<00:01:31.560> because<00:01:31.799> its<00:01:31.890> power<00:01:32.220> on

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
restaurant clock because its power on

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.330 
restaurant clock because its power on
that<00:01:32.369> block<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.900> redstone<00:01:34.259> clock<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.740> was

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that block and the redstone clock I was

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.789 
that block and the redstone clock I was
quite<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> long<00:01:35.970> time<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.450> eight<00:01:37.079> full<00:01:37.530> ones

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
quite a long time it's eight full ones

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.149 
quite a long time it's eight full ones
so<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:38.700> each<00:01:39.509> full<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.500> mean<00:01:40.860> no<00:01:41.009> oh

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
so that's each full one is I mean no oh

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.069 
so that's each full one is I mean no oh
I<00:01:41.729> had<00:01:41.939> Tony<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.299> work<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> time<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.899> fine

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
I had Tony to work out the time is fine

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.109 
I had Tony to work out the time is fine
and<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.460> these<00:01:44.549> Pistons<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and then I have all these Pistons to the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.450 
and then I have all these Pistons to the
side<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.470> push<00:01:46.710> their<00:01:46.860> nonstick<00:01:47.130> basins

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
side so they push their nonstick basins

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
side so they push their nonstick basins
a<00:01:47.549> regular<00:01:47.939> Pistons<00:01:48.299> as<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> saw<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.009> info

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
a regular Pistons as you saw the info

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.160 
a regular Pistons as you saw the info
box<00:01:50.250> earlier<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> pushed<00:01:51.630> forward<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
box earlier so I pushed forward and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.719 
box earlier so I pushed forward and
those<00:01:52.259> apples<00:01:52.680> down<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> pushed<00:01:53.189> forward<00:01:53.520> again

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
those apples down I pushed forward again

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.219 
those apples down I pushed forward again
so<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.479> I'm<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.689> falls<00:01:54.840> onto<00:01:55.079> another

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
so which I'm that falls onto another

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.630 
so which I'm that falls onto another
layer<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.500> push<00:01:55.710> forge<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.189> keeps<00:01:56.280> pushing

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
layer to push forge so it keeps pushing

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.950 
layer to push forge so it keeps pushing
it<00:01:56.729> forward<00:01:56.939> until<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.420> crushes<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it forward until it crushes you in the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.550 
it forward until it crushes you in the
middle<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:59.450> think<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.630> explain<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.290> offer

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
middle I think I explain that one offer

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.889 
middle I think I explain that one offer
to<00:02:01.649> make<00:02:01.740> sense<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.399> feel<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> gravel<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.479> there

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to make sense I feel the gravel is there

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.840 
to make sense I feel the gravel is there
because<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.530> know<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.680> need<00:02:04.979> something<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
because you know you need something to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
because you know you need something to
replace<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.450> push<00:02:06.719> forward<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.079> replace

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
replace it and push forward and replace

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.900 
replace it and push forward and replace
that<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.039> push<00:02:08.190> forward<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.520> replace

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that and then push forward and replace

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.730 
that and then push forward and replace
out<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.239> push<00:02:09.360> forward<00:02:10.039> so<00:02:11.039> yeah<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.700> is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
out and push forward so yeah this is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.800 
out and push forward so yeah this is
yeah<00:02:14.740> this<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.030> pretty<00:02:16.540> simple

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
yeah this is it this is pretty simple

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.440 
yeah this is it this is pretty simple
actually<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.260> concept<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:18.070> simple<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.240> so

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
actually the concept is simple and so

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.300 
actually the concept is simple and so
the<00:02:19.570> Redstone<00:02:19.900> really<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.320> just<00:02:20.350> takes<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.100> lot

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
the Redstone really it just takes a lot

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.480 
the Redstone really it just takes a lot
of<00:02:21.340> rest<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.730> also<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:23.110> yeah<00:02:23.260> I'm<00:02:24.130> going<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.340> go

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
of rest and also so yeah I'm going to go

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.940 
of rest and also so yeah I'm going to go
into<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.300> room<00:02:25.510> here<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:25.960> I'm<00:02:26.620> an<00:02:26.710> actress

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
then you see the gravels falling down as

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.300 
then you see the gravels falling down as
it<00:02:55.000> pushes<00:02:55.210> in<00:02:55.450> stock<00:02:55.960> pulls<00:02:56.110> back<00:02:56.310> grapples

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
it pushes in stock pulls back grapples

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.070 
it pushes in stock pulls back grapples
down<00:02:57.430> push<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.360> stop<00:02:58.570> pushing<00:02:58.810> itself

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
down push it in and stop pushing itself

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.120 
down push it in and stop pushing itself
because<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.440> reached<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.770> middle<00:03:00.040> and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
because it reached the middle and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.130 
because it reached the middle and
instill<00:03:00.430> Bravo<00:03:00.610> left<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.600> break<00:03:01.870> your<00:03:02.020> son

system<00:03:02.530> obviously<00:03:02.770> because<00:03:03.310> there's<00:03:03.460> no<00:03:03.550> way

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
system obviously because there's no way

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.160 
system obviously because there's no way
to<00:03:03.700> reset<00:03:03.910> anyway<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.720> want<00:03:04.900> two<00:03:04.990> eggs

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
to reset anyway you want two eggs

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
to reset anyway you want two eggs
without<00:03:05.290> saying<00:03:05.650> doesn't<00:03:05.710> matter<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:06.100> it

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
without saying doesn't matter if it

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.660 
without saying doesn't matter if it
breaks<00:03:06.280> own<00:03:06.490> system<00:03:06.820> afterwards<00:03:07.210> because<00:03:07.900> if

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
breaks own system afterwards because if

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.730 
breaks own system afterwards because if
you're<00:03:09.670> going<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.820> try<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.060> re<00:03:10.630> reset<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.560> in

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
you're going to try and re reset it in

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.930 
you're going to try and re reset it in
the<00:03:11.950> same<00:03:12.160> thing<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:12.580> going<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.760> take<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:12.910> a

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the same thing it's going to take you a

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.540 
the same thing it's going to take you a
long<00:03:13.120> time<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.990> come<00:03:14.680> about<00:03:14.800> 37<00:03:15.250> same<00:03:15.370> thing

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
long time so I come about 37 same thing

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.040 
long time so I come about 37 same thing
just<00:03:15.580> eggs<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.150> say<00:03:16.300> so<00:03:16.690> if<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.840> system

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
just eggs and say so if the system

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.170 
just eggs and say so if the system
breaks<00:03:17.260> itself<00:03:17.590> that's<00:03:17.920> fine<00:03:18.130> because<00:03:18.820> people

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
breaks itself that's fine because people

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.080 
breaks itself that's fine because people
already<00:03:19.390> be<00:03:19.510> dead<00:03:19.690> inside<00:03:19.990> there<00:03:20.970> anyway<00:03:21.970> yeah

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090
