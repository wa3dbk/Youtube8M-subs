00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.750
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.740
 I invite you to a makeup 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.150
 completely different from what I can 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.639
 do it usually since it's a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.530
 pink makeup so usually you tell me 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.160
 see wearing hands very colors 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.470
 neutral enough basic we will say that we 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.509
 see every day and I wanted to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.210
 change I had been several requests 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.240
 and colorful makeups and so I'm 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
 am told why not where is the king 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.400
 after all I'm blonde so to the point 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.280
 where I am it is gone dare the pink 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.660
 barbie is then of course this makeup 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.590
 may not please everyone 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.350
 since precisely he is a little bit 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.879
 different he comes out of the ordinary 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.519
 but I thought I was going when 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.109
 same time p so if you want to 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.989
 know how I realized this 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.280
 makeup stay with me and here are the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.559
 explanations that I have already done my 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 dyed I used the light perfection 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.390
 from Chanel so that is a background of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.530
 long-lasting complexion so the hue its 10 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.210
 and I mixed a few shades 20 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.190
 VITALUMIÃˆRE the foundation you're aqua 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.080
 really very very good too the reason 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.780
 for which I mixed thann that's 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.180
 because otherwise this hue is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.830
 really too clear it looks like a corpse 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.450
 and this date is this year too 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.340
 dark and that's not pretty it's done 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.480
 demarcations so for the eyes that's 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.290
 going to be very firm I'm going to use 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.110
 only one ball is so who will be there 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 not the turballe the keys anniversary yes 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.590
 it was a 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:38.670
 special edition before I'm still 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.470
 apply a base on my eyes so that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.950
 will help make my lighthouse more 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.570
 vibrating and also not to hold back anymore 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.050
 So here a long time I take a bar 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.060
 chocolate so the first color that I 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.160
 am going to use is going to be like theme tic 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.660
 who is here and forgive me in advance 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.610
 if I look from time to time 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.490
 local on this side I do not ignore you 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.820
 not but I'm still afraid of not well 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.560
 framed then you look trend the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.840
 reflex to look a little bit aside 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.450
 but I do not ignore you so 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.780
 I apply my short handed all over the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.780
 eyelid 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.270
 I avoid the inner corner what I'm going 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.400
 put another color in the inner corner 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:30.330
 i'm going to put flahaut which is a no 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:38.760
 so here is a little pastel sin 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:41.239
 very pretty so I apply in all the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.239
 internal corner 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.420
 that brings light 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.570
 now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.100
 that I'm going to take the pink firecracker that 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.810
 I never dared by fact 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.470
 finally I find that the result is 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:05.520
 not so bad 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:07.110
 so it's john cho john so you have this 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.950
 sponsorship but apply it in the corner 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.950
 external of life 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.390
 trying to peak each 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.110
 I use the same brush 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.110
 do not bother me 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.090
 I now take a faded brush 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.440
 no and so I want to come is actually 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.020
 all this and you'll see suddenly 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.240
 will be much better after that will do less 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.240
 flashy more melted 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.269
 now i'm going to move to the liner so 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.660
 I would have used the corn knuckle 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.660
 E-mail 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.010
 now that I'm done with my 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.250
 honor i'm going to apply a little bit of 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.760
 bluff so use the live ore what 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:05.470
 finish this scheme with a brush like 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.640
 these people do not use much 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:15.640
 because I do not want that either 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:18.370
 do too much too much pink it's just 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.650
 to give some light on 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.810
 the student stole the lead blau from home 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.570
 dior so that actually adapts to the 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:36.250
 color of your lips like that will make you 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:37.960
 not too zappera it's natural you 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.340
 can also use something from 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.100
 very nude of this component if you 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:49.570
 wish I will now resort to 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:51.520
 missiles and now i'm applying my 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.840
 mascara including kiel and the inimitable 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.840
 intense che chanel 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.009
 Well here I hope that we 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.210
 will ask more then of course exchange 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.460
 a lot of what I can do 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.629
 usually but I promise you that the 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.520
 next makeup will be a match 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.050
 much more neutral like that 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.550
 will really count everyone because 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.229
 obviously we have all the tastes 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.830
 different 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.330
 do not hesitate to leave me a 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.949
 comment if you have ideas on 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.490
 makeup I think maybe make a 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:47.939
 make-up with bronze things 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.339
 like that very summer makeup I think 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.409
 that it can be nice before the 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.879
 bad weather comes back I cross the 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:54.300
 fingers so it's not too much 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.430
 quick 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.110
 thank you very much for having 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.430
 watched this video I make you full 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.430
 kisses and tell you very soon
