00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.430 
because I actually guys when I was
uploading<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.140> videos<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.619> was<00:02:10.099> making<00:02:10.429> more

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
uploading the videos I was making more

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.690 
uploading the videos I was making more
but<00:02:12.440> actually<00:02:12.799> wouldn't<00:02:13.040> let<00:02:13.190> me<00:02:13.310> upload<00:02:13.579> I

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
but actually wouldn't let me upload I

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.949 
but actually wouldn't let me upload I
guess<00:02:13.910> there's<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.150> limit<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.510> how<00:02:14.569> many<00:02:14.840> things

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
guess there's a limit of how many things

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.559 
guess there's a limit of how many things
you<00:02:15.140> can<00:02:15.230> upload<00:02:15.470> at<00:02:15.650> one<00:02:15.799> time<00:02:16.090> which<00:02:17.090> was

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
you can upload at one time which was

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.710 
you can upload at one time which was
strange
