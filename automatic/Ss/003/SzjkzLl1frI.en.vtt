00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
system that the old video used and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.790 
system that the old video used and
they've<00:00:51.270> changed<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.719> some<00:00:51.989> newer<00:00:52.289> system

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
they've changed to some newer system

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.069
