 iphone or ipod or ipad devices worth 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.640
 and well let's start the first thing 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.020
 everything is having requirements to have light in 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.079
 the latest version is worth having the iphone 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.020

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.019
 There are you also worth or ipad 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.080
 then the cable to connect it to 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.080
 computer 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.050
 and it's already there and the good iphone comes 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.589
 you have to first of all know and 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.969
 haiti remember right click execute 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.580
 as administrators and open it I already what 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.640
 I have open and this can be done without 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.680
 internet vale 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 here as you see I do not have internal now 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.150
 same and good before 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 before that it 's good to get off the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.020
 application download music voucher on the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.430
 song that you want is clear yes 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.610
 Come on, music goes on, you have to be 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.490
 in the song and good the song I've 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.780
 chosen this I do not know which one is very well 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.180
 you will find out there that I had it in my 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.350
 computer already download and good voice is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.850
 OK 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.820
 that 's why this is a session of 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.759
 electro and this lasts longer and takes longer 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.320
 more in compiling is worth but I'm going to 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.119
 pass this 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.399
 It is worth forgiveness to tell him calls 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.170
 because I have a cold and maybe I am 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.170
 some or some more 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.320
 would be down the song from are even 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.770
 the program that you have to download them 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.520
 songs 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.289
 I think it admits it all mp3 / mp4 mind 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.289
 I think it admits everything is worth 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.610
 we open the itunes we have it here I do not 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.980
 I have internet but and we are going to do it 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.950
 also without internet, you do not need 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.020
 put anything and I'm going to connect it the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.020
 light the iphone a moment 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.800
 worth the computer 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.380
 let's wait for what is here 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.380
 is loading this we can close it 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.810
 this is good and we are going to go 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:46.219
 formal 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.750
 this is a is a tutorial I have not seen 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:54.060
 other tutorials 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:58.110
 and what they do is more truth and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.840
 I was seen easy square of I say 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.750
 well let's do this voucher well 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.750
 what 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.700
 we give here in this the things that 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.070
 they have to be put in sync 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.260
 only selected songs and videos 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.340
 important and synchronized with this 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.910
 iphone via wifi 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.910
 it is also quite important it 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.540
 draft 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.600
 good is synchronized via wifi what 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.210
 you want, it's not necessary 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.590
 what would be quite important in 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.150
 without clemency of just songs videos 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.490
 selected because if it's not from 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.230
 synchronize what you want 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.610
 Well, now we 're not going to the tab where 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.800
 says on this iphone give it and here as 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.930
 you see here I have my songs that 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.900
 I have inside the iphone and here you can 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.350
 pass videos and with this the program 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.020
 I suppose that also but it is worth 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.140
 let's go to video 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.930
 even envy not in music if you want 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.540
 pass music music and videos videos 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.730
 we are already musicians and here what you have 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.099
 what to do is choose the song I've 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.359
 chosen is it worth then then we're going 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:15.689
 to give right click copies copy it the 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.689
 song we go back to light yum and we give it 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.689
 we click inside a song by 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.030
 example in this we click has nothing 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:26.629
 to see that so that the song is passed 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.870
 here we click and give where to put 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:32.729
 genes on the control v keyboard and we hope 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.879
 one moment each lane and up here already 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.780
 will begin to update patatin 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.570
 patatÃ¡n is worth 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.790
 and to this I believe that it is already updated 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.870
 and the song has already been copied 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.870

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:05.009
 the song will appear where it will appear by 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.960
 the song where that 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.719
 the song that you have passed is worth 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.099

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.639
