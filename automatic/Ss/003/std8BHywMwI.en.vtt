00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.910
 Who does not speak it band? 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.259
 hello friends on this video let's learn 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 how to make this small motor a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.539
 Word is a simpler engine in the world 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 as you can see in the video 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.160
 Let 's get some material eyes on you. 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.199
 need a big pile of 1.5 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.760
 volts a minimum of any other 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.040
 steering wheel - this size covers badness 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.770
 of 0.8 mm anyone either 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.239
 can serve a piece of wood is in the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.800
 description a manual drill bit 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.420
 three millimeters you can replace 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.969
 Anything else that was the godmother 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.320
 also a thread 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.309
 favoritism of 2.5 meters of copper one 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.770
 Durex tape 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.770
 can be either a ruler 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.930
 and hot glue let's start using the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.090
 own evil to make a hole in the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.930
 the beloved side and more or less in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.930
 rio grande center 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 approximately one centimeter 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.990
 depth with the next album 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.799
 soon after you have done the first hole use 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.070
 the ruler and measure six centimeters 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.250
 hole and make others 6 105 same region 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.840
 well aligned with the same depth of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.840
 1 cent used approximately 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:44.280
 done that now you get the 2.5 filter 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.289
 liters and use the bulb to dispatch it. 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.899
 then worn out pick up use the 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.679
 network again messi 16cm and 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.890
 rope 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.689
 let's use possibilities 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.520
 after that we will use pliers 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.649
 hand to make a small ring on the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.460
 tip them as the video does 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.460
 that with both 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.489
 You did and now we will withdraw the group. 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.440
 two note that the video is ticking logo 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:22.870
 It will stay a little bit longer by letter. 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.870
 same time gold with 71 net the two 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.030
 after that we'll use the glue 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.790
 Let's hot fill the glue hole. 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:38.150
 hot then put so we did 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:38.150
 quality there as well as in the two video 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.000
 done that take the magnet but a bit of 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.750
 hot glue on magnet for gluing on wood 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.879
 right in the center of the two partners of copper 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.079
 or uses the stan son and he did not have 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.060
 From Rio 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.220
 but you can also use another movie 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.590
 just scroll like I'll show it on the video 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.860
 now if you do not have a machine 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.860
 soldering 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.480
 after greeting the two children 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.890
 How can you see in the video? Let's go. 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.220
 make the mouth 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.140
 You give ten laps with glue wire. 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.850
 enameled is copper after time is a 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.330
 piece of life to learn for 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.330
 he does not come back 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.810
 done that you case like in the video 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.420
 and roll because it is firm 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.370
 do this on both sides of the small stack 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.370
 that was being shown in the video 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.990
 how can you see and have to stay 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.560
 in this model well aligned with the tip with 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.960
 the other 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.490
 now you take the wood you see 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.530
 this was very perfect 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.950
 after that we'll use the knife 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.260
 again and we but for the enamel 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:11.330
 Have a drink, I've done it well. 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.520
 with the padilha as in the end only that says 29 the 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.660
 public 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.660
 these two legs 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.290
 after you have removed all the enamel 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.810
 Let's put it like the video 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.280
 See how it works perfectly now with 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.310
 a little hot glue let's add 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.280
 a little more to stick to the daughter 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.560
 made that a piece of durex tape 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.390
 nicole one side of the pole wire 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.610
 battery negative we now go 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.040
 first test not only did I get onu 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.090
 condemning to start the match 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.550
 how can you see stone works 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.840
 is the simplest engine called as the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.340
 necklace on the world's simplest engine 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.639
 as you can see it works 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.639
 perfectly 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.870
 now to finish let's put more 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.029
 a piece of lurex thread on the other side 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.339
 to hold a movie 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:07.809
 This is our little engine put there. 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.699
