00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
what I'm going to talk about is why you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.050 
what I'm going to talk about is why you
use<00:00:25.470> distilled<00:00:25.920> water<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.519> your<00:00:26.640> cooling

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
use distilled water in your cooling

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.589 
use distilled water in your cooling
system<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.660> your<00:00:28.320> XJ<00:00:28.830> okay<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.420> look

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
system on your XJ okay now if you look

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.870 
system on your XJ okay now if you look
right<00:00:30.779> here<00:00:30.840> okay<00:00:31.769> I've<00:00:32.099> had<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> leak<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.700> some

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
right here okay I've had a leak at some

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.560 
right here okay I've had a leak at some
point<00:00:33.149> time<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.559> thermostat<00:00:35.030> neck<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
point time so my thermostat neck the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.970 
point time so my thermostat neck the
upper<00:00:36.840> water<00:00:37.050> neck<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.500> stuff<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
upper water neck and stuff like that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.360 
upper water neck and stuff like that
it's<00:00:38.160> got<00:00:38.370> corroded<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.410> oxidized<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.250> lot

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it's got corroded and oxidized and a lot

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.979 
it's got corroded and oxidized and a lot
of<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:41.579> due<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.420> chlorinated<00:00:42.960> water

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
of that's due to the chlorinated water

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.950 
of that's due to the chlorinated water
that<00:00:43.379> comes<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.890> tap<00:00:43.950> system<00:00:44.960> and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that comes out of your tap system and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.369 
that comes out of your tap system and
what<00:00:46.950> happens<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.660> chlorinated

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
what happens is with that chlorinated

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
what happens is with that chlorinated
water<00:00:49.410> inside<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.129> cooling<00:00:50.670> system<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
water inside your cooling system it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
water inside your cooling system it
causes<00:00:51.600> rust<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.199> cause<00:00:52.410> events<00:00:52.829> causes<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
causes rust it cause events causes it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.389 
causes rust it cause events causes it
inside<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.030> engine<00:00:54.379> it<00:00:55.379> oxidizes<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
inside of the engine it oxidizes and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.810 
inside of the engine it oxidizes and
corrode<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.149> heater<00:00:57.930> core<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:59.550> just

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
corrode the heater core and it's just

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.429 
corrode the heater core and it's just
not<00:01:00.030> good<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.320> also<00:01:02.660> this<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> good<00:01:04.140> way<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
not good and also this is a good way to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.950 
not good and also this is a good way to
tell<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.790> starting<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> rust<00:01:06.420> inside

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
tell that it's starting to rust inside

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840 
tell that it's starting to rust inside
the<00:01:07.110> engine<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.950> dirty<00:01:08.280> mucky

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the engine you get this dirty mucky

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.240 
the engine you get this dirty mucky
nasty<00:01:09.360> antifreeze<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.530> really<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.040> worth

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
nasty antifreeze this really not worth

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.899 
nasty antifreeze this really not worth
nothing

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
nothing

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.210

being a big big big headache going
through<00:01:22.710> flushing<00:01:23.430> off<00:01:23.549> system<00:01:23.970> which<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
through flushing off system which I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
through flushing off system which I
probably<00:01:24.479> want<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.890> really

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.749 
tap and here's the old water pump you
know<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.799> it's<00:02:01.799> pretty<00:02:02.189> gooey

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
know you can see it it's pretty gooey

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.899 
know you can see it it's pretty gooey
nasty<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.680> don't<00:02:04.890> want<00:02:05.070> that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
nasty and you don't want that

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.770 
nasty and you don't want that
so<00:02:07.009> make<00:02:08.009> sure<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.849> obscenity<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
so make sure you get on obscenity and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.510 
so make sure you get on obscenity and
freeze<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.649> don't<00:02:10.709> recommend<00:02:11.130> getting<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
freeze and I don't recommend getting the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.720 
freeze and I don't recommend getting the
50/50<00:02:12.290> if<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.709> need<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.950> pop<00:02:14.489> your

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
50/50 if you just need to pop your

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.000 
50/50 if you just need to pop your
system<00:02:15.060> off<00:02:15.180> 50/50<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.930> fine<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> really

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
system off 50/50 is fine but I really

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.479 
system off 50/50 is fine but I really
wouldn't<00:02:17.280> go<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.819> 50/50<00:02:18.599> for<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.650> whole<00:02:19.830> system

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
wouldn't go a 50/50 for the whole system

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.630 
wouldn't go a 50/50 for the whole system
just<00:02:21.209> for<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.230> fact<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.590> when<00:02:23.250> he<00:02:23.280> drained

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
just for the fact that when he drained

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.430 
just for the fact that when he drained
radiator<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.480> don't<00:02:24.630> get<00:02:24.750> all<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.110> water<00:02:25.319> out

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
radiator you don't get all the water out

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.020 
radiator you don't get all the water out
of<00:02:25.500> your<00:02:25.650> cooling<00:02:26.010> system<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.550> lot<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.849> water

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
of your cooling system so a lot of water

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.490 
of your cooling system so a lot of water
left<00:02:27.209> up<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.569> block<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:28.050> lot<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.380> old

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
left up in the block a lot of old

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.370 
left up in the block a lot of old
antifreeze<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.269> add<00:02:30.420> 50/50<00:02:31.140> mix

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
antifreeze and if you add 50/50 mix

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.699 
antifreeze and if you add 50/50 mix
you're<00:02:32.190> pretty<00:02:32.640> much<00:02:32.730> diluting<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.110> 50/50

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
you're pretty much diluting the 50/50

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.229 
you're pretty much diluting the 50/50
mix<00:02:34.920> with<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.220> old<00:02:35.370> water<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.849> craps<00:02:36.060> it's

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
mix with the old water and craps it's

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.720 
mix with the old water and craps it's
our<00:02:36.360> two<00:02:36.450> units<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.380> always<00:02:38.280> get<00:02:38.519> real

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
our two units so I always get real

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.309 
our two units so I always get real
antifreeze<00:02:39.180> want<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.599> complete<00:02:40.019> feel

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
antifreeze want to do a complete feel

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.789 
antifreeze want to do a complete feel
also<00:02:41.190> always<00:02:41.790> fill<00:02:42.060> your<00:02:42.269> radiator<00:02:42.510> first<00:02:43.470> and

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
also always fill your radiator first and

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.949 
also always fill your radiator first and
you<00:02:43.860> fill<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.160> block<00:02:44.340> first<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.840> way

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
you fill the block first and that way

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.240 
you fill the block first and that way
you<00:02:46.380> can<00:02:46.560> kindly<00:02:47.599> dilute<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:49.769> antifreeze<00:02:50.069> and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
you can kindly dilute the antifreeze and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.770 
you can kindly dilute the antifreeze and
water<00:02:50.400> that's<00:02:50.700> doing<00:02:50.940> your<00:02:51.060> block<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.540> make

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
water that's doing your block and make

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.930 
water that's doing your block and make
it<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:52.260> little<00:02:52.590> bit<00:02:52.769> stronger<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.370> more

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
it a little bit stronger and more

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.600 
it a little bit stronger and more
antifreeze<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.660> then<00:02:55.170> then<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.099> top<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.459> off

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
antifreeze and then then I top it off

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.309 
antifreeze and then then I top it off
with<00:02:57.480> distilled<00:02:57.900> water

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
with distilled water

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.309 
with distilled water
so<00:02:58.890> guys<00:02:59.790> girls<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.329> hope<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.569> made<00:03:00.810> sense<00:03:01.110> for
