00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
zoom in for accuracy when aimed pursley
I<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.120> big<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> deal<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I don't think that's a big a deal I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.779 
I don't think that's a big a deal I
think<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.050> would<00:00:55.140> only<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.469> valuable<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
think it would only be valuable on a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
think it would only be valuable on a
large<00:00:57.090> maps<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.570> sky<00:00:57.780> shock<00:00:58.170> or<00:00:58.379> something

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
large maps like sky shock or something

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.160 
large maps like sky shock or something
but<00:00:59.370> even<00:00:59.640> then<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.510> there<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.750> drop

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
but even then I think that there is drop

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.689 
but even then I think that there is drop
off<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.530> don't<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.039> counters<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.430> drop

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
off I don't know if it counters the drop

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.979 
off I don't know if it counters the drop
off<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:03.359> cross<00:01:03.719> map

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
off and you can actually cross map

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
off and you can actually cross map
somebody<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.250> can't<00:01:05.489> actually

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
somebody with it but you can't actually

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.520 
somebody with it but you can't actually
not<00:01:06.000> kill<00:01:06.270> somebody<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.780> golden<00:01:07.110> gun<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
not kill somebody with a golden gun and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
not kill somebody with a golden gun and
sky<00:01:08.070> shock<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.460> generally<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> map<00:01:08.939> you'll

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
sky shock is generally the map you'll

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.420 
sky shock is generally the map you'll
