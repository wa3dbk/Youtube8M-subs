00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.280 
when I do reset it the second hand on
the<00:02:19.830> timer<00:02:20.070> does<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.610> stop<00:02:21.000> exactly<00:02:21.780> at<00:02:21.930> 12:00

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the timer does not stop exactly at 12:00

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.070 
the timer does not stop exactly at 12:00
I<00:02:22.590> don't<00:02:23.490> know<00:02:23.610> if<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:23.940> done<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.750> it

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
I don't know if this is done so it

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.960 
I don't know if this is done so it
doesn't<00:02:25.560> block<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.830> illumination<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
doesn't block the illumination of the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.320 
doesn't block the illumination of the
twelve<00:02:27.390> o'clock<00:02:27.540> tritium<00:02:28.530> tube<00:02:28.800> or<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:30.060> this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
twelve o'clock tritium tube or if this

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.750 
twelve o'clock tritium tube or if this
is<00:02:30.480> just<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.900> fault<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.740> watch<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.730> I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
is just a fault of the watch so I

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
is just a fault of the watch so I
started<00:02:33.240> again<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:34.730> then<00:02:35.730> stopped<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.270> until

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
started again and then stopped in until

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.990 
started again and then stopped in until
I'm<00:02:37.590> happy<00:02:38.070> with<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.340> location<00:02:40.550> overall<00:02:41.550> this

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
I'm happy with the location overall this

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.210 
I'm happy with the location overall this
is<00:02:42.060> not<00:02:42.330> exactly<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.810> cheap<00:02:43.170> watch<00:02:43.410> considering

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
is not exactly a cheap watch considering

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.760 
is not exactly a cheap watch considering
it<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:44.730> an<00:02:44.910> automatic<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> quartz

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
it is not an automatic this is a quartz

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.730 
it is not an automatic this is a quartz
but<00:02:47.730> I'm<00:02:47.820> pretty<00:02:48.090> damn<00:02:48.300> happy<00:02:48.570> with<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.560> you

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
but I'm pretty damn happy with it if you

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.440 
but I'm pretty damn happy with it if you
have<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.980> opportunity<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.610> picking<00:02:50.940> one<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:51.270> I
