00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.610
 for me it's good for it's night 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.610
 heat the 10% obvious 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.209
 35 kilometers through the city 60 years all back in the opposite direction 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.699
 needles 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.419
 309 km in total 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.989
 four long straight lines 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.630
 the reassuring scene 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.569
 three possibilities of passing 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.569
 maximum speed of 2,197 km 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.149
 here we are in Singapore 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.149
 - circuit tours 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.400
 first part of the circuit very difficult and very complex of these two 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.310
 insurance 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.590
 to avoid touching the members of the bands are very very high the track 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.890
 is very bumpy 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.460
 put power partners 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 we first come in a bend and a very fast 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.940
 it's not easy to do well in wood or jump 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.490
 we now arrive in a very sinuous part 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.680
 relieved that's all 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.140
 side because it's true that if a boss 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.490
 I want to go 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.650
 she serves across the planet 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.820
 it is not easy for him and me 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.720
 an excess of the event not possible 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.000
 during the facts for one hour 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.180
 difficult a chicane with very very bad moment 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.220
 so here it must be in my opinion it's a matter of a touch 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.220
 we go straight to Iraq 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.400
 even during the turns that follow letters to the past very closely 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.390
 walls 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.500
 why this year 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.810
 but we're going fast 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 so it's true that it's a peculiarity of this circuit 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 even when we arrive in a difficult part with others 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.130
 the mandate includes members 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.570
 his side asked at the time of the meal 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.720
 this chicane the go to the smic 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.730
 this meeting 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.020
 exit of turn 10 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.609
 he will have my arrival in the bend 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:10.539
 is going to the bottom 4th 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.289
 and who makes us finished 5 th 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:13.179
 but the singapore circuit
