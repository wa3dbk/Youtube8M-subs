00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
they're also wasting another band like

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.900

Caitlin<00:00:37.739> what<00:00:38.100> does<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.309> band<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:38.790> them

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
Caitlin what does that band you for them

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.250 
Caitlin what does that band you for them
there<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.600> doing<00:00:39.840> anything<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.230> he

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
there it's not doing anything because he

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.139 
there it's not doing anything because he
still<00:00:40.500> has<00:00:40.649> graves<00:00:40.920> there's<00:00:41.489> still<00:00:41.670> quirky<00:00:42.059> in

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
still has graves there's still quirky in

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.060 
still has graves there's still quirky in
their<00:00:42.270> solution<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.960> they're<00:00:43.559> wasting<00:00:43.920> all

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
their solution so they're wasting all

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040 
their solution so they're wasting all
three<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.670> their<00:00:44.850> bands<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:45.930> you're

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
three of their bands and when you're

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.389 
three of their bands and when you're
doing<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> you're<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
doing that you're not going to have a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.069 
doing that you're not going to have a
good<00:00:47.550> time<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.850> pick<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.149> ban<00:00:48.420> days<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:49.020> feels

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
good time in pick and ban days it feels

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.500 
good time in pick and ban days it feels
like<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.860> sort<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.430> losing<00:00:50.879> focus<00:00:51.120> as

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
like they are sort of losing focus as

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.010 
like they are sort of losing focus as
the<00:00:52.289> series<00:00:53.280> goes<00:00:53.489> deeper<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.180> deeper<00:00:54.329> now

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the series goes deeper and deeper now

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.010 
the series goes deeper and deeper now
how<00:00:55.469> much<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.520> due<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.809> thinking

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
how much of that is due to just thinking

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.959 
how much of that is due to just thinking
about<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.320> last<00:00:58.440> game<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.949> they<00:00:59.430> forget<00:00:59.670> all

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
about the last game and they forget all

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.610 
about the last game and they forget all

your<00:01:27.689> plan<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.259> stick<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.680> plan<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
your plan was and stick to your plan I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
your plan was and stick to your plan I
think<00:01:29.670> they're<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.390> sticking<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> plan

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
think they're not sticking to the plan

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.690 
think they're not sticking to the plan
obviously<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:31.890> picks<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.400> bans<00:01:32.430> are

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
obviously because picks and bans are

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.609 
obviously because picks and bans are
changing<00:01:33.000> drastically<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.079> they're

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
changing drastically and they're

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.530 
changing drastically and they're
starting<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> overthink<00:01:36.000> things<00:01:36.240> here

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
starting to overthink things here

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
starting to overthink things here
they're<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.170> sticking<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.740> they<00:01:37.829> came

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
they're not sticking to what they came

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.670 
they're not sticking to what they came

would win the game for you but that

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720 
would win the game for you but that

nine<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.310> need<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.550> use<00:02:50.790> theirs<00:02:51.000> teleports

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
nine just need to use theirs teleports

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.700 
nine just need to use theirs teleports
better<00:02:51.810> or<00:02:52.550> drop<00:02:53.550> those<00:02:53.760> summer<00:02:54.120> spose<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.870> get

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
better or drop those summer spose so get

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.380 
better or drop those summer spose so get
that<00:02:55.740> game<00:02:56.220> right<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:56.580> if<00:02:56.850> they<00:02:57.090> use<00:02:57.360> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
that game right there if they use a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.730 
that game right there if they use a
towel<00:02:57.660> boy<00:02:57.690> better<00:02:57.990> they<00:02:58.230> definitely<00:02:58.590> could

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
towel boy better they definitely could

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.290 
towel boy better they definitely could
have<00:02:58.800> won<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.010> game<00:02:59.250> for<00:02:59.490> example<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.060> think

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
have won that game for example I think

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.030 
have won that game for example I think
they<00:03:00.630> got<00:03:00.780> quadrant<00:03:01.350> or<00:03:01.410> something<00:03:01.740> near<00:03:01.890> that

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
they got quadrant or something near that

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.190 
they got quadrant or something near that
mid<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.490> inner<00:03:02.760> turret<00:03:03.060> instead<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.870> EG<00:03:04.050> q

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
mid in the inner turret instead of EG q

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.050 
mid in the inner turret instead of EG q
tal<00:03:04.350> import<00:03:04.710> back<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.160> think<00:03:05.580> he<00:03:05.700> should<00:03:05.880> just

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
tal import back I think he should just

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.610 
tal import back I think he should just
kept<00:03:06.270> pushing<00:03:06.420> bomb<00:03:06.690> yeah<00:03:07.080> what<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> got<00:03:07.470> that

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
kept pushing bomb yeah what I got that

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.290 
kept pushing bomb yeah what I got that
turret<00:03:07.950> he<00:03:08.130> may<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.370> gotten<00:03:08.580> inhibitor<00:03:09.120> and

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
turret he may have gotten inhibitor and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.300 
turret he may have gotten inhibitor and
at<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.900> point<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.290> time<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.620> think<00:03:10.680> aspire<00:03:11.130> to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
at that point in time I think aspire to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.280 
at that point in time I think aspire to
do<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.430> trade<00:03:11.730> you're<00:03:12.090> losing<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.570> game<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.140> do

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
do a trade you're losing the game so do

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.720 
do a trade you're losing the game so do
your<00:03:13.440> best<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.740> try<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:13.920> trade<00:03:14.250> objectives

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
your best to try and trade objectives

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.240 
your best to try and trade objectives
give<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.000> mid<00:03:15.330> turret<00:03:15.540> delay<00:03:16.230> their<00:03:16.440> backs<00:03:16.650> but

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
give a mid turret delay their backs but

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.280 
give a mid turret delay their backs but
let<00:03:17.430> him<00:03:17.550> push<00:03:17.790> bottom<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.570> for<00:03:18.750> example<00:03:18.840> when

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
let him push bottom so for example when

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.990 
let him push bottom so for example when
we're<00:03:19.410> playing<00:03:19.680> against<00:03:19.980> coast<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.700> LCS

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
we're playing against coast in the LCS

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.699 
we're playing against coast in the LCS
of<00:03:21.209> our<00:03:21.330> last<00:03:21.510> week<00:03:21.720> we<00:03:22.200> were<00:03:22.290> losing<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.620> game

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
really hardly right so at that point in

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.020 
really hardly right so at that point in
time<00:03:24.450> we're<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:24.810> hey<00:03:25.430> meteos<00:03:26.430> go<00:03:26.670> bottom

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
time we're like hey meteos go bottom
