we'll<00:02:13.019> probably<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.499> again<00:02:13.680> when<00:02:13.829> the<00:02:13.890> fat

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
we'll probably get it again when the fat

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.770 
we'll probably get it again when the fat
gets<00:02:14.249> hard<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:14.879> then<00:02:15.090> we<00:02:15.180> get<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.329> real<00:02:15.540> good

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
gets hard and then we get a real good

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.989 
gets hard and then we get a real good
testament<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.290> power<00:02:16.439> really<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.400> speed<00:02:17.790> wise

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:17.999 
testament of power really is speed wise

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.459 
testament of power really is speed wise
head-to-head<00:02:18.659> with<00:02:19.010> conditions<00:02:20.010> take<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.340> out
