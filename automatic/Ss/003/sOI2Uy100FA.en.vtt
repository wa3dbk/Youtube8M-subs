00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
should look like generally speaking I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.790 
should look like generally speaking I
think<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.880> about<00:01:48.480> that's<00:01:48.960> pretty<00:01:49.530> hard<00:01:49.740> to

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
think that's about that's pretty hard to

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.790 
think that's about that's pretty hard to

just you know we enjoyed being around

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.699 
just you know we enjoyed being around
each<00:02:39.300> other's<00:02:39.570> company<00:02:39.600> it's<00:02:40.019> not<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.380> it's

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
each other's company it's not like it's

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.550 
each other's company it's not like it's
forced<00:02:41.040> or<00:02:41.160> anything<00:02:41.519> so<00:02:42.440> that's<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.530> good

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
forced or anything so that's a good

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.960 
forced or anything so that's a good
thing<00:02:43.739> because<00:02:43.980> when<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.340> glue<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
thing because when you glue you on the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.000 
thing because when you glue you on the
court<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.330> want<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.140> play<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.350> each<00:02:46.709> other<00:02:46.920> and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
court we want to play for each other and

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.220 
court we want to play for each other and
I<00:02:47.190> think<00:02:47.220> that's<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.600> know<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.720> big<00:02:48.959> part<00:02:49.170> of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
I think that's a you know a big part of

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.479 
I think that's a you know a big part of
chemistry<00:02:49.650> almost<00:02:49.950> go<00:02:50.010> say<00:02:50.130> how<00:02:50.220> much<00:02:50.310> can

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
chemistry almost go say how much can

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.180 
chemistry almost go say how much can
that<00:02:50.519> translate<00:02:51.120> into<00:02:51.269> play<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.350> court<00:02:52.500> it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
that translate into play on the court it

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.780 
that translate into play on the court it
translates<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.760> lot<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.890> know<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.220> if<00:02:56.519> you're

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
translates a lot you know it's if you're

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.460 
translates a lot you know it's if you're
playing<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.390> people<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.900> enjoy<00:02:58.260> being

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
playing with people that you enjoy being

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.140 
playing with people that you enjoy being
around<00:02:58.680> people<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.340> want<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.610> go<00:02:59.670> battle

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
around people that you want to go battle

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.290 
around people that you want to go battle
with<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.780> battle<00:03:01.110> for<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.530> sacrifice<00:03:02.010> for

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
with in battle for and sacrifice for

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.699 
with in battle for and sacrifice for
those<00:03:03.300> teams<00:03:03.540> always<00:03:03.750> get<00:03:03.989> further<00:03:04.290> than<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
those teams always get further than the

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.040 
those teams always get further than the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
does it really matter in the playoffs at

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.050 
does it really matter in the playoffs at
this<00:03:11.260> point<00:03:11.500> at<00:03:11.890> this<00:03:11.950> point<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.610> know<00:03:12.760> we

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
this point at this point you know we

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.080 

well<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.150> think<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.520> there<00:03:39.520> were<00:03:39.700> two

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
well I think that so there were two

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.420 
well I think that so there were two
groups<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.630> went<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.500> hung<00:03:41.680> out<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.070> we

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
groups that went that hung out and we

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.460 
groups that went that hung out and we
were<00:03:42.520> going<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.700> try<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.850> meet<00:03:43.120> up<00:03:43.150> but<00:03:43.270> then<00:03:43.660> it

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
were going to try to meet up but then it

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.530 
were going to try to meet up but then it
didn't<00:03:44.680> work<00:03:44.800> out<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.310> we<00:03:45.430> had<00:03:45.580> like<00:03:45.610> most<00:03:46.330> half

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.470 
didn't work out so we had like most half
on<00:03:46.870> one<00:03:47.080> side<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.320> put<00:03:47.590> half<00:03:47.770> on<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.070> other
