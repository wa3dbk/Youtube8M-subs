00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 welcome cycling tips from 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.569
 Anton Stepanova 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.000
 Good day, I just 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.160
 recorded version of this vidos not included 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.190
 airplane mode on the phone and called me 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.650
 friend and everything bent down and now I will tell 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.529
 it all opened again this time not 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.529
 gaming stars why it happens like with 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.920
 this fight how to straighten itself 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.830
 if the star is not bent out of the connecting rod 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 and I about it and the obelisk a little later, then you 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.290
 you need to fix it somewhere in some 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.040
 vise how to hold take long 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.140
 crocodiles 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.590
 or passatizh in general something with big 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 lever and actually here such poppy 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.989
 and straighten out if the star is the rest of the plan 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.850
 straightens right on the bike 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.280
 Pliers or hammer is very 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 just but the rest is a star in itself 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.149
 shit she will constantly be a group 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.449
 we put to straighten someone this masturbation 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.359
 puddle easily bend 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.210
 due to deformation of blows bad 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.729
 made the stars of those who 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.159
 jumpers between the prongs and the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.020
 the part where it is attached to the shaft is thin 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.439
 either they are diagonally milled as 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.119
 old stars salary and cheap stars 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.720
 who are milling while there with two 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.119
 parties 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.860
 although it would seem they should be stronger 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.409
 but practice shows man always 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.820
 so let's go to the back 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.820
 we show it all because of what in general 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.520
 there is an overwhelming majority of curves 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.159
 stars is determined by the curve star you have 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.650
 or not by turning that sexes back if 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.570
 the chain has non-constant tension 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.220
 somewhere more pulled somewhere less 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.180
 mean star curve comes from 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:51.299
 because manufacturers are often 9 they 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.290
 here they do these places where 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.469
 fasten here is where star fasten praise and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:03.899
 where is it fastened by the connecting rod itself 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:06.299
 here is not one line especially sin 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.130
 conflicts and simple stark 8 spline 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.300
 rods this place often 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.160
 turns below and the star curls here 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.980
 everything is solved very simply go to build 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.990
 Maghazi buy puck leave with bolt in 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.810
 stars to heat their tea under 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.790
 diameter 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.700
 0305 mm maximum thickness 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.960
 millimeter can bend the other side 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.470
 put between the star and the mount 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.790
 the spikes are going and no problem here 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.250
 between the star of this mount and rather 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:46.730
 all will happen from shuga curvature 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:50.270
 starlets will disappear 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.370
 forget to put likes with you was Anton 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.370
 Stepan and see you
