and that also goes from marine tank as
you<00:00:57.460> don't<00:00:57.760> want<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.000> disturb<00:00:58.359> the

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
that is deep in the gravel by virtue of

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.420 
that is deep in the gravel by virtue of
adding<00:01:04.510> oxygen<00:01:04.720> which<00:01:05.530> is<00:01:05.680> not<00:01:06.190> good<00:01:06.400> for

adding oxygen which is not good for
denitrifying<00:01:06.880> bacteria<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.619> continue<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.189> go

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
denitrifying bacteria you continue to go

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.810 
denitrifying bacteria you continue to go
through<00:01:09.580> in<00:01:09.850> areas<00:01:10.210> like<00:01:10.240> that

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.020 

you<00:01:17.390> burn<00:01:17.659> other<00:01:17.810> areas<00:01:18.560> really<00:01:19.460> simple<00:01:19.820> and

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
you burn other areas really simple and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.800 
you burn other areas really simple and
then<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:20.180> want<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.540> keep<00:01:21.229> going<00:01:21.409> through<00:01:21.830> and

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
then you want to keep going through and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.350 
then you want to keep going through and
then<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:23.930> want<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.140> kink<00:01:24.760> so<00:01:25.760> she<00:01:25.820> could<00:01:26.150> drop

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
then you want to kink so she could drop

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.350 
then you want to kink so she could drop
the<00:01:26.540> gravel<00:01:26.930> like<00:01:27.080> I'm<00:01:27.260> doing<00:01:27.590> here<00:01:28.270> time<00:01:29.270> you

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
the gravel like I'm doing here time you

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.690 
the gravel like I'm doing here time you
kink<00:01:29.660> it<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:30.470> allows<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.890> gravel<00:01:31.430> now

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
kink it that allows the gravel now

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.920 
kink it that allows the gravel now
there's<00:01:31.909> other<00:01:32.030> ways<00:01:32.119> of<00:01:32.390> doing<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.810> by

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
there's other ways of doing it by

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.109 
there's other ways of doing it by
lifting<00:01:33.170> too<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:33.740> I<00:01:33.830> find<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.160> kinking<00:01:34.640> looks

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
lifting too but I find the kinking looks

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.550 
lifting too but I find the kinking looks
the<00:01:35.330> best<00:01:35.510> for<00:01:35.780> this<00:01:38.259> basically<00:01:39.259> when<00:01:39.410> you're

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
the best for this basically when you're

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.880 
the best for this basically when you're
done<00:01:39.680> then<00:01:39.979> after<00:01:40.910> changing<00:01:41.300> about<00:01:41.860> 25%<00:01:42.860> of

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
done then after changing about 25% of

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.650 
done then after changing about 25% of
the<00:01:42.979> water<00:01:43.160> or<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.759> little<00:01:44.150> more<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.360> little<00:01:44.450> less

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
tacking on your needs

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.320 
tacking on your needs
take<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.190> gravel<00:01:46.490> out<00:01:46.610> your<00:01:46.790> mouth<00:01:46.880> then<00:01:47.180> you

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
take the gravel out your mouth then you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.150 
take the gravel out your mouth then you
could<00:01:47.509> fill<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.900> tank<00:01:48.140> by<00:01:48.380> virtue<00:01:48.650> of<00:01:48.830> a
