00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.649 
tight end isn't someone who just catches
the<00:01:40.740> ball<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.490> better<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.909> able<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.150> block<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the ball you better be able to block and

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.120 
the ball you better be able to block and
that<00:01:42.810> that's<00:01:43.350> something<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> learn

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that that's something that you learn

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
that that's something that you learn
when<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.520> first<00:01:44.970> get<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.899> can't

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
when you first get here is if you can't

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.260 
when you first get here is if you can't
block<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
block you know you don't get to see the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.609 
block you know you don't get to see the
field<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.079> something<00:01:49.290> that's<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
field and so that's something that's a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.679 
field and so that's something that's a
really<00:01:50.009> stress<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.390> something

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
really stress and and it's something

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.350 
really stress and and it's something
that<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.159> helps<00:01:53.670> us<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.970> lot<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that that I think helps us a lot in the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.690 
that that I think helps us a lot in the
long<00:01:54.570> run<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.500> an<00:01:55.649> amazing<00:01:56.100> feeling<00:01:56.340> when

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
long run it was an amazing feeling when

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850
