00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.429
 go to the second holiday lesson 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.580
 in it we will process our picture beautiful 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.480
 purple tones I will work here 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.920
 with this snapshot 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.840
 you can take any layer and starts yes 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:28.019
 so first of all we create a corrective 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.960
 layer curves and add a little bit of air 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.920
 in our picture we will make it more airy 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.910
 for this we raise the curve like this 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.719
 way up so that our snapshot became 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.510
 a little bit lighter so like that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.430
 manner and also move in the blue channel 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:56.989
 and drive the curve here like this 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:01:00.829
 way so to get this 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:04.729
 shade yes so bend and 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.400
 close the adjustment layer curves 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.930
 Next, create a correction layer. 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.670
 gradient and style for him 100 his 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.570
 radial 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:24.439
 color choose the first color so we have 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.439
 will be f4 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.930
 ee 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.750
 and so click ok 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.409
 light gray we will have on the left and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:42.450
 right we will put now 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:46.670
 807 df 0 this is the color of blue 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.740
 click here ok ok 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.649
 change a little bit put the scale 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.049
 here is 150 percent for the gradient to be 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:00.060
 smoother and press ok 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:04.729
 layer overlay mode set soft light 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.290
 and transparency for him put 50 so 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:12.390
 fine 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.390
 further add a correction layer color 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:22.180
 set color for it 5 a7 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.400
 and 9 and here is such a gray-blue color 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.040
 press ok 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:32.260
 overlay mode will be overlapping 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.580
 transparency is 30 percent so following 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.510
 step we need you 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.240
 correct 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.460
 we create the right shades for this 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.020
 adjustment layer selective correction 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:48.670
 colors and first go over here to yellow 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.160
 tones and add a little blue 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.220
 colors 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.100
 purple and lower the value itself 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.800
 yellow to -9 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:04.709
 takes a purple on the contrary it will strengthen 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:12.640
 for this we write here 13 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:15.310
 here is minus 12 here is plus 12 so 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.980
 way we get rid of the yellow shade 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.390
 on our pictures we turn now white 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.250
 tones and slightly reduce the content 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.489
 yellow also in white shades 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:33.310
 put -30 close this 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:37.450
 adjustment layer and add layer 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.910
 color here we will need you 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.850
 dark blue color 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.000
 he will have a cat 000 81 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.190
 do not press ok 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.700
 blending mode for this layer will be y 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:56.410
 we put an exception to it as well 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.260
 add the adjustment layer again 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.370
 selective color correction to even 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.570
 slightly enhance the shadows on our shots 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.360
 for this we go to black tones and 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:16.160
 just add the black value here 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:19.840
 plus 10 so maybe even plus 15 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.390
 so that our shadows become a little bit brighter 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.880
 close this adjustment layer and 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.980
 we have three more to add 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.470
 adjustment layer color to get 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:36.640
 the effect we need and so the first layer y 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:42.470
 we will be with you color number e c 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:45.230
 9th 22 warm yellow hue push 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:50.600
 here ok, blend mode is set soft 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:52.910
 light transparency 50 next step 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.900
 add a little cold shade to 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:01.910
 shadows for this choose a color c f.e. 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.790
 0f here is such 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.500
 light blue tint press the key 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.000
 ok 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:14.180
 blend mode also soft light 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:18.140
 transparency 40 so soft light not 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.510
 overlapping as you can see our picture already 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.040
 looks very good you can one more 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.970
 adjustment layer add to it 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:32.590
 let's do it so again layer color 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:36.200
 and this time choose color 001 82a 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.890
 I press the ok key and set the mode 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.600
 overlay 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:43.880
 already this time the exception also 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.690
 lowering the transparency somewhere to 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.950
 forty percent so here it looks 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.360
 our final result 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.620
 let me merge all the layers into one 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.320
 I select the top layer by clamping the key 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.470
 shift click on the penultimate layer and 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:04.910
 I press kontrol r to combine our 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:07.970
 layers into a group and so here's a snapshot which y 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:11.380
 we were at the beginning of the lesson and this 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.380
 the effect we have with you
