00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
that was the camera that was crushproof

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.730 
that was the camera that was crushproof
and<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.539> wanted<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:27.960> how<00:00:28.080> crushproof<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
and we wanted to see how crushproof it

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.460 
and we wanted to see how crushproof it
was<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.730> new<00:00:30.000> model<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.840> freeze

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
was this is the new model that is freeze

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.810 
was this is the new model that is freeze
proof<00:00:32.180> waterproof<00:00:33.500> shockproof<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.190> there's

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
proof waterproof shockproof and there's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.970 
proof waterproof shockproof and there's
a<00:00:35.880> new<00:00:36.149> feature<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:37.079> goes<00:00:37.440> along<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
a new feature that goes along with that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.850 
a new feature that goes along with that
and<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.600> well<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> won't<00:00:40.320> say<00:00:40.559> tap

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and it's it's it's well I won't say tap

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.590 
and it's it's it's well I won't say tap
proof<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.399> idea<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.940> want<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.360> tap<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
proof the idea is you want to tap it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500 
proof the idea is you want to tap it
it's<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.559> an<00:00:43.710> accelerometer<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.940> quite<00:00:45.329> like

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it's got an accelerometer not quite like

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.600 
it's got an accelerometer not quite like
the<00:00:45.660> iPhone<00:00:46.289> accelerometer<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> idea<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the iPhone accelerometer but the idea is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.250 
the iPhone accelerometer but the idea is
you<00:00:47.670> could<00:00:47.910> tap<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> pictures<00:00:49.110> go

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you could tap it and the pictures go

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
you could tap it and the pictures go
that<00:00:49.440> way<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> screen<00:00:50.160> tap<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.969> way

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that way on the screen tap it that way

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.600 
that way on the screen tap it that way
they<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:52.110> tap<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> top<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.489> do

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
they go that way tap the top you can do

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250 
they go that way tap the top you can do
some<00:00:53.789> other<00:00:53.910> things<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.510> turn<00:00:54.719> flash<00:00:55.050> on

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
some other things you know turn flash on

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.610 
some other things you know turn flash on
or<00:00:55.500> off<00:00:55.590> settings<00:00:56.149> you<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.390> tap<00:00:57.660> away<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
or off settings you just tap away I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.680 
or off settings you just tap away I
think<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.219> should<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> tap<00:01:00.059> dance<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.539> this

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
think we should do a tap dance on this

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.119 
think we should do a tap dance on this
thing<00:01:00.899> put<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> through<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> towel<00:01:01.620> oh<00:01:01.739> no<00:01:02.070> you

buttons unfortunately it didn't work
yeah<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.930> strikes<00:01:55.290> me<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.649> one<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.829> those

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
yeah it strikes me as one of those

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.370 
yeah it strikes me as one of those
because<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.090> technologies<00:01:57.869> rather<00:01:58.140> than

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
because we can technologies rather than

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.780 
because we can technologies rather than
because<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.799> really<00:01:59.070> need<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.579> you're

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
because you really need it if you're

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.240 
because you really need it if you're
gonna<00:01:59.969> use<00:02:00.290> accelerometer<00:02:01.290> let's<00:02:01.860> shake<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
gonna use accelerometer let's shake the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.130 
gonna use accelerometer let's shake the
camera<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.759> go<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.149> go<00:02:03.360> forward<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.899> let's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
camera to go as we go forward and let's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.690 
camera to go as we go forward and let's
make<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.380> work<00:02:04.680> let's<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.189> make<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.549> yeah

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
it's shockproof after all okay we kill

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.119 
it's shockproof after all okay we kill

instructions tap the back of the camera
to<00:02:17.400> get<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.610> previous<00:02:18.030> screen<00:02:18.270> not<00:02:18.900> good<00:02:19.260> but

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
to get the previous screen not good but

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.800 
to get the previous screen not good but
once<00:02:20.400> our<00:02:20.550> Olympus<00:02:20.910> rep<00:02:21.150> told<00:02:21.420> us<00:02:21.599> more

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
once our Olympus rep told us more

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.650 
once our Olympus rep told us more
specifically<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.590> tap<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.980> LCD<00:02:23.550> screen<00:02:23.660> then

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
specifically to tap the LCD screen then

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.140 
specifically to tap the LCD screen then
it<00:02:24.690> worked<00:02:24.989> not<00:02:25.470> every<00:02:25.709> time<00:02:25.950> but<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.640> did<00:02:26.849> work

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
it worked not every time but it did work

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.420
