00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
my god this room looks so cool now it

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.570 
my god this room looks so cool now it
looks<00:06:29.350> so<00:06:29.500> much<00:06:29.560> better<00:06:29.860> with<00:06:30.130> the<00:06:30.160> shaders

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
looks so much better with the shaders

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.360 
looks so much better with the shaders
look<00:06:31.390> at<00:06:31.450> the<00:06:31.540> background<00:06:32.100> then<00:06:33.100> began

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
look at the background then began

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.060 
look at the background then began
between<00:06:33.550> the<00:06:33.760> teeth<00:06:34.000> and<00:06:34.240> we<00:06:34.300> are<00:06:35.170> heading<00:06:35.530> way

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
between the teeth and we are heading way

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.360 
between the teeth and we are heading way
way<00:06:36.490> down<00:06:37.320> once<00:06:38.320> again<00:06:38.440> what's<00:06:39.010> that<00:06:39.160> water

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
way down once again what's that water

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.460 
way down once again what's that water
though<00:06:39.610> I<00:06:39.880> guess<00:06:40.270> we<00:06:40.480> go<00:06:40.660> like<00:06:40.840> right<00:06:41.140> past

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
though I guess we go like right past

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.060 
though I guess we go like right past
like<00:06:41.770> the<00:06:41.919> ocean

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
like the ocean

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.560 
like the ocean
oh<00:06:44.110> here<00:06:45.110> we<00:06:45.230> go<00:06:45.370> that<00:06:46.370> that<00:06:46.730> is<00:06:46.880> a<00:06:46.910> potato

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.570 
oh here we go that that is a potato

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.420
