a<00:00:17.680> couple<00:00:18.680> of<00:00:18.769> years<00:00:18.980> ago<00:00:19.189> I<00:00:19.699> was<00:00:20.390> teaching<00:00:20.840> a

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
a couple of years ago I was teaching a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.140 
a couple of years ago I was teaching a
robotics<00:00:21.470> course<00:00:21.770> as<00:00:22.039> I<00:00:22.160> do<00:00:22.220> every<00:00:22.520> year<00:00:22.910> for

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
robotics course as I do every year for

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.040 
robotics course as I do every year for
the<00:00:23.210> last<00:00:23.330> decade<00:00:23.900> or<00:00:24.050> more<00:00:24.110> and<00:00:25.810> it<00:00:26.810> was

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
the last decade or more and it was

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.220 
the last decade or more and it was
demoed<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:28.150> demonstration<00:00:29.150> day<00:00:29.480> basically

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
demoed a demonstration day basically

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.990 
demoed a demonstration day basically
what<00:00:30.470> we<00:00:30.590> have<00:00:30.800> his<00:00:31.010> first<00:00:31.279> year<00:00:31.520> students

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
what we have his first year students

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.420 
what we have his first year students
artificial<00:00:32.539> intelligence<00:00:33.109> they<00:00:34.070> have<00:00:34.280> to

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
artificial intelligence they have to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.860 
artificial intelligence they have to
build<00:00:34.760> a<00:00:34.910> robot<00:00:35.949> program<00:00:36.949> it<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.429> then<00:00:38.239> it<00:00:38.600> has

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
build a robot program it and then it has

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.259 
build a robot program it and then it has
to<00:00:39.079> run<00:00:39.289> through<00:00:39.589> a<00:00:39.620> track<00:00:40.069> that<00:00:40.640> we<00:00:40.789> make<00:00:40.999> for

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
to run through a track that we make for

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.389 
to run through a track that we make for
them<00:00:41.420> containing<00:00:42.260> all<00:00:42.379> kinds<00:00:42.679> of<00:00:42.769> obstacles

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
them containing all kinds of obstacles

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.819 
them containing all kinds of obstacles
and<00:00:43.809> objects<00:00:44.809> that<00:00:44.839> they<00:00:45.050> have<00:00:45.170> to<00:00:45.319> take<00:00:45.530> and

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
and objects that they have to take and

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.189 
and objects that they have to take and
solve<00:00:46.100> some<00:00:46.249> problems<00:00:46.639> etc<00:00:46.989> one<00:00:47.989> of<00:00:48.019> the

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
solve some problems etc one of the

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.770 
solve some problems etc one of the
hardest<00:00:48.909> obstacles<00:00:49.909> that<00:00:50.059> we<00:00:50.210> have<00:00:50.420> for<00:00:50.629> them

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
hardest obstacles that we have for them

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.860 
hardest obstacles that we have for them
is<00:00:50.929> a<00:00:51.499> seesaw<00:00:52.190> that's<00:00:53.059> basically<00:00:53.389> a<00:00:53.510> board

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
is a seesaw that's basically a board

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.809 
is a seesaw that's basically a board
that<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.319> have<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.620> climb<00:00:54.829> up<00:00:55.129> first<00:00:55.370> or<00:00:55.729> the

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
that you have to climb up first or the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:57.369 
that you have to climb up first or the
robot<00:00:56.089> has<00:00:56.209> to<00:00:56.299> climb<00:00:56.420> up<00:00:56.629> first<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.139> then<00:00:57.260> you

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
robot has to climb up first and then you

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.229 
robot has to climb up first and then you
read<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.679> mill<00:00:57.829> it<00:00:58.249> turns<00:00:58.489> down<00:00:58.729> and<00:00:58.999> you<00:00:59.059> have

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
read the mill it turns down and you have

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.709 
read the mill it turns down and you have
to<00:00:59.389> descend<00:01:00.319> right<00:01:01.359> in<00:01:02.359> this<00:01:02.510> particular

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
to descend right in this particular

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.600 
to descend right in this particular
robot<00:01:03.909> but<00:01:04.909> what<00:01:05.630> we<00:01:05.780> were<00:01:05.930> watching<00:01:06.610> wasn't

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
robot but what we were watching wasn't

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.350 
robot but what we were watching wasn't
probably<00:01:08.770> programmed<00:01:09.770> right<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.370> a<00:01:11.150> little

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
probably programmed right and a little

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.410 
probably programmed right and a little
bit<00:01:11.570> too<00:01:11.720> heavy<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.280> was<00:01:13.400> trying<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:14.000> ascend

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
bit too heavy so it was trying to ascend

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.560 
bit too heavy so it was trying to ascend
the<00:01:14.930> seesaw<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.880> wheels<00:01:17.180> started

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
the seesaw but the wheels started

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.820 
the seesaw but the wheels started
slipping<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.050> it<00:01:18.170> wasn't<00:01:18.320> making<00:01:18.650> progress

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
slipping and it wasn't making progress

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.530 
slipping and it wasn't making progress
it<00:01:19.160> was<00:01:19.310> moving<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.760> wheels<00:01:19.940> but<00:01:20.210> it<00:01:20.330> didn't

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
it was moving the wheels but it didn't

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.630 
it was moving the wheels but it didn't
go<00:01:20.660> anywhere<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.620> like<00:01:21.860> we<00:01:22.070> were<00:01:22.220> all<00:01:22.400> watching

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
go anywhere so like we were all watching

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.150 
go anywhere so like we were all watching
this<00:01:23.060> scene<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:24.050> know<00:01:24.170> cheering<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.800> robot

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
this scene you know cheering the robot

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.010 
this scene you know cheering the robot
on<00:01:25.400> especially<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.120> team<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.510> built<00:01:26.690> it<00:01:26.810> of

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
on especially the team that built it of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.160 
on especially the team that built it of
course<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:28.120> then<00:01:29.120> suddenly<00:01:29.390> out<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:29.930> nowhere

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
course and then suddenly out of nowhere

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.980 
course and then suddenly out of nowhere
there<00:01:30.710> was<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.830> fly<00:01:31.250> coming<00:01:32.060> down<00:01:32.300> descending

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
there was a fly coming down descending

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.580 
there was a fly coming down descending
right<00:01:33.530> next<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.520> robot<00:01:34.930> on<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.170> seesaw

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
right next to the robot on the seesaw

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.000 
right next to the robot on the seesaw
and<00:01:36.860> it<00:01:37.580> started<00:01:37.910> walking<00:01:38.270> upwards<00:01:39.010> beating

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
and it started walking upwards beating

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.400 
and it started walking upwards beating
before<00:01:40.520> what<00:01:40.760> people<00:01:41.570> started<00:01:41.840> cheering<00:01:42.110> for

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
before what people started cheering for

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.760 
before what people started cheering for
the<00:01:42.500> fly<00:01:42.680> obviously<00:01:43.400> and<00:01:43.900> then<00:01:44.900> for<00:01:45.620> some

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
the fly obviously and then for some

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.740 
the fly obviously and then for some
reason<00:01:45.800> or<00:01:46.250> other<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.700> robot<00:01:46.970> started<00:01:47.330> moving

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
reason or other the robot started moving

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.360 
reason or other the robot started moving
and<00:01:47.900> it<00:01:48.560> came<00:01:48.770> on<00:01:48.800> top<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.900> board

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
and it came on top and so the board

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.399 
and it came on top and so the board
flopped<00:01:52.370> and<00:01:52.580> then<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.540> paths<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.080> fly

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
flopped and then the paths of the fly

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.920 
flopped and then the paths of the fly
and<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.740> robot<00:01:55.300> started<00:01:56.300> merging<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:56.780> was

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
and the robot started merging it was

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.410 
and the robot started merging it was
almost<00:01:57.200> like<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.560> robot<00:01:57.860> was<00:01:57.980> trying<00:01:58.250> to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
almost like the robot was trying to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.080 
almost like the robot was trying to
drive<00:01:59.420> take<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.960> revenge<00:02:00.440> if<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.830> like<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.310> so

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
drive take a revenge if you like and so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.360 
drive take a revenge if you like and so
people<00:02:02.300> were<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.600> little<00:02:02.960> bit<00:02:03.140> afraid<00:02:03.409> well<00:02:04.010> if

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
people were a little bit afraid well if

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.340 
people were a little bit afraid well if
I<00:02:04.550> came<00:02:04.820> out<00:02:04.970> all<00:02:05.150> right<00:02:05.360> etc<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:05.930> everybody

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
I came out all right etc and everybody

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.469 
I came out all right etc and everybody
was<00:02:06.500> laughing<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:06.979> was<00:02:07.100> very<00:02:07.340> very<00:02:07.640> nice<00:02:07.909> scene

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
was laughing it was very very nice scene

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.869 
was laughing it was very very nice scene
actually<00:02:08.810> but<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.590> started<00:02:10.099> thinking<00:02:10.159> at<00:02:10.789> that

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
actually but I started thinking at that

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.010 
actually but I started thinking at that
particular<00:02:11.180> moment<00:02:12.489> in<00:02:13.489> all<00:02:13.790> these<00:02:13.969> years

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
particular moment in all these years

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.400 
particular moment in all these years
that<00:02:15.200> I've<00:02:15.380> been<00:02:15.410> teaching<00:02:15.770> at<00:02:16.130> class<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:18.170> have

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
that I've been teaching at class we have

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.410 
that I've been teaching at class we have
never<00:02:18.770> made<00:02:19.130> my<00:02:19.400> colleagues<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.880> students<00:02:20.270> we

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
never made my colleagues to students we

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.600 
never made my colleagues to students we
have<00:02:20.570> never<00:02:20.840> ever<00:02:21.140> thought<00:02:21.560> about<00:02:22.160> what<00:02:22.490> would

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
have never ever thought about what would

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.050 
have never ever thought about what would
happen<00:02:22.910> if<00:02:23.600> suddenly<00:02:24.080> an<00:02:24.350> other<00:02:24.560> agent<00:02:25.160> would

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
happen if suddenly an other agent would

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.680 
happen if suddenly an other agent would
appear<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.690> scene<00:02:27.190> uninvited<00:02:28.570> we<00:02:29.570> are

appear on the scene uninvited we are

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.110 
appear on the scene uninvited we are
thinking<00:02:30.020> about<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.290> robot<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:31.460> are<00:02:31.640> thinking

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
thinking about a robot we are thinking

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.620 
thinking about a robot we are thinking
about<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:33.560> tasks<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.190> how<00:02:34.400> they<00:02:34.580> match<00:02:34.820> but

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
about the tasks and how they match but

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.090 
about the tasks and how they match but
we<00:02:35.780> never<00:02:35.990> ever<00:02:36.050> thought<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.770> know<00:02:36.890> what

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
we never ever thought you know what

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.940 
we never ever thought you know what
would<00:02:37.310> happen<00:02:37.550> if<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.510> fly<00:02:38.840> would<00:02:38.900> join<00:02:39.560> in<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
would happen if a fly would join in the

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.580 
would happen if a fly would join in the
game<00:02:40.630> let<00:02:41.630> me<00:02:41.720> explain<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.200> why<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.440> is

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
homes when we grow older to be

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.000 
homes when we grow older to be
independent<00:03:17.990> for<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.170> prolonged<00:03:18.560> period<00:03:18.650> of

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
these robots what if something

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.590 
these robots what if something
unexpected<00:03:27.200> happens<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.940> mind<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.330> my

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
designed it for and this is not always

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.390 
designed it for and this is not always
because<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.260> complexity<00:04:21.799> of<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.010> robot

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
because of the complexity of the robot

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.240 
because of the complexity of the robot
but<00:04:22.750> because<00:04:23.750> of<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.960> complexity<00:04:24.590> of<00:04:24.770> the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
but because of the complexity of the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.510 
but because of the complexity of the
environment<00:04:26.030> the

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
environment the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.270 
environment the
operating<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.750> world<00:04:27.990> as<00:04:28.379> we<00:04:28.620> all<00:04:28.800> know<00:04:29.009> is

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
operating in the world as we all know is

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.170 
operating in the world as we all know is
a<00:04:29.340> dynamic<00:04:29.940> place<00:04:30.289> in<00:04:31.490> households<00:04:32.490> there's

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
a dynamic place in households there's

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.619 
a dynamic place in households there's
not<00:04:33.419> just<00:04:33.690> me<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.590> owner<00:04:35.270> but<00:04:36.270> there<00:04:36.449> will<00:04:36.569> be

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:36.629 
not just me the owner but there will be

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.999 
not just me the owner but there will be
cats<00:04:37.409> and<00:04:37.800> dogs<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.940> children<00:04:39.629> and<00:04:40.050> visitors

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
cats and dogs and children and visitors

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.010 
cats and dogs and children and visitors
and<00:04:41.190> they<00:04:41.639> will<00:04:41.789> all<00:04:42.030> be<00:04:42.060> interacting<00:04:42.840> and

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
and they will all be interacting and

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.279 
and they will all be interacting and
that<00:04:43.919> will<00:04:44.159> be<00:04:44.280> unpredictable<00:04:45.050> let<00:04:46.050> me<00:04:46.110> give

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
that will be unpredictable let me give

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.830 
that will be unpredictable let me give
you<00:04:46.440> an<00:04:46.560> example<00:04:46.919> there<00:04:47.550> is<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.659> robot<00:04:48.659> now

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
you an example there is a robot now

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.600 
you an example there is a robot now
that's<00:04:49.050> being<00:04:49.199> used<00:04:49.409> in<00:04:49.620> lots<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.949> households

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
that's being used in lots of households

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.210 
that's being used in lots of households
the<00:04:51.270> Roomba<00:04:51.720> basically<00:04:52.319> it's<00:04:52.470> just<00:04:52.650> cleaning

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
the Roomba basically it's just cleaning

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.170 
the Roomba basically it's just cleaning
robots<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:54.680> it's<00:04:55.680> actually<00:04:56.129> moving<00:04:56.940> around

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
robots and it's actually moving around

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.149 
robots and it's actually moving around
on<00:04:57.509> the<00:04:57.539> floor<00:04:57.870> at<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.169> very<00:04:58.349> low<00:04:58.590> speed<00:04:58.919> it's

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
on the floor at the very low speed it's

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.550 
on the floor at the very low speed it's
a<00:04:59.280> very<00:04:59.490> simple<00:04:59.849> system<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.330> it's<00:05:00.930> collecting

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
a very simple system and it's collecting

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
a very simple system and it's collecting
dust<00:05:03.050> let's<00:05:04.050> take<00:05:04.319> a<00:05:04.409> look<00:05:04.590> at<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.770> brief<00:05:05.310> movie

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
dust let's take a look at a brief movie

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:14.440 
dust let's take a look at a brief movie
clip<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.090> see<00:05:06.240> what<00:05:06.449> can<00:05:06.690> happen

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:36.580 

whoo<00:05:15.310> get<00:05:16.310> out<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.850> way

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.480 

poor<00:05:37.590> dog<00:05:38.340> right<00:05:38.940> I<00:05:39.330> mean<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.410> motorized<00:05:41.070> cats

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
poor dog right I mean a motorized cats

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.950 
poor dog right I mean a motorized cats
what<00:05:41.850> can<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.120> do<00:05:44.210> but<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.330> problem<00:05:45.510> of

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
what can you do but the problem of

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.080 
what can you do but the problem of
course<00:05:46.320> is<00:05:46.500> that<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:47.280> people<00:05:47.580> building<00:05:47.790> that

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
course is that the people building that

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.080 
course is that the people building that
Roomba<00:05:48.650> thought<00:05:49.650> about<00:05:49.950> everything<00:05:50.340> they

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
Roomba thought about everything they

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.040 
Roomba thought about everything they
know<00:05:51.360> this<00:05:51.630> Roomba<00:05:52.110> inside<00:05:53.070> out<00:05:53.450> but<00:05:54.450> nobody

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
know this Roomba inside out but nobody

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.870 
know this Roomba inside out but nobody
ever<00:05:55.350> thought<00:05:55.800> or<00:05:56.100> could<00:05:56.430> have<00:05:56.639> thought<00:05:56.820> about

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
ever thought or could have thought about

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.000 
ever thought or could have thought about
what<00:05:57.150> will<00:05:57.570> happen<00:05:57.600> if<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.200> cat<00:05:58.410> uses<00:05:58.860> the

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
what will happen if a cat uses the

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.550 
what will happen if a cat uses the
Roomba<00:05:59.340> as<00:05:59.520> a<00:05:59.550> tank<00:05:59.940> in<00:06:00.510> order<00:06:00.870> to<00:06:01.139> attack<00:06:01.410> it

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
Roomba as a tank in order to attack it

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.270 
Roomba as a tank in order to attack it
all<00:06:03.830> and<00:06:05.270> this<00:06:06.270> is<00:06:06.330> our<00:06:06.600> problem<00:06:07.280> because

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
all and this is our problem because

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.180 
all and this is our problem because
legally<00:06:08.910> we<00:06:09.570> have<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:10.020> take<00:06:10.260> proper<00:06:10.710> care<00:06:10.740> and

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
legally we have to take proper care and

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.580 
legally we have to take proper care and
foreseeing<00:06:11.760> unintended<00:06:12.660> consequences<00:06:13.440> of

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
foreseeing unintended consequences of

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.340 
foreseeing unintended consequences of
our<00:06:13.710> products<00:06:14.130> we<00:06:14.280> as<00:06:14.550> robot<00:06:14.880> assists<00:06:15.300> so<00:06:16.169> what

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
our products we as robot assists so what

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.969 
our products we as robot assists so what
we<00:06:16.500> do

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
we do

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.150 
we do
in<00:06:17.220> order<00:06:17.550> to<00:06:17.580> address<00:06:17.880> this<00:06:18.120> problem<00:06:18.300> I

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
in order to address this problem I

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.100 
in order to address this problem I
cannot<00:06:20.160> see<00:06:20.370> only<00:06:20.520> one<00:06:20.850> solution<00:06:21.419> and<00:06:21.540> that's

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
cannot see only one solution and that's

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.580 
cannot see only one solution and that's
basically<00:06:22.590> giving<00:06:22.979> robots<00:06:23.370> the<00:06:23.550> capacity<00:06:24.180> to

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
basically giving robots the capacity to

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.040 
basically giving robots the capacity to
assess<00:06:25.590> certain<00:06:25.860> situations<00:06:26.700> to<00:06:27.050> assess

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
assess certain situations to assess

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.460 
assess certain situations to assess
their<00:06:28.229> own<00:06:28.520> capabilities<00:06:29.520> and<00:06:29.880> then<00:06:30.690> think<00:06:31.139> I

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
their own capabilities and then think I

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.740 
their own capabilities and then think I
should<00:06:32.370> not<00:06:32.550> be<00:06:32.580> trusted<00:06:33.210> doing<00:06:33.570> this<00:06:33.780> now<00:06:34.440> I

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
should not be trusted doing this now I

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.200 
should not be trusted doing this now I
can<00:06:36.750> hand<00:06:37.740> over<00:06:38.070> a<00:06:38.100> cup<00:06:38.340> of<00:06:38.370> coffee<00:06:38.490> to

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
can hand over a cup of coffee to

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.719 
can hand over a cup of coffee to
something<00:06:39.660> to<00:06:39.990> someone<00:06:40.200> okay<00:06:40.800> this<00:06:41.430> is<00:06:41.550> not<00:06:41.669> a

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
something to someone okay this is not a

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.670 
something to someone okay this is not a
problem<00:06:41.940> and<00:06:42.390> we've<00:06:42.810> all<00:06:43.050> done<00:06:43.289> this<00:06:43.410> many

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
problem and we've all done this many

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.610 
problem and we've all done this many
times<00:06:43.860> thousands<00:06:44.700> of<00:06:44.820> times<00:06:45.030> etc<00:06:45.440> but<00:06:46.440> when

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
times thousands of times etc but when

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.380 
times thousands of times etc but when
that<00:06:46.800> person<00:06:47.220> that<00:06:47.340> I'm<00:06:47.490> giving<00:06:47.850> as<00:06:47.970> a<00:06:48.000> robot

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
that person that I'm giving as a robot

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.630 
that person that I'm giving as a robot
giving<00:06:48.780> the<00:06:48.900> cup<00:06:49.080> of<00:06:49.229> coffee<00:06:49.470> to<00:06:49.770> holds<00:06:50.520> out

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
giving the cup of coffee to holds out

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.080 
giving the cup of coffee to holds out
its<00:06:50.850> hand<00:06:51.060> right<00:06:51.330> on<00:06:51.570> top<00:06:51.810> of<00:06:51.960> his<00:06:52.169> laptop<00:06:53.090> then

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
its hand right on top of his laptop then

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.940 
its hand right on top of his laptop then
I<00:06:54.120> shouldn't<00:06:54.450> take<00:06:54.750> the<00:06:54.900> risk<00:06:55.080> because<00:06:55.680> I<00:06:55.770> can

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
I shouldn't take the risk because I can

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.520 
I shouldn't take the risk because I can
be<00:06:56.039> trusted<00:06:56.490> but<00:06:57.270> not<00:06:57.510> a<00:06:57.539> thousand<00:06:58.140> out<00:06:58.260> of<00:06:58.410> a
