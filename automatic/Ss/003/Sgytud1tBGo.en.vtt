 just take a look in this the main building 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.310
 have to propose 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.170
 and where does that brand of daman I have 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.210
 14 fps 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.580
 16 on an app and here is yes the edge 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.640

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.860
 f look 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.970
 holy shit looks nice when in the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.820
 being completed 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.070
 because hotel and that is not entirely true 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.450
 but let's go to the most important 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.480
 portion of that of the jacket, of course, 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.920
 capital that has changed a lot and 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.000
 Immediately you will not return if you already have 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.990
 would not have been in a while 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.920
 you really don't recognize that fool anymore 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.800
 back 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.190
 he is so bold ordinary i was in a hurry 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.110
 with something that guts comes from guys 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.700
 because I have this on communitycraft 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.220
 not this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.530
 well on inch ran away 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.540
 ok it will be again 30 fps it came 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.740
 I think therefore you I had it just right 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.450
 no but here is the capital it is 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.070
 What you notice is that we have new walls 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.670
 have that grain or ff away 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.620
 should 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.470
 that looks delicious so we have 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.590
 now we walls much firmer much much 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.270
 we are better at defending ourselves 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.180
 once defended it but 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.920
 that was a bit of a shooting 2 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.180
 minutes it went with a beep beep 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.470
 out and then we inside one 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.209
 15 minutes 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.550
 to the man team or what they covered 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.510
 baby killed and yes was already doing 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.310
 has with 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.790
 Stimuli have not really been used 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.010
 nothing herein to states way 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.480
 come with combi hammer f so you too 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.860
 I know I have an empire because I have that 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.550
 never normally issued under me but 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.470
 so have an empire wall handy in it 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.310
 especially the wars ran handy to 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.290
 ships there we go oh city so see 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.760
 you notice immediately and different kind 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.980
 port is much more convenient to 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.440
 to defend 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.650
 and it is also just much chiller 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.410
 passes there of course we can hit 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.340
 very handy when we have the stew 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.440
 enter 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.300
 you will be the first to enter another cave 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.880
 and sitting there is very cyrus is very much 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.030
 gives shine in levels yeti is that one 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.460
 super big statue if she could if you 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.350
 late come on 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:53.240
 and expected by late which became a 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.170
 so here is our span this is one 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.170
 become a statue 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.620
 yes it is still a house i have 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.380

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.740
 we don't know for sure 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.510
 I will have to ask who was in the future 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.730

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.270
 make them come over this but 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:57.509

 Deep all around here is our bridge then 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.039
 really such 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:19.369
 dilapidated bridge it now looks different 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.369
 from 

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:24.749

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.219

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:42.269
 to wait 

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:44.759
 so here we have some or so 

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:47.189
 big raise in the corner and there 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.199
 They have set up a few houses 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:51.119

 and now there is 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.010
 and number of houses I think this is still 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.610
 I assume not furnished 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.230
 and a little bit it will be like 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.270
