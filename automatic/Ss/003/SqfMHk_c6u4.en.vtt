00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
hashtag that was on Twitter I think was

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.480 
hashtag that was on Twitter I think was
like<00:01:31.520> divas<00:01:32.240> what<00:01:32.570> was<00:01:32.689> it<00:01:33.130> gif<00:01:34.130> divas<00:01:34.460> a

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
change how do you feel about I guess the

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.179 
change how do you feel about I guess the
difference<00:01:38.090> between<00:01:38.689> how<00:01:38.990> NHD<00:01:39.439> is<00:01:39.710> given

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
difference between how NHD is given

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.010 
difference between how NHD is given
divas<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:40.549> lot<00:01:40.670> more<00:01:40.819> time<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.329> as<00:01:41.659> opposed<00:01:41.929> to

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
divas a lot more time and as opposed to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.899 
divas a lot more time and as opposed to
like<00:01:42.170> raw<00:01:42.380> where<00:01:42.619> I<00:01:42.679> feel<00:01:42.829> like<00:01:42.979> it's<00:01:43.159> it's

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
like raw where I feel like it's it's

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.320 
like raw where I feel like it's it's
really<00:01:44.299> a<00:01:44.569> lot<00:01:44.780> more<00:01:45.110> story<00:01:46.090> storyline<00:01:47.090> based

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
really a lot more story storyline based

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.990 
really a lot more story storyline based
and<00:01:47.689> not<00:01:47.780> necessarily<00:01:48.530> match<00:01:48.799> based<00:01:49.130> you<00:01:49.939> know

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
and not necessarily match based you know

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.760 
and not necessarily match based you know
I<00:01:50.090> really<00:01:50.539> think<00:01:50.750> like<00:01:51.020> now's<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.500> time<00:01:51.709> for

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
I really think like now's the time for

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.100 
I really think like now's the time for
the<00:01:52.009> Divas<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.549> mean<00:01:52.759> obviously<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.929> fans
