in battlefield 1943 which was

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.580 
in battlefield 1943 which was
coincidentally<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:36.000> first<00:00:36.329> battlefield<00:00:36.930> game

X<00:00:40.260> very<00:00:40.590> similar<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.250> here

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
X very similar to this one here

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
X very similar to this one here
basically<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.329> enter<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> bunker<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
basically you enter a bunker in and you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.180 
basically you enter a bunker in and you
callin<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.450> bomber<00:00:45.750> aircraft<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.500> bham<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
callin a bomber aircraft in bham like a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.069 
callin a bomber aircraft in bham like a
part<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> map<00:00:47.730> which<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.059> very<00:00:48.600> simple<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
part of the map which is very simple and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.110 
part of the map which is very simple and
in<00:00:49.200> battlefield<00:00:49.770> 4<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.129> works<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.550> exact<00:00:50.850> same

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
in battlefield 4 it works the exact same

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.470 
in battlefield 4 it works the exact same
way<00:00:51.390> now<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.550> bomber<00:00:53.789> aircraft<00:00:54.059> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
way now to get the bomber aircraft you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.029 
way now to get the bomber aircraft you
have<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.870> capture<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.320> flag<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.770> use<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
have to capture the flag and use you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.090 
have to capture the flag and use you
that<00:00:56.219> flag<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:57.300> conquest<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.649> D<00:00:58.800> flag

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that flag in on conquest it's the D flag

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.029 
that flag in on conquest it's the D flag
and<00:00:59.340> you<00:01:00.329> capture<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.960> flag<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.620> you'll

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and you capture the flag and then you'll

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.850 
and you capture the flag and then you'll
be<00:01:02.280> able<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.640> enter<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.420> bunker<00:01:04.199> while<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
zone to kill people now the bomber it's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.990 
zone to kill people now the bomber it's
very<00:01:33.780> simple<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> work<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.250> aim<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.790> has

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
very simple to work it's you aim it has

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.210 
very simple to work it's you aim it has
like<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.590> interesting<00:01:37.590> reticle<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.040> would

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
like this interesting reticle I would

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.350 
like this interesting reticle I would
have<00:01:38.310> chose<00:01:38.490> maybe<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.790> different<00:01:39.000> reticle

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
have chose maybe a different reticle

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.910 
have chose maybe a different reticle
because<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:39.659> very<00:01:40.020> similar<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
because it's very similar to like a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.280 
because it's very similar to like a
Heatseeker<00:01:41.549> kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.540> missile<00:01:42.930> reticle

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
Heatseeker kind of like missile reticle

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.139 
Heatseeker kind of like missile reticle
I<00:01:43.320> which<00:01:43.500> should<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.799> more<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.490> don't

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
I which should be more of like I don't

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.429 
I which should be more of like I don't
know<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.600> weird<00:01:45.689> radical<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.320> my

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
know this is a weird radical in my

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.740 
know this is a weird radical in my
opinion<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.670> use<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:47.939> reticle<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.630> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
opinion but you use that reticle and you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.190 
opinion but you use that reticle and you
aim<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:50.009> jayden<00:01:50.640> bombs<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.869> certain

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
aim like for jayden bombs at a certain

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.960 
aim like for jayden bombs at a certain
location<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.799> could<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:52.920> i'd<00:01:53.220> say<00:01:53.399> vehicles

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
location so it could be i'd say vehicles

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.319 
location so it could be i'd say vehicles
enemies<00:01:54.899> flags<00:01:55.619> whatever<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:57.119> aim<00:01:57.299> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
enemies flags whatever and you aim it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.810 
enemies flags whatever and you aim it
there<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.530> missiles<00:01:59.009> actually<00:01:59.640> they're

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
there now the missiles actually they're

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.810 
there now the missiles actually they're
bombs<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.810> bombs<00:02:01.020> actually<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:02.070> little<00:02:02.640> bit

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
bombs the bombs actually go a little bit

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.700 
bombs the bombs actually go a little bit
slower<00:02:03.030> they<00:02:03.240> won't<00:02:03.420> instantly<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.320> shot<00:02:04.560> off

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
slower they won't instantly be shot off

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
slower they won't instantly be shot off
right<00:02:04.950> as<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.189> pick<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> targets<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.390> usually

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
right as you pick the targets it usually

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.930 
right as you pick the targets it usually
be<00:02:07.229> around<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.560> maybe<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:07.890> 56<00:02:08.489> seconds

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
be around like maybe like 56 seconds

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.600 
be around like maybe like 56 seconds
before<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.929> bombs<00:02:10.770> are<00:02:10.920> actually<00:02:11.220> launching

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
before the bombs are actually launching

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.700 
before the bombs are actually launching
and<00:02:11.760> they'll<00:02:11.910> go<00:02:12.150> tour

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
and they'll go tour

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.310 
and they'll go tour
sir<00:02:12.830> target<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.430> hit<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.880> they're<00:02:14.840> pretty

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
sir target and hit and they're pretty

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.350 
sir target and hit and they're pretty
powerful<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.430> their<00:02:16.670> own<00:02:16.790> way<00:02:17.000> against

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
powerful in their own way against

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.420 
powerful in their own way against
vehicles<00:02:17.780> they<00:02:17.900> are<00:02:17.990> very<00:02:18.230> good<00:02:18.470> usually<00:02:19.220> two

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
vehicles they are very good usually two

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.880 
vehicles they are very good usually two
to<00:02:19.460> three<00:02:19.880> JDAM<00:02:20.660> bombs<00:02:20.990> will<00:02:21.320> destroy<00:02:21.680> like<00:02:21.860> a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
to three JDAM bombs will destroy like a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.710 
to three JDAM bombs will destroy like a
tank<00:02:22.160> or<00:02:22.340> something<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.910> if<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.510> could

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
tank or something and if you could

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.790 
tank or something and if you could
accurately<00:02:24.650> land<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.640> jdam<00:02:26.000> bomb<00:02:26.210> onto<00:02:26.770> like<00:02:27.770> a

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
accurately land a jdam bomb onto like a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.560 
accurately land a jdam bomb onto like a
player<00:02:28.220> or<00:02:28.460> like<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.580> recon<00:02:29.060> that's<00:02:29.330> like<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.540> a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
player or like a recon that's like on a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.210 
player or like a recon that's like on a
mountain<00:02:29.900> or<00:02:29.960> something<00:02:30.020> you'll<00:02:30.890> be<00:02:31.070> able<00:02:31.130> to

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
mountain or something you'll be able to

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.680 
mountain or something you'll be able to
kill<00:02:31.370> them<00:02:31.490> in<00:02:31.610> like<00:02:31.730> one<00:02:32.000> bomb<00:02:32.360> which<00:02:32.540> is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
kill them in like one bomb which is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.670 
kill them in like one bomb which is
pretty<00:02:32.870> good<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.820> that's<00:02:34.820> pretty<00:02:35.090> much<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
pretty good so that's pretty much it the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.040 
pretty good so that's pretty much it the
bombs<00:02:36.950> they<00:02:37.340> go<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.270> they<00:02:38.600> go<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.780> weird

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
bombs they go like they go to weird

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.650 
bombs they go like they go to weird
angles<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:39.740> it's<00:02:40.280> pretty<00:02:40.640> easy<00:02:40.760> for<00:02:41.180> some<00:02:41.360> like

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
angles so it's pretty easy for some like

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.270 
angles so it's pretty easy for some like
enemies<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.320> say<00:02:42.500> hidebound<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.980> mountain

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
enemies to like say hidebound a mountain

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.740 
enemies to like say hidebound a mountain
or<00:02:43.370> something<00:02:43.700> like<00:02:43.790> dragons<00:02:44.240> pass<00:02:44.450> it's<00:02:44.720> a

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
or something like dragons pass it's a

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.380 
or something like dragons pass it's a
pretty<00:02:44.960> hard<00:02:45.680> map<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.160> use<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.790> bomb<00:02:47.150> Iran

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
pretty hard map to use the bomb Iran

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.590 
pretty hard map to use the bomb Iran
because<00:02:47.600> those<00:02:48.260> huge<00:02:48.800> egg<00:02:49.310> mountains<00:02:50.270> and

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
because those huge egg mountains and

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.270 
because those huge egg mountains and
everything<00:02:50.990> can<00:02:51.170> make<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.680> really<00:02:51.860> hard<00:02:51.890> but

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
everything can make it really hard but

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.130 
everything can make it really hard but
if<00:02:52.520> say<00:02:53.090> people<00:02:53.300> are<00:02:53.390> out<00:02:53.510> in<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.660> open<00:02:53.840> it's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
if say people are out in the open it's

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.530 
if say people are out in the open it's
pretty<00:02:54.350> easy<00:02:54.560> especially<00:02:54.770> like<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.460> said<00:02:55.700> tanks

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
pretty easy especially like I said tanks

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.800 
pretty easy especially like I said tanks
um<00:02:57.100> anti-air<00:02:58.100> like<00:02:58.760> la<00:02:59.030> veas<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.510> stuff<00:02:59.690> like

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
um anti-air like la veas and stuff like

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.120 
um anti-air like la veas and stuff like
those<00:03:00.020> are<00:03:00.140> pretty<00:03:00.290> easy<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.680> get<00:03:00.800> cuz<00:03:00.980> usually

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
those are pretty easy to get cuz usually

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.700 
those are pretty easy to get cuz usually
they<00:03:02.000> are<00:03:02.150> pretty<00:03:02.420> stationary<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.530> could

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
they are pretty stationary and you could

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.050 
they are pretty stationary and you could
easily<00:03:04.100> take<00:03:04.430> them<00:03:04.610> out<00:03:04.700> because<00:03:04.820> they're

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
easily take them out because they're

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.510 
easily take them out because they're
like<00:03:05.540> not<00:03:05.810> going<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.050> move<00:03:06.170> pretty<00:03:06.470> much<00:03:06.680> now

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
like not going to move pretty much now

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.580 
like not going to move pretty much now
you<00:03:07.580> can<00:03:07.850> also<00:03:07.940> get<00:03:08.150> new<00:03:08.390> attachments<00:03:09.230> with

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
you can also get new attachments with

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.000 
you can also get new attachments with
the<00:03:10.330> what<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.570> bomber<00:03:12.140> with<00:03:12.650> like

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
the what is it the bomber with like

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.860 
the what is it the bomber with like
basically<00:03:13.310> if<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.550> get<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:14.030> think<00:03:14.300> it's<00:03:14.420> 15

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
basically if you get I think it's 15

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.230 
basically if you get I think it's 15
kills<00:03:15.200> it's<00:03:15.590> an<00:03:15.740> assignment<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.580> get<00:03:16.730> 15

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
kills it's an assignment you get 15

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.690 
kills it's an assignment you get 15
kills<00:03:17.540> with<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.870> bomber<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:19.100> destroy<00:03:19.670> a

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
kills with the bomber and you destroy a

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.670 
kills with the bomber and you destroy a
bomber<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.180> actually<00:03:20.390> get<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.750> cruise<00:03:21.290> missile

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
bomber you actually get a cruise missile

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.400 
bomber you actually get a cruise missile
now<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.070> haven't<00:03:23.060> been<00:03:23.450> able<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.900> unlock<00:03:24.230> this

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
now I haven't been able to unlock this

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.500 
now I haven't been able to unlock this
yet<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:25.190> should<00:03:25.700> have<00:03:25.790> probably<00:03:25.910> unlocked<00:03:26.270> it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
yet I should have probably unlocked it

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.540 
yet I should have probably unlocked it
but<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.440> cruise<00:03:27.770> missile<00:03:28.100> i'm<00:03:28.190> assuming

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
but the cruise missile i'm assuming

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.970 
but the cruise missile i'm assuming
works<00:03:29.090> very<00:03:29.330> similar<00:03:29.600> to<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.980> commander

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
works very similar to the commander

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.080 
works very similar to the commander
cruise<00:03:31.190> miss<00:03:31.370> i'm<00:03:31.520> not<00:03:31.670> sure<00:03:31.790> if<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:31.940> only

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
cruise miss i'm not sure if you only

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.640 
cruise miss i'm not sure if you only
have<00:03:32.240> like<00:03:32.360> one<00:03:32.390> or<00:03:32.960> if<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.110> like<00:03:33.140> for<00:03:33.560> like

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
have like one or if you like for like

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.920 
have like one or if you like for like
two<00:03:33.770> jdam<00:03:34.130> bombs<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.300> probably<00:03:35.600> looks

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
two jdam bombs but it probably looks

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.660 
two jdam bombs but it probably looks
really<00:03:36.320> like<00:03:36.470> works<00:03:37.130> pretty<00:03:37.340> powerful

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
really like works pretty powerful

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.160 
really like works pretty powerful
because<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.060> cruise<00:03:38.270> missile<00:03:38.660> when<00:03:39.050> your

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
because the cruise missile when your

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.900 
because the cruise missile when your
commander<00:03:39.650> if<00:03:39.830> I<00:03:40.070> mean<00:03:40.250> if<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.430> saw<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:40.880> my

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
commander if I mean if you saw it in my

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.750 
commander if I mean if you saw it in my
commander<00:03:41.690> double<00:03:41.990> tap<00:03:42.170> is<00:03:42.550> really<00:03:43.550> powerful

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
commander double tap is really powerful

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.210 
commander double tap is really powerful
so<00:03:44.210> probably<00:03:45.200> for<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.410> bomber<00:03:45.620> it's<00:03:45.860> just<00:03:46.100> as

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
so probably for the bomber it's just as

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.130 
so probably for the bomber it's just as
powerful<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:46.880> that's<00:03:47.390> pretty<00:03:47.600> good<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.110> UH

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
powerful so that's pretty good the UH

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.260 
powerful so that's pretty good the UH
another<00:03:49.130> thing<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.340> reload<00:03:49.610> time<00:03:49.640> for<00:03:50.120> the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
another thing the reload time for the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.900 
another thing the reload time for the
jdam<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.990> a<00:03:51.350> couple<00:03:52.130> seconds<00:03:52.490> it's<00:03:52.610> not<00:03:52.760> really

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
jdam is a couple seconds it's not really

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.940 
jdam is a couple seconds it's not really
it's<00:03:53.000> around<00:03:53.180> like<00:03:53.300> 13<00:03:53.660> seconds<00:03:54.050> or<00:03:54.140> so<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.590> you

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
it's around like 13 seconds or so so you

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.800 
it's around like 13 seconds or so so you
can<00:03:55.070> get<00:03:55.190> maybe<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.460> two<00:03:55.730> or<00:03:55.760> three<00:03:56.000> passes<00:03:56.510> with

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
can get maybe a two or three passes with

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.140 
can get maybe a two or three passes with
the<00:03:57.080> bomber<00:03:57.290> which<00:03:57.620> is<00:03:57.770> pretty<00:03:58.400> decent<00:03:58.610> so<00:03:59.090> you

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
the bomber which is pretty decent so you

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.030 
the bomber which is pretty decent so you
definitely<00:03:59.570> want<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.960> make<00:04:00.110> sure<00:04:00.140> you<00:04:00.380> hit<00:04:00.980> a

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
definitely want to make sure you hit a

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.500 
definitely want to make sure you hit a
good<00:04:01.340> amount<00:04:01.460> of<00:04:01.550> targets<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.000> aim<00:04:02.120> as<00:04:02.270> early

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
good amount of targets and aim as early

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.730 
good amount of targets and aim as early
as<00:04:02.570> possible<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.140> don't<00:04:03.320> want<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.590> like

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
as possible you don't want to like

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.380 
as possible you don't want to like
really<00:04:04.220> like<00:04:04.400> lose<00:04:04.610> half<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:04.970> time<00:04:05.180> table

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
really like lose half the time table

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.290 
really like lose half the time table
only<00:04:05.900> unload<00:04:06.380> one<00:04:06.920> payload<00:04:07.490> of<00:04:07.640> bombs<00:04:07.970> because

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
only unload one payload of bombs because

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.730 
only unload one payload of bombs because
then<00:04:08.660> you're<00:04:08.930> not<00:04:08.990> really<00:04:09.140> using<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.470> bomber

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
then you're not really using the bomber

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.920 
then you're not really using the bomber
to<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:09.980> full<00:04:10.250> advantage<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:10.820> always<00:04:11.240> do<00:04:11.660> that

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
to a full advantage so always do that

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.650 
to a full advantage so always do that
you<00:04:12.920> also<00:04:13.040> get<00:04:13.220> flares<00:04:13.520> with<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:13.880> too<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:14.330> you

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
you also get flares with it too so you

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
you also get flares with it too so you
don't<00:04:14.780> really<00:04:14.840> have<00:04:14.960> to<00:04:15.080> worry<00:04:15.140> about<00:04:15.380> save

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
don't really have to worry about save

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.170 
don't really have to worry about save
Jets<00:04:16.010> are<00:04:16.160> like<00:04:16.340> locking<00:04:16.609> on<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.150> you

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
Jets are like locking on to you you

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.170 
Jets are like locking on to you you
could<00:04:17.510> easily<00:04:17.930> like<00:04:18.859> get<00:04:19.370> rid<00:04:19.520> of<00:04:19.580> the<00:04:19.760> heat

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
could easily like get rid of the heat

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.640 
could easily like get rid of the heat
seekers<00:04:20.540> or<00:04:20.630> whatever's<00:04:20.960> locked<00:04:21.080> down<00:04:21.350> too<00:04:21.500> so

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
seekers or whatever's locked down too so

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.140 
seekers or whatever's locked down too so
that's<00:04:21.770> pretty<00:04:21.950> good<00:04:22.160> but<00:04:22.400> in<00:04:22.790> total<00:04:23.090> the

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
that's pretty good but in total the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.480 
that's pretty good but in total the
Bombers<00:04:23.510> a<00:04:23.690> pretty<00:04:24.350> fun<00:04:24.650> aircraft<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.340> would

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
Bombers a pretty fun aircraft I would

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.790 
Bombers a pretty fun aircraft I would
definitely

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
definitely

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.830 
definitely
say<00:04:25.949> try<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.729> out<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:26.970> mean<00:04:27.240> it's<00:04:27.419> not<00:04:27.569> going<00:04:27.750> to

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
say try it out I mean it's not going to

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.260 
say try it out I mean it's not going to
change<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:29.250> way<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.550> maps<00:04:29.759> going<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.030> work

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
change the way the maps going to work

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.089 
change the way the maps going to work
and<00:04:30.509> you're<00:04:30.810> instantly<00:04:30.990> gonna<00:04:31.409> push<00:04:31.949> the

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
and you're instantly gonna push the

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.980 
and you're instantly gonna push the
enemy<00:04:32.250> back<00:04:32.400> or<00:04:32.789> anything<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.360> just<00:04:33.629> it's<00:04:33.900> a

enemy back or anything it's just it's a

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.680 
enemy back or anything it's just it's a
fun<00:04:34.199> thing<00:04:34.229> to<00:04:34.409> use<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:34.919> say<00:04:35.099> if<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:36.210> don't<00:04:36.599> know

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
fun thing to use and say if I don't know

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.990 
fun thing to use and say if I don't know
like<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.080> enemy<00:04:37.289> team<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.590> taking<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:38.129> flag<00:04:38.460> you

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
like the enemy team is taking a flag you

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.520 
like the enemy team is taking a flag you
can<00:04:39.150> get<00:04:39.270> in<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.449> bomber<00:04:39.659> and<00:04:39.960> just<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.259> just

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
can get in the bomber and just you just

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
a flag and then your teammates can move

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.760 
a flag and then your teammates can move
in<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.419> recapture<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:49.020> flag<00:04:49.259> that's<00:04:49.470> pretty

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
in a recapture a flag that's pretty
