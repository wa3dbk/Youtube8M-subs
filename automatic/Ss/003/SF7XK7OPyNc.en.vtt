00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.620
 a round punch and a 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.500
 chestney punch you're going to have 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.990
 upstream wood those white paper or 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.140
 paper any other colors or sound 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.560
 fish and you're going to need that 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.319
 Parisian pocket is optional 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.829
 launch then it's very simple you 

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:11.740
 go take a tissue paper gold me 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:17.740
 looted goods ca combined send the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:24.219
 super nice so are you perforated 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:26.229
 in gently that you even this 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.639
 is quite tricky that can see the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.399
 scalloped to ensure that it is of 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:32.399
 Dogs as much cut out about bag 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.620
 you'll see it's super pretty 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.560
 true only for those who do not know 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.670
 it's still tendinitis and 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.070
 beautification because you have me 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.930
 asked especially with things that one has to 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.880
 the paper house either it's from the 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.850
 recover art do not hesitate to recover the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.470
 silk paper 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.560
 you will see it's super nice then 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.760
 once you've made your five little ones 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.960
 heads you are going to take in a 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.650
 round hole punch 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.260
 you will punch a small round of 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:27.100
 white paper or other color you go 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:28.870
 put the remaining 5 together 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.100
 go take a point are they gone 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.100
 make a hole in the middle 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:49.769
 I especially hope house slips between 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:53.060
 we suddenly I'm struggling to go 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.060
 take a little Parisian tie 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:06.420
 do not know a joke render because 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:15.409
 otherwise it does not always pretty good 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:18.359
 well, it's already going to give you this 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.280
 then you go through a hole in 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.810
 the middle of them if ever the map 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.030
 honest yes but here is a little too much 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.970
 great 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.889
 what you can do want to carve 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.120
 because that's only where I have 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.670
 finally jean-louis two fish too 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:40.590
 small you re- cut must she be 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:44.000
 still smaller than the flower 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.000
 did not make everything but good 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:58.489
 why are you making a hole also in 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:04:01.099
 the middle up or down like that it's 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.340
 done it's set to the drake removed all 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.989
 I put four ends and I have a house 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.730
 which are too long so I'm having trouble 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.349
 to use it what I actually had 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.879
 on the nails see it 's never seen 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.739
 that it was resting if it's still 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:23.930
 quite long and suddenly I have trouble 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:27.289
 take to take some isolated objects 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.810
 I'm not showing you I'm just ironing so 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:38.780
 then does he go into the little 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:40.039
 attaches his quarters in fact it's 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.789
 just to make a little support the 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.510
 cardboard then the flowers voice go 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.430
 built 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.770
 now you give texture 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.270
 so what I'm doing is here 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.070
 we shouted a little bit a little forget 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.200
 in every year with small flowers in 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.200
 party or black crumpled a word say 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.979
 this high done before that I wish you 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:33.849
 after you do not hesitate to give a little 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:35.139
 volume and that's you have a small 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.180
 flower that is made 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.550
 this house obviously what you 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.080
 can do too I'm scared I'm going 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.960
 to go it's like that natural could 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.199
 to spend a little bit in it can be 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.199
 friendly 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:06.789
 hop and that's it so it's so 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.229
 this is nice we can do 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.300
 so you can create 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.490
 big flowers so do not hesitate to 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.949
 use your big hole punch for 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.479
 realize these flowers did not think to use 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:20.770
 other shapes than round shapes 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:24.039
 if you feel like you can also 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.570
 create these same flowers with paper - 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:29.560
 a friend he had made in an I 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:31.630
 wanted to show with paper that little 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:37.680
 near the same if they know that the wound 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:39.610
 each big scallop was bent here 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.740
 what you can do anyway 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.349
 that with a scalloped perforator 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:51.099
 still great it's not me I had 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:51.880
 received we had received for the moment we were 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.789
 bigger 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.190
 I had received these here they are 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.780
 super nice if we do it these are the 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.630
 bigger in the year is no longer 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.510
 small if you want petals times 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.330
 more thickness do not hesitate to put 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.940
 no more tissue paper simply 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.860
 do not hesitate here I hope this 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.750
