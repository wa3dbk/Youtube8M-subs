00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.140
 ok so in fact there are going to be some 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.619
 boring stuff with the software comes from 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.480
 happen 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.619
 two things the first thing that's 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.640
 it's that I launched so I'm going 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.739
 put on the not loose thing on the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.690
 replay already I launched a game and the 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.809
 software crashed so that made me a 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.270
 wolf and second thing I launched a 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.359
 game jerry strings the game but it did not 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.289
 not at all rice ropes and neck being 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.350
 given that the game is still 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:52.179
 interesting it was a moment please I 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.120
 you order it as in replay as 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:59.379
 if it was live then actually 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.660
 I was in zvp so I chose 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.059
 so to make the strategy of the young and 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.510
 expand to change a little bit 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.049
 so the strategy of a lookout expand I 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.380
 precise there are two ways to do it 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.110
 it can be done with one gas 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.369
 it can be done with two gases and 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.750
 in this case I make them with gas 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.200
 so when we do with one gas we have 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.060
 the nexus earlier and a push timing 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.680
 possible faster with zealots and 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.110
 a little less center and when we do it 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.270
 with grass no longer has center there is 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.130
 here are the two are interesting there I 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.530
 do them with two boxes so the bo that 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.430
 I did it that was healed your 13th and 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.719
 double gas 15 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.979
 I accelerate a little bit so double gas 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:48.689
 15 to be able to actually m only two 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.960
 gas drones to optimize the balance 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.960
 mineral income on income would spin 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.360
 and be optimal to be able to 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.829
 ask the nexus and gates so that 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.740
 it's classic then I put the 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.570
 pylon at 16 and I'm going to pose the cyber 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.060
 body shine gates will be there and scout is 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.770
 behind so see for now in 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.119
 the vision I did not cost scuderia the 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.420
 cyber body because we are on a map 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.660
 two-player 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.980
 so there in drones and as soon as the cyber 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.870
 body will be worth theirs this one blue 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.730
 mother ship body the thing is that 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.300
 the opponent was gone on a bo type 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.830
 gas and that considering my timing of 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.790
 Scouts 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.950
 you will see that I'm not going 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.860
 be able to scout and because in fact there 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.690
 voluntarily leaves carling very fast 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.350
 and I did not want to lose the proof is 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.470
 so it's to prevent me from scouting 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.230
 gas intake behind that then 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.050
 normally a the third pylon that 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.750
 is there we put it there instead and in 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.549
 builds his gates from so on in 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.870
 the wall from the third pylon and 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.760
 no fourth 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.040
 there I made a small mistake I asked 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.140
 the third pylon here and I did the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.060
 gates from the fourth so there we have 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.080
 launched the mother ship body once 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.410
 that we have the drones to the mineral chaos to 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.060
 We put the drones back on 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.560
 gas drones to have 3 and 3 there 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.090
 must not forget is so there he tries 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.350
 a little pressure with zerling 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.720
 did not happen because I had a 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.420
 exit in addition he tried to have the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.220
 pilot is there so we do not interrupt the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.730
 prob production does not interrupt 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.160
 sentry production and one poses it's 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.930
 gates in the lobby so as to create a role 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.970
 with a single hole or in this case 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.410
 it was here therefore is can 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.090
 put a pylon or force fields for 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.130
 complete it and see that he is 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.109
 gone on an ultra cheesy thing that I 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.380
 did not have scouts at all and see I 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.150
 nothing seen but in itself in itself monbiot 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.820
 esafe since I have the hall that is 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.019
 completed in time so see it but the 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.810
 pressure I see that two hernias our 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.980
 beginnings on the other hand from the moment I 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.299
 see a lot bim forcefield 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:59.310
 open photo charge and there I am 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:01.620
 quiet ie that if he ever 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.659
 see there he continues to try to 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.790
 stuffed and ben I there I'm going to put a 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.250
 pylon to temporize and I would have to 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.530
 force fields if they ever grow 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.060
 still in addition it is necessary to remove recharge 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.639
 that does a lot of that he will have 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.650
 so the pylon game fa geforce son 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.870
 on it could stop him from 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.110
 the focus and for the pilot to get 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.210
 finish and so there you see my 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.310
 interest of the coup it was more out 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.680
 right away like onfray forced 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.530
 there who took face three bases there my 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.660
 interest was to wait a little bit 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.449
 since there he impaled I will not 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.250
 go out and get surrounded by masdar 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:46.410
 league by having little so I'm waiting so 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.160
 there in more it impales and I think 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.180
 they 3 and suddenly I kill everything 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.880
 there I launched a forge 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.440
 I threw my gas what 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.169
 actually allowed the blow to make a 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.190
 intermediate pressure with so there I 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.810
 chose to put pressure 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.400
 intermediate rather than doing it 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.710
 right away with some sentry the 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.270
 mother ship body and some zealots 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.250
 to wait a little bit launched the most in 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.650
 attack why because the zealots 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:17.880
 its hot touch the erling with the most in 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:19.830
 attack and so is taking the gas and 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.729
 so if they had ever pushed me back 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.010
 for a reason x 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.169
 so I could ricol with the energy of 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.389
 bad mothership body and go on 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.000
 a bo type 7 gates robot behind but 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.950
 see that he actually look at her 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.360
 number of drones he gave back as a 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.580
 pork and he had stayed very long 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.010
 behind he's always behind and in 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.539
 did I do that this pocket timing in 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:46.320
 knowing in fact that throughout 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:47.940
 phase the whole phase behind his 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.120
 pressure they were going to redo drones 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.010
 and that by the time I was about to arrive they 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.320
 were going to be typically in a phase 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.479
 where he was going to have redone a lot of 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.550
 drones meanwhile I would have done 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.160
 a lot of units and I knew he 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.570
 was going to have zero units or so 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.880
 if he ever had a lot 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.280
 of units when I was able to 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.310
 to savor that would have you I'm using 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:15.060
 ddd as long as I do not even know that 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:19.830
 would have meant that so his 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:22.380
 economy was slowed down he would not have 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.050
 did this drone so I would have been 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.460
 front of an economic point of view so 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.370
 push timing were needed 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.930
 precisely avoid one of the complex and 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.040
 so there the guy uninhibited on the 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.530
 number of drones because he did not have 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.270
 the choice and so I do the timing with 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.950
 sentry zealots because he had done 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.350
 a mass zerglings no need to stalker 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.600
 the joy of roach nokia most send 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.520
 who goes then the finish game all his slope 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.020
 so this is what I'm going to see 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.470
 p it's going to be stalker to fart 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.420
 roachs so lose my force fields from the 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.130
 slope more in attack that ends 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.560
 stack in time and there the opponent 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.600
 he just could not do anything because 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.230
 inevitably he ar drone is behind 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.160
 I had the sieve window stack that has 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.460
 allowed to punish him 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.740
 and so they tear up leave here I 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.920
 you admit it was more interesting 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.660
 in force nobody but little problem 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.750
 technique it's okay so 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:20.000
 now I'm going to launch the third 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:20.000
 part of those vod in zerg
