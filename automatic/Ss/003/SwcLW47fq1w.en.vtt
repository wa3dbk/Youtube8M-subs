00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
hi my name is Bjorn and this is a Yeti

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.190 
hi my name is Bjorn and this is a Yeti
tutorial<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.310> how<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.640> control<00:00:06.150> length<00:00:06.930> and

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
tutorial on how to control length and

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.860 
tutorial on how to control length and
density<00:00:07.529> using<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.280> texture<00:00:08.700> map

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.350 

and<00:00:12.710> I'm<00:00:12.950> going<00:00:13.100> to<00:00:13.160> save<00:00:13.400> this<00:00:13.520> out<00:00:13.730> as<00:00:13.940> a<00:00:13.970> tiff

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
and I'm going to save this out as a tiff

Yeti<00:00:16.100> doesn't<00:00:16.520> like<00:00:16.700> PNG<00:00:17.570> or<00:00:18.020> JPEG<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:20.770> this

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
Yeti doesn't like PNG or JPEG and this

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.380 
Yeti doesn't like PNG or JPEG and this
is<00:00:21.920> even<00:00:22.100> though<00:00:22.369> it's<00:00:22.550> only<00:00:22.700> supposed<00:00:23.300> to

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
is even though it's only supposed to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.589 
is even though it's only supposed to
look<00:00:23.510> at<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:23.779> RGB<00:00:23.930> channel<00:00:25.270> right<00:00:26.270> so<00:00:26.510> I'm

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
look at the RGB channel right so I'm

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.930 
look at the RGB channel right so I'm
just<00:00:26.750> gonna<00:00:26.840> hide<00:00:27.140> this<00:00:27.290> geometry<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:28.010> move

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
just gonna hide this geometry and move

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.400 
just gonna hide this geometry and move
on<00:00:29.090> to<00:00:29.210> his<00:00:29.330> chest<00:00:29.630> because<00:00:29.780> we're<00:00:30.080> gonna<00:00:30.170> give

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
on to his chest because we're gonna give

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.000 
on to his chest because we're gonna give
him<00:00:30.500> chest<00:00:30.800> hair<00:00:31.100> so<00:00:31.670> I<00:00:31.699> import<00:00:32.180> my<00:00:33.010> my

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
him chest hair so I import my my

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.540 
him chest hair so I import my my
geometry<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.540> create<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.500> texture<00:00:37.100> note<00:00:37.309> and

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
geometry and I create a texture note and

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.400 
geometry and I create a texture note and
in<00:00:38.210> this<00:00:38.360> station<00:00:38.690> what<00:00:38.840> I'm<00:00:38.930> going<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.170> load

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
in this station what I'm going to load

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.110 
in this station what I'm going to load
in<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.620> texture<00:00:40.100> that<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:40.280> just<00:00:40.489> saved<00:00:40.760> out<00:00:40.940> as

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
in the texture that I just saved out as

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.620 
in the texture that I just saved out as
a<00:00:41.150> tiff<00:00:42.550> next<00:00:43.550> thing<00:00:43.790> I<00:00:43.880> want<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.149> do<00:00:44.210> is<00:00:44.450> go<00:00:44.600> to

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
a tiff next thing I want to do is go to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.310 
a tiff next thing I want to do is go to
attributes<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.590> type<00:00:46.370> in<00:00:46.610> a<00:00:47.320> variable

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
attributes and type in a variable

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.160 
attributes and type in a variable
density<00:00:48.950> in<00:00:49.340> this<00:00:49.489> case<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.030> we'll<00:00:50.989> leave

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
density in this case and we'll leave

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.000 
density in this case and we'll leave
this<00:00:51.290> at<00:00:51.469> RGB<00:00:51.920> don't<00:00:52.910> forget<00:00:53.270> to<00:00:53.630> tell<00:00:54.620> Yeti

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
this at RGB don't forget to tell Yeti

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.459 
this at RGB don't forget to tell Yeti
about<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.090> V<00:00:56.270> coordinates<00:00:56.809> because<00:00:56.989> for<00:00:57.260> some

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
about the V coordinates because for some

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.850 
about the V coordinates because for some
reason<00:00:57.500> even<00:00:58.190> though<00:00:58.840> Yeti<00:00:59.840> is<00:01:00.020> a<00:01:00.050> plugin<00:01:00.469> for

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
reason even though Yeti is a plugin for

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.360 
reason even though Yeti is a plugin for
Maya

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
Maya

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.389 
Maya
it<00:01:01.850> still<00:01:02.239> doesn't<00:01:03.170> read<00:01:03.469> a<00:01:03.500> UV<00:01:03.890> map<00:01:04.039> the<00:01:04.190> same

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
it still doesn't read a UV map the same

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.880 
it still doesn't read a UV map the same
way<00:01:04.550> my<00:01:04.759> us<00:01:05.059> so<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:05.539> have<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.840> just<00:01:06.020> flip<00:01:06.500> the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
way my us so you have to just flip the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.930 
way my us so you have to just flip the
UV<00:01:07.369> or<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.509> V<00:01:08.660> chord<00:01:09.310> Donette

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.400 

next<00:01:13.940> I'm<00:01:14.030> gonna<00:01:14.119> make<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.360> scatter<00:01:14.750> node<00:01:15.160> and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
next I'm gonna make a scatter node and

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.249 
next I'm gonna make a scatter node and
activate<00:01:18.410> it<00:01:18.970> like<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.209> and<00:01:20.240> we<00:01:20.509> see<00:01:20.720> it's<00:01:20.929> the

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
activate it like so and we see it's the

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.340 
activate it like so and we see it's the
first<00:01:21.560> growing<00:01:22.690> exactly<00:01:23.690> where<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:23.899> painted

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
first growing exactly where I painted

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.040 
first growing exactly where I painted
now<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.860> area<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:25.670> painted<00:01:26.149> on<00:01:26.300> my<00:01:26.360> texture<00:01:26.899> map

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
now the area I painted on my texture map

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.550 
now the area I painted on my texture map
is<00:01:27.259> in<00:01:27.709> fact<00:01:27.920> on<00:01:28.069> his<00:01:28.220> chest<00:01:28.660> so<00:01:29.660> that<00:01:30.259> is<00:01:30.410> where

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
is in fact on his chest so that is where

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.580 
is in fact on his chest so that is where
we're<00:01:30.679> gonna<00:01:30.740> see<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.130> result

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
we're gonna see the result

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.440 
we're gonna see the result
so<00:01:33.590> obviously<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.310> lower<00:01:34.520> can't<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.300> lower

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
so obviously the lower can't the lower

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.160 
so obviously the lower can't the lower
value<00:01:35.959> black<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.220> no<00:01:37.819> no<00:01:38.119> density<00:01:38.450> nothing<00:01:38.990> and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
value black is no no density nothing and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.719 
value black is no no density nothing and
white<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:40.130> 100%<00:01:41.410> so<00:01:42.410> that<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:42.890> just<00:01:43.399> like<00:01:43.550> any

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
white is 100% so that is just like any

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.199 
white is 100% so that is just like any
other<00:01:43.880> alpha<00:01:45.160> so<00:01:46.160> if<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:46.399> render<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.819> out<00:01:46.940> we

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
other alpha so if we render it out we

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.480 
other alpha so if we render it out we
can<00:01:47.420> see<00:01:47.660> it<00:01:48.050> still<00:01:48.349> has<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.619> same<00:01:48.649> length<00:01:49.130> so

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
can see it still has the same length so

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.999 
can see it still has the same length so
we<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:49.729> control<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.240> length<00:01:50.509> too<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.380> we're

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
we can control the length too and we're

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.729 
we can control the length too and we're
just<00:01:52.160> going<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.369> add<00:01:52.490> another<00:01:53.259> texture<00:01:54.259> node

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:54.739 
just going to add another texture node

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.339 
just going to add another texture node
here<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.539> this<00:01:56.539> time<00:01:56.750> we're<00:01:56.869> gonna<00:01:56.929> load<00:01:57.229> in

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
here and this time we're gonna load in

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:58.389 
here and this time we're gonna load in
the<00:01:57.470> file<00:01:57.679> as<00:01:57.830> before

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
the file as before

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.080 
the file as before
and<00:01:58.670> we're<00:01:59.539> going<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.869> write<00:02:00.410> in<00:02:00.590> attributes

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
and we're going to write in attributes

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.880 
and we're going to write in attributes
length<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.899> don't<00:02:03.890> forget<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.429> change<00:02:04.640> the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
length and don't forget to change the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.779 
length and don't forget to change the
coordinate<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.399> UV<00:02:07.640> map<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:09.670> we're<00:02:10.670> just

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
coordinate of the UV map and we're just

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.640 
coordinate of the UV map and we're just
gonna<00:02:10.940> plug<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.780> there<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.290> listen<00:02:12.620> to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
gonna plug this in there and listen to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.830 
gonna plug this in there and listen to
outgrow<00:02:13.130> node<00:02:13.400> now<00:02:14.090> another<00:02:14.330> things<00:02:14.480> happened

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
outgrow node now another things happened

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.690 
outgrow node now another things happened
yet<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.349> we<00:02:15.440> need<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.650> go<00:02:15.739> into<00:02:15.860> our<00:02:16.099> grow<00:02:16.459> node

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
yet so we need to go into our grow node

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.540 
yet so we need to go into our grow node
and<00:02:16.940> as<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:18.020> hope<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.410> remember<00:02:18.560> we<00:02:19.010> just<00:02:19.250> typed

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
and as I hope you remember we just typed

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.069 
and as I hope you remember we just typed
in<00:02:19.730> length<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:21.459> texture<00:02:22.459> node<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.079> that

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
in length in the texture node and that

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.630 
in length in the texture node and that
is<00:02:24.290> what<00:02:24.469> we<00:02:24.590> want<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:24.890> put<00:02:25.040> into

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
is what we want to put into

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.290 
is what we want to put into
the<00:02:25.910> length<00:02:26.840> multiplier<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.060> grow<00:02:29.060> node

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
the length multiplier of the grow node

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.550 
the length multiplier of the grow node
so<00:02:29.660> type<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.380> dollar<00:02:30.920> sign<00:02:31.340> length<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.560> hit

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
so type in dollar sign length and hit

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.000 
so type in dollar sign length and hit
enter<00:02:33.950> whatever<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.490> want<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.730> hit<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.030> then

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
enter whatever you want to hit and then

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.420 
enter whatever you want to hit and then
you're<00:02:37.010> done<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.350> can<00:02:39.500> use<00:02:39.620> this<00:02:39.800> method

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
you're done and you can use this method

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.390 
you're done and you can use this method
for<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:41.120> kinds<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.950> whatever<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.190> want<00:02:43.280> to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
for all kinds of whatever you want to

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.430 
for all kinds of whatever you want to
control<00:02:43.730> basically<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.230> same

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
control basically it's the same

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.010 
control basically it's the same
principle<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.490> just<00:02:47.390> go<00:02:47.660> ahead<00:02:47.690> and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
principle so just go ahead and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.620 
principle so just go ahead and
experiment<00:02:48.350> with<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.390> wanna

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
experiment with that and if you wanna

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.540 
experiment with that and if you wanna
watch<00:02:50.690> more<00:02:50.840> yeti<00:02:51.440> tutorials<00:02:52.040> or<00:02:52.190> other

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
watch more yeti tutorials or other

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.610 
watch more yeti tutorials or other
tutorials<00:02:53.150> then<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:53.959> should<00:02:54.140> take<00:02:54.350> note<00:02:54.590> of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
tutorials then you should take note of

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.550 
tutorials then you should take note of
the<00:02:54.890> text<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.430> front<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.380> appearing<00:02:57.380> right

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
the text in front of you appearing right

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.410 
the text in front of you appearing right
now<00:02:58.810> type<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.020> into<00:03:00.170> your<00:03:00.320> browser<00:03:01.030> window<00:03:02.030> and

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
now type it into your browser window and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.050 
now type it into your browser window and
hit<00:03:02.870> enter<00:03:03.470> or<00:03:04.390> whatever<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.510> wanna<00:03:05.690> here
