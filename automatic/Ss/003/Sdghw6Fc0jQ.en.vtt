00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:03.290
 My name is JoÃ£o Oliveira. 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.130
 she just does not know how to listen 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.499
 and I live rio de janeiro 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:10.190
 then in the process 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.260
 then it has a has a rule in the context of a single way 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.919
 I'm not going to lie working with a situation. 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:19.900
 the architect 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.390
 my proposal yes then in a 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.119
 is not the case of the biennial now 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 they invited me I went to know the space 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.280
 and I was another hostage and walked some old jobs and was taking 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.440
 a process of 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.200
 is to review some projects - 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.450
 ef 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.550
 So 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.260
 she is the intense flow in the year several 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.870
 Bienal building in the lion's den 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.300
 each job 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.370
 I belong to the specificities then 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.340
 the production of these works of his, each one for each job demands 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.360
 production of a form to carry out the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.430
 sometimes I'm the greatest 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.400
 I'll inform myself on a certain subject, I'm going 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.850
 as a form of professionals who make use of what I want the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.960
 own work that determines the support 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 let's say yes 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.640
 sometimes working with 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.350
 and this sometimes work with movies sometimes I do the small installations 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.399
 with objects found I think everyday is 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.560
 It's a harmonization of my work so I think that in fact he 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.290
 maybe it's a look 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.290
 harris desserts everyday things 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.940
 I think the scenic art work relationship here 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.820
 the paths sensitize the viewer's gaze knows I think 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.770
 It's so gross when the work gets 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.479
 reach 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.340
 For those who are seeing who is living this year, I work 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.309
 I think 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:19.909
 communication about how you can make this communication I think it's 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.549
 this is the function of art 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.129
 is another form of communication
