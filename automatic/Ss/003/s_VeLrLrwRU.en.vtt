00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:26.569
 arbitrate 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.970
 Chatton should be my weight now 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.230
 Impeccably, just take a look at what's all about the shape of it 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.370
 Fox the whole thing is just out 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.590
 so 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.910
 if we have that thing more 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.300
 Sanogos are individually packed out 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.070
 when we do something 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.110
 that's Carvalho 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.730
 so that many not a little site with that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730
 Union was her parental union 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 Sande Spiekermann himself 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.100
 a 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.950
 nice cup for storing things 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.460
 and how we see them in our hearts 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.220
 as I can already say Ivedik manual is very good 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 So I really liked it so it was plain and simple 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.900
 So explain that praise 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.990
 Of course, I hope not now when I hear that such explanations 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.870
 just a way 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.430
 the bag also pack way 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.430
 to the customer later again in the 14 main product 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.280
 the goal is the Minis Reeker 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.170
 Costs of music, so to speak 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.520
 and now that we've used it with him we just do something 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.990
 the increased interest rates are adapters to do this we need it 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.689
 now I have here once 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.450
 this little USB port 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 the animal world its the speaker that simply make bad luck manner 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.190
 is easy without problems 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.280
 Here we can do a great usb-connections for the PC to the plan 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520
 the battery from the speaker 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.880
 First of all, we can not listen to music and the battery at the same time 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.619
 recharge 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.759
 last but not least at the end of the 2 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.179
 Wings 4 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.039
 we have the jack plug 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.459
 like I just like my cellphone 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.339
 such a high value of 90 are 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.339
 He has often seen other videos 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.559
 connect the adapter here 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.559
 with the jack plug 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.239
 Now we have prepared the topic 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.480
 And now, of course, that's not open yet 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.969
 we just have to do it all by now 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.549
 practically 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.599
 We do that by turning counterclockwise and clockwise 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.789
 Whole thing on lawn Just tears it gently 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.239
 and son we see that they are like his accordion 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.689
 Here you see it again 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:59.089
 now you can set the stable here to mount the field that 3 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.169
 I do not know exactly how to call that so close that does not strangle us 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.719
 I say gum stuffing 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.329
 so the operation is also very easy 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.779
 we have here 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.689
 individually failed 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.999
 again on the bottom and come see the companies 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.559
 because of the obtained corpses of light 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.859
 and that was already possible for me 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.859
 but also very good is very simple 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.829
 Now you notice it in front of the eye and around 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.319
 it will come back and show all the world is made by Children of Bodom 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.929
 maybe some of you 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:41.099
 and I'll just let it tune in the front there is evening played 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.669
 Do not feel like it because the region so you always have the Olivier at 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.829
 make the case over my phone 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.099
 you just play it off and we'll just listen directly to it 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.099
 like the sound quality 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:11.659
 so 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.849
 So far, I really like it very much 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.019
 the percent but really super 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.079
 and I'll let it stand now even just quiet times 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.079
 how nonsense is then 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.460
 by heating and oil of the tracks made all around 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:34.909
 here or I at least pretty good that they are still very good 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:38.060
 that also everything seemed clear the movies of the post office and so on 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.830
 out before the break 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.249
 so the soft rich 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.640
 So I really like it very much 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.880
 if possible use without problems 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.139
 you always have it with you 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.860
 sda um I'm going to Stögers plans completely percent the usb connection 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.029
 the club 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:02.770
 So if the way is clear, the sound of it has been really good 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.470
 The device will switch off again as I said here just after the controllers 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.389
 shift right 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.800
 all the way to the right 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.419
 both to make the whole thing together now we just press 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.800
 down the scythe no fear there's nothing happening 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.099
 ours in the upper parts 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.200
 a Tec 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.979
 in the buzzer minded 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.949
 and that's the way I was secured the WebTV 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.039
 it has two around here 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.020
 two small surveys in the downtrend in it you see if this is his 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.819
 or not 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.670
 Now the team is tightly closed 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.309
 for this small compact 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:37.990
 lies here so well in the hand 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.259
 and we can take that whole whole hand 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.069
 this bag 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.289
 Sun the researchers are nice, everyone would normally come back 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.790
 still the cable comes that it is however not so 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.650
 nice that it is not there 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.819
 and we just see it here at the crossbar 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.719
 fatigue indefinitely and so in your pocket or in our purse wherever 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:59.460
 stowed 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.740
 and it still has a nice shot 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.810
 So you can really say that the dough has to look like it again 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.220
 his name is Wixell, but art Rica is right, as well as coproduction I can only 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.699
 recommend so there is percent 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.779
 a buy really for people who like to listen to music when they're on the go 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.979
 Bathing is with joy is really 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.000
 the purchase is 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.619
 Duty and a must 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:25.099
 and suddenly goes in front of me »said the flap» praised number one 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.290
 really nothing here it would match against the users 

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:33.809
 and then that should have been here if we liked the youth 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:36.309
 promote the income if not then too 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:37.759
 Precision I am the boss
