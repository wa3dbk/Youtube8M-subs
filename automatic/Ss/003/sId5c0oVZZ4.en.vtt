00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 That means the players have to get that 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.870
 then take with you in the backpack and ins 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.410
 Take training in the training everything 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.590
 work out enough training opportunities in training 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.910
 stay outside for 15 minutes and say yes 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.410
 my colleagues play with the ball in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.820
 the alley or play by against the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.369
 Four-string kidman 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.510
 you shoot good after 67 goals 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.789
 feeling out of training 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.910
 as such, things have to come and go 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.579
 only see this in the second half 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.860
 hungry for my individual 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.070
 performance with everything at my disposal 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.500
 is to optimize nutrition sleep 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.430
 Training hide everything in the tunnel 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.170
 go and the next 17 weeks or 16 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.480
 Do not let them know you are 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.239
 take care of other than the profession and only 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.140
 the thing you 're up to 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.990
 all that is next to it beautiful 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.659
 walk rest everything just do 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.330
 That's why I'm back to my job 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.700
 100 percent can do it if we can 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.350
 can afford a very big one 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 part of the players that can afford 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.590
 me a strong team in the square 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.520
 Ten over a week again and again when we 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.570
 we will not be able to do that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:39.509
 not have the necessary performance erlebnisse 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:42.320
 because the single player determines the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.320
 performance of the team 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.920
 it is only a single look for the 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:54.700
 player and only on himself only 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.690
 the mirrors do not look the other way 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.380
 no teammates 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:05.490
 no one else on no one 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.490
 different only on your own responsibility 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.670
 is the crucial point like one 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.900
 Team always in a group though 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.540
 a group together is cut 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.490
 decisive I look at the other one 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.100
 is just about how I am as an individual 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.160
 to bring me into a group 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.440
 who does that better to me with me 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.300
 Do it right if it is me 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.830
 I feel really good in the training 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.959
 comes felt on the training place 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.459
 I both guys available that 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.810
 Merck already a lot of small caravan 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.750
 draws go back a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.180
 then we will have the necessary on saturday 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.720
 I have concentration and focus 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.810
 i can be very very intense and 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.620
 exhausting task but we have 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.330
 that already I have not experienced it 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.820
 as simple as that would be too easy other 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:04.410
 simply that 's a bit further extreme 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.410
 if we can handle an extremity 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:14.680
 it is very very demanding that 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.420
 level has just now just that means 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.130
 go down from the training ground and go 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:24.190
 home and meet me right after that 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.260
 In everything I do I do not go 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.760
 then, or I do not do that and I 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.670
 do not drive there or not at all 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.890
 if I feel like a percent 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.420
 missing me a day or two later 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.640
 I do not do any training 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.500
 I do not drive 100 kilometers in the car 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.459
 I drive only ten kilometers around here 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.010
 to go for a walk 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.650
 so I do not miss that I look 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.120
 again own video 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.950
 from Saturday if it's good or not later 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.200
 plays well 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.980
 I'll take care of everything with me 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:58.760
 my own performance on 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:03.709
 Feeding space has everything to sleep 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.290
 Diet give everything this orientation 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.930
 That's when you have this process 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.459
 this process takes place have a 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.959
 real chance the question actually before 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:21.290
 Everything meant they have the impression 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:23.000
 that this focusing i will use it 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.250
 Just watch who is not a few 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.250
 announce weeks whether it occurred 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.300
 interesting now it was okay though 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.720
 okay all hope that they play 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:48.100
 Everyone comes from the winter break and has 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:50.900
 breathed really great and everything completely 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.620
 wonderful and we are so good colleague 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.150
 and we insist and work on it 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.280
 you will see space and every day in the 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.740
 training and every day in total 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.889
 behavior of the individual 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.669
 that's about it and everything else 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.789
 tactics so seen against ideas like that 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.289
 we can do that we do everything 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.090
 try everything we trainers and and 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:18.250
 video and I do not care about everything 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:22.070
 it is crucial if they are this 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:25.580
 extreme requirement and everyone 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.370
 Single of the encroaching on the bank 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.430
 sits or plays on the bench 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.880
 and after the game if not playing field 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.080
 does exercises in the power room 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.360
 afterwards we go with the team 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.789
 after that immediately goes to bed 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.130
 another day in training 100 percent 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:46.210
 his performance can bring him to 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:49.550
 available and pushes everything away 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.090
 unity push all other things away 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.090
 to himself
