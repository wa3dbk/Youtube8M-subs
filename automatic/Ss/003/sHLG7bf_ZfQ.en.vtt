you go back and listen to it carefully

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.530 
you go back and listen to it carefully
you<00:04:55.770> can<00:04:55.920> hear<00:04:56.130> that<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.340> s5<00:04:56.790> has<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:57.030> lot<00:04:57.300> more

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
you can hear that the s5 has a lot more

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.140 
you can hear that the s5 has a lot more
white<00:04:57.780> noise<00:04:58.280> for<00:04:59.280> stabilization<00:04:59.640> the

s5 had optical image stabilization like

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.320 
s5 had optical image stabilization like
the<00:05:09.390> s6<00:05:09.840> it<00:05:10.020> might<00:05:10.440> have<00:05:10.620> stood<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:10.860> chance

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
the s6 it might have stood a chance

both phones do a fantastic job although

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.840 
both phones do a fantastic job although
this<00:05:16.050> time<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.440> galaxy<00:05:16.830> s6<00:05:17.190> has<00:05:17.430> warmer

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
this time the galaxy s6 has warmer

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.150 
this time the galaxy s6 has warmer
colors<00:05:18.180> whereas<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.750> s5<00:05:19.140> tends<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.590> be<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.800> bit

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
colors whereas the s5 tends to be a bit

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.280 
colors whereas the s5 tends to be a bit
on<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.730> cooler<00:05:21.060> side<00:05:21.270> both<00:05:21.840> do<00:05:22.020> an<00:05:22.140> amazing

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
on the cooler side both do an amazing

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.170 
on the cooler side both do an amazing
job<00:05:22.500> capturing<00:05:23.100> detail<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.640> sharpness<00:05:23.940> and

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
job capturing detail the sharpness and

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.210 
job capturing detail the sharpness and
both<00:05:24.360> pics<00:05:24.630> are<00:05:24.810> amazing<00:05:25.230> no<00:05:25.380> doubt<00:05:25.680> however

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
both pics are amazing no doubt however

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.340 
both pics are amazing no doubt however
the<00:05:26.490> s6<00:05:26.940> takes<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.390> point<00:05:27.570> because<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.200> has

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
the s6 takes the point because it has

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.110 
the s6 takes the point because it has
more<00:05:28.620> chewer<00:05:28.890> to<00:05:29.070> live<00:05:29.220> colors<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:29.790> because

detail<00:05:46.290> once<00:05:46.530> again<00:05:46.980> you<00:05:47.220> can<00:05:47.370> especially

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
detail once again you can especially

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.720 
detail once again you can especially
tell<00:05:48.060> by<00:05:48.240> looking<00:05:48.600> at<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.080> ps4<00:05:49.470> trackpad<00:05:50.250> you

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
tell by looking at the ps4 trackpad you

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.520 
tell by looking at the ps4 trackpad you
can<00:05:50.910> see<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.090> texture<00:05:51.420> on<00:05:51.660> that<00:05:51.990> whereas<00:05:52.350> you

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
can see the texture on that whereas you

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.460 
can see the texture on that whereas you
can't<00:05:52.770> really<00:05:52.920> see<00:05:53.190> any<00:05:53.370> of<00:05:53.520> that<00:05:53.550> on<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:54.000> s5

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
can't really see any of that on the s5

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.600 
can't really see any of that on the s5
another<00:05:55.470> good<00:05:55.620> example<00:05:55.650> is<00:05:56.130> looking<00:05:56.430> at<00:05:56.520> the

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
another good example is looking at the

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.390 
another good example is looking at the
texture<00:05:56.940> on<00:05:57.180> this<00:05:57.390> red<00:05:57.690> cup<00:05:58.050> so<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:58.830> s6<00:05:59.160> takes

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
texture on this red cup so the s6 takes

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.640 
texture on this red cup so the s6 takes
the<00:05:59.580> point<00:05:59.820> for<00:06:00.090> low-light<00:06:00.510> pictures<00:06:01.110> when<00:06:01.560> it

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
the point for low-light pictures when it

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.080 
the point for low-light pictures when it
comes<00:06:01.800> to<00:06:01.920> flash<00:06:02.130> I<00:06:02.400> think<00:06:02.640> they<00:06:02.760> both<00:06:03.030> are

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
comes to flash I think they both are

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.090 
comes to flash I think they both are
pretty<00:06:03.540> much<00:06:03.690> equal<00:06:03.960> both<00:06:04.470> do<00:06:04.620> a<00:06:04.650> great<00:06:04.920> job

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
pretty much equal both do a great job

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.340 
pretty much equal both do a great job
capturing<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.880> object<00:06:06.390> but<00:06:06.630> also<00:06:06.840> suffer

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
capturing the object but also suffer

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.810 
capturing the object but also suffer
when<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.590> comes<00:06:07.770> to<00:06:07.950> taking<00:06:08.100> pictures<00:06:08.640> of

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
when it comes to taking pictures of

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.240 
when it comes to taking pictures of
white<00:06:09.030> objects<00:06:09.810> so<00:06:10.380> I<00:06:10.410> guess<00:06:10.680> both<00:06:10.890> deserve<00:06:11.220> a

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
white objects so I guess both deserve a

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.820 
white objects so I guess both deserve a
point<00:06:11.580> for<00:06:11.880> flash<00:06:12.210> pics<00:06:12.570> so<00:06:12.810> the<00:06:13.530> final

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
point for flash pics so the final

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.850 
point for flash pics so the final
verdict<00:06:14.220> I<00:06:14.520> think<00:06:15.000> that<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.360> galaxy<00:06:15.810> s5<00:06:16.380> still

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
verdict I think that the galaxy s5 still

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.350 
verdict I think that the galaxy s5 still
does<00:06:17.010> a<00:06:17.040> pretty<00:06:17.340> good<00:06:17.520> job<00:06:17.700> for<00:06:17.760> being<00:06:18.180> last

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
does a pretty good job for being last

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.420 
does a pretty good job for being last
year's<00:06:18.600> model<00:06:19.020> it<00:06:19.530> was<00:06:19.620> pretty<00:06:19.830> much<00:06:19.980> neck<00:06:20.280> and

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.220 
year's model it was pretty much neck and
neck<00:06:20.550> for<00:06:20.580> some<00:06:20.970> of<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.120> comparisons<00:06:21.750> however

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
neck for some of the comparisons however

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.980 
neck for some of the comparisons however
the<00:06:22.320> real<00:06:22.500> winner<00:06:22.680> is<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:23.100> galaxy<00:06:23.580> s6<00:06:24.150> so<00:06:24.810> far
