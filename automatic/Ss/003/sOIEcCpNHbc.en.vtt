00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
excited because I actually almost went

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.849 
excited because I actually almost went
into<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.579> medical<00:02:20.939> field<00:02:21.109> I<00:02:22.109> was<00:02:22.620> studying

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
into the medical field I was studying

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.860 
into the medical field I was studying
that<00:02:23.189> for<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> little<00:02:23.730> while<00:02:23.879> for<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> couple<00:02:24.840> of

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
that for a little while for a couple of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.199 
that for a little while for a couple of
years<00:02:25.049> in<00:02:25.290> college<00:02:26.000> wanted<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.060> be<00:02:27.180> a

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
years in college wanted to be a

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.030 
years in college wanted to be a
physician's<00:02:27.689> assistant<00:02:27.840> but<00:02:28.469> just<00:02:28.769> kind<00:02:28.980> of

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
physician's assistant but just kind of

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.280 
physician's assistant but just kind of
never<00:02:29.219> you<00:02:29.939> know<00:02:30.060> completed<00:02:30.720> schooling<00:02:31.140> on

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
never you know completed schooling on

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.649 
never you know completed schooling on
that<00:02:31.530> who<00:02:32.370> knows<00:02:32.549> might<00:02:32.819> go<00:02:33.000> back<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.510> it

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
that who knows might go back and do it

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.949 
that who knows might go back and do it
one<00:02:34.409> day<00:02:34.819> but<00:02:35.819> who<00:02:35.970> knows<00:02:36.180> when<00:02:36.359> that<00:02:36.510> will<00:02:36.540> be

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
one day but who knows when that will be

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.530 
one day but who knows when that will be
so<00:02:37.319> this<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.099> definitely<00:02:38.310> an<00:02:38.819> app<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.329> I<00:02:39.359> will

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
so this is definitely an app that I will

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.360 
so this is definitely an app that I will
probably<00:02:39.870> keep<00:02:39.989> around<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:41.040> know<00:02:41.159> so

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370
