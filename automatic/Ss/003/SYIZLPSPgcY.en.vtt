be finger tightened because now it's
time<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:40.240> drop<00:02:40.450> in<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:41.610> chrome<00:02:42.610> cross<00:02:42.940> tube

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
time to drop in the chrome cross tube

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.010 
time to drop in the chrome cross tube
you<00:02:44.770> see<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.130> these<00:02:45.340> two<00:02:45.640> bolts<00:02:46.120> slide<00:02:46.720> back

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
you see that these two bolts slide back

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.430 
you see that these two bolts slide back
and<00:02:47.230> forth<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:49.150> simply<00:02:49.390> drop<00:02:49.750> those<00:02:50.020> bolts

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
and forth and we simply drop those bolts

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.370 
and forth and we simply drop those bolts
down<00:02:50.710> through<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.220> saddle<00:02:51.490> blocks<00:02:51.820> and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
down through the saddle blocks and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.570 
down through the saddle blocks and
position<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.500> pretty<00:02:53.740> much<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.220> center<00:02:54.550> of

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
position it pretty much in the center of

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.200 
position it pretty much in the center of
the<00:02:54.760> bike<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.270> now<00:02:56.230> we're<00:02:56.410> going<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.590> put<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
the bike and now we're going to put the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.010 
the bike and now we're going to put the
washers<00:02:58.210> and<00:02:58.240> nuts

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
washers and nuts

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.850

beneath<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.100> saddle<00:03:00.490> blocks<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.860> tighten

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
beneath the saddle blocks and tighten

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:12.110 
beneath the saddle blocks and tighten
those<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.520> tighten

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.930 

that's<00:03:12.660> pretty<00:03:12.959> much<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.730> now<00:03:14.730> we're<00:03:14.849> going

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
that's pretty much that now we're going

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.190 
that's pretty much that now we're going
to<00:03:15.030> add<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.420> two<00:03:15.660> pivot<00:03:16.260> carriers<00:03:18.080> one<00:03:19.080> is

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
to add the two pivot carriers one is

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.199 
to add the two pivot carriers one is
marked<00:03:19.500> with<00:03:19.680> an<00:03:19.830> L<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.580> other<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.910> marked

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
marked with an L and the other is marked

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.630 
marked with an L and the other is marked
with<00:03:21.300> an<00:03:21.569> R<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:23.099> can<00:03:23.250> be<00:03:23.400> sure<00:03:23.610> that

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
with an R so you can be sure that

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.190 
with an R so you can be sure that
they're<00:03:23.970> going<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.480> right<00:03:24.660> end<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
they're going on the right end and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.680 
they're going on the right end and
tighten<00:03:25.650> up<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.400> one<00:03:26.610> of<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.819> set<00:03:27.060> screws<00:03:27.450> a

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
tighten up just one of the set screws a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.690 
tighten up just one of the set screws a
little<00:03:27.930> bit<00:03:28.319> doesn't<00:03:28.739> have<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.099> be<00:03:29.220> real<00:03:29.430> tight

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
little bit doesn't have to be real tight

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.119 
little bit doesn't have to be real tight
because<00:03:30.000> we're<00:03:30.599> just<00:03:30.629> checking<00:03:31.379> them<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:31.709> fit

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
because we're just checking them for fit

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.910 
because we're just checking them for fit
right<00:03:32.340> now<00:03:32.690> keep<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.840> mind<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.470> slot<00:03:34.769> in

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
right now keep in mind that the slot in

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.449 
right now keep in mind that the slot in
the<00:03:35.010> pivot<00:03:35.340> carrier<00:03:35.670> faces<00:03:36.209> forward<00:03:37.459> all

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
the pivot carrier faces forward all

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.490 
the pivot carrier faces forward all
right<00:03:38.519> those<00:03:38.940> are<00:03:38.989> tightened<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.080> little<00:03:40.110> bit

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
right those are tightened a little bit

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.979 
right those are tightened a little bit
we'll<00:03:41.160> put<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:42.290> right<00:03:43.290> armrest<00:03:44.870> put<00:03:45.870> on

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
we'll put on the right armrest put on

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.580 
we'll put on the right armrest put on
the<00:03:46.140> Left<00:03:46.349> armrest<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:48.140> I'm<00:03:49.140> going<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.380> just

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
the Left armrest and I'm going to just

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.960 
the Left armrest and I'm going to just
walk<00:03:49.799> over<00:03:49.950> here<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.340> make<00:03:50.579> sure<00:03:50.610> that

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
walk over here and make sure that

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.970 
walk over here and make sure that
they're<00:03:51.209> parallel<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.440> adjust<00:03:52.560> them

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
they're parallel and you can adjust them

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.470 
they're parallel and you can adjust them
up<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.280> down<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:53.610> only<00:03:53.940> one<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.329> those

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
up and down because only one of those

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.150 
up and down because only one of those
set<00:03:55.110> screws<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.709> very<00:03:56.069> tight<00:03:57.650> all<00:03:58.650> right<00:03:58.829> now

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
set screws is very tight all right now

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.289 
set screws is very tight all right now
we're<00:03:59.340> going<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.519> take<00:03:59.760> the<00:04:00.030> armrest<00:04:00.660> off<00:04:00.989> and

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
we're going to take the armrest off and

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.819 
we're going to take the armrest off and
tighten<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.420> other<00:04:03.599> set<00:04:03.989> screw<00:04:04.819> very<00:04:05.819> tight

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
tighten the other set screw very tight

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.500 
tighten the other set screw very tight
so<00:04:07.829> all<00:04:08.780> four<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.810> these<00:04:10.110> set<00:04:10.440> screws<00:04:10.829> are

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
so all four of these set screws are

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.690 
so all four of these set screws are
really<00:04:12.650> clamped<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.860> there<00:04:14.069> they<00:04:14.579> actually

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
really clamped in there they actually

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.360 
really clamped in there they actually
have<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.090> point<00:04:15.450> on<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:15.750> end<00:04:15.840> of<00:04:16.049> them<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.440> that

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
have a point on the end of them and that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.400 
have a point on the end of them and that
point<00:04:17.700> digs<00:04:18.000> into<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.359> cross<00:04:18.720> tube<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.229> keep

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
point digs into the cross tube to keep

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.029 
point digs into the cross tube to keep
them<00:04:19.560> really<00:04:19.739> solid<00:04:20.340> then<00:04:20.910> there's<00:04:21.120> also<00:04:21.329> a

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
them really solid then there's also a

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.690 
them really solid then there's also a
clamping<00:04:23.039> screw<00:04:23.610> underneath<00:04:25.580> so<00:04:26.580> you're

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
clamping screw underneath so you're

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.520 
clamping screw underneath so you're
going<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.880> tighten<00:04:27.539> up<00:04:27.810> these<00:04:27.990> clamping

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
going to tighten up these clamping

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.320 
going to tighten up these clamping
screws<00:04:28.889> really<00:04:29.370> really<00:04:29.700> tight<00:04:29.940> as<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.150> matter

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
screws really really tight as a matter

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.520 
screws really really tight as a matter
of<00:04:30.419> fact<00:04:30.630> you're<00:04:30.780> gonna<00:04:30.840> want<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.169> put<00:04:31.349> some

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
of fact you're gonna want to put some

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.770 
of fact you're gonna want to put some
thread<00:04:31.860> Locker<00:04:32.130> on<00:04:32.280> there<00:04:32.669> so<00:04:33.270> that<00:04:33.450> if<00:04:33.570> your

thread Locker on there so that if your

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.110 
thread Locker on there so that if your
bike<00:04:34.110> rattles<00:04:34.590> like<00:04:34.860> some<00:04:35.160> of<00:04:35.280> them<00:04:35.400> do<00:04:35.580> it

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
bike rattles like some of them do it

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.560 
bike rattles like some of them do it
doesn't<00:04:36.510> fall<00:04:36.780> out<00:04:36.810> sometime<00:04:37.560> down<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:37.950> road

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
doesn't fall out sometime down the road

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.610 
doesn't fall out sometime down the road
now<00:04:39.570> we're<00:04:39.720> going<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:39.870> put<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.080> little<00:04:40.229> bit<00:04:40.380> of

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
now we're going to put a little bit of

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.190 
now we're going to put a little bit of
vaseline<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.580> little<00:04:41.849> bit<00:04:41.970> of<00:04:42.060> grease<00:04:42.330> I'm

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
vaseline a little bit of grease I'm

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.440 
vaseline a little bit of grease I'm
actually<00:04:43.410> going<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.770> use<00:04:44.669> a<00:04:44.940> little<00:04:45.180> bit<00:04:45.300> of

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
actually going to use a little bit of

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.230 
actually going to use a little bit of
chapstick<00:04:46.050> on<00:04:46.229> these<00:04:46.830> pivot<00:04:47.220> posts<00:04:47.729> so<00:04:48.210> that

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
chapstick on these pivot posts so that

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.620 
chapstick on these pivot posts so that
the<00:04:48.870> arm<00:04:49.800> rests<00:04:50.340> will<00:04:50.520> pivot<00:04:50.760> real<00:04:51.120> nice<00:04:51.360> and

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
the arm rests will pivot real nice and
