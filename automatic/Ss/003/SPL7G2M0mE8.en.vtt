because<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.620> videos<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.219> good<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.489> my<00:00:35.670> my

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
because the videos as good as my my

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.979 
because the videos as good as my my

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and i'm figuring that the gold like as

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
and i'm figuring that the gold like as
it<00:00:44.250> comes<00:00:44.430> down<00:00:44.670> through<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.270> he's<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
it comes down through here he's going to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.360 
it comes down through here he's going to
carried<00:00:46.440> along<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:46.860> deposited

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
carried along and then deposited

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
carried along and then deposited
probably<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> backside<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> there<00:00:48.930> so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
probably on the backside of there so

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.209 
probably on the backside of there so
what<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.649> I'm<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.070> in
