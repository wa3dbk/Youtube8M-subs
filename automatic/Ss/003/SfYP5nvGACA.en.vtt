00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.299
 today normal continues to the topic like 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.330
 is it the japanese and here all 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.130
 specifically on the subject of water change 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.080
 how much fresh water to a plant 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.820
 supplied so the Japanese are 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.369
 traditionally initially set up this way 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.170
 that partly permanently water flows 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.750
 So as I at home sometimes as 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.519
 It not only recommends it to my clients 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.170
 changing over water means changing water 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.910
 I always change something out of the one 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.189
 much that others fresh money 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.679
 pure but a continuous one 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.920
 water intake and when I akin monte and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.600
 micronova the question how high here 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.190
 freshwater inflow is you have me 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.210
 first looked at and franco he 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.579
 should we know that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.079
 you have to fix it somewhere then you 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.489
 they say yes we look at the water 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.469
 Others when it gets so bad 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.320
 So say the money to increase 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.610
 or the foaming is too strong than 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.289
 we had some foam formation 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.180
 we have needed it more often 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.890
 Then we turn on the fresh water 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.829
 If we notice that was so will 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.329
 clean to clear not to small form 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.100
 from pompous but too colorless 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.260
 too transparent that is not more 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.090
 this konamis this retracted 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.220
 then turn base or run water 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.229
 have to go back and then I have them 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.030
 Just given a short overrun 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.250
 to estimate moderately how much 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 this is usually always somewhere 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.460
 at a rate between five and ten 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.130
 percent came in the day 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.320
 in summer when the fish is intense 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.340
 be guided so if you have us 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.180
 if they are nice in another block 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.100
 here 3% feed a day in relation to 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.990
 the fish weight can be entered 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.799
 officially the pond also somewhere 23 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 kilo be 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.140
 because you just can not get around there 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.880
 they will not get around either 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.680
 and as I said , not only result 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.720
 to abuse in the water parameter 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.759
 ammonium nitrate ammonium is shot by the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.149
 Freshwater change completely excluded 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.430
 it's about other other parameters 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.560
 like all the phosphate if you go to 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.390
 little was changing makes the council in 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.210
 large quantities contained in the fishing boat 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.280
 comes about that happen in the fish feed 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.979
 purely naturally need the clubs 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.850
 certain promised and blood bones 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.759
 builds 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.560
 young but too much is just a thin one 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.600
 who then with them with extremely albums 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.510
 would make growth noticeable 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.610
 you are not missing here in japan 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.069
 carbonates deister ph values so also 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.690
 the problematic have not but the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.700
 other corresponding other problems 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.750
 if you do not fresh water the dough too much 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.459
 send 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.470
 but if now come to winter when 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.060
 The amount of feed less will then drive 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.620
 the amount of fresh water also aware 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.860
 down so then they come too 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.230
 1 percent 2 percent off and there are the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.700
 Japanese just because conviction but 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.430
 not the conviction but have that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.080
 know that too clean but how 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.540
 said clean and nothing with harmony 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.540
 Monitors are ammonium nitrate 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.630
 Everything stored next to clean is there 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.459
 it's about organic connection and about 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.530
 clean water it neither that beauty 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.140
 and certainly not the health of 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.760
 Cows beneficial This is a mucous membrane 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.500
 the mucous membrane of the between the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.019
 needed a certain stimulus the charm 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.450
 needed to stay active and there her 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.709
 defense against certain germs to 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.200
 to be held 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.100
 and, of course, the epidermis also needs it 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.970
 the stimulus with it the preform 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.620
 takes place and one notices with yes 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.780
 metallic colors co fastest and 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.209
 at all others if the simplest 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.799
 all the stimuli lack the sunlight one 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.900
 listener hardly in the epidermis 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.600
 invest then the color fades 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.519
 So that's one of the examples now 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.980
 but would that be scientific 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.350
 examined and one knows one has also 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.150
 already gained knowledge 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.890
 then you would go on completely different 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.109
 things are happening so now we are there 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.470
 can intervene between five and ten 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.540
 percent of the day in the times of the states 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.940
 Feeding and you can do it independently 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.900
 of your size also on your pond 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.239
 adapt 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.799
 just for big same these monsters 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.750
 Particles like Japan here clearly 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.390
 I do not know anything at all 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.910
 that people think about 200,000 liters 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.440
 they shared 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.959
 2008 fresh water a day they do something 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.850
 good money that is wrong there one does on 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.540
 Nothing at all like a giant pond 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.370
 needs on fresh water and in relation 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.720
 not much less than a small one 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.050
 pond maybe even there 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.590
 stronger 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.390
 but it works logical power 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.100
 will not happen in any case 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.390
 extensive water changes away 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.370
 one must also distinguish 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.170
 you can change the water that was so 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.150
 before and estonia fresh purely that 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.550
 is the classic water change or 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.140
 if continuous water intake the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.700
 is what they are doing here is that 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.350
 what I recommend to each of our customers 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.690
 that's what i like about my equipment 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.090
 makes and the five to ten percent of 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.380
 which we just save is the 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.450
 provide permanent water supply of water 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.520
 run over 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.850
 there will be added later if the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.760
 finder is cleaned and then goes 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.440
 again about 20 25 percent of 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.180
 total volume flutes and then becomes 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.360
 so it would be filled up against fresh water 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.790
 probably in the overall context 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.660
 the technical water change in the summer 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.550
 on any 8 to 10% he comes like that 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.680
 Now we are at home stepping on and on 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.680
 I hope you can take something with you
