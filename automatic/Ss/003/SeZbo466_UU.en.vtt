00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.829
 the exhibition you came to see the bodies last by the association 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:24.220
 she quickly mounted this exhibition on apiaries the attractions I 

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:24.869
 booze 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.090
 this association aims to promote the agricultural heritage 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.190
 he supported his life association for training and development in 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.400
 Agriculture 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.680
 it concerns the whole world except that the places we did not have the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.500
 time still to search his ace 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.770
 we can not say we went through tourcoing dollars 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.030
 facing the challenge of exposed models 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.670
 so this exhibition 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.730
 this particular piece to him 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.840
 the evolution of the hive 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.790
 that is, they were the main schools of thought that have 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.430
 pushed to make hives 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.130
 so we can see that in the first room the man tried to 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.550
 in europe produce the habitat the natural who had the hammers 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.840
 that is to say essentially the other marble proof 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.840
 it could be a hole in a rock see in the ground 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.659
 in the chimneys in houses but afterwards we will say 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.820
 then he tried to make hives that to look more like the shape of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.120
 so a more compact shape more bell-shaped 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.780
 on the site of the old had a big fault is that to harvest the 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.350
 honey 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.080
 it was very difficult to be able to take a built piece so in fact 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.920
 the main difficulty was to harvest the honey without damaging the hive 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.909
 so that one day the man had the idea to do what is called a 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.850
 rise so a floor to add to the top of the hive 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.729
 a floor that was meant for the farmer can pick up the crumbs 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.520
 hulot revolution that took place in the streets is the invention of the moving frame 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.490
 the interest of this cargo bbc to be able to collect pieces separately 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.670
 without damaging anything else hence the great facility to harvest the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.370
 honey 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.620
 it also allowed to standardize the forms so by passing on the forms 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.610
 rectangle it was interesting for the machines 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.830
 extractors and this mobil mobil is also quite interesting and in beekeeping 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.610
 to the extent that you can take a quarter in a hive give it to a 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.740
 other so if for example you have a hive does not have reindeer you can 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.649
 give objects will make it a 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.779
 he also had a hive of observation that was the most beautiful 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.249
 man from France in 1996 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.419
 it's a hive that date from 1900 it is sent massive 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.739
 even the frames are sent the brains brain and obviously 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.769
 we continue to make traveling exhibitions on request 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.049
 and if the communes are interested in janka contact the affiliated association 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.029
 to cachan its switzerland headquarters
