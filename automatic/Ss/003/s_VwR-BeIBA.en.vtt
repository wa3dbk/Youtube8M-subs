00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.839

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.620
 in my house in my life is all that 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.329

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.460

 they wanted to finish and then with the debt 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.190

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.220
 as well as if destiny will infatuate 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.630
 in 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.630

 if it's the Parisian house 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.100
 a huge part of my life disappears 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.100
 I'm empty, I do not have anything 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.119
 do not say that 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.420
 Do not say that because the house is going 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.810
 to recover and it will be all right is 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.009
 what you ask 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.170
 I do not want you to say more that you do not have 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.170
 nobody and you 're alone because it's not like that 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.500
