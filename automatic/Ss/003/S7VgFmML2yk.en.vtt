00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.540 

okay<00:00:45.960> I'm<00:00:46.730> going<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.879> show<00:00:48.000> how<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.449> link<00:00:48.839> the

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
okay I'm going to show how to link the

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.500 
okay I'm going to show how to link the
first<00:00:50.550> triple<00:00:51.030> Fang<00:00:51.239> hit<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:53.149> back<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
first triple Fang hit from the back to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.290 
first triple Fang hit from the back to
the<00:00:54.780> rear<00:00:54.960> cross<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.620> Lee<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.070> combo<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.149> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the rear cross with Lee in combo so that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.049 
the rear cross with Lee in combo so that
you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:57.899> extra<00:00:58.260> hit<00:00:58.409> in<00:00:58.649> any<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.940> your

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
you can get one extra hit in any of your

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
you can get one extra hit in any of your
carries<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:01.350> lot<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.649> people<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.039> said

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
carries and a lot of people have said

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.820 
carries and a lot of people have said
that<00:01:02.369> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:02.879> difficult<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.830> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that this is really difficult and it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.490 
that this is really difficult and it
really<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.789> the<00:01:06.149> timing<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> main<00:01:07.200> problem

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
really is the timing is the main problem

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.609 
really is the timing is the main problem
with<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:09.030> I'll<00:01:09.720> show<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.409> technique

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
with this so I'll show you one technique

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.889 
with this so I'll show you one technique
with<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> stick<00:01:11.460> though<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.180> will<00:01:12.479> help<00:01:12.720> out

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
with a stick though that will help out

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:19.149 
with a stick though that will help out
and<00:01:15.440> here's<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.619> least<00:01:16.860> ik<00:01:17.100> hooray<00:01:17.700> anyhow

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
and here's the least ik hooray anyhow

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.029 
and here's the least ik hooray anyhow
there's<00:01:20.159> an<00:01:20.310> old<00:01:20.490> technique<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.179> lot<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
there's an old technique that a lot of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.100 
there's an old technique that a lot of
players<00:01:23.039> used<00:01:23.429> for<00:01:23.700> timing<00:01:23.970> sensitive<00:01:24.659> links

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
players used for timing sensitive links

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.559 
players used for timing sensitive links
in<00:01:25.380> 2d<00:01:26.340> fighting<00:01:26.580> games<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.149> a<00:01:27.210> lot<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
in 2d fighting games and a lot of the

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.870 
in 2d fighting games and a lot of the
Japanese<00:01:28.020> players<00:01:28.319> used<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.700> that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
Japanese players used it and what that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.580 
Japanese players used it and what that
is<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.690> timing<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.229> really

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
is is when the timing is really

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.160 
is is when the timing is really
sensitive<00:01:32.039> they<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.090> two<00:01:33.750> button

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
sensitive they would get two button

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.529 
sensitive they would get two button
presses<00:01:34.649> for<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.490> button<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.030> quickly

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
presses for one button really quickly

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.809 
presses for one button really quickly
what<00:01:37.110> happens<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.679> you<00:01:37.830> use<00:01:37.979> two<00:01:38.250> fingers<00:01:38.789> to

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
what happens is you use two fingers to

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.149 
what happens is you use two fingers to
hit<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.479> instead<00:01:40.289> of<00:01:40.440> repeatedly

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
hit it and instead of repeatedly

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.660 
hit it and instead of repeatedly
pressing<00:01:41.580> down<00:01:41.909> mashing<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:44.310> stroke

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
pressing down mashing on it you stroke

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.449 
pressing down mashing on it you stroke
across<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.450> button<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.159> middle

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
across the button so that the middle

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.359 
across the button so that the middle
finger<00:01:47.670> hits<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.360> slides<00:01:48.899> off<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.530> right

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
finger hits and slides off and right

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.029 
finger hits and slides off and right
after<00:01:50.819> that<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.720> pointer<00:01:52.170> finger<00:01:52.500> hits<00:01:52.739> and

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
after that the pointer finger hits and

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.109 
after that the pointer finger hits and
slides<00:01:53.550> off<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.929> can<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.700> one<00:01:56.700> button

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
slides off so you can get one button

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.219 
slides off so you can get one button
with<00:01:57.569> two<00:01:57.599> very<00:01:58.349> quick<00:01:58.739> successive<00:01:59.610> presses

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
with two very quick successive presses

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.320 
with two very quick successive presses
which<00:02:01.229> helps<00:02:01.560> with<00:02:01.709> timing<00:02:02.039> because<00:02:02.970> then<00:02:03.149> you

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
which helps with timing because then you

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.080 
which helps with timing because then you
have<00:02:03.530> two<00:02:04.530> chances<00:02:05.099> on<00:02:05.340> something<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.940> might

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
have two chances on something that might

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.969 
have two chances on something that might
be<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.660> or<00:02:06.810> two<00:02:06.989> or<00:02:07.170> three<00:02:07.200> frame<00:02:07.679> link

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
be a one or two or three frame link

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.780 
be a one or two or three frame link
instead<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.519> just<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.879> single<00:02:09.060> one<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> this

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
instead of just a single one and so this

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.449 
instead of just a single one and so this
is<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> method<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:13.050> I've<00:02:13.560> been<00:02:13.920> using<00:02:14.220> for

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
is the method that I've been using for

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.270 
is the method that I've been using for
this<00:02:14.819> link<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:16.620> makes<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.129> little

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
this link and it makes it a little

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.160 
this link and it makes it a little
easier<00:02:17.660> now<00:02:18.660> what<00:02:19.019> happens<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:20.629> if<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.930> first

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
easier now what happens is if the first

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.470 
easier now what happens is if the first
press<00:02:22.440> was<00:02:22.680> correctly<00:02:23.160> timed<00:02:23.550> then<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.209> won't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
press was correctly timed then I won't

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.780 
press was correctly timed then I won't
get<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.560> frame<00:02:25.800> version<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.459> triple

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
get the just frame version of the triple

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.180 
get the just frame version of the triple
Fang<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:27.780> only<00:02:27.900> adds<00:02:28.140> three<00:02:28.500> damage<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:29.069> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
Fang so it only adds three damage to the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.850 
Fang so it only adds three damage to the
combo<00:02:29.580> whereas<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.840> was<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.200> second<00:02:31.620> press

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
combo whereas if it was the second press

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.920 
combo whereas if it was the second press
I<00:02:32.159> will<00:02:32.519> end<00:02:32.760> up<00:02:32.879> getting<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.720> frame

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
I will end up getting the just frame

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.259 
I will end up getting the just frame
version<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:34.620> it'll<00:02:35.069> add<00:02:35.220> five<00:02:35.580> damage<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
version and it'll add five damage to the

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.509 
version and it'll add five damage to the
combo<00:02:36.659> but<00:02:37.379> I've<00:02:37.620> decided<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
combo but I've decided that the

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.930 
combo but I've decided that the
consistency<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.690> more<00:02:39.750> important<00:02:40.680> than<00:02:41.069> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
consistency is more important than the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.699 
consistency is more important than the
two<00:02:42.150> extra<00:02:42.510> damage<00:02:42.930> for<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.500> frame

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
two extra damage for the just frame

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.559 
two extra damage for the just frame
version<00:02:44.159> which<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.519> still<00:02:44.730> get<00:02:44.909> about<00:02:45.120> half<00:02:45.390> of

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
version which I still get about half of

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.190 
version which I still get about half of
the<00:02:45.720> time<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.849> about<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.450> added<00:02:48.810> damage

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the time so it's about for added damage

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.250 
the time so it's about for added damage
and<00:02:49.470> extra<00:02:50.040> carry<00:02:50.280> distance<00:02:50.900> now<00:02:51.900> what<00:02:52.109> I<00:02:52.139> do

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
and extra carry distance now what I do

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.229 
and extra carry distance now what I do

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
cross also then you have back to first

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:24.560 
cross also then you have back to first
and<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.140> timing<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.590> something<00:04:00.770> like<00:04:01.070> this
