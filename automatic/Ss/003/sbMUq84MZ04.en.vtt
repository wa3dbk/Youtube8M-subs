plan eating something bigger later on
tonight<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.970> think<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.109> tastes<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.470> like

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
tonight I think that tastes just like

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.830 
tonight I think that tastes just like
normal<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:45.630> little<00:02:45.810> bit<00:02:45.930> different<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:47.840> not

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
normal a little bit different just not

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.559 
normal a little bit different just not
enough<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.169> matter

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.890 

almost<00:02:53.290> like<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.470> bubblegum<00:02:53.830> flavor<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:57.900> don't

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
almost like a bubblegum flavor I don't

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.809 
almost like a bubblegum flavor I don't
think<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.200> like<00:02:59.439> it<00:02:59.680> as<00:02:59.829> much<00:02:59.860> as<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.459> regular

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
think I like it as much as the regular

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:01.679 
think I like it as much as the regular
every<00:03:01.209> there
