00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.540
 is a route hopefully known 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.799
 The country will also pass overtaking maneuvers 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.799
 Let's say a bit 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.310
 It took some getting used to 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.260
 hotel facilities and just ran first 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.300
 that is not bad if you are from the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.289
 cold winter arrives in europe then 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.150
 to soak up some sun 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 the situation is really very 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.020
 unusual now as the third driver 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.780
 to be there anyway, of course one 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.600
 clear task and goal to the team 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.649
 to help to succeed as 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.960
 test driver I will probably hardly to 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.329
 Nevertheless , I'm coming to all 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.100
 then run as a substitute driver as a reserve 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.629
 almost the case if the other two something 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.610
 what happens we do not hope 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.590
 and accordingly also in the tests 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.960
 already been there and then at 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.719
 to work the race around me 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.280
 see how everything works like eg 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.710
 Steering wheel the buttons will work in case 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.820
 I have to get started and could 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.379
 me now a few times 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.369
 contribute due to the experience of the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.619
 I'm in the last years 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.960
 I could collect everywhere and there 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.930
 few comments on different things 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.000
 So give the new point control 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.680
 I do not think big 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.280
 especially not for the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.100
 driver 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.990
 because we always try at the very front 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.880
 to overtake and win 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.290
 just because now the distance between 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.180
 first second and maybe also 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.119
 second and a little bit bigger 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.610
 not much on the tactics and the 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.210
 change aggressiveness 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.979
 In addition, the distance is if you the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.509
 in relation presupposes to the points 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.130
 between first and second and second 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.350
 and third place not very big 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 it is simply increased by a certain factor 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.790
 and and that's it and there's the difference 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.409
 because it was so small it was better 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.780
 From my point of view, the points too 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 leave as before alone for better ones 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.870
 comparisons can be drawn to 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.810
 past in terms of histories 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.340
 It is very important before the season 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.230
 especially in recent years 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.090
 and also in this season the 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.540
 Stability on foreman too 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.100
 bring 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.080
 but not as many tests have as 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.640
 in the past and various parts 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.330
 have to last much longer than before 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.800
 such as engine and gearboxes 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.500
 You look that then the kilometer 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.900
 is unwound additionally 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.760
 of course the car in the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.700
 basic features to understand before the first 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.240
 Run because of various tests to do something 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.950
 the feathers fabric trace everything possible 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.600
 concerns and again and again the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.850
 mature to understand this year 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.840
 also changed it a bit 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.190
 maybe also visible 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.790
 front tires are a bit faster 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.980
 become 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.830
 but also the mixture and construction 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.500
 is a bit different and that's 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.150
 a very important point you 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.170
 but which one does not always get 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.910
 can work out optimally until the last 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.110
 a little bit because of the temperatures 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.330
 Of course, very different and with the 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.610
 Winter tests as specially then in Bahrain 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.610
 Blamage 31 degrees on the mountain
