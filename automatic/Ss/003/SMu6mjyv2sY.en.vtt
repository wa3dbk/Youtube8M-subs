that<00:01:38.020> church<00:01:38.290> that<00:01:38.500> was<00:01:38.620> going<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.890> be<00:01:38.979> broken

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
that church that was going to be broken

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.070 
that church that was going to be broken
down<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.820> fall<00:01:40.060> over<00:01:40.299> that<00:01:40.450> clip<00:01:40.659> it<00:01:40.810> looks

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
down and fall over that clip it looks

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.320 
down and fall over that clip it looks
like<00:01:41.290> this<00:01:41.500> one<00:01:41.770> actually<00:01:42.010> is<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.060> same

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
like this one actually is the same

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.420 
like this one actually is the same
church<00:01:43.630> style<00:01:44.260> so<00:01:44.740> maybe<00:01:45.040> that's<00:01:45.310> this

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
church style so maybe that's this

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.160 
church style so maybe that's this
portion<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.090> game<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.810> we're<00:01:46.930> seeing

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
portion of the game that we're seeing

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.710 
portion of the game that we're seeing
this<00:01:47.560> map<00:01:47.799> come<00:01:48.100> from<00:01:48.370> ignition<00:01:48.970> looks<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.600> me

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
this map come from ignition looks to me

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.840 
this map come from ignition looks to me
like<00:01:49.750> an<00:01:50.080> old<00:01:50.350> tree<00:01:50.770> noble<00:01:51.130> type<00:01:51.340> effect<00:01:51.490> of

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
like an old tree noble type effect of

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.910 
like an old tree noble type effect of
map<00:01:52.090> something<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.750> we<00:01:52.869> saw<00:01:53.110> similar<00:01:53.680> to

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
map something that we saw similar to

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.200 
map something that we saw similar to
like<00:01:54.070> some<00:01:54.220> of<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.369> maps<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.700> call<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.119> duty

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
like some of the maps in call of duty

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.270 
like some of the maps in call of duty
modern<00:01:55.420> warfare<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.350> fourth<00:01:56.619> installment<00:01:57.010> of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
modern warfare the fourth installment of

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.980 
modern warfare the fourth installment of
quality<00:01:57.790> not<00:01:57.909> modern<00:01:58.299> warfare<00:01:58.450> 2<00:01:58.630> your<00:01:58.750> modern

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
quality not modern warfare 2 your modern

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.630 
quality not modern warfare 2 your modern
warfare<00:01:59.110> 3<00:01:59.260> so<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.010> looks<00:02:00.040> like<00:02:00.250> it's<00:02:00.430> gonna<00:02:00.490> be

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
warfare 3 so it looks like it's gonna be

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.460 
warfare 3 so it looks like it's gonna be
going<00:02:00.820> back<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.150> route<00:02:01.570> kind<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.110> think

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
going back to that route kind of I think

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.960 
going back to that route kind of I think
that'll<00:02:02.680> be<00:02:02.710> cool<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.040> see<00:02:03.100> because<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.850> can

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
that'll be cool to see because you can

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.030 
that'll be cool to see because you can
play<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.180> lot<00:02:04.540> around<00:02:04.840> with<00:02:05.110> some<00:02:05.320> cover<00:02:05.590> with

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
play a lot around with some cover with

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.560 
play a lot around with some cover with
lines<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.460> sight<00:02:06.670> with<00:02:07.000> things<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.330> can<00:02:07.540> be

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
lines of sight with things that can be

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.240 
lines of sight with things that can be
shot<00:02:07.930> through<00:02:08.229> because<00:02:08.679> of<00:02:08.860> all<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.039> sheet

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
shot through because of all the sheet

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.499 
shot through because of all the sheet
metal<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:09.640> that'd<00:02:09.759> be<00:02:09.879> really<00:02:10.030> cool<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.299> see

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
metal so that'd be really cool to see

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.479 
metal so that'd be really cool to see
that's<00:02:10.959> my<00:02:11.200> take<00:02:11.530> on<00:02:11.709> what<00:02:11.980> these<00:02:12.129> maps<00:02:12.340> are

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
that's my take on what these maps are

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.770 
that's my take on what these maps are
going<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.700> be<00:02:12.879> like<00:02:13.060> how<00:02:13.239> they're<00:02:13.390> gonna<00:02:13.450> play

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
going to be like how they're gonna play

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.420 
going to be like how they're gonna play
and<00:02:14.019> now<00:02:14.170> for<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.620> bonus<00:02:14.890> weapon<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and now for the bonus weapon the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.860 
and now for the bonus weapon the
Maverick<00:02:15.819> i'm<00:02:16.000> really<00:02:16.330> interested<00:02:16.540> how

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
Maverick i'm really interested how

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.420 
Maverick i'm really interested how
Infinity<00:02:17.349> Ward<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.590> going<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.860> let<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.130> play

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
Infinity Ward is going to let this play

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.550 
Infinity Ward is going to let this play
out<00:02:18.459> because<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.120> claims<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.690> as<00:02:19.780> an<00:02:19.900> AR<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.410> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
out because it claims it as an AR and a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.890 
out because it claims it as an AR and a
sniper<00:02:20.860> rifles<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.209> makes<00:02:22.510> me<00:02:22.660> really

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
sniper rifles so that is makes me really

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.790 
sniper rifles so that is makes me really
curious<00:02:23.170> maybe<00:02:23.560> there

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
curious maybe there

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.500 
curious maybe there
be<00:02:23.920> some<00:02:24.160> sort<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.490> burst<00:02:24.820> fire<00:02:25.030> attachment

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
be some sort of burst fire attachment

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.780 
be some sort of burst fire attachment
some<00:02:25.660> sort<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.050> semi<00:02:26.530> auto<00:02:26.770> attachment<00:02:27.430> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
some sort of semi auto attachment that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.370 
some sort of semi auto attachment that
it<00:02:27.880> has<00:02:28.060> built-in<00:02:28.660> where<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:28.990> can<00:02:29.110> switch

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
it has built-in where you can switch

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.250 
it has built-in where you can switch
from<00:02:29.980> say<00:02:30.490> fully<00:02:30.970> auto<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.570> a<00:02:31.600> single<00:02:31.990> shot

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
from say fully auto to a single shot

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.690 
from say fully auto to a single shot
long<00:02:32.590> range<00:02:32.830> where<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.100> can<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.400> put<00:02:33.640> a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
long range where you can like put a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.640 
long range where you can like put a
scope<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.360> we're<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:35.020> flips<00:02:35.350> across

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
scope on it we're like flips across

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.930 
scope on it we're like flips across
somewhat<00:02:36.070> like<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> thermal<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.850> the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
somewhat like the thermal and the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.760 
somewhat like the thermal and the
variable<00:02:37.390> zoom<00:02:37.540> do<00:02:37.810> where<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.410> just<00:02:38.560> flip

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
variable zoom do where you can just flip

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.200 
variable zoom do where you can just flip
to<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.920> side<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.430> think<00:02:39.700> that'd<00:02:39.820> be<00:02:39.910> cool<00:02:40.090> to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
to the side I think that'd be cool to

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.020 
to the side I think that'd be cool to
see<00:02:40.270> but<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.080> thing<00:02:41.410> with<00:02:41.590> gun<00:02:42.040> dlc<00:02:42.250> that

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
see but the thing with gun dlc that

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.490 
see but the thing with gun dlc that
scares<00:02:43.360> me<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.780> fact<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.140> has<00:02:44.350> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
scares me is the fact that it has the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.320 
scares me is the fact that it has the
potential<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.920> be<00:02:45.040> super<00:02:45.460> overpowered<00:02:46.210> and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
potential to be super overpowered and

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.360 
potential to be super overpowered and
very<00:02:46.900> unbalanced<00:02:47.650> that's<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:48.040> story<00:02:48.250> for

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
very unbalanced that's a story for

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.670 
very unbalanced that's a story for
another<00:02:48.550> time<00:02:48.820> but<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.810> my<00:02:50.050> concern<00:02:50.260> with

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
another time but that is my concern with

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.770 
another time but that is my concern with
it<00:02:50.890> as<00:02:51.040> for<00:02:51.550> extinction<00:02:51.940> I'm<00:02:52.240> pretty<00:02:52.660> excited

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
it as for extinction I'm pretty excited

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.270 
it as for extinction I'm pretty excited
to<00:02:53.320> see<00:02:53.470> what<00:02:53.650> they're<00:02:53.800> going<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.010> do<00:02:54.100> because

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
to see what they're going to do because

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.490 
to see what they're going to do because
the<00:02:54.670> regular<00:02:55.060> extinction<00:02:55.540> Matt<00:02:55.690> only<00:02:56.200> held<00:02:56.380> my

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
the regular extinction Matt only held my

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.960 
the regular extinction Matt only held my
interest<00:02:56.530> for<00:02:56.890> about<00:02:57.040> three<00:02:57.250> or<00:02:57.280> four<00:02:57.400> days<00:02:57.520> so

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
interest for about three or four days so

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.700 
interest for about three or four days so
it's<00:02:58.360> got<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.660> be<00:02:58.750> really<00:02:59.140> good<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.470> get<00:02:59.590> me
