table put your adhesive on the front of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.590 
table put your adhesive on the front of
this<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.579> put<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> middle<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
this you can put it in the middle of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960 
this you can put it in the middle of
these<00:02:06.719> little<00:02:06.899> grooves<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.920> whatever<00:02:08.849> you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
these little grooves and whatever you

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.669 
these little grooves and whatever you
want<00:02:09.239> make<00:02:09.660> sure<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.170> design<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.619> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
want make sure that your design that you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.600 
want make sure that your design that you
cut<00:02:10.920> out<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.280> at<00:02:11.790> least<00:02:12.030> well<00:02:12.780> not<00:02:13.020> at<00:02:13.110> least

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
cut out is at least well not at least

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.190 
cut out is at least well not at least
it<00:02:13.880> has<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.030> little<00:02:14.180> bit<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.360> excess<00:02:14.780> room<00:02:15.080> on

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
it has a little bit of excess room on

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.050 
it has a little bit of excess room on
each<00:02:15.290> side<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:15.770> can<00:02:15.890> wrap<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.280> around<00:02:16.790> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
each side so you can wrap it around the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.740 
each side so you can wrap it around the
crevices<00:02:17.660> on<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.870> side<00:02:18.080> here<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.940> basically

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
crevices on the side here so basically

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.110 
crevices on the side here so basically
all<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.050> do<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.380> just<00:02:21.620> cut<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.130> if<00:02:22.610> it's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
all you do is just cut it out if it's

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.440 
all you do is just cut it out if it's
fabric<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.690> works<00:02:23.900> phenomenal<00:02:24.710> phenomenal

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
fabric it works phenomenal phenomenal

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.570 
fabric it works phenomenal phenomenal

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
that's what I did for my shamrock and it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.160 
that's what I did for my shamrock and it
looks<00:02:28.880> absolutely<00:02:29.180> great<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.840> got<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.020> at<00:02:30.140> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
looks absolutely great it got it at the

place it on your design make sure that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.290 
place it on your design make sure that
the<00:02:45.980> adhesive<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.520> on<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.760> back<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
the adhesive is on the back of the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.900 
the adhesive is on the back of the
design<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.870> on<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.440> front<00:02:48.740> of<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.130> press

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.880 
design and on the front of this press
down<00:02:50.150> for<00:02:50.390> about<00:02:50.540> five<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.870> ten<00:02:51.170> minutes<00:02:51.200> so

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
down for about five to ten minutes so

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.530 
down for about five to ten minutes so
that<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.160> gets<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.550> secure<00:02:52.910> connection<00:02:53.150> after

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
that it gets a secure connection after

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.500 
that it gets a secure connection after
that<00:02:54.400> man<00:02:55.400> you're<00:02:55.580> pretty<00:02:55.730> much<00:02:55.910> all<00:02:56.120> done<00:02:56.300> all

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
that man you're pretty much all done all

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.050 
that man you're pretty much all done all
you<00:02:56.690> got<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.930> do<00:02:57.020> is<00:02:57.260> just<00:02:57.770> trim<00:02:58.100> off<00:02:58.130> any

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
you got to do is just trim off any

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.440 
you got to do is just trim off any
excess<00:02:59.270> that<00:02:59.900> does<00:03:00.110> not<00:03:01.000> come<00:03:02.000> over<00:03:02.360> the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
excess that does not come over the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.600 
excess that does not come over the
crevice<00:03:02.810> if<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.350> does<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.220> take<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.459> little

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
crevice if it does you can take a little

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.979 
crevice if it does you can take a little
bit<00:03:04.760> more<00:03:04.880> super<00:03:05.239> glue<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.540> glue<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.959> the

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
bit more super glue and glue it to the

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.229 
bit more super glue and glue it to the
back<00:03:06.320> so<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.100> completely<00:03:07.550> surrounds

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
back so that it completely surrounds

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.180 
back so that it completely surrounds
this<00:03:08.330> whole<00:03:08.630> logo<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:09.290> then<00:03:09.770> once<00:03:10.040> you're

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
this whole logo and then once you're

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.940 
this whole logo and then once you're
done<00:03:10.900> take<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.930> look<00:03:12.110> at<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.320> make<00:03:12.620> sure<00:03:12.650> it's

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
done take a look at it make sure it's

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.530 
done take a look at it make sure it's
you<00:03:13.489> know<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.700> way<00:03:13.820> you<00:03:13.880> want<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.330> because

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
you know the way you want it because

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.910 
you know the way you want it because
you're<00:03:14.959> going<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.140> be<00:03:15.200> putting<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.680> little<00:03:15.860> bit

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
you're going to be putting a little bit

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.220 
you're going to be putting a little bit
of<00:03:16.220> superglue<00:03:16.700> in<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.030> hole<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.019> came

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
of superglue in the hole that it came

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.229 
of superglue in the hole that it came
out<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.310> creates<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.910> tight

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
out of so that it creates a tight

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.180 
out of so that it creates a tight
connection<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.650> won't<00:03:21.830> fall<00:03:22.160> out

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
connection and that it won't fall out

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.250 
connection and that it won't fall out
especially<00:03:23.000> when<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.540> do<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.660> check<00:03:23.959> if<00:03:24.140> you

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
especially when you do a check if you

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.229 
especially when you do a check if you
have<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.410> tank<00:03:24.739> you<00:03:25.400> know<00:03:25.519> last<00:03:25.790> thing<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.090> want

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
have a tank you know last thing you want

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.720 
have a tank you know last thing you want
to<00:03:26.299> do<00:03:26.420> is<00:03:26.600> do<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> wrap<00:03:27.200> checker<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:28.370> know<00:03:28.489> like

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
to do is do a wrap checker you know like

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.130 
to do is do a wrap checker you know like
a<00:03:28.760> poke<00:03:29.000> check<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:29.660> know<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> thing<00:03:29.989> just

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
a poke check and you know the thing just

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.600 
a poke check and you know the thing just
pops<00:03:30.440> right<00:03:30.560> out<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:32.500> definitely<00:03:33.519> when<00:03:34.519> you

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
pops right out so definitely when you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.160 
pops right out so definitely when you
insert<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:34.970> back<00:03:35.239> in<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.810> going<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.080> be<00:03:36.140> a

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
insert it back in is going to be a

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.110 
insert it back in is going to be a
little<00:03:36.260> plastic<00:03:36.680> piece<00:03:37.130> in<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.670> middle<00:03:37.700> that

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
little plastic piece in the middle that

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.060 
little plastic piece in the middle that
comes<00:03:38.780> out<00:03:39.019> so<00:03:39.440> you're<00:03:39.590> going<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.769> be<00:03:39.860> putting

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
comes out so you're going to be putting

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.479 
comes out so you're going to be putting
some<00:03:40.880> super<00:03:41.150> glue<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:42.500> whole<00:03:42.890> going

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
some super glue on the whole going

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.590 
some super glue on the whole going
inside<00:03:43.910> as<00:03:44.810> well<00:03:44.870> as<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.440> little<00:03:46.360> piece<00:03:47.360> that's

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
inside as well as a little piece that's

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.820 
inside as well as a little piece that's
going<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.870> stick<00:03:48.049> out<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.380> back<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.709> this

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
going to stick out in the back of this

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.699 
going to stick out in the back of this
so<00:03:49.430> yeah<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.540> when<00:03:50.690> you're<00:03:50.780> done<00:03:50.930> pop<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.680> back

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
so yeah so when you're done pop it back

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.280 
so yeah so when you're done pop it back
in<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:53.000> should<00:03:53.209> have<00:03:53.239> an<00:03:53.540> awesome<00:03:53.900> custom

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
in and you should have an awesome custom

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.080 
in and you should have an awesome custom
stick<00:03:54.500> like<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.799> said<00:03:55.070> it<00:03:55.519> works<00:03:55.760> with<00:03:55.970> the

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
stick like I said it works with the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.220 
stick like I said it works with the
optics<00:03:56.750> optic<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.769> optic<00:03:58.459> high<00:03:58.489> school<00:03:59.230> the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
optics optic you optic high school the

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.470 
optics optic you optic high school the
tank<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.840> I<00:04:02.840> do<00:04:02.989> believe<00:04:03.320> it<00:04:03.650> will<00:04:03.769> work<00:04:03.799> with

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
tank and I do believe it will work with

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.340 
tank and I do believe it will work with
actually<00:04:05.480> now<00:04:05.600> those<00:04:05.780> are<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:06.019> only<00:04:06.110> three

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
actually now those are the only three

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.410 
actually now those are the only three
heads<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.680> I<00:04:06.769> know<00:04:06.830> so<00:04:07.220> far<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.610> wouldn't

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
heads that I know so far I wouldn't

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.690 
heads that I know so far I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:08.690> doing<00:04:08.900> it<00:04:09.200> on<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.320> rable<00:04:09.799> newer

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
recommend doing it on a rable newer

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.789 
recommend doing it on a rable newer
rables<00:04:11.180> because<00:04:11.480> those<00:04:11.750> types<00:04:12.079> of<00:04:12.200> jewels<00:04:12.440> are

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
rables because those types of jewels are

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.370 
rables because those types of jewels are
really<00:04:13.250> indented<00:04:13.820> and<00:04:14.030> taking<00:04:14.810> those<00:04:14.930> out<00:04:15.170> can

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
really indented and taking those out can

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.440 
really indented and taking those out can
really<00:04:15.709> damage<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.130> stick<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.180> highly

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
really damage the stick so I highly

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.599 
really damage the stick so I highly
suggest<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:18.019> don't<00:04:18.169> do<00:04:18.380> that<00:04:18.560> but<00:04:19.459> if<00:04:19.549> you

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
suggest you don't do that but if you

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.900 
suggest you don't do that but if you
want<00:04:19.790> to<00:04:19.850> get<00:04:20.000> more<00:04:20.180> creative<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:21.500> could<00:04:21.650> also

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
want to get more creative you could also

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.270 
want to get more creative you could also
take<00:04:22.910> this<00:04:23.090> piece<00:04:23.360> off<00:04:23.539> and<00:04:24.140> make<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.070> whole

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
take this piece off and make the whole

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.220 
take this piece off and make the whole
design

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
design

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.780 
design
actually<00:04:26.620> create<00:04:27.010> an<00:04:27.130> hit<00:04:27.280> because<00:04:27.490> there<00:04:27.670> is

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
actually create an hit because there is

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.370 
actually create an hit because there is
a<00:04:27.820> crevasse<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.300> goes<00:04:28.600> in<00:04:28.840> here<00:04:29.170> so

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
a crevasse that goes in here so

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.560 
a crevasse that goes in here so
technically<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.790> could<00:04:30.910> actually<00:04:31.120> raise

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
technically you could actually raise

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.260 
technically you could actually raise
some<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.710> bullhorns<00:04:33.040> going<00:04:33.790> up<00:04:33.910> here<00:04:34.120> if

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
some like bullhorns going up here if

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.240 
some like bullhorns going up here if
your<00:04:34.390> team<00:04:34.600> is<00:04:34.630> like<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.680> know<00:04:35.800> like<00:04:35.830> the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
your team is like you know like the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.360 
your team is like you know like the
Mustangs<00:04:37.240> or<00:04:37.600> whatever<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.170> is<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:39.070> can<00:04:39.160> do<00:04:39.250> it

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
Mustangs or whatever it is you can do it

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.090 
Mustangs or whatever it is you can do it
like<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:40.360> can<00:04:40.510> make<00:04:40.690> your<00:04:40.870> image<00:04:41.290> it

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
like that you can make your image it

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.440 
like that you can make your image it
doesn't<00:04:42.400> have<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.550> be<00:04:42.640> a<00:04:42.760> circle<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.240> can<00:04:43.330> even

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
doesn't have to be a circle it can even

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.710 
doesn't have to be a circle it can even
