00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
go a sighting of reg look they're both

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.640 
go a sighting of reg look they're both
there<00:01:08.770> okay<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:10.130> like<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:10.460> not<00:01:11.470> okay<00:01:12.470> it's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
faces have actually pulled that back too

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.230 
faces have actually pulled that back too
far<00:01:22.130> let's<00:01:23.380> jump<00:01:24.380> over<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:25.000> translate<00:01:26.000> tool

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
far let's jump over to translate tool

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.810 
far let's jump over to translate tool
and<00:01:26.450> just<00:01:26.479> let's<00:01:26.840> move<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:28.040> forward<00:01:28.580> a

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
and just let's move that forward a

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:37.440 
and just let's move that forward a
little<00:01:29.030> bit<00:01:29.150> on<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.960> side<00:01:30.200> access<00:01:35.860> key

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
little bit on the side access key

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.560 
little bit on the side access key
but<00:01:37.770> I'm<00:01:38.770> just<00:01:38.920> going<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:39.219> create<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.240> new<00:01:40.360> set

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
but I'm just going to create a new set

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.219 
but I'm just going to create a new set
of<00:01:40.659> faces<00:01:40.869> here<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.649> just<00:01:41.890> extrude<00:01:42.399> these<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
of faces here and just extrude these and

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:52.770 
of faces here and just extrude these and
what's<00:01:48.840> extrude<00:01:49.840> again<00:01:50.820> W<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:52.000> move<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.600> I'll

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
what's extrude again W to move and I'll

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
to the e key and we'll just scale that

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:08.009 
to the e key and we'll just scale that
down<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.390> be<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.990> bevel<00:02:06.509> right<00:02:07.509> click<00:02:07.840> to
