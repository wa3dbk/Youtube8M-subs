00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.890
 the catch-up game of the 24 day of the wsv 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.619
 is a guest in the great msv arena in 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.359
 schowinsland-travel-arena dws ford 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.670
 yes, still a game less than 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.769
 the ssvg velbert as the table leader 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 Today, the HSV can at least by the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.439
 pull right away and save four 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 points to the ssvg approach after four 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.190
 the wsv has won so far 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.290
 every case self-confidence fueled here 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.360
 are the highlights and the highlights 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.770
 this catch-up game here from duisburg 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.770
 from and with web tv 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.420
 alex thamm 121 here in the schauinsland 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.830
 Traveling in Duisburg you have the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.770
 end-effect started too late right 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.940
 to play football 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.700
 I think football played today 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.840
 relatively little but we have then 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.610
 at least in the second half 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.860
 started fighting football and us 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.910
 then you can fight over somewhere 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.500
 also found a way into the game 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.330
 And of course our goal is disappointed 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.280
 It was actually the remaining eight 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.560
 all games to win and in that respect 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.970
 clear early arrears got there 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.140
 again even came back well 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.370
 relatively early in the second half 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.260
 had then I think a good 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.440
 half an hour later the game is still closed 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.030
 to decide our favor but yes 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.230
 the duisburgers have also done well 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.459
 then somehow always have 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.540
 that could be dangerous again 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.970
 out the back or last five minutes 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.410
 then we can have opened 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.640
 even be happy for that 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.229
 taken out point 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.390
 it was similar in score from the score 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.800
 you never need 01 to wake up 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.380
 I think you can say that 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.340
 second time was I look why 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.419
 does not have it in the first half 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.639
 it worked the two best 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.900
 defensive of the league the ones named here 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.540
 have played what a first 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.130
 half-time the crack point when I do that 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.110
 knew or even in the first 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.300
 halftime would have known then would 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.330
 that certainly is clear 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.590
 of course the duisburgers are for me 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.940
 playful maybe the best 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.680
 team in the league that are 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.660
 of course, too, at ease and 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.490
 can play relatively freely and me 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.660
 think they have games before today too 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.550
 the info gets that team 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.800
 remain today are without a sample 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.740
 been without professional support here 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.270
 which, of course, for the more qualitative 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.550
 far and away a worsening 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.720
 Can only be thought of as a team can do something like that 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.270
 Of course, push sometimes if you then 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.440
 really allowed to trippeln with the guys on 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.910
 have on the weekend or today 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.010
 Thursdays with the one also the week 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.419
 trained over and in that respect the goods 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.910
 highly motivated they can also kick 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.960
 the boys and we are why too 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.090
 always not in the right way 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.890
 come for that there are none 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.120
 real explanation there was simply 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.060
 unfortunately at half-time 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.530
 and then we are on it 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.280
 also sworn an announcement of 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.169
 our goalie 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.490
 that was if anything even football today 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.310
 at least we can not make it to the ass 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.510
 and I think there can 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.800
 I put the hand in the fire for everyone 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.690
 that is what we have today in the 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.760
 second half at least made point 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.020
 taken away not lost here 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.930
 an insight into the team 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.490
 resign hanging heads now 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.140
 sadness or what's now a 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.159
 reaction as the next days are looking up 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.950
 sunday is already on 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:02.229
 yes i mean i can start it 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.419
 cut out what football is always 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.590
 Everything is possible fact is current 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.130
 the game right here are seven 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.500
 games 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.880
 we have six points residue + that 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.450
 Goal difference whatever course 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.620
 Considerable we can not do that 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.120
 last dependent play the season completely 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.979
 normal to the end our goal is to 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.270
 or today the new goal is then the 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.220
 to win next seven games 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.479
 that's going to be hard enough and then it's on 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.650
 something else happens to the other places 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:25.630
 or not the light anyway not in 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.810
 our hand we still play 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.070
 a good season a very good season 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.450
 really play in velbert 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.120
 Outstanding season I believe if you are 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.930
 20 games in a row does not lose then 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.710
 is that also worth noting and 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.720
 currently there are six points 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.890
 but we will continue as normal 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.970
 We will become that and we will train 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.370
 maybe start up a bit more 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.599
 and just believe it until the end 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.729
 Anything else does not stay with us anyway 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:51.450
 over ne and fight on until sunday 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.450
