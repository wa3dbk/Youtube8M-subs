00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.710
 And, well, people, welcome, another video of 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.200
 epilogue of the commented here who speaks is the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.910
 kimi and this time I'll comment on this 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.029
 from there I had with you 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.210
 mythical young man then he is doing 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.340
 several lines and a game that he is 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.590
 using these lives is the 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.680
 apb reloaded and I'm participating 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:44.079
 it is today had a 10 at morning 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.860
 tomorrow will have a live morning of e gt 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.770
 to samp and on Saturday will be another cam of 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.080
 tv that I should attend too 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.080
 if you want to see a gameplay more 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.170
 relaxed and not very informative and 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.630
 such more entertainment can even be there 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.680
 takes a look at what we're up 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.470
 amusing enough and not bbc brazil 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.930
 they released the marketplace you 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:19.509
 they could see there in game play that I am 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:21.700
 with 111 lander nec is a name or that 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.340
 car is very good I'm using 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.420
 he for the first time he can 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.359
 stun multiple shots and still have a 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.460
 time very good smp staff 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.249
 in particular was one of our 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.850
 The best of the day we tried several 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:42.969
 often play a relaxed match and 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.600
 but we ended up getting very 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:50.590
 The Brazilian baby is at the level of 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.500
 player technique very high then 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.719
 for you to play right you 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.060
 will need a team will need 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:01.240
 communication has to know the main 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.390
 enemy and you have to go if you go 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.350
 knowing the enemy's support for Spanish 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.869
 in your team 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.899
 because if the team was born in the north by 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:16.030
 example, the enemy team will never 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:20.760
 also in the north because it is always the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.980
 opposite side of your team's back 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.750
 hence he was joining with a 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.640
 I'm from brf 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.120
 we got a support one pro 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.790
 another but spoke like where the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.860
 enemy was and so could we 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:42.299
 do several types xix and moreover 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.260
 defend the staff more easily 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:49.269
 the brazil he is there without lag 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.549
 enjoy downloading had a video on 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.569
 that I did with a mythical one that is also 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.489
 on his channel 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.220
 if you did not see I can talk to see you 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.790
 leave in the description which was very very 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.790
 beast 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.620
 then personal and if they bought some 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.290
 weapons 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.430
 the cars of the marketplace you 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.820
 prefer what I've seen many people prize 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.120
 buying sg from usp 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.870
 but I advise you not to spend the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.450
 cash on weapons because various weapons 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.240
 can have the same effect giving a 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.910
 example in the usp 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.510
 You can have a hollow with it. 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.860
 best 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.640
 Rocam to infections with three CorÃ­ntians 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.740
 3 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.300
 she was very good even then there is not 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.410
 need 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.410
 Do you buy a motorbike twister? 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.850
 I'd rather buy the cars with four 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.390
 slots because it increases as I go 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.360
 progressing in the game I am releasing the 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.380
 modifications and so I'm going to have a car 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.600
 best 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.880
 how would you like a better car? 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.280
 have a car that could lock in a 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.340
 car that will take nitro to run 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.240
 so you have to choose the right one 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.240
 car you will use 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:18.019
 I used to prefer vegas but the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:22.040
 vegas he is fast but his direction is 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.620
 Very bad , we were already there. 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.470
 in near the end of the mission 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.480
 we were able to defend these two 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.160
 these two cars they had to 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.050
 pick up and return to this place but it was 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.660
 well frenetic and gameplay I liked it 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.590
 enough so I wanted to show 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.170
 you 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.540
 Now notice the gameplay that I was going to 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.440
 said that we are not together in a 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.540
 place because this is due to the 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.220
 goals that are separate 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.200
 so if he was together in that 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.720
 construction where the mythical is 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.450
 You can see his name, he has the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.040
 vision of a goal only and I wanted to 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.310
 have the vision of the two 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.700
 so I would get ahead 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.240
 make the enemy close 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.419
 him and talk when the guys are 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.410
 invading and climbing the ladder 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.980
 you're not going up there and where road 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:25.100
 they managed to climb in Christmas the mixed 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.120
 they climbed in 2 and killed him but did not 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.620
 I got one and I got away. 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.620
 Of course we were able to clean 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.830
 area again and then he came back to 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.850
 this place is not compare because it is already a 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.580
 place and is the only place where 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:48.830
 you would have a good view of the goal of 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:52.820
 goal and the rest of the team 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.730
 It was spread apart. 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:59.030
 There will come a time there that I have in 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.130
 mind starts to want to kill me and a 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.620
 thing that i hate when you turn 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.200
 Baute and at your limit 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.310
 he simply wants the money that you 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.130
 Woods 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.360
 there is no need you wait for departure 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:17.540
 End up doing this because it's not cool. 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.680
 because if you kill the gift trolley 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.190
 your group 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.720
 You may end up losing a goal. 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.630
 remembering our 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.160
 commemoration of an enrollment car that 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.460
 is the trailer for apb 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.000
 I'll do it on Saturday, it's a day. 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.280
 that everyone is free is relaxed and 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.890
 There are no obstacles 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.740
 and how am I going to do is decide 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:45.100
 to do by means of live that I will be able to 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.380
 organize staff and who do not have 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.050
 participating in the scene will be able to see how 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:55.850
 work is working and so the 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:59.630
 people record several scenes, I edit and 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:03.110
 people can end up on Saturday and 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:06.140
 Sunday will have the well-edited trailer 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.200
 It's very cute, I want to do it. 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.740
 a cool thing an epic thing I want 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.900
 do the workout 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:19.550
 so it's going to be a pretty cool thing to 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:21.890
 to participate with you, let's also do 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.370
 something well organized is not going to be the game 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:27.700
 play specifically yes some scenarios 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:31.360
 pretty cool 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.440
 the staff is this if you liked the game 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.050
 left 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.660
 If you did not like it and want to help 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.700
 divulge leaves the favorite and also not 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.430
 forget to comment that it's one thing 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:45.820
 very important then he comments on what 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.770
 Did you find the air update but if you 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:51.520
 Are you liking brazil tv? 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:54.130
 these things like that or something that 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.550
 can become a subject of video in the future 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:08:00.100
 which also tips are welcome and 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:03.600
 Constructive criticism also 

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.600
 That's what I said
