playing<00:02:38.200> well<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:39.610> never<00:02:39.730> know<00:02:39.880> there<00:02:40.090> might

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
playing well you never know there might

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.050 
playing well you never know there might
be<00:02:40.270> another<00:02:40.480> spot<00:02:40.810> out<00:02:41.020> there<00:02:41.080> for<00:02:41.890> 2010<00:02:42.460> so

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
be another spot out there for 2010 so

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.450 
be another spot out there for 2010 so
that's<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.300> first<00:02:43.510> thing<00:02:43.660> individually<00:02:44.230> but

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
that's the first thing individually but

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.160 
that's the first thing individually but
most<00:02:45.460> importantly<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.150> think<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.750> team<00:02:46.930> goal

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
most importantly I think the team goal

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.010 
most importantly I think the team goal
is<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.470> make<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.680> playoffs<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.100> year<00:02:49.020> Frank
