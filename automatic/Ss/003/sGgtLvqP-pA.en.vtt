hello everyone today I want to present

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.950 
hello everyone today I want to present
my<00:00:03.210> first<00:00:03.830> aquaponic<00:00:04.830> system<00:00:05.480> it's<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.720> flow

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
my first aquaponic system it's a flow

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.570 
my first aquaponic system it's a flow
and<00:00:07.140> drain<00:00:08.240> based<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.860> Japan<00:00:10.860> aquaponics

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
and drain based on the Japan aquaponics

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.060 
and drain based on the Japan aquaponics
system<00:00:12.259> consisting<00:00:13.259> only<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:14.009> Ikea<00:00:14.759> parts

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
system consisting only on of Ikea parts

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.710 
system consisting only on of Ikea parts
thank<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.220> very<00:00:17.310> much<00:00:17.430> for<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.699> idea<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
thank you very much for this idea so the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.140 
thank you very much for this idea so the
nice<00:00:18.869> part<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.010> everyone<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.609> build<00:00:20.939> it

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
nice part is that everyone can build it

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.529 
nice part is that everyone can build it
like<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> very<00:00:22.590> tiny<00:00:23.010> pump<00:00:23.539> going

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
like that I have a very tiny pump going

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.839 
like that I have a very tiny pump going
in<00:00:24.810> there<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.529> can<00:00:25.680> even<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> details<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
in there you can even see the details of

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.490 
in there you can even see the details of
it<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.560> six<00:00:29.460> VAT<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:33.290> it<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
it so it's a six VAT and it is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.170 
it so it's a six VAT and it is
configurable<00:00:35.160> that's<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.610> nice<00:00:35.790> thing<00:00:36.090> about

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
configurable that's the nice thing about

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.000 
configurable that's the nice thing about
it<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:38.190> siphon<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.710> based

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it I have a siphon here and it's based

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.340 
it I have a siphon here and it's based
on<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.579> half<00:00:41.940> non<00:00:42.300> siphon<00:00:42.930> which<00:00:43.170> is

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
on the half non siphon which is

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.069 
on the half non siphon which is
consisting<00:00:44.070> only<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> two<00:00:44.550> parts<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.780> three

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
consisting only of two parts not three

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.350 
consisting only of two parts not three
just<00:00:46.350> two<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:48.120> made

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
just two and as you can see it's made

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.400 
just two and as you can see it's made
out<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:49.520> plastic<00:00:50.520> bottles<00:00:51.800> this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:54.199> very<00:00:55.199> nice

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
out of plastic bottles this is very nice

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.020 
out of plastic bottles this is very nice
as<00:00:55.590> well<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:56.190> everyone<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.910> like

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
as well because everyone can do it like

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
as well because everyone can do it like
that<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:58.199> flow<00:00:58.469> rate<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.890> very<00:00:59.010> low<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:01.609> it's

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that the flow rate is very low and it's

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.759 
that the flow rate is very low and it's
consciously<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.899> am<00:01:04.199> experimenting

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
consciously like that I am experimenting

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.719 
consciously like that I am experimenting
to<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> very<00:01:05.760> small<00:01:06.150> pump<00:01:06.530> consuming

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
to have a very small pump consuming

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.450 
to have a very small pump consuming
their<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:09.090> energy<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.380> even<00:01:10.770> maybe

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
their little energy so we can even maybe

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.719 
their little energy so we can even maybe
operate<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.810> our<00:01:13.610> battery<00:01:14.610> in

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
operate it from the so our battery in

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.840 
operate it from the so our battery in
the<00:01:14.850> future<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.250> right<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.490> see<00:01:17.820> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the future and right now you see that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.649 
the future and right now you see that
the<00:01:18.810> siphon<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> start<00:01:20.509> first<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
the siphon is about to start first a

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.289 
the siphon is about to start first a
little<00:01:24.710> little<00:01:25.710> bit<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> water<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.670> flowing

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
little little bit of water is flowing

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.350 
little little bit of water is flowing
through<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.040> second<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.549> should<00:01:29.880> flow

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
through and in a second it should flow

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.359 
through and in a second it should flow
more<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.810> and

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
more and more so we will see that and

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.350 
more and more so we will see that and
you<00:01:35.369> see<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> side<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:38.579> water<00:01:38.759> level

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
you see here on the side the water level

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.160 
you see here on the side the water level
I<00:01:39.540> will<00:01:39.990> focus<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> little<00:01:40.950> bit<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
I will focus that a little bit like that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.860 
I will focus that a little bit like that
so

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
so

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.520 
so
there<00:01:45.870> you<00:01:46.020> go<00:01:46.230> should<00:01:46.710> start<00:01:47.040> any<00:01:47.160> second<00:01:48.530> so

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
there you go should start any second so

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.640 
there you go should start any second so
let's<00:01:49.980> take<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> look<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.760> again<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.650> there

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
let's take a look here again and there

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.540 
let's take a look here again and there
you<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:52.980> it<00:01:53.220> starts<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.180> flow<00:01:54.510> properly<00:01:55.550> size

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
you go it starts to flow properly size

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.880 
you go it starts to flow properly size
and<00:01:56.790> kicks<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.800> everything<00:02:01.800> is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
and kicks in you see that everything is

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.770 
and kicks in you see that everything is
flowing<00:02:02.160> out<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.100> average<00:02:05.400> time<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.750> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
flowing out so the average time for a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.750 
flowing out so the average time for a
complete<00:02:07.080> cycle<00:02:07.800> folder<00:02:08.190> right<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:08.550> between

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
complete cycle folder right now between

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.690 
complete cycle folder right now between
two<00:02:09.090> robots<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.840> around<00:02:10.380> eight<00:02:10.590> minutes<00:02:12.230> and

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
two robots is around eight minutes and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.380 
two robots is around eight minutes and
it's<00:02:14.700> flowing<00:02:15.120> now<00:02:15.270> really<00:02:15.570> really<00:02:15.870> fast

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
it's flowing now really really fast

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.120 
it's flowing now really really fast
it's<00:02:18.390> going<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.780> over<00:02:19.110> soon<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.770> we<00:02:19.920> have

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
it's going to be over soon so we have

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.610 
it's going to be over soon so we have
done<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.490> complete<00:02:21.110> cycle<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.170> order<00:02:24.290> let's<00:02:25.290> see

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
done a complete cycle of order let's see

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.900 
done a complete cycle of order let's see
how<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.010> will<00:02:26.160> stop<00:02:27.590> meanwhile<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.920> will<00:02:29.730> show

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
how it will stop meanwhile I will show

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.510 
how it will stop meanwhile I will show
the<00:02:29.970> system<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.390> little<00:02:30.600> bit<00:02:30.720> for<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.140> sides<00:02:32.130> so

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
the system a little bit for the sides so

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.180 
the system a little bit for the sides so
you<00:02:32.550> see<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:34.430> can<00:02:35.510> find<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.690> at<00:02:37.290> IKEA<00:02:37.770> at

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
you see that you can find it at IKEA at

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.640 
you see that you can find it at IKEA at
a<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:38.550> IKEA<00:02:39.060> store<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.900> consisting

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
a very IKEA store that it's consisting

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.460 
a very IKEA store that it's consisting
of<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:40.920> frame<00:02:41.990> two<00:02:43.370> ports<00:02:44.370> then<00:02:45.320> which<00:02:46.320> is

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
of this frame two ports then which is

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.060 
of this frame two ports then which is
those<00:02:46.710> grow<00:02:47.070> beds<00:02:47.370> which<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.970> one<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:49.070> 25

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
those grow beds which this one is 25

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.790 
those grow beds which this one is 25
litres<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.720> 50<00:02:52.020> liters<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.560> think

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
litres and this is 50 liters I think

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.860 
litres and this is 50 liters I think
that<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.220> can<00:02:53.400> see<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.730> exactly<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.260> brand<00:02:56.870> so

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that you can see it exactly the brand so

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.750 
that you can see it exactly the brand so
that's<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.590> one<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.190> find

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
that's the one you can find

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.920 
that's the one you can find
and<00:03:00.530> yeah<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.830> siphon<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.340> about<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.820> stop<00:03:03.150> so

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
and yeah the siphon is about to stop so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.830 
and yeah the siphon is about to stop so
stopping<00:03:06.930> right<00:03:07.170> now

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.030 

so<00:03:10.840> yeah<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.500> think<00:03:11.620> that's<00:03:12.129> over<00:03:13.200> no<00:03:14.200> oh

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
so yeah I think that's over no oh

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.869 
so yeah I think that's over no oh
now<00:03:15.280> okay<00:03:15.730> now<00:03:15.970> it's<00:03:16.209> completely<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:18.040> inside

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
now okay now it's completely so inside

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.789 
now okay now it's completely so inside
its<00:03:19.540> solve<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:20.950> what<00:03:21.129> we<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.690> it's

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
its solve this is what we have it's

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:30.449 
its solve this is what we have it's
basically<00:03:25.560> one<00:03:26.560> liter<00:03:26.920> bottle<00:03:28.049> cutoff<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.459> I

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
basically one liter bottle cutoff and I

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.460 
basically one liter bottle cutoff and I
stuck<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.330> into<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:32.879> beginning<00:03:33.879> of<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.540> PVC

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
stuck it into this beginning of a PVC

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.690 
stuck it into this beginning of a PVC
pipe<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.450> rather<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.870> closing<00:03:38.680> part<00:03:39.010> for<00:03:39.250> PVC

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
pipe it is rather a closing part for PVC

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.210 
pipe it is rather a closing part for PVC
pipe<00:03:39.909> I<00:03:39.940> just<00:03:40.329> put<00:03:41.049> some<00:03:41.079> holes<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.799> there<00:03:42.010> and

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
pipe I just put some holes in there and

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.600 
pipe I just put some holes in there and
at<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.239> bottom<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.750> has<00:03:43.780> some<00:03:44.230> space<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.190> flow

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
at the bottom it has some space so flow

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.680 
at the bottom it has some space so flow
water<00:03:46.450> can<00:03:46.750> flow<00:03:47.019> from<00:03:47.260> all<00:03:47.410> sides<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.940> on<00:03:49.510> top

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
water can flow from all sides and on top

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.270 
water can flow from all sides and on top
of<00:03:49.840> it<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.170> just<00:03:50.410> another<00:03:50.829> bottle<00:03:52.890> with<00:03:53.890> some

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
of it is just another bottle with some

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.030 
of it is just another bottle with some
cuts<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.359> here<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:57.190> all<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:58.000> really<00:03:58.060> need<00:03:58.660> is

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
cuts in here so all you really need is

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.819 
cuts in here so all you really need is
actually<00:04:00.040> this<00:04:00.280> poured<00:04:00.640> in<00:04:00.790> here<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.390> do<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.829> so

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
actually this poured in here to do it so

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.490 
actually this poured in here to do it so
the<00:04:03.190> rest<00:04:03.430> can<00:04:03.819> be<00:04:03.970> found<00:04:04.269> from<00:04:04.569> recyclable

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
the rest can be found from recyclable

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.550 
the rest can be found from recyclable
materials<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.540> think<00:04:07.540> that's<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.959> good<00:04:08.109> thing<00:04:08.170> to

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
materials I think that's a good thing to

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.740 
materials I think that's a good thing to
start<00:04:08.620> with<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:10.470> my<00:04:11.470> next<00:04:11.620> step<00:04:11.739> will<00:04:12.010> be<00:04:12.069> to

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
start with so my next step will be to

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.560 
start with so my next step will be to
fill<00:04:13.750> it<00:04:13.870> up<00:04:13.959> with<00:04:14.200> grow<00:04:14.790> I'll<00:04:15.790> do<00:04:16.000> it<00:04:16.090> soon<00:04:16.329> and

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
fill it up with grow I'll do it soon and

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.909 
fill it up with grow I'll do it soon and
then<00:04:16.720> we'll<00:04:16.900> start<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.260> second<00:04:17.560> link<00:04:17.650> so<00:04:17.889> I

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
then we'll start the second link so I

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.789 
then we'll start the second link so I
hope<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:19.030> enjoyed<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.470> have<00:04:20.470> fun<00:04:20.739> with

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
hope you enjoyed it have fun with

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.789 
hope you enjoyed it have fun with
aquaponics<00:04:21.250> as<00:04:21.609> well
