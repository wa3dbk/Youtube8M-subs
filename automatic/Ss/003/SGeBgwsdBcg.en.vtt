I'm supposed to do I personally would

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.940

only<00:01:14.310> get<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> tattoo<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:16.560> was<00:01:16.740> something

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
only get a tattoo if it was something

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.039 
only get a tattoo if it was something
that<00:01:17.130> meant<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.850> lot<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> me<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.840> I'm<00:01:19.020> not

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that meant a lot to me and I'm not

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.719 
that meant a lot to me and I'm not
saying<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.470> definitely<00:01:19.830> wouldn't<00:01:20.220> regret<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
saying I definitely wouldn't regret it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.749 
saying I definitely wouldn't regret it
because<00:01:21.119> maybe<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:22.200> I'm<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.650> 60<00:01:23.549> or

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
because maybe when I'm like 60 or

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.330 
because maybe when I'm like 60 or
something<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.479> might<00:01:24.750> regret<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
something I might regret it and that

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.580 
something I might regret it and that
would<00:01:26.520> suck<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> same<00:01:27.420> time<00:01:27.689> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
would suck but at the same time you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.190 
would suck but at the same time you
can't<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.240> things<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:30.900> you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
can't just not do things because you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600 
can't just not do things because you
might<00:01:31.470> regret<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.100> Baker's<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
might regret that one Baker's and you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
might regret that one Baker's and you
wouldn't<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.909> anything<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:34.020> they're

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
wouldn't do anything and like they're

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.539 
wouldn't do anything and like they're
likely<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.100> wouldn't<00:01:35.340> regret

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
likely it is that I wouldn't regret

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
likely it is that I wouldn't regret
because<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> means<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.509> lot<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> me<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
because if it means a lot to me now a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.870 
because if it means a lot to me now a
life<00:01:37.740> thinking<00:01:38.100> mean<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> lot<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.520> me<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
life thinking mean a lot to me in the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
life thinking mean a lot to me in the
future<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> wouldn't<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.290> something

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
future so I wouldn't get something
