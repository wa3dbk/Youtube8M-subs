00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 Hello everyone today in our review 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 such a set with such 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.019
 interesting detail 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.259
 from a series of star wars it is a bomber and 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.599
 acutely it felt it acutely and bottom and field 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.750
 usually in such sets come across 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.230
 planets let's say a stone well or coruscant 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.269
 but in this case it is an asteroid field 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.779
 if you have a green hand you can 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.640
 here and so hang up will be beautiful 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.880
 also apparently in the set there is still 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.320
 Here is such a small boat and 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.180
 minifigure 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:42.510
 some fighter don't know who it is in general 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.270
 I personally take this kit for this detail. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.280
 I did not take this set 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.640
 cadet find or something like that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.520
 brighter but it also goes because 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.309
 This item Well, I don `t know why you need more 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.520
 these planets because well yes even if 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.800
 These are miniature funny in essence. 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.199
 ships can still be put on the shelf 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.570
 play there with them like the whole 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.900
 planet I can not imagine but for sure 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.270
 dreamers will understand but I have this detail 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.650
 need for homemade drive for here such 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.330
 here's a homemade thing then let's not hesitate and 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.100
 hide it because i'm not here at all 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.070
 I know how it should look inside 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.030
 I did not watch any reviews I know nothing 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.520
 how such sets with these planets are common 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.650
 is completed and that inside it will be 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.729
 interesting 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.939
 fun and stuff like that 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.860
 instruction 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.770
 yes with this little boat now we 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.900
 so it quickly collect and how to get it 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.190
 and the planet itself 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:52.520
 very difficult climbs planet povylazili 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:58.470
 heavy for sure there is something inside 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 how to open it about a very simple idea 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.740
 funny this is essentially so cool whale 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.149
 a surprise comes out why them so here 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.360
 don't sell directly like that 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.940
 packed 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.680
 but so the principle in the box is also interesting 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.950
 look attracted at least to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.489
 attention here so that's not a planet 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.010
 planet 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.870
 built by myself so what we see here 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:29.100
 cosmic darkness and astroids 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.590
 Essentially nothing above this is necessary 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.010
 herself this 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.600
 spherical region is wonderful but 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.989
 to watch the whole set 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.060
 let's party we collect this here if 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.610
 have something to love star wars dct for 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.130
 the fact that in their sets the biggest 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.650
 the amount of sulfur parts probably among 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.570
 all sets anywhere else did not meet 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.540
 such a huge amount of sulfur and 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.189
 details 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.799
 so if i ever will 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:59.730
 grab the gray in my models then I know 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.469
 what series will i need to apply 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.840
 that already after a pretty quick build we 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.870
 we get such a small one 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.439
 exposure with a little man somehow 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.930
 star ship or starship 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:17.049
 a few extra spare parts or rather 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.329
 Three things for a stand 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.239
 planets don't know why if she cares 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.609
 should hang 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:29.200
 but apparently suddenly you have no where to hang that 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:31.329
 you could put well and on top of this 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.079
 a piece so you can tie a rope 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.849
 and hang well but for those who are a fan 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.659
 star wars, I probably will show what's here 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:43.540
 there is a coaster decorated with the name 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:48.329
 set and see this is the bomber pilots 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.329
 there is quite simple . 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.769
 apparently the imperial knights have 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.409
 such helmets like 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:01.270
 for me knights imperial attack aircraft 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:04.150
 exactly t-shirt plates pistol 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.400
 he seems to like him cheerful 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.910
 be in such a set 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.420
 Well, here is such a simple to horror simple 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.000
 boat 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.140
 but I like this idea when 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.920
 not just a little model, but exactly 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.480
 miniature that is recreated such 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.600
 model of the bay see how it can 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.390
 do though he may not suddenly 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.850
 This is another catch star series 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.110
 wars when the mobility of parts is not at all 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.680
 means their mobility 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.520
 that he should be like this 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.780
 In general, I leave in the middle position this 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.420
 of course, I'll sort it out 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.920
 useful gray details gray detail nobody 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:53.020
 there will not be much and besides here 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:56.170
 mirror more precisely the windshield is very 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:01.240
 funny and suitable for all homemade 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:04.360
 too but of course this thing will take 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.570
 your place in homemade right everything is superfluous 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.100
 this is all unnecessary the most important thing is this 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.930
 the thing is this ball which from the inside in 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.220
 principle not to use 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.169
 do not use it in parts 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.660
 separately only because here 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.410
 these mounts 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.900
 no way to help me where to mount them 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.570
 just another same ball but it is already 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.889
 will not be beautiful 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.860
 1000 here is such a set 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.020
 I have no idea why he is needed at all 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.320
 except how to use this one 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.030
 homemade item 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.449
 if you have a different planet explain 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.600
 or 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:49.510
 or show or take a picture of you 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.510
 You can even use some 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.500
 make decorations or 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.080
 some exposure can it 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.530
 I really cut this thing 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:04.180
 a slacker fatal know how homemade 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:08.289
 read in general so here it was 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:11.169
 star wars and master of iodine 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:15.280
 he says write his comments in the comments 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:18.789
 opinion and what planets do you have that 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.680
 we only have asteroids on it all 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.680
 good luck to all and bye
