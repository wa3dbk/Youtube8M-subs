00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.960
 Zombie and this is another video over 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.549
 accessories for game consoles 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.339
 the master develops this pistol 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:15.690
 light for playstation 2 this is the 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:17.609
 bank 2 these come out in 2000 this one was 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.640
 created by the company henÃ¡n compares its 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.039
 bodies video games and this accessory 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.740
 it works pretty well 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.929
 one like I had not done a similar thing 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.000
 but for another console that was the same 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.960
 playstation which is the precision 1 for 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.370
 the playstation 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.480
 those games were so crisis on 1 and 2 and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.480
 another game more 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.629
 countless consoles have had this 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.390
 kind of accessories like nintendo sega 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.930
 3d genesis or the philips this the xbox 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.210
 as well 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.640
 and good also the precision has them 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.270
 his own gun is also the same 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.239
 reception mark but get white and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.320
 well let's start is a very 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.770
 simple 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.340
 It's very simple like the others 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.890
 part we have to be in select the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.740
 part this is a button that says 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.520
 your trigger our love part the logo 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.530
 Henan with arriving 2 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.280
 just the turn in this part we have a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.170
 button he says button by in this part 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.899
 we have the crosshead to choose in the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.569
 mean either you shoot him and you choose 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.680
 things respond pretty well the 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.410
 gun 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.050
 in case you do not have this gun the gun 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.680
 with how it can not work on the pc are 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.810
 two 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.840
 and well this connects directly from the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 pen session via usb so I have what 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.510
 it looks but if you occupy connect it 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.330
 to video for example occupy area with a 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.970
 connector remove it from the playstation or from 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.300
 TV but if it happens to raise it to 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.030
 that works well if you connect is this one 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.009
 works well to say if you drink 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.070
 connect this by forces so that you 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.070
 detect well the part of the sight 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.040
 would be some pc games are one in 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.739
 the pc are the ones that were going back to 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.780
 do so I have a game that came out 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.340
 for the pre session or not that they are for 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.099
 the play station 2 which is the 3 2 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.580
 is an entertaining game also 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.400
 they released version 5 from 61 to 3 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.830
 they also took it out is a mud game 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.140
 entertaining action with cons 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.430
 delinquents and good certain things that 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.430
 there's a lot of action here 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.760
 the time crisis 3 I wanted to get 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.250
 but good if it has been difficult 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.520
 find them but basically I'll see if 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.070
 I find it 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.230
 other games came out that were not 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.230
 many very famous but yes 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.959
 it looks like it came out of time 3 6 4 for 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.400
 this console but it seems that also 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.400
 for playstation 3 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.689
 I have for another to be online 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.490
 until the sun also of the same 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.070
 company 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.000
 this if you fight with monsters and 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.350
 different things something very similar but 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.940
 they pulled different versions of this 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.940
 type of games 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.280
 shooting 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:40.390
 I sometimes if I play this kind of 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.700
 addictive to this kind of games in the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.980
 little machines I sometimes go to the little machines 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.800
 of machines that have the shotgun 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.220
 for the house of deer bears and 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.230
 different animals and then I could not 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.100
 missing the improvement one of my favorites 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.530
 what is the house of day of the 2 a 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.990
 little machine that I'm still playing 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.800
 out there and sometimes I'm going to unveil 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.740
 I'm out there to buy or do something there 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.770
 sometimes and I spent a few 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.530
 weights out there and well then that's a 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.390
 small sample of this light gun 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.210
 already today no longer not used anymore 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.940
 you know different controls we're going 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.010
 modernizing things but well then 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.320
 it's a good opportunity to show them 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.790
 is this accessory 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.190
 and well, I hope you liked it 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.540
 and then we go to the next one in the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.540
