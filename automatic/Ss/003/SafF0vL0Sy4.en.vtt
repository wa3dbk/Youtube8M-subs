00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
if that was just me but uh it just
didn't<00:01:37.740> feel<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.130> 92<00:01:38.579> shot<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> felt<00:01:39.150> like

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
didn't feel like a 92 shot it felt like

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.649 
didn't feel like a 92 shot it felt like
an<00:01:39.390> 80<00:01:39.720> probably<00:01:40.470> 85<00:01:40.890> 86<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.390> really

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
an 80 probably 85 86 it was a really

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.480 
an 80 probably 85 86 it was a really
really<00:01:42.899> weak<00:01:43.200> shot<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> really<00:01:44.070> wasn't<00:01:44.430> all

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
really weak shot it really wasn't all

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.980 
really weak shot it really wasn't all
that<00:01:44.579> accurate<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.390> really<00:01:45.630> surprising

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that accurate was really surprising

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.190 
that accurate was really surprising
actually<00:01:46.290> uh<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.570> biggest<00:01:48.810> flaw

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
actually uh that is the biggest flaw

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.249 
actually uh that is the biggest flaw
that<00:01:49.229> i<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.100> card<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.659> shot<00:01:51.899> i<00:01:51.930> mean

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that i see in this card the shot i mean

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.899 
that i see in this card the shot i mean
with<00:01:52.380> 92<00:01:52.740> shot<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.549> you're<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.729> all

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
with 92 shot you see it you're like all

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.370 
with 92 shot you see it you're like all
of<00:01:54.000> nice<00:01:54.180> i'm<00:01:54.360> gonna<00:01:54.509> snack<00:01:54.720> Geno's<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.259> days

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
of nice i'm gonna snack Geno's for days

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.789 
of nice i'm gonna snack Geno's for days
but<00:01:56.540> that's<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> case<00:01:57.840> at<00:01:58.320> least<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.770> i

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
but that's not the case at least when i

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.609 
but that's not the case at least when i
play<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.219> them<00:01:59.630> with<00:02:00.630> ninety<00:02:00.990> two<00:02:01.140> hands

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
play with them with ninety two hands

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.550 
play with them with ninety two hands
that<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.700> accurate<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.630> best<00:02:03.840> hand

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that is so accurate one of the best hand

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.620 
that is so accurate one of the best hand
he<00:02:05.070> has<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.310> best<00:02:05.490> hands<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.240> game<00:02:06.420> i

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
he has the best hands in the game i

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.130 
he has the best hands in the game i
think<00:02:06.710> next<00:02:07.710> stuff<00:02:07.950> probably<00:02:08.250> oh<00:02:08.670> god<00:02:09.390> team<00:02:10.020> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
think next stuff probably oh god team of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.260 
think next stuff probably oh god team of
the<00:02:10.229> week<00:02:10.349> Kadri<00:02:10.979> has<00:02:11.190> insane<00:02:11.610> hands<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.060> i'll

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the week Kadri has insane hands so i'll

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.700 
the week Kadri has insane hands so i'll
probably<00:02:12.450> put<00:02:12.629> those<00:02:12.810> two<00:02:12.989> together<00:02:13.080> with

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
probably put those two together with

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.380 
probably put those two together with
the<00:02:13.770> best<00:02:13.980> hands<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> game<00:02:14.520> he<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.210> catch

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
the best hands of the game he can catch

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.350 
the best hands of the game he can catch
any<00:02:15.600> pass<00:02:15.870> God<00:02:16.500> make<00:02:16.830> every<00:02:17.550> every<00:02:17.940> week<00:02:18.090> and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
cross Greece is just having anyone not

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.640 
cross Greece is just having anyone not
passing<00:02:26.340> across<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.850> crease<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.210> what<00:02:27.360> not

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650

really<00:02:28.650> really<00:02:28.770> good<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.190> know<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.730> all<00:02:30.090> that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
really really good I know that all that

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.940 
really really good I know that all that
is<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.720> compass<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.200> hands<00:02:31.440> at<00:02:31.650> least<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.890> think

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
is in compass and hands at least I think

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.270 
is in compass and hands at least I think
it<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.450> 85<00:02:33.450> checking<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.470> feel<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.130> he

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it is 85 checking on the I feel like he

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.070 
it is 85 checking on the I feel like he
has<00:02:35.730> 95<00:02:36.240> check<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.570> with<00:02:36.690> granite

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
has 95 check in with granite

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.550 
has 95 check in with granite
most<00:02:37.560> players<00:02:37.800> no<00:02:38.070> 14<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.030> feel<00:02:39.630> like<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.900> have<00:02:40.020> 95

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
most players no 14 I feel like I have 95

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.740 
most players no 14 I feel like I have 95
checking<00:02:41.010> because<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.640> awesome<00:02:42.360> physics

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
checking because the awesome physics

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.790 
checking because the awesome physics
engines<00:02:43.080> yeah<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.980> uh<00:02:44.420> he<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.600> hit<00:02:45.810> me<00:02:46.050> wreck

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
engines yeah but uh he can hit me wreck

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.620 
engines yeah but uh he can hit me wreck
people<00:02:47.220> when<00:02:47.370> he<00:02:47.460> wants<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> off<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.450> get<00:02:48.570> a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
people when he wants to off you get a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.420 
people when he wants to off you get a
good<00:02:48.840> position<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.440> destroy<00:02:49.770> anyone<00:02:50.130> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
good position you can destroy anyone and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.970 
good position you can destroy anyone and
um<00:02:50.930> he's<00:02:51.930> actually<00:02:52.140> really<00:02:52.440> really<00:02:52.560> hard<00:02:52.860> to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
um he's actually really really hard to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.290 
um he's actually really really hard to
get<00:02:53.070> knocked<00:02:53.280> off<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.670> puck<00:02:53.820> which<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.090> really

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
get knocked off the puck which is really

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.270 
get knocked off the puck which is really
nice<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.720> had<00:02:55.470> issue<00:02:55.710> with<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.070> with<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
nice I had issue with that with the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.670 
nice I had issue with that with the
normal<00:02:56.550> Gaborik<00:02:57.020> but<00:02:58.020> like<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.290> said<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.590> was

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
normal Gaborik but like I said it was

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.000 
normal Gaborik but like I said it was
really<00:02:58.890> nice<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> see<00:02:59.220> uh<00:02:59.870> this<00:03:00.870> Gaborik<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.890> be

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
really nice to see uh this Gaborik to be

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.670 
really nice to see uh this Gaborik to be
really<00:03:02.340> strong<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.210> puck<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.690> uh<00:03:03.750> pretty

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
really strong in the puck and uh pretty

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.040 
really strong in the puck and uh pretty
much<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.830> beast<00:03:05.130> checker<00:03:05.570> 85<00:03:06.570> defense<00:03:06.900> that's

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
much a beast checker 85 defense that's

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.870 
much a beast checker 85 defense that's
pretty<00:03:07.320> that's<00:03:07.350> that's<00:03:07.890> pretty<00:03:08.370> much<00:03:08.430> average

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
pretty that's that's pretty much average

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.510 
pretty that's that's pretty much average
uh<00:03:09.090> he<00:03:09.690> give<00:03:10.230> most<00:03:10.440> poke<00:03:10.710> checks<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.190> don't

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
uh he give most poke checks but don't

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.460 
uh he give most poke checks but don't
expect<00:03:11.670> him<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.360> little<00:03:12.750> today<00:03:12.930> no<00:03:13.110> char

intercepting the puck and why not he has
his<00:03:18.540> moments<00:03:18.570> but<00:03:19.020> I<00:03:19.410> wouldn't<00:03:19.740> say<00:03:19.770> he's<00:03:20.010> a

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
his moments but I wouldn't say he's a
