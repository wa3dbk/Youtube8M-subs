00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello youtube friends tell you that 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.089
 extra that I always two to episode 2 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.560
 of the top 5 of halo 4 where this week 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.360
 corresponds to us in the category of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.500
 epic felix and practically in this 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.509
 episode there were only three people 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.549
 different in leaving since they were the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.080
 five best moves that came to me and 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.670
 I know that many sent me several 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.470
 played but if you did not go out you 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.330
 worry since you can participate in 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.330
 the categories that come in the future 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.360
 at number 5 we have bet 05 on 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.340
 where he is here in ragnarok is with his 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.140
 sniper and good that has happened there to the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.060
 seem to want to kill one another 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.280
 team but has betrayed one of his 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.230
 partner here we see the repetition as 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.510
 the other partner wanted to kill him 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.150
 but it goes through and I did not have to 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.140
 fall in the prostate bullets how bad 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.140
 super epic fail 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.730
 in number 4 we have five hundred 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.410
 platform where he is with his room and 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.210
 is playing capture the way you are going 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.800
 with his colleagues to take the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.140
 enemy flag and here it takes its 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.059
 mate matt someone with the one of m &amp; r and 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.070
 they will go to the garden to get to the base 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.780
 faster but apparently they do not coordinate 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.880
 ok and they go up to a room that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.500
 wrong everyone then here they 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.570
 tachan climbs but leaves his partner 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.670
 without car then they try 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.440
 fix it as your partner climbs 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.990
 with the bomb flag had to get to 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.660
 a bullet from the plasma gun and well 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.850
 in the end they had to kill them 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.100
 turned this into a super epic fail and 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.780
 here we see again the repetition where 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.399
 here your partner takes the flag and 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.530
 remove it is defending here 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.140
 they go up to the room that wrong then 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.729
 they try to fix it they want to go back to 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.320
 his room an old but the other 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.660
 enemy steals the other quarter then 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 here he is stopped by the gun 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.670
 plasma and explode at the end 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.040
 in number 3 we have here diet chan 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.900
 where is also on this map of 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.730
 harvest but this time it has an epic fail 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.680
 different and I'm going to talk to you more or 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.570
 less what happened here is trying to 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.930
 kill one there kills him and gets his 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.840
 implacable but who believe he had to 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.850
 get to that room to dispatch it here 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.370
 we see once more as it is for churra 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.980
 that room but guess what they guess 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.430
 who was the fourth one imagine who 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.320
 it was like that you are there is the repetition 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.350
 where he hit kill and tachÃ¡n and good 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.850
 I apologize the truth was there was 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.310
 got a relentless and good me 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.310
 he had to destroy his streak the 115 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.450
 and we get to number two with prostar 05 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.570
 again where is he here killing a 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.430
 enemy but apparently it's chuck norris 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.410
 since he does not die here he gives a few shots 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.180
 at the head does not die gives two 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.520
 cachazos and still does not die and to the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.770
 final they had to give assistance all 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.920
 because of that long gentlemen and 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.960
 ladies is the garlic here we see once again 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.240
 how he wants to kill him but then at the end 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.400
 had to get his partner already 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.510
 death steal that worked so 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.670
 it cost to prostar 0-5 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.099
 and we get to number one compact or 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.780
 reader where here is with the one of m &amp; r 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.909
 is an enemy wants to kill him 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.280
 but the enemy thinks of launching a 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.560
 granada eludes it and pum the same 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.720
 enemy commits suicide and this is rather the 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.750
 epic fail for that guy who launched a 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.670
 granada and well, it ended with a 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.650
 very strange pose but here we see once 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.209
 more that gave me a lot of laughter as 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.340
 throws the big one try to win him the 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.049
 grenade but in the end brush the same and 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.459
 this has been all for today's episode 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.409
 do not forget to send your plays for the 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.239

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.349
 episode 4 girls and matrix and in the 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.269
 number 5 we have the deaths with 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.739
 vehicle can be dispatched or 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.019
 anything else that has happened to them 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.269
 here on the left I leave you the first 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.769

 send me their moves and they can leave in 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.829
