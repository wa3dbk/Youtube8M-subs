department today we're going to focus

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.430 
department today we're going to focus
our<00:00:06.420> attention<00:00:06.779> on<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.960> layers<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.379> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
our attention on the layers of the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.919 
our attention on the layers of the
atmosphere<00:00:08.000> now<00:00:09.000> layers<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.540> atmosphere

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
atmosphere now layers of the atmosphere

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.330 
atmosphere now layers of the atmosphere
are<00:00:09.990> very<00:00:10.230> important<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> us<00:00:10.889> because<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
are very important to us because the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.280 
are very important to us because the
atmosphere<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:12.240> essential<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:12.929> life<00:00:13.080> to

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
atmosphere is essential for life to

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.650 
atmosphere is essential for life to
exist<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.769> planet<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:14.820> atmosphere<00:00:15.480> today

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
exist on the planet now atmosphere today

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.970 
exist on the planet now atmosphere today
is<00:00:15.750> very<00:00:16.049> different<00:00:16.170> from<00:00:16.500> what<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.740> was<00:00:16.830> like

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
is very different from what it was like

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.220 
is very different from what it was like
two<00:00:17.430> billion<00:00:17.760> years<00:00:18.000> ago<00:00:18.119> there<00:00:18.900> are<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.199> of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
two billion years ago there are a lot of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.560 
two billion years ago there are a lot of
noxious<00:00:19.800> gases<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.400> sulfur<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.000> methane<00:00:21.390> in

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
noxious gases like sulfur and methane in

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.390 
noxious gases like sulfur and methane in
the<00:00:21.600> atmosphere<00:00:21.740> unlike<00:00:22.740> today<00:00:23.010> which<00:00:23.250> is

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the atmosphere unlike today which is

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.250 
the atmosphere unlike today which is
mostly<00:00:23.730> nitrogen<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.600> oxygen

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
mostly nitrogen and oxygen

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.230 
mostly nitrogen and oxygen
well<00:00:25.800> those<00:00:26.010> gases<00:00:26.519> basically<00:00:26.849> came<00:00:27.060> through

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
well those gases basically came through

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.120 
well those gases basically came through
the<00:00:27.570> violent<00:00:28.019> volcanic<00:00:28.439> eruptions<00:00:29.070> that

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the violent volcanic eruptions that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.980 
the violent volcanic eruptions that
occurred<00:00:29.460> during<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.179> early<00:00:30.539> years<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> our

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
occurred during the early years of our

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
occurred during the early years of our
earth<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.949> process<00:00:32.369> called<00:00:32.579> outgassing

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
earth that process called outgassing

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.150 
earth that process called outgassing
basically<00:00:33.719> released<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.290> tremendous<00:00:34.980> amount

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
basically released a tremendous amount

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.190 
basically released a tremendous amount
of<00:00:35.219> noxious<00:00:35.700> gases<00:00:36.180> into<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.510> atmosphere

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
of noxious gases into the atmosphere

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.470 
of noxious gases into the atmosphere
you'll<00:00:38.010> notice<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.460> oxygen<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you'll notice that oxygen was not a

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.569 
you'll notice that oxygen was not a
major<00:00:39.719> part<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.350> early<00:00:40.500> atmosphere<00:00:41.100> very

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
major part of that early atmosphere very

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.770 
major part of that early atmosphere very
simply<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.210> there<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:42.390> not<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> large

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
simply because there was not a large

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.799 
simply because there was not a large
abundance<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.320> plants<00:00:43.739> during<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.129> time<00:00:44.809> now

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
abundance of plants during that time now

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.569 
abundance of plants during that time now
our<00:00:45.930> atmosphere<00:00:46.440> today<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> very<00:00:47.070> important

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
our atmosphere today is very important

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
our atmosphere today is very important
to<00:00:47.700> us<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.750> essential<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.260> life<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to us because it's essential for life to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.160 
to us because it's essential for life to
exist<00:00:50.160> without<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.180> atmosphere<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:52.020> no

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
exist without the atmosphere there's no

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.069 
exist without the atmosphere there's no
oxygen<00:00:52.559> there's<00:00:53.190> no<00:00:53.309> life<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> planet<00:00:54.079> our

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
oxygen there's no life on the planet our

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.869 
oxygen there's no life on the planet our
we<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.559> our<00:00:55.680> atmosphere<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.340> broken<00:00:56.730> up

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
we know that our atmosphere is broken up

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.160 
we know that our atmosphere is broken up
into<00:00:57.000> multiple<00:00:57.480> layers<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.780> we'll<00:00:58.020> talk

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
into multiple layers and we'll talk

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.630 
into multiple layers and we'll talk
about<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.469> four<00:00:58.710> basic<00:00:58.739> layers<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
about the four basic layers of the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.970 
about the four basic layers of the
atmosphere<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.359> we'll<00:01:01.109> also<00:01:01.230> focus<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
atmosphere and we'll also focus on the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.500 
atmosphere and we'll also focus on the
fact<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.309> temperature<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.910> an<00:01:03.030> extremely

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
fact that temperature is an extremely

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
fact that temperature is an extremely
important<00:01:04.110> concept<00:01:04.260> when<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.280> from<00:01:05.489> one

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
important concept when going from one

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.640 
important concept when going from one
layer<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> next<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> stated

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
layer to the next and like I stated

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.100 
layer to the next and like I stated
earlier<00:01:08.100> notice<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> composition<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.390> very

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
earlier notice the composition is very

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.390 
earlier notice the composition is very
very<00:01:10.409> different<00:01:10.619> from<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> early<00:01:11.250> atmosphere

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
very different from the early atmosphere

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.960 
very different from the early atmosphere

the<00:01:17.400> white<00:01:17.580> clouds<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.270> focus<00:01:18.479> our

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the white clouds we can focus our

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.840 
the white clouds we can focus our
attention<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.380> layer<00:01:20.340> where<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
attention on that layer where all the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.740 
attention on that layer where all the
clouds<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.210> found<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.450> called<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
clouds are found this called the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.969 
clouds are found this called the
troposphere<00:01:22.049> we'll<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
troposphere we'll get to that in a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.580 
troposphere we'll get to that in a
second<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.540> as<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.689> increase<00:01:24.720> our<00:01:25.259> altitude

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
second and as we increase our altitude

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
second and as we increase our altitude
or<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.009> increase<00:01:26.400> our<00:01:26.549> elevation<00:01:27.090> above<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
or we increase our elevation above the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.580 
or we increase our elevation above the
earth<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.110> layer<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
earth you can go from one layer to the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.100 
earth you can go from one layer to the
next<00:01:28.979> troposphere<00:01:29.820> stratosphere<00:01:30.110> mesosphere

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.440 
next troposphere stratosphere mesosphere
thermosphere<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.880> jump<00:01:33.119> into<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
thermosphere so jump into the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.819 
thermosphere so jump into the
troposphere<00:01:33.720> talk<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> little<00:01:34.350> bit<00:01:34.500> about<00:01:34.530> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
troposphere talk a little bit about it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.880 
troposphere talk a little bit about it
so<00:01:35.570> with<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.720> layer<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> be

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
so with this layer it's going to be

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.200 
so with this layer it's going to be
layer<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.400> currently<00:01:38.670> live<00:01:39.000> in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
layer that we currently live in

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.700 
layer that we currently live in
it's<00:01:39.390> where<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> majority<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.259> water<00:01:40.500> vapor

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it's where the majority of a water vapor

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.219 
it's where the majority of a water vapor
is<00:01:40.890> found<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.150> being<00:01:42.450> said<00:01:42.810> that's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
is found and with that being said that's

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.330 
is found and with that being said that's
where<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> majority<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.890> our<00:01:43.979> weather<00:01:44.189> is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
where the majority of our weather is

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
where the majority of our weather is
going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.700> found<00:01:44.909> as<00:01:45.149> well<00:01:45.390> within<00:01:46.049> our

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
going to be found as well within our

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.730 
going to be found as well within our
troposphere<00:01:47.420> because<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.659> live<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.560> most

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
troposphere because we live for the most

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.499

part<00:01:49.979> close<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.369> sea<00:01:50.549> level<00:01:50.700> we're<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
part close to sea level we're going to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.270 
part close to sea level we're going to
have<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> majority<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> troposphere<00:01:52.890> all

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
have the majority of the troposphere all

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.399 
have the majority of the troposphere all
the<00:01:53.909> stratosphere<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.899> mesosphere<00:01:55.200> and

the stratosphere all the mesosphere and
all<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> thermosphere<00:01:56.070> pushing<00:01:56.610> down<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.969> top

all the thermosphere pushing down on top
of<00:01:57.180> us<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.020> we're<00:01:58.110> gonna<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> greatest

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
of us so we're gonna have the greatest

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.350 
of us so we're gonna have the greatest
atmospheric<00:01:59.340> pressure<00:01:59.579> found<00:01:59.969> within<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
troposphere you're physically getting

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.139

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
further away from the earth so

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.429 
further away from the earth so
temperature<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> decrease<00:02:07.079> and

temperature is going to decrease and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.229 
temperature is going to decrease and
that's<00:02:07.920> evident<00:02:08.369> when<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> look<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:08.940> mountain

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
that's evident when you look at mountain

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.820

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.480 
to house what's called the ozone layer
the<00:02:21.750> ozone<00:02:22.020> layer<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.410> part<00:02:22.830> special<00:02:23.250> part

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
the ozone layer is a part special part

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.250 
the ozone layer is a part special part
of<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.640> stratosphere<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.360> protects<00:02:25.080> us

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
of the stratosphere that protects us

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.870 
of the stratosphere that protects us
from<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.560> ultraviolet<00:02:25.980> radiation<00:02:26.280> from<00:02:26.670> the

causes a high cases of skin cancer
now<00:02:33.660> as<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.900> travel<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.530> stratosphere

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
now as you travel up to the stratosphere

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.580 
now as you travel up to the stratosphere
temperature<00:02:35.640> actually<00:02:36.120> goes<00:02:36.360> up<00:02:36.690> even<00:02:37.410> though

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
temperature actually goes up even though

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.540 
temperature actually goes up even though

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
earth it goes up because that ozone

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.360 
earth it goes up because that ozone
layer<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.290> absorbing<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.860> lot<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> sun's

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
people call it a hole but it's actually

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.160 
people call it a hole but it's actually
a<00:02:50.580> thinning<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.060> ozone<00:02:51.120> layer<00:02:51.600> over<00:02:51.780> top

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
Antarctica the next layer up is what we

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.670 
Antarctica the next layer up is what we
call<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.000> mesosphere<00:03:12.330> now<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.260> mesosphere

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
call the mesosphere now the mesosphere

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.740 
call the mesosphere now the mesosphere
has<00:03:14.520> some<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.880> coldest<00:03:15.240> temperatures<00:03:15.450> in

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
has some of the coldest temperatures in

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.150 
has some of the coldest temperatures in
the<00:03:15.840> atmosphere<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.410> as<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.620> travel<00:03:17.070> up

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
the atmosphere and as you travel up

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.250 
the atmosphere and as you travel up
through<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.610> mesosphere<00:03:17.910> temperatures<00:03:18.870> drop

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
through the mesosphere temperatures drop

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.400 
through the mesosphere temperatures drop
dramatically<00:03:20.010> very<00:03:20.660> simply<00:03:21.660> because<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:22.050> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
dramatically very simply because of the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.710 
dramatically very simply because of the
layer<00:03:22.590> above<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.310> which<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.970> called<00:03:24.300> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
layer above it which is called the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.000 
layer above it which is called the
thermosphere<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.470> we'll<00:03:25.590> talk<00:03:25.739> about<00:03:25.830> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
thermosphere and we'll talk about the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.430 
thermosphere and we'll talk about the
thermosphere<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.640> second<00:03:27.060> ok<00:03:28.020> this<00:03:28.230> is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
thermosphere in a second ok this is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.750 
thermosphere in a second ok this is
pretty<00:03:28.500> much<00:03:28.950> where<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.160> layer<00:03:29.370> where<00:03:29.550> all

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
pretty much where the layer where all

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.460 
pretty much where the layer where all
your<00:03:30.000> meteorites<00:03:30.480> are<00:03:30.660> your<00:03:30.810> shooting<00:03:31.140> stars

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
your meteorites are your shooting stars

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.229 
your meteorites are your shooting stars
are<00:03:31.590> going<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.890> burn<00:03:32.100> up<00:03:32.310> as<00:03:32.489> they<00:03:32.940> enter<00:03:33.209> our

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
are going to burn up as they enter our

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.290 
are going to burn up as they enter our
atmosphere<00:03:34.670> now<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.730> reason<00:03:36.120> why<00:03:36.239> the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
atmosphere now the reason why the

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.150 
atmosphere now the reason why the
mesosphere<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.320> cold<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.770> because<00:03:38.040> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
mesosphere is so cold is because the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.790 
mesosphere is so cold is because the
thermosphere<00:03:38.580> is<00:03:38.989> going<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.050> absorb<00:03:40.530> a

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
thermosphere is going to absorb a

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.759 
thermosphere is going to absorb a
tremendous<00:03:40.910> amount<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> energy<00:03:42.360> from<00:03:43.050> the

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
tremendous amount of the energy from the

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.310 
tremendous amount of the energy from the
Sun<00:03:44.010> gamma<00:03:44.550> rays<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.000> x-rays<00:03:45.320> specifically

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
Sun gamma rays and x-rays specifically

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.840 
Sun gamma rays and x-rays specifically
those<00:03:46.530> really<00:03:46.920> nasty<00:03:47.130> rays<00:03:47.519> from<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.760> Sun

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
those really nasty rays from the Sun

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.300 
those really nasty rays from the Sun
really<00:03:48.690> really<00:03:49.050> short<00:03:49.350> wavelengths<00:03:49.920> really

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
really really short wavelengths really

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.640 
really really short wavelengths really
high<00:03:50.459> frequency<00:03:50.700> very<00:03:51.360> dangerous<00:03:51.959> waves<00:03:52.470> from

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
high frequency very dangerous waves from

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.690 
high frequency very dangerous waves from
the<00:03:52.739> Sun<00:03:52.890> they<00:03:53.040> get<00:03:53.190> absorbed<00:03:53.430> by<00:03:53.580> the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
the Sun they get absorbed by the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.790 
the Sun they get absorbed by the
thermosphere<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:55.019> this<00:03:55.170> tends<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.440> be<00:03:55.560> some<00:03:55.709> of

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
thermosphere so this tends to be some of

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.720 
thermosphere so this tends to be some of
the<00:03:55.860> hottest<00:03:56.070> temperatures<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
the hottest temperatures in the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.280 
the hottest temperatures in the
atmosphere<00:03:57.209> because<00:03:57.810> your<00:03:57.959> temperature's

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
atmosphere because your temperature's

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.960 
atmosphere because your temperature's
going<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.440> go<00:03:58.590> up<00:03:58.739> through<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.280> absorbing<00:03:59.820> of

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
going to go up through the absorbing of

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.740 
going to go up through the absorbing of
these<00:04:00.180> rays<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:01.370> many<00:04:02.370> times<00:04:02.640> if<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.330> have<00:04:03.360> an

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
these rays and many times if you have an

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.270 
these rays and many times if you have an
opportunity<00:04:04.080> or<00:04:04.530> you're<00:04:04.709> lucky<00:04:04.890> enough<00:04:05.010> to

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
opportunity or you're lucky enough to

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.860 
opportunity or you're lucky enough to
see<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.580> Northern<00:04:05.820> Lights<00:04:05.970> or<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.540> aurora

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
see the Northern Lights or the aurora

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.070 
see the Northern Lights or the aurora
borealis<00:04:06.989> or<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.150> Australia's<00:04:09.150> borealis<00:04:09.870> in

borealis or the Australia's borealis in
the<00:04:10.290> southern<00:04:10.590> hemisphere<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:11.220> the

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
the southern hemisphere that the

the southern hemisphere that the
Southern<00:04:11.850> Lights<00:04:12.000> what<00:04:12.780> will<00:04:12.870> happen<00:04:13.140> is

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
Southern Lights what will happen is

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.960 
Southern Lights what will happen is
those<00:04:13.410> can<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.769> taking<00:04:14.070> place<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
those can be taking place in the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.479 
those can be taking place in the
thermosphere<00:04:15.709> so<00:04:16.709> those<00:04:16.890> are<00:04:17.040> your<00:04:17.160> basically

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
thermosphere so those are your basically

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.580 
thermosphere so those are your basically
your<00:04:17.700> four<00:04:18.000> basic<00:04:18.209> layers<00:04:18.630> through<00:04:19.470> the

your four basic layers through the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.380 
your four basic layers through the
atmosphere<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.340> couple<00:04:20.700> characteristics<00:04:21.269> you

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
atmosphere a couple characteristics you

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.790 
atmosphere a couple characteristics you
want<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.600> litte<00:04:21.690> bit<00:04:21.720> more<00:04:21.989> information<00:04:22.289> about

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
want a litte bit more information about

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.170 
want a litte bit more information about
them<00:04:23.190> please<00:04:23.580> go<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.850> your<00:04:24.030> reference<00:04:24.419> table

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
them please go to your reference table

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.180 
them please go to your reference table
now<00:04:27.180> we're<00:04:27.479> one<00:04:27.690> layer<00:04:27.870> ends<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.590> other<00:04:28.860> ones

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
now we're one layer ends the other ones

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.650 
now we're one layer ends the other ones
going<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.460> begin<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.060> it's<00:04:30.479> all

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
going to begin and it's all

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.680 
going to begin and it's all
temperature-dependent<00:04:31.350> here<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:32.940> we're<00:04:33.570> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
temperature-dependent here so we're the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.749 
temperature-dependent here so we're the
troposphere<00:04:34.139> ends<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.250> stratosphere

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
troposphere ends and the stratosphere

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.219 
troposphere ends and the stratosphere
begins<00:04:36.180> that's<00:04:36.630> what<00:04:36.840> we<00:04:36.930> call<00:04:37.110> the

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
begins that's what we call the

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.920 
begins that's what we call the
tropopause<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:38.490> get<00:04:38.639> a<00:04:38.669> very<00:04:39.090> very<00:04:39.210> distinct

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
tropopause you get a very very distinct

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.260 
tropopause you get a very very distinct
boundary<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.100> temperature<00:04:41.789> differences

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
boundary in temperature differences

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.610 
boundary in temperature differences
between<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.720> stratosphere<00:04:43.289> and<00:04:43.470> the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
between the stratosphere and the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.290 
between the stratosphere and the
troposphere<00:04:43.979> there<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:44.970> boundary

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
troposphere there so the boundary

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.670 
troposphere there so the boundary
between<00:04:45.389> those<00:04:45.690> two<00:04:45.840> layers<00:04:46.050> is<00:04:46.289> what<00:04:46.440> we<00:04:46.530> call

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
between those two layers is what we call

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.159 
between those two layers is what we call
the<00:04:46.770> tropopause<00:04:47.479> where<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:48.600> stratosphere

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
the tropopause where the stratosphere

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.050 
the tropopause where the stratosphere
ends<00:04:49.560> in<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.740> mesosphere<00:04:50.009> begins<00:04:50.610> is<00:04:50.850> what

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
ends in the mesosphere begins is what

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.950 
ends in the mesosphere begins is what
called<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.360> stratopause

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
called the stratopause

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.110 
called the stratopause

thermosphere begins that's what we call

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.219 
thermosphere begins that's what we call
the<00:04:55.680> meso<00:04:56.039> pause<00:04:56.570> okay<00:04:57.570> so<00:04:57.600> make<00:04:57.960> sure<00:04:57.990> you

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
the meso pause okay so make sure you

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.499 
the meso pause okay so make sure you
know<00:04:58.349> the<00:04:58.500> difference<00:04:58.830> between<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:59.370> spheres

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
know the difference between the spheres

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.400

which<00:05:00.509> are<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.780> layers<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.289> atmosphere

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
which are the layers of the atmosphere

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.189 
which are the layers of the atmosphere

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
and the pauses which are the breaks now

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.330 
and the pauses which are the breaks now
where<00:05:04.440> one<00:05:04.590> layer<00:05:04.740> ends<00:05:05.099> and<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.250> other

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
you go to your reference table you'll

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.189 
you go to your reference table you'll
see<00:05:09.180> that<00:05:09.419> relationship<00:05:11.750> now<00:05:12.750> you<00:05:12.810> do<00:05:12.990> have<00:05:13.139> a

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
see that relationship now you do have a

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.960 
see that relationship now you do have a
couple<00:05:13.349> atmospheric<00:05:14.070> relationships<00:05:14.699> with

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970
