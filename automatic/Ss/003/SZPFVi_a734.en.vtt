something<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.380> all<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.799> often<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
something you see all that often the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.910 
something you see all that often the
main<00:02:02.909> reason<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.659> when<00:02:04.560> you're<00:02:04.799> working

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
main reason is that when you're working

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
main reason is that when you're working
alongside<00:02:05.340> azumarill<00:02:06.000> obviously<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.750> going

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
alongside azumarill obviously it's going

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.880 
alongside azumarill obviously it's going
to<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.259> water<00:02:07.469> based<00:02:07.740> attacks

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
to be a lot of water based attacks

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.130 
to be a lot of water based attacks
coming<00:02:08.459> from<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> azumarill<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.840> don't

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
coming from the azumarill so you don't

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.670 
coming from the azumarill so you don't
want<00:02:10.319> pokemon<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:10.950> Charizard<00:02:11.730> or<00:02:12.000> nine

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680

attacks<00:02:15.650> by<00:02:15.799> fifty<00:02:16.099> percent<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.939> the<00:02:17.060> idea<00:02:17.299> is

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
attacks by fifty percent so the idea is

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.349 
attacks by fifty percent so the idea is
first<00:02:18.200> turn<00:02:18.500> out<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:18.980> chuck<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.519> your<00:02:19.849> map
