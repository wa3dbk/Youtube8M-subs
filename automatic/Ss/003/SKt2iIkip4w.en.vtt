 And today I'm going to answer the question. 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.949
 by daniel santos that is the following 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.410
 Every time I play the guitar I feel strong. 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.119
 spine pains why does this happen 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.380
 and what better way to play for 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.660

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.519
 please help me daniel 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.080
 very important to solve this doubt 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.480
 so let's take it easy 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.640
 if you feel severe pain whenever 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.690
 there is something working 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.309
 seriously 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.719
 so what I recommend you is not 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.390
 early your limits 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.399
 If you feel a strong pain the first time 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 thing to do is find out why 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.410
 this happens and then you can go back to 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.120
 to play with pain is not cool to play 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 I 'm speaking from experience. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 itself because it is born as a 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.739
 condition that complicates me enough to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.530
 touch 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.809
 if you are not very attentive it only worsens 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.820
 for a while I feel strong pains in the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.410
 base of the column and now I'll tell you 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.609
 What I had to do to solve 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.500
 the problem 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.420
 the first thing to do is look for 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.650

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.110
 help in the treatment of you will 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.909
 look for an orthopedist and it's also legal 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.040
 the soul and the physiotherapist 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.960
 they are the guys who will tell you what 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.640
 your situation and what you should do 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.409
 to solve the problem 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.090
 there are professionals who work 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.780
 directly with the health area of ​​the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.340
 are professionals who can 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.439

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.619

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.090

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.799
 but then your care has to be 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.390
 redoubled to find someone who 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.960
