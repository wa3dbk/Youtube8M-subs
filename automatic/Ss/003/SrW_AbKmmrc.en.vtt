00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello we are welcome another new idea and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.809
 as they saw it in the title test of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.670
 speed have three against bat and 801 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.980
 then let's start and how 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.719
 are seeing this is not itself what's going 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 doing the speed test but 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 it was a test before doing the test 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.150
 speed and then I said good that gives me a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.740
 little bit more time to grab it 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.269
 so you can see it too 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.699
 as they see it I was using the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.250
 first bat 801 and my friend Carlos 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.230
 coll hd whose with him he leaves them in the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.759
 description is using what you are doing 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.010
 on the farm piece for which you do not know 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.719
 what is the atrocious dinc is the new motorbike 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.300
 that just came out with the dlc height law 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.760
 update then once said this then 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.379
 let's start not as you see here I would 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.570
 I put in position to do what 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.850
 they do speed tests and as you know 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.190
 motorcycle had nothing of tuned then 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.930
 this gave us more opportunity to do what 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.930
 what they did before speed not me 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.270
 had one time and 801 new and he had a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.430
 line back new and as you see it here the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.410
 result was something unexpected something that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.690
 nor did I imagine since then 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.090
 they will see it and the truth is something that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 does not get much out of the wave as you see 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.079
 at first what the abbe doing 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.789
 801 comes out with great speed and 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.829
 we both left at the same time 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.600
 we did with stopwatches and there everything and 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.299
 As you see, we are going a step 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.859
 similar no and look here is when I 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.840
 I was surprised because suddenly in what 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.759
 they make the atrocious dinc we realized that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.130
 has a greater acceleration than the abate 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.049
 801 as you can see it is more 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.179
 fast but it does not have a great balance and 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.819
 not a great control and here as they are 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.250
 seeing what we did next was 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.859
 that I took the atrocious dinc and the result 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.380
 it was also something unexpected I did not 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:43.140
 I expected the Abbe 801 to be more 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.640
 fast but what they have to beat 800 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.500
 are the ones that have the most control 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.890
 it's easier to make horses with her 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.079
 besides that he has control and a lot 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.369
 easier handling than they have 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.500
 I'll come back from here as you see it 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.929
 we just go out again to take 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.549
 the competition and how they see it now came out 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.399
 with greater acceleration what doing the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.159
 dignity 2 and what they do to base 801 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.049
 never could reach it is not something that the 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.220
 Truth if it does not get enough of a wave 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.959

 now it's the atrocious vinca in the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.090
 acceleration but in manageability and 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.250
 caballitos obviously wins the abate 201 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.660
