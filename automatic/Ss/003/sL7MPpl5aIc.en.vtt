00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
this for some reason I guess it's pretty

better<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:39.070> hips<00:01:39.250> were<00:01:39.400> a<00:01:39.460> little<00:01:39.550> bit<00:01:39.730> deeper

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
better the hips were a little bit deeper

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.330 
better the hips were a little bit deeper
down<00:01:40.150> but<00:01:40.570> still<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:42.460> tough<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:43.150> feel<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:44.920> not

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
down but still it's tough I feel I'm not

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.160 
down but still it's tough I feel I'm not
really<00:01:45.580> pulling<00:01:45.910> with<00:01:46.150> my<00:01:46.300> back<00:01:46.570> like<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.140> used
