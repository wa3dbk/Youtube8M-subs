and you can do things this way too so

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.490 
and you can do things this way too so
you<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> could<00:00:39.360> even<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.719> push-ups<00:00:39.960> here

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you know I could even do push-ups here

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.940 
you know I could even do push-ups here
or<00:00:40.710> mountain<00:00:41.219> climbers<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.180> could

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
or mountain climbers here or I could

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.069 
or mountain climbers here or I could
stand<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> would<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.300> stand<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
stand on it so you would just stand and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
stand on it so you would just stand and
then<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.680> do<00:00:46.829> things<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.160> waves<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:47.850> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
variety of things and there's definitely

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
variety of things and there's definitely
levels<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.250> there's<00:00:53.430> basic<00:00:53.820> levels

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
levels so you know there's basic levels

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.430 
levels so you know there's basic levels
this<00:00:54.329> might<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> little<00:00:54.870> bit<00:00:55.020> more<00:00:55.140> advanced

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
this might be a little bit more advanced

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.459 
this might be a little bit more advanced
for<00:00:55.710> someone<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> work<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.629> way<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.750> so

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
for someone but you work your way up so

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.830 
for someone but you work your way up so
the<00:00:59.039> even<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.609> standing<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.030> some<00:01:00.480> people

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the even just standing here some people

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.420 
the even just standing here some people
when<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> put<00:01:01.410> them<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.160> time

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
when I put them on it for the first time

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
when I put them on it for the first time
they're<00:01:02.940> shaking<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.629> crazy<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:04.350> they

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
they're shaking like crazy because they

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.320 
they're shaking like crazy because they
don't<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.070> those<00:01:05.339> little<00:01:05.670> muscles

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
don't have those little muscles

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.210 
don't have those little muscles
stabilizing<00:01:06.930> themselves<00:01:07.350> whereas<00:01:08.010> for

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
stabilizing themselves whereas for

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.859 
stabilizing themselves whereas for
someone<00:01:08.700> who's<00:01:08.850> more<00:01:09.030> accustomed<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.689> it

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
someone who's more accustomed to it

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.390 
someone who's more accustomed to it
they're<00:01:10.350> already<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.770> how<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> balance<00:01:11.100> on

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
they're already know how to balance on

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.679 
they're already know how to balance on
they<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.670> come<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.390> easily

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
they can come on and they can easily

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.200 
they can come on and they can easily
come<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> so

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
come off of it just like that and so

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.640 
come off of it just like that and so
there's<00:01:15.509> plenty<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.960> things<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.530> with

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
this because I like for the most part I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.710 
this because I like for the most part I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
lot of equipment maybe some weights

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.550 
lot of equipment maybe some weights
involved<00:01:27.360> too<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> most<00:01:28.170> part<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
