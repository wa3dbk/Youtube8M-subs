okay<00:00:01.110> so<00:00:01.170> we're<00:00:01.829> getting<00:00:01.920> close<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.490> end

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay so we're getting close to the end

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.260 
okay so we're getting close to the end
of<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.820> day<00:00:03.049> so<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.080> thought<00:00:04.410> I'd<00:00:04.589> take<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.799> video

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
of the day so I thought I'd take a video

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.350 
of the day so I thought I'd take a video
we<00:00:06.270> got<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.569> first<00:00:06.779> row<00:00:07.049> set<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.589> place<00:00:07.890> and

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
we got the first row set in place and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:18.260 
we got the first row set in place and
leveled<00:00:09.360> out<00:00:11.330> and<00:00:14.990> each<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.350> was<00:00:16.880> we<00:00:17.880> set<00:00:18.119> that

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
leveled out and each one was we set that

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.439 
leveled out and each one was we set that
stream<00:00:18.630> line<00:00:19.460> based<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.640> my<00:00:20.789> reference<00:00:21.210> tire

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
stream line based on my reference tire

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.250 
stream line based on my reference tire
that<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.720> wanted<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:23.689> set<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> string<00:00:25.080> line

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
that I wanted and set the string line

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.640 
that I wanted and set the string line
and<00:00:25.590> then<00:00:25.769> set<00:00:26.099> each<00:00:26.130> tire<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:27.900> made<00:00:28.470> sure

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and then set each tire and made sure

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.749 
and then set each tire and made sure
each<00:00:28.890> tire<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.550> level<00:00:31.219> side<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.369> side<00:00:32.550> in

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
each tire was level side to side in

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.240 
each tire was level side to side in
front<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.090> back<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:34.230> they're<00:00:34.950> screwed

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
front to back and they're screwed

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
front to back and they're screwed
together<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.739> pins<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:39.500> 10<00:00:40.500> inch

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
together and the pins are just 10 inch

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.380 
together and the pins are just 10 inch
stakes<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.309> hold<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.850> place<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.120> they

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
stakes just hold them in place so they

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
stakes just hold them in place so they
don't<00:00:42.420> slide<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:44.059> my<00:00:45.059> reference<00:00:45.539> line<00:00:46.160> which

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
don't slide off my reference line which

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.220 
don't slide off my reference line which
for<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.910> first<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
for this first one because of the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.220 
for this first one because of the
drainage<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> need<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.760> put<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
drainage you can see I need to put a

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.160 
drainage you can see I need to put a
drainage<00:00:52.230> tube<00:00:52.940> with<00:00:53.940> gravel<00:00:54.390> back<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
drainage tube with gravel back here and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.950 
drainage tube with gravel back here and
that's<00:00:55.760> up<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:57.000> with<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.270> yellow<00:00:57.510> string

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that's up there with that yellow string

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.470 
that's up there with that yellow string
on<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> perforated<00:00:59.480> drainage

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
on and you see that perforated drainage

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.310 
on and you see that perforated drainage
pipe<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.829> that'll<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.219> back<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.320> instead

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
pipe and that'll go back here so instead

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.469 
pipe and that'll go back here so instead
of<00:01:04.379> excavating<00:01:05.100> more<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.610> decided<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.240> slide

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
of excavating more I decided to slide

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.500 
of excavating more I decided to slide
the<00:01:06.659> tires<00:01:07.580> forward<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:11.360> that's<00:01:12.360> why

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the tires forward a bit so that's why

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.940 
the tires forward a bit so that's why
when<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.780> were<00:01:13.020> back<00:01:13.290> over<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
when we were back over there at the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.359 
when we were back over there at the
corner<00:01:14.130> coming<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> ramp<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:17.070> string

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
corner coming down the ramp the string

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.399 
corner coming down the ramp the string
line<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.790> basically<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:21.409> with

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
line is basically at the at the with

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
line is basically at the at the with
parallel<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> wall<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
parallel with the with the wall here of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.160 
parallel with the with the wall here of
the<00:01:24.900> garage<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:27.119> tires<00:01:27.360> are<00:01:27.720> sitting

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the garage so the tires are sitting

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.179 
the garage so the tires are sitting
about<00:01:28.650> 11<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> half<00:01:29.700> inches<00:01:30.470> in<00:01:31.470> front<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
about 11 and a half inches in front of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.480 
about 11 and a half inches in front of
the<00:01:32.430> edge<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.920> foundation<00:01:34.920> wall<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
the edge of this foundation wall for the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.749 
the edge of this foundation wall for the
garage<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.060> face<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:38.150> on<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.570> first<00:01:39.630> string

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
garage the face so on this first string

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.530 
garage the face so on this first string
so<00:01:41.759> they've<00:01:41.939> been<00:01:42.090> leveled<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:43.470> now<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> have

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
so they've been leveled and now I have

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.929 
so they've been leveled and now I have
that<00:01:45.540> reference<00:01:45.810> tire<00:01:46.259> packed<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.790> can

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that reference tire packed and you can

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.860 
that reference tire packed and you can
see<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> string<00:01:48.479> there<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.930> let<00:01:49.740> me<00:01:49.829> grab<00:01:52.700> ya

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
see the string there and let me grab ya

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:05.190 
see the string there and let me grab ya
my<00:01:55.870> turn<00:01:56.110> gonna<00:01:56.590> fear<00:01:56.979> but<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:04.020> little<00:02:05.020> bit

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
my turn gonna fear but a little bit

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.180 
my turn gonna fear but a little bit
before<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.140> can<00:02:08.350> see<00:02:10.830> when<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:11.950> push<00:02:12.160> down

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
before so you can see when I push down

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.870 
before so you can see when I push down
on<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.700> we<00:02:12.850> got<00:02:13.030> level<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:14.230> way<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.520> we<00:02:18.730> get

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
on that we got level that way and we get

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.360 
on that we got level that way and we get
level<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.660> way<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.070> our<00:02:21.190> reference

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
level that way so this is our reference

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.750 
level that way so this is our reference
tire<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:23.470> what<00:02:23.830> I'll<00:02:23.920> do<00:02:24.100> now<00:02:24.310> as<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.580> can<00:02:24.700> see

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
tire so what I'll do now as you can see

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.740 
tire so what I'll do now as you can see
the<00:02:25.090> string<00:02:25.540> line<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:27.360> pretty<00:02:28.360> much<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.690> you

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
the string line is pretty much and you

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.180 
the string line is pretty much and you
can<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:28.989> I've<00:02:29.080> got<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.440> one<00:02:29.620> kind<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:29.950> packed

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
can see I've got this one kind of packed

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.520 
can see I've got this one kind of packed
and<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:30.610> actually<00:02:31.180> popping<00:02:32.020> up<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.230> I'll

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
and it's actually popping up so I'll

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.600 
and it's actually popping up so I'll
probably<00:02:32.680> have<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.980> knock<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.370> down<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
probably have to knock that down a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.790 
probably have to knock that down a
little<00:02:33.700> bit<00:02:34.050> that's<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.200> little<00:02:35.380> pack<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> little

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
little bit that's a little pack a little

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.740 
little bit that's a little pack a little
too<00:02:36.040> high<00:02:36.220> but<00:02:36.400> that's<00:02:36.610> what<00:02:36.880> that's<00:02:37.570> so

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
too high but that's what that's so

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.080 
too high but that's what that's so
that'll<00:02:38.050> give<00:02:38.080> me<00:02:38.200> my<00:02:38.440> reference<00:02:38.920> as<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.790> how

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
that'll give me my reference as to how

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.229 
that'll give me my reference as to how
high<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.840> need<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.920> pack<00:02:42.130> those<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.910> string

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
high I need to pack those that string

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.270 
high I need to pack those that string
line<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.980> get<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> height<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:45.790> bulbing<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
line to get the height of bulbing the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.190 
line to get the height of bulbing the
tires<00:02:48.280> out<00:02:48.580> because<00:02:49.540> when<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.840> come<00:02:49.989> along

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
tires out because when you come along

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.220 
tires out because when you come along
and<00:02:50.260> you<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:51.239> clear<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.600> will<00:02:52.720> work<00:02:52.750> as

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
and you can clear this one will work as

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.270 
and you can clear this one will work as
a<00:02:53.260> demo<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:55.300> can<00:02:55.360> see<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.930> kind<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.320> grab<00:02:57.070> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
a demo you can see you kind of grab the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.830 
a demo you can see you kind of grab the
dirt<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:59.230> pull<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.630> sidewall<00:03:01.630> that

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
dirt and you pull that sidewall that

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.250 
dirt and you pull that sidewall that
tire<00:03:02.170> up<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.150> can<00:03:04.329> see<00:03:04.510> this<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.870> touching

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
tire up and you can see this is touching

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.150 
tire up and you can see this is touching
that<00:03:05.380> string<00:03:05.709> line<00:03:05.890> now<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.660> know<00:03:07.660> there<00:03:08.160> see

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
that string line now you know there see

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.949 
that string line now you know there see
this<00:03:09.370> one's<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:09.880> low<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.799> we<00:03:11.799> pull<00:03:12.070> that

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
this one's a little low so we pull that

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.440 
this one's a little low so we pull that
pull<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:13.989> sidewall<00:03:14.680> up<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.820> pack<00:03:16.180> dirt

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
pull that sidewall up and pack dirt

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.390 
pull that sidewall up and pack dirt
under<00:03:16.720> there<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.590> we'll<00:03:17.769> just<00:03:17.980> pound<00:03:18.220> that

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
under there so we'll just pound that

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.600 
under there so we'll just pound that
dirt<00:03:18.640> until<00:03:19.150> these<00:03:19.269> sidewalls<00:03:19.780> raise<00:03:20.079> up<00:03:20.610> that

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
dirt until these sidewalls raise up that

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.840 
dirt until these sidewalls raise up that
string<00:03:21.940> line<00:03:22.090> all<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.420> way<00:03:22.450> around<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.850> that

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
string line all the way around so that

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.240 
string line all the way around so that
one's<00:03:25.060> done<00:03:25.329> and<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:26.110> check<00:03:26.530> level<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.130> that's

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
one's done and we check level so that's

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.030 
one's done and we check level so that's
we<00:03:27.549> got<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.760> pack<00:03:27.970> all<00:03:28.209> these<00:03:28.390> going<00:03:28.900> down<00:03:29.170> and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
we got to pack all these going down and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.319 
we got to pack all these going down and
this<00:03:33.040> will<00:03:33.220> be<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.430> stairs<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:37.000> tire

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
this will be the stairs so this tire

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.590 
this will be the stairs so this tire
this<00:03:38.110> tire<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.860> tire<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.340> tire<00:03:39.600> there'll

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
this tire this tire this tire there'll

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.440 
this tire this tire this tire there'll
be<00:03:40.920> another<00:03:41.920> two<00:03:42.250> rows<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.489> tires<00:03:42.910> off<00:03:43.390> of

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
be another two rows of tires off of

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.259 
be another two rows of tires off of
these<00:03:43.870> two<00:03:44.470> or<00:03:45.190> these<00:03:45.489> four<00:03:45.700> tires<00:03:45.940> here<00:03:46.060> in

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
these two or these four tires here in

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.630 
these two or these four tires here in
front<00:03:46.540> going<00:03:46.750> back<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:48.130> create<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.459> thumb

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
front going back to create the thumb

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.479 
front going back to create the thumb
lowest<00:03:49.209> foundation<00:03:49.750> for<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.049> stairs<00:03:50.489> and

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
lowest foundation for the stairs and

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.759 
lowest foundation for the stairs and
then<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.060> second<00:03:52.600> trail<00:03:52.780> will<00:03:53.019> turn<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:53.739> go

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
then the second trail will turn and go

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.509 
then the second trail will turn and go
back<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:55.030> now<00:03:55.600> we'll<00:03:55.810> create<00:03:56.200> steps<00:03:56.709> going<00:03:57.310> up

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
back and now we'll create steps going up

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.580 
back and now we'll create steps going up
with<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.120> tires<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:58.690> then<00:03:59.200> those<00:03:59.380> will<00:03:59.530> be

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
with the tires and then those will be

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.069 
with the tires and then those will be
covered<00:03:59.859> with<00:03:59.890> concrete<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:01.090> then<00:04:01.870> over<00:04:02.049> here

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
covered with concrete and then over here

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.610 
covered with concrete and then over here
we<00:04:02.470> got<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:03.840> return<00:04:04.840> pipe<00:04:05.140> now<00:04:05.440> that's

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
we got the return pipe now that's

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.780 
we got the return pipe now that's
covered

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
covered

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.300 
covered
so<00:04:07.349> there's<00:04:08.349> the<00:04:08.879> the<00:04:09.879> pipes<00:04:10.180> set<00:04:10.840> in<00:04:10.959> place

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
so there's the the pipes set in place

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.240 
so there's the the pipes set in place
running<00:04:12.310> up<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.760> will<00:04:12.970> go<00:04:13.480> into<00:04:13.689> the<00:04:14.250> the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
running up that will go into the the

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.490 
running up that will go into the the
weir<00:04:15.459> for<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.849> waterfall<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:17.139> will<00:04:17.320> be

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
weir for the waterfall and this will be

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.099 
weir for the waterfall and this will be
I'm<00:04:18.220> standing<00:04:18.760> right<00:04:18.820> now<00:04:19.000> in<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.479> pond

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
I'm standing right now in the pond

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.740 
I'm standing right now in the pond
I'll<00:04:20.380> eventually<00:04:20.680> be<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.070> pond<00:04:21.389> so<00:04:22.389> in<00:04:22.600> right

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
I'll eventually be the pond so in right

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.500 
I'll eventually be the pond so in right
here<00:04:23.199> this<00:04:24.039> is<00:04:24.100> where<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.639> tires<00:04:24.880> will<00:04:25.210> start

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
here this is where the tires will start

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.480 
here this is where the tires will start
to<00:04:25.630> turn<00:04:25.930> off<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.530> this<00:04:26.680> one<00:04:26.889> this<00:04:27.100> will<00:04:27.250> be<00:04:27.310> the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
to turn off of this one this will be the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.820 
to turn off of this one this will be the
last<00:04:27.699> one<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.300> then<00:04:28.810> they<00:04:28.960> have<00:04:29.139> to<00:04:29.260> turn<00:04:29.470> for

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
last one and then they have to turn for

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.460 
last one and then they have to turn for
those<00:04:29.949> routes<00:04:30.280> there<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:30.940> they'll<00:04:31.870> turn<00:04:32.169> and

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
those routes there and they'll turn and

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.890 
those routes there and they'll turn and
come<00:04:32.889> out<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.370> go<00:04:33.970> around<00:04:34.090> that<00:04:34.479> big<00:04:34.690> route

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
come out and go around that big route

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.040 
come out and go around that big route
over<00:04:35.020> there<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.620> then<00:04:36.280> end<00:04:36.520> up<00:04:36.690> over<00:04:37.690> by<00:04:37.810> that

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
over there and then end up over by that

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.219 
over there and then end up over by that
fence<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.669> will<00:04:39.880> be<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.630> then<00:04:41.020> that's

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
fence and that will be and then that's

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.189 
fence and that will be and then that's
where<00:04:41.440> those<00:04:42.240> would<00:04:43.240> be<00:04:43.419> backfilled<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:44.139> all

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
where those would be backfilled and all

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.140 
where those would be backfilled and all
that<00:04:44.410> so<00:04:45.750> so<00:04:46.750> that's<00:04:46.900> what<00:04:47.199> we've<00:04:47.350> got

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
that so so that's what we've got

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.640 
that so so that's what we've got
accomplished<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:50.110> we're<00:04:50.229> getting<00:04:50.440> close<00:04:50.620> to

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
accomplished and we're getting close to

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.080 
accomplished and we're getting close to
the<00:04:50.860> end<00:04:50.949> of<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.280> day<00:04:51.460> but<00:04:51.520> I'm<00:04:51.789> going<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:51.970> try

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
the end of the day but I'm going to try
