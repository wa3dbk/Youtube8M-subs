00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.460 
to have a bit more control about the
start<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.130> game<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.820> fantasy<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:04.020> lineup

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
start of the game the fantasy the lineup

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.290 
start of the game the fantasy the lineup
is<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.860> teams<00:03:05.130> they<00:03:05.400> see<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.760> handshaking

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
is to the teams they see the handshaking

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.720 
is to the teams they see the handshaking
it<00:03:07.140> gives<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.500> start<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:07.950> game<00:03:08.160> bit<00:03:08.580> more

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
it gives the start of the game bit more

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.610 
it gives the start of the game bit more
presence<00:03:09.150> referees<00:03:09.930> now<00:03:10.110> got<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.350> bit<00:03:10.500> more

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
presence referees now got a bit more

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:24.410 
presence referees now got a bit more
controlled<00:03:11.100> by<00:03:11.670> talking<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.270> captain's

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.199 

before<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.440> came<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.740> place<00:03:26.190> they're<00:03:27.060> probably

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
before it came to place they're probably

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.140 
before it came to place they're probably
more<00:03:27.599> sending<00:03:28.200> off<00:03:28.349> so<00:03:28.620> less<00:03:29.310> respect<00:03:29.790> to

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
more sending off so less respect to

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.710 
more sending off so less respect to
players<00:03:30.420> whereas<00:03:31.200> now<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.440> think<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.130> helped

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
players whereas now I think it's helped

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.180 
players whereas now I think it's helped
referees<00:03:33.720> officials<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.500> players<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.980> take

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
referees officials and players to take

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.460 
referees officials and players to take
on<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.580> idea<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.720> they've<00:03:36.959> got<00:03:37.140> respect

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
on the idea that they've got respect

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.020 
on the idea that they've got respect
each<00:03:37.650> other

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.699 

I've<00:03:42.630> seen<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.900> lot<00:03:42.930> more<00:03:43.170> younger<00:03:43.410> that's

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
I've seen a lot more younger that's

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.740 
I've seen a lot more younger that's
coming<00:03:44.310> into<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.880> game<00:03:45.000> since<00:03:45.300> respect

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
coming into the game since respect

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.870 
coming into the game since respect
campaigns<00:03:46.140> know<00:03:46.290> about<00:03:46.560> which<00:03:47.370> i<00:03:47.550> think<00:03:47.610> is

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
campaigns know about which i think is

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.510 
campaigns know about which i think is
good<00:03:48.450> because<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.840> will<00:03:49.020> see<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:50.220> young

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
good because you will see that young

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.059 
good because you will see that young
risk<00:03:50.790> on<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.060> food<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.510> got<00:03:52.410> no<00:03:52.530> game<00:03:52.800> really

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
risk on the food and got no game really

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.550 
risk on the food and got no game really
so<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.730> need<00:03:53.910> them<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.660> my<00:03:54.810> County<00:03:55.260> for<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
so you need them in my County for the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.710 
so you need them in my County for the
twenty<00:03:55.890> two<00:03:56.040> percent<00:03:56.190> increase<00:03:56.790> in<00:03:56.819> referees

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
twenty two percent increase in referees

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.449 
twenty two percent increase in referees
which<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.440> great<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.739> lot<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.010> those<00:03:59.130> are<00:03:59.340> young

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
which is great a lot of those are young

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.070 
which is great a lot of those are young
referees<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.060> want<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.420> get<00:04:00.569> involved<00:04:00.810> I

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
referees you want to get involved I

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.420 
referees you want to get involved I
think<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.530> that's<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:01.920> got<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.220> be<00:04:02.280> good

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
think that that's just got to be good

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.160 
think that that's just got to be good
for<00:04:02.640> ruining<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.390> good<00:04:03.510> for<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.810> future<00:04:04.140> of

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
for ruining and good for the future of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:18.009 
for ruining and good for the future of
football

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019

the respect campaign is a good thing for
the<00:04:20.720> game<00:04:20.930> because<00:04:21.259> it's<00:04:21.410> all<00:04:21.650> players

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949
