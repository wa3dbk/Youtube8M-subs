out<00:03:31.019> there<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:31.890> that<00:03:32.130> we<00:03:32.340> as<00:03:32.910> far<00:03:33.269> as<00:03:33.389> so<00:03:33.600> close

concern I think we sit in on a type of

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.099 
concern I think we sit in on a type of
music<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:37.859> take<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.340> world<00:03:38.489> by<00:03:38.730> storm
