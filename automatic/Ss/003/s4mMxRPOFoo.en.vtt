00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
similar to Gengar in the sense that it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.480 
similar to Gengar in the sense that it's
a<00:01:12.540> glass<00:01:12.810> cannon<00:01:13.170> has<00:01:13.619> no<00:01:13.799> defenses<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.340> all

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
but it hits really really hard with

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.570 
but it hits really really hard with
electric<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.350> buzz<00:01:16.500> type<00:01:16.710> moves<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.189> of

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
electric and buzz type moves and of

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.340 
electric and buzz type moves and of
course<00:01:17.850> 16<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.659> got<00:01:18.780> even<00:01:18.900> better<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
course 16 I got even better because of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.390

sticky waves what I mean

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.710 
sticky waves what I mean
just<00:01:20.670> because<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.060> fact<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.360> he<00:01:21.450> can't

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
just because the fact that he can't

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.179 
just because the fact that he can't
really<00:01:21.780> take<00:01:22.049> hits<00:01:22.229> he's<00:01:22.500> he's<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> little
