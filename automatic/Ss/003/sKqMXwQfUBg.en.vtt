taking<00:01:54.600> pictures<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.020> some<00:01:55.290> cases<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
taking pictures I know some cases that

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.499 
taking pictures I know some cases that
flash<00:01:56.399> will<00:01:56.610> bounce<00:01:56.820> off<00:01:57.000> their<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.420> edge

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
flash will bounce off their little edge

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.670 
flash will bounce off their little edge
of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> case<00:01:57.899> right<00:01:58.079> there<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.409> you'll<00:01:58.500> see

of the case right there and you'll see
like<00:01:58.829> I'm<00:01:58.950> aware<00:01:59.219> haze<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.880> case<00:02:00.060> didn't

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
like I'm aware haze but this case didn't

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.030 
like I'm aware haze but this case didn't
have<00:02:00.479> any<00:02:00.600> issues<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.890> see

there really has a really cool design on
this<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.990> yellow<00:02:04.110> show<00:02:04.409> of

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
this one this is like a yellow show of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.859 
this one this is like a yellow show of
the<00:02:04.619> circles<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.490> case<00:02:05.670> retails<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.060> 1999

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the circles this case retails for 1999

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.869 
the circles this case retails for 1999
on<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.920> case<00:02:08.599> mate<00:02:09.599> com<00:02:10.520> really<00:02:11.520> reasonably

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
on the case mate com really reasonably

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.910 
on the case mate com really reasonably
priced<00:02:12.209> case<00:02:12.870> may<00:02:13.020> has<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> largest

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
priced case may has a largest

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.290 
priced case may has a largest
cases<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.430> they<00:02:14.520> offer<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.270> a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
cases that they offer and they have a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.309

really<00:02:15.450> good<00:02:15.630> track<00:02:15.750> record<00:02:15.959> when<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.230> comes

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
really good track record when it comes

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.900 
really good track record when it comes
to<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.740> quality<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.280> don't<00:02:17.459> think<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.849> can

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
to the quality so I don't think you can

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.640 
to the quality so I don't think you can
have<00:02:18.090> any<00:02:18.209> issues<00:02:18.510> with<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.810> at<00:02:18.930> all<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.500> is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
have any issues with this at all this is

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.050 
have any issues with this at all this is
it<00:02:19.860> provides<00:02:20.160> pretty<00:02:20.430> minimal<00:02:20.760> minimal

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it provides pretty minimal minimal

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.900 
it provides pretty minimal minimal
minimal<00:02:21.690> protection<00:02:22.230> if<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.069> do<00:02:23.190> drop<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.640> it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
minimal protection if you do drop it it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.070 
minimal protection if you do drop it it
does<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.209> screen<00:02:24.390> protector<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.780> case<00:02:24.959> you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
does have a screen protector in case you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.650 
does have a screen protector in case you
do<00:02:25.230> possibly<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.370> possibly<00:02:26.819> scratch<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.300> it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
do possibly can possibly scratch it it

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.059 
do possibly can possibly scratch it it
will<00:02:27.780> protect<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.590> screen<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.830> little<00:02:28.860> bit

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
will protect the screen a little bit

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.920 
will protect the screen a little bit
there<00:02:29.250> but<00:02:29.849> for<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.270> most<00:02:30.420> part<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.810> just

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
there but for the most part it's just

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.420 
there but for the most part it's just
kind<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.290> factual<00:02:31.590> style<00:02:31.890> case<00:02:32.100> mr.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
