00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.000

 the following is this that I loved is 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.439

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.280
 among the favorites is this because in 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.099
 reality is it is not very common and it is not very 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.800
 easy to find it is very good 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.810

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.989
 design I liked a lot because it's a 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.989
 very large cursor and I know that some 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.400
 they like the color rosita combined with 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.260
 gray then see very well 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.640
 one that they have asked me a lot and 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.099
 Ekiza I bring you this is the cursor 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.959

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.970
 another that I love many the little hand of 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.400

 those girls who love 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.859
 pastel colors 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.930
 one that they had also asked for a lot 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.760
 like the previous one is this the mustache me 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.250
 loved it but this is different because 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.310
 combines black with a touch of pink 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.160
 that makes it look very feminine here what 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.440
 I have and another that I also like good 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.270

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.930

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.010

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.010
 I have used and I am doing very well 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.400
 another one that I also like about her is 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.170

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.390

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.180

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.209

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.430
 among my favorites is infinity but 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.260
 It has a pink color that makes it look 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.570
 very, very, very feminine 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.370
 good girls these are the cursors that 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.800

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.170
 say how to place them signia society is 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.260
 no program are we going to close this and 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.050
 let's open our control panel 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.870
 I already have it here in my bar 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.450

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.220
 go to this search bar let's go to 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.220

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.970
 we will give a click 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.550
 where says mouse we will leave this 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.550
 window after we 're going to go to 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.730
 pointers 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.360
 and here we are going to see the cursor that we have 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.090
 installed at this moment that I good 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.670
 I have this to change it is very 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.100
 simple first of all they must be lowered 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.290
 these cursors I will leave the link 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.880
 in the description of the video once 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.890
 we have already downloaded them it will be very easy 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.280
 because we only have to look for them 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.260
 for this we are going to select the one 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.930
 we want to change in this case I'm going to 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.540
 start with the normal selection what 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.280
 selected I will give you to examine and 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.630
 I'm going to look for the folder where they have my 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.720
 cursors that is this 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.880
 once I have it here I go to 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.770
 choose which one I liked best 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.490
 this case I will put the d 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.490
 a mustache 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.349
 I notice that I have the selector of 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.840
 normal selection and I'll look for the one of 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.920
 normal selection that I found normal what 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.140
 selected I give in open 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.080
 and once you have already selected it 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.150
 we see that the cursor is going to change 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.280
 I'm going to do with each one of these 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.070
 example I'm going to select this one I give in 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.920

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:14.920
 help I selected it I give in open 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.900
 and we see that we have already changed these 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.790
 two and so I will do with each of 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.010
 these once you have finished with 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.960
