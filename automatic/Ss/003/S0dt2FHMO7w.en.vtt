floating selection so we need to

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.540 
floating selection so we need to
right-click<00:03:56.660> on<00:03:57.050> it<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.440> we<00:03:58.100> need<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.310> anchor

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
all the green and basically just take

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.320 
all the green and basically just take
out<00:04:26.480> as<00:04:26.750> much<00:04:27.080> as<00:04:27.290> you<00:04:27.320> can<00:04:27.620> of<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.190> green<00:04:31.330> and

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.110 

remember<00:05:19.710> we<00:05:19.830> could<00:05:19.979> do<00:05:20.100> text<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.699> selection

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
remember we could do text to selection

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.960 
remember we could do text to selection

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
to use a gradient or something like that

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.820 
to use a gradient or something like that
or<00:05:27.300> one<00:05:27.870> of<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.080> techniques<00:05:28.590> we've<00:05:28.800> learned

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
or one of the techniques we've learned

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.570 
or one of the techniques we've learned
for<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.550> font<00:05:29.819> you<00:05:30.360> can<00:05:30.509> do<00:05:30.599> that<00:05:30.780> as<00:05:30.930> well

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
for the font you can do that as well

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.980 
for the font you can do that as well
once<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:32.729> have<00:05:32.880> that<00:05:33.060> done<00:05:33.300> let's<00:05:33.690> go<00:05:33.870> ahead
