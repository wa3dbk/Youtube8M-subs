basically what this video is gonna be
about<00:00:12.010> this<00:00:12.550> is<00:00:12.700> just<00:00:12.910> a<00:00:13.000> comparison<00:00:13.330> video<00:00:13.720> a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
about this is just a comparison video a

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.990 
about this is just a comparison video a
lot<00:00:14.769> of<00:00:14.890> people<00:00:15.100> that<00:00:15.220> kept<00:00:15.460> up<00:00:15.640> with<00:00:15.670> me

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
lot of people that kept up with me

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.870 
lot of people that kept up with me
locally<00:00:16.660> or<00:00:16.929> know<00:00:17.349> me<00:00:17.589> period<00:00:18.099> know<00:00:18.579> that<00:00:18.759> I

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
locally or know me period know that I

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.210 
locally or know me period know that I
was<00:00:19.029> a<00:00:19.060> heart<00:00:19.390> that<00:00:19.900> heart<00:00:20.019> cadence<00:00:20.499> fan<00:00:20.800> I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
was a heart that heart cadence fan I

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.380 
was a heart that heart cadence fan I
just<00:00:22.060> want<00:00:22.240> to<00:00:22.329> try<00:00:22.509> something<00:00:22.929> new<00:00:23.079> this<00:00:23.109> year

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
just want to try something new this year

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.239 
just want to try something new this year
so<00:00:25.390> I<00:00:25.749> did<00:00:26.470> these<00:00:26.800> guys<00:00:27.069> have<00:00:27.369> been<00:00:27.400> sold<00:00:27.999> but

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:29.249 
so I did these guys have been sold but

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.859 
so I did these guys have been sold but
the<00:00:30.249> guy<00:00:30.399> hasn't<00:00:30.609> picked<00:00:30.970> them<00:00:31.119> up<00:00:31.269> yet<00:00:31.539> so<00:00:31.720> I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
the guy hasn't picked them up yet so I

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.400 
the guy hasn't picked them up yet so I
figured<00:00:32.290> I'd<00:00:32.410> do<00:00:32.560> a<00:00:32.590> comparison<00:00:33.070> video<00:00:34.410> this

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
figured I'd do a comparison video this

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.480 
figured I'd do a comparison video this
would<00:00:35.590> be<00:00:35.740> the<00:00:36.190> Kanan<00:00:36.700> CB<00:00:37.270> r<00:00:38.070> CB<00:00:39.070> RM<00:00:39.630> CB<00:00:40.630> l<00:00:40.840> M

or nine pounds this guy over here turned

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.960 
or nine pounds this guy over here turned
out<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.230> be<00:00:59.350> 11<00:00:59.740> and<00:00:59.829> a<00:00:59.920> half<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:01.650> Cadence's

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
out to be 11 and a half this Cadence's

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.640 
out to be 11 and a half this Cadence's
because<00:01:03.970> of<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.150> slug<00:01:04.449> magnet<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:05.050> it<00:01:05.199> has<00:01:05.379> it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
because of a slug magnet that it has it

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.680 
because of a slug magnet that it has it
is<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.800> lot<00:01:06.190> heavier<00:01:06.640> does<00:01:06.970> have<00:01:07.150> more<00:01:07.420> motor

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
is a lot heavier does have more motor

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.970 
is a lot heavier does have more motor
force<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:09.610> both<00:01:09.820> have<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.800> terminals<00:01:11.800> that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
force they both have the terminals that

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.370 
force they both have the terminals that
I<00:01:12.010> preferred<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.550> I<00:01:12.850> say<00:01:13.120> I<00:01:13.150> don't<00:01:13.270> like<00:01:13.750> both

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
I preferred that I say I don't like both

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.100 
I preferred that I say I don't like both
of<00:01:14.409> them<00:01:14.770> has<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:16.270> good<00:01:16.510> tensile<00:01:16.780> leads

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
of them has really good tensile leads

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.070 
of them has really good tensile leads
these<00:01:17.409> guys<00:01:17.650> have<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.280> tencel's<00:01:19.080> some

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
these guys have the tencel's some

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.870 
these guys have the tencel's some
similar<00:01:20.530> like<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:20.830> sub<00:01:21.100> that<00:01:21.310> freefloat

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
similar like the sub that freefloat

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.270 
similar like the sub that freefloat
going<00:01:22.330> into<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.870> boy<00:01:23.290> school<00:01:23.650> where<00:01:24.010> it<00:01:24.100> says

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
going into the boy school where it says

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.090 
going into the boy school where it says
these<00:01:24.490> guys<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:25.659> their<00:01:26.050> tencel's<00:01:26.710> actually

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
these guys have their tencel's actually

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.260 
these guys have their tencel's actually
woven<00:01:27.729> into<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.920> surround

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
woven into the surround

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.090 
woven into the surround
so<00:01:32.549> overall<00:01:34.380> they're<00:01:35.380> both<00:01:35.590> have<00:01:35.830> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
so overall they're both have the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.510 
so overall they're both have the
aluminum<00:01:36.549> basket

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.190 

like<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.550> said<00:01:40.670> when<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:41.270> look<00:01:41.420> at<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.690> back<00:01:41.930> of

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
like I said when you look at the back of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.690 
like I said when you look at the back of
them<00:01:43.360> one<00:01:44.360> does<00:01:44.630> have<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.260> penis<00:01:46.250> does<00:01:46.430> out

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
them one does have the penis does out

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.190 
them one does have the penis does out
beat<00:01:46.910> it<00:01:47.060> on<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.360> magnet<00:01:47.750> but<00:01:47.900> it's<00:01:48.050> not

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
beat it on the magnet but it's not

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.500 
beat it on the magnet but it's not
vignetting<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.130> once<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:49.700> coil<00:01:50.060> gets<00:01:50.270> hot

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
vignetting so once that coil gets hot

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.030 
vignetting so once that coil gets hot
it's<00:01:50.780> gonna<00:01:50.870> be<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.080> bitch<00:01:51.350> cooling<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.860> back

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
it's gonna be a bitch cooling it back

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.330 
it's gonna be a bitch cooling it back
down<00:01:52.390> versus<00:01:53.500> PRV<00:01:54.500> kind<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:55.010> thought<00:01:55.190> about

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
down versus PRV kind of thought about

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.150 
down versus PRV kind of thought about
that<00:01:55.640> same<00:01:55.940> process<00:01:56.480> they<00:01:56.720> actually<00:01:57.170> stuck<00:01:58.130> a

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
that same process they actually stuck a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.580 
that same process they actually stuck a
vent<00:01:58.430> hole<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.910> back<00:01:59.140> which<00:02:00.140> will<00:02:00.320> allow

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
vent hole in the back which will allow

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.670 
vent hole in the back which will allow
it<00:02:00.620> to<00:02:00.770> have<00:02:01.010> more<00:02:01.190> power<00:02:01.400> handling<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.240> also

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
it to have more power handling and also

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.770 
it to have more power handling and also
be<00:02:03.680> able<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.950> keep<00:02:04.100> itself<00:02:04.430> cooler<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.630> in

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
be able to keep itself cooler and in

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.300 
be able to keep itself cooler and in
essence<00:02:06.170> basically<00:02:06.710> you'll<00:02:06.830> be<00:02:06.950> able<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.190> get

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
essence basically you'll be able to get

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.950 
essence basically you'll be able to get
this<00:02:07.400> asshole<00:02:07.640> for<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.119> longer<00:02:08.420> duration<00:02:08.540> of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
time not saying that I had any cooling

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.140 
time not saying that I had any cooling
problems<00:02:12.560> with<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.100> cadence<00:02:13.310> cuz<00:02:13.730> that's<00:02:14.030> not

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
problems with the cadence cuz that's not

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.430 
problems with the cadence cuz that's not
what<00:02:14.840> I'm<00:02:14.959> trying<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.350> say<00:02:15.560> at<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:17.410> but<00:02:18.410> I

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
what I'm trying to say at all but I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.770 
what I'm trying to say at all but I
can't<00:02:18.800> say<00:02:19.100> overall<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.000> cadence<00:02:20.450> if

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
can't say overall that the cadence if

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.780 
can't say overall that the cadence if
you<00:02:21.050> do<00:02:21.290> not<00:02:21.470> have<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.770> lot<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.040> door<00:02:22.280> space<00:02:22.610> so

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
you do not have a lot of door space so

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.460 
you do not have a lot of door space so
if<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:22.970> don't<00:02:23.180> want<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.450> build<00:02:23.600> out<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.320> only

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
if you don't want to build out it's only

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.190 
if you don't want to build out it's only
3.2<00:02:25.400> inches<00:02:25.760> tall<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.530> very<00:02:27.890> very

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
3.2 inches tall so it's a very very

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.440 
3.2 inches tall so it's a very very
shallow<00:02:30.200> speaker<00:02:32.350> versus<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:34.580> have<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.090> PRV

which is four and a half inches tall

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.690
