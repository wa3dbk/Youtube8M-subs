a<00:00:30.480> focused<00:00:31.320> sports<00:00:31.980> car<00:00:32.250> who<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.329> car

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
a focused sports car who want this car

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.980 
a focused sports car who want this car
to<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.809> faster

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.200 

I'm<00:00:38.590> responsible<00:00:38.950> for<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.340> track<00:00:39.550> DSC<00:00:40.030> and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
I'm responsible for the track DSC and

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.360 
I'm responsible for the track DSC and
the<00:00:40.480> EDF<00:00:40.720> calibration<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.500> we<00:00:41.980> try<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.280> get

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
the EDF calibration and we try and get

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.970 
the EDF calibration and we try and get
them<00:00:42.520> harmonized

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.060 

I<00:00:46.070> don't<00:00:46.880> almost<00:00:47.630> 16,000<00:00:48.380> laps<00:00:48.590> at<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.829> ring

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
I don't almost 16,000 laps at the ring

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
I don't almost 16,000 laps at the ring
so<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:50.090> dare<00:00:50.390> say<00:00:50.420> that<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:50.870> know<00:00:50.900> it<00:00:51.140> fairly<00:00:51.380> well

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
so I dare say that I know it fairly well

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.490 
so I dare say that I know it fairly well
after<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:53.120> while<00:00:53.420> you're<00:00:53.690> driving<00:00:54.110> is<00:00:54.200> almost

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
after a while you're driving is almost

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.590 
after a while you're driving is almost
automatic<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.309> that<00:00:55.970> allows<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:56.540> to

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
automatic and that allows you to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.380 
automatic and that allows you to
concentrate<00:00:57.079> on<00:00:57.470> what<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.650> car<00:00:57.890> is<00:00:58.040> too<00:00:58.390> long

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
concentrate on what a car is too long

the<00:01:12.650> performance<00:01:13.040> isn't<00:01:13.190> quite<00:01:13.520> optimized

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
the performance isn't quite optimized

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.420 
the performance isn't quite optimized
we'll<00:01:15.020> look<00:01:15.110> at<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.320> data<00:01:15.470> trace<00:01:15.860> change<00:01:16.280> some

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
we'll look at the data trace change some

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.730 
we'll look at the data trace change some
parameters<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:16.940> basically<00:01:17.330> retest<00:01:17.810> until

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
parameters and basically retest until

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.529 
parameters and basically retest until
we're<00:01:18.860> happy<00:01:19.009> with<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.280> car<00:01:19.430> feel<00:01:19.789> and<00:01:20.060> it's

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
we're happy with the car feel and it's

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.750 
we're happy with the car feel and it's
all<00:01:20.690> about<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.990> feel<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.500> car

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.490 

the<00:01:26.180> driver<00:01:26.420> needs<00:01:26.660> to<00:01:26.780> be<00:01:26.870> connected<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.410> the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
the driver needs to be connected to the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.320 
the driver needs to be connected to the
car<00:01:27.710> so<00:01:28.130> in<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.400> f-type<00:01:28.700> what<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.180> so

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
car so in the f-type what is so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.780 
car so in the f-type what is so
rewarding<00:01:29.540> is<00:01:30.020> that<00:01:30.230> you<00:01:30.440> have<00:01:30.860> good<00:01:31.370> feedback

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
rewarding is that you have good feedback

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.850 
rewarding is that you have good feedback
from<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.090> tires<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:33.050> balance<00:01:33.410> front<00:01:33.680> and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
from the tires the balance front and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.220 
from the tires the balance front and
rear<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.310> efficient<00:01:35.120> so<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:35.480> can<00:01:35.690> go<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.870> power

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
rear is efficient so you can go to power

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.650 
rear is efficient so you can go to power
giving<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.310> lot<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.730> satisfaction<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
our system off we want them to use them

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.470 
our system off we want them to use them
to<00:01:43.880> enjoy<00:01:44.000> them<00:01:45.430> into<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.550> carousel<00:01:47.030> I<00:01:47.240> get<00:01:47.450> a
