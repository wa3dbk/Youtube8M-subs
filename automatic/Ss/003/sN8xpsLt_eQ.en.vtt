 lively here is the earpiece that comes 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.739
 These are the most ordinary headphones 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:27.030
 very good bass there is everything there is even 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:29.980
 There is a clip, too, it charges from 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.190
 computer outlet but the manufacturer does not 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.540
 recommends charging from an outlet in such 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:43.930
 here is an adapter inserted here and 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:49.560
 20 beaten insert and charge this 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:54.970
 computer or so that from the outlet for the same 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:58.000
