00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.010
 I'm sleeping and I got up said that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.960
 cool good the first sure of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.460
 legation games that try a lot of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.200
 you do not remember it but there is a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.610
 group that if you remember too well 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.310
 I told him he was out there 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.220
 doing a little game about this very well 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.039
 the present day 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.930
 last month I improve I close I dwelt 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.279
 to explain very well when it 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.449
 rumored so is the new game 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.449
 delegation that this what the other 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.500
 well it seems that the day of his 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.079
 confirmed that this game does not hide 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.420
 gifts we are going to be based in the world 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.890
 of legacy of kain but it's going to be 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.600
 multiplayer nothing else which or but 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.140
 let's hope it is very good because 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.500
 I play delegation that in its play 1 and 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.730
 the truth 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.230
 zuma of that game if that difficult game 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.660
 super difficult and for very people 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.680
 intelligent the truth but legacy of 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.540
 kain nom my grandfather that day game like this 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.220
 how good you know we like it and go and 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.410
 is based only on the multiplayer nothing 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.550
 more because it comes first so it's not going to 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.720
 have history legacy of kain and no 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.540

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.180

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.190

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.060
 they will also focus on playstation 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.550
 3 and xbox 360 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.640

 service on both consoles to the maximum that 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.930
