00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.890
 Crossing Computacenter 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 this may 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.569
 oath 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.859
 Dudu Juli how are you? 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.859
 Zerbst Stuttgart 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.550
 Today we want to go high and that on our own 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340
 in crisis with a climbing gym 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.860

 There are three trousers each 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.670
 Comfortable clothes and matching shoes should be brought before you 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.670
 Make an appointment before evil you do not need 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.330
 naughty then it can go to the so-called Poulter Nepal to climb 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.880
 You do not need a secure partner in jump height, but we want to go up 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.680
 In addition, anyone who has never climbed has to be guided by a specialist us leader 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.700
 The safety belt can be secured like a pair of trousers and is firmly attached to the case 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.050
 the case that you just fall 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.460

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.210
 they go out there 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.480
 How does it feel 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.119
 rank 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.119
 honestly then I want that too what do I have to do for it 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.710
 There is a possibility that we were making the goal 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.269
 either you can do the art 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.679
 then you do not like to learn that 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:23.219
 or to be my elbow coach so the krad will now make it safe 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.019
 the people 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.549
 but you could also jewelry 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.159
 he gives the opportunity but it is important to just call delicatessen 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.249
 and to inform 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:33.779
 is borrowed 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.259
 The next wall is not for the faint-hearted Heath Ledger's 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:38.929
 absolute professionals 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.029
 and we do not have that too 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.759
 since there is no need to be very courageous, a heavy band 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.229
 to try out what Kurt SeemÃ¼ller shortens 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:50.419
 So for the first time in the topics on slips of a whole group are there 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.870
 different fame 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.070
 listed and people numbers 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.090
 the harder the route is 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.620
 So Damjan I want to tell you he may so vulgarly refer to the gray war 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.019
 try them are a little better than the DAX 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.459
 if it does not even know wearing a different color of the at least 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.419
 a little easier but if you think I have my dream for feet and 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.419
 hands 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.239
 ca you do not look so high when climbing so 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:23.540
 that is to say, in the neighborhood percent the unrecognized own 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.479
 Work of great work 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.930
 takes place over the feet so you really have to work in the legs 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.929
 nothing at all with your feet or physics 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.849
 Andrew be dropped 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.069

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.220
 when we catch up again a distinctive look issued patent of its own 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.089

 there is enough 30 October is coming 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:57.569
 Even if that still sounds math and physics can climb almost anyone and after 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.679
 a few steps is really fun 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:03.899
