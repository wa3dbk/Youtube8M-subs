00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
I'll probably do a little research

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.090 
I'll probably do a little research
before<00:01:53.609> I<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:54.509> what<00:01:55.439> temp<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.859> try<00:01:56.039> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
before I get into what temp to try to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.630 
before I get into what temp to try to
bring<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.499> so<00:01:58.499> it's<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.189> want<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
bring it to so it's it's I just want to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.560 
bring it to so it's it's I just want to
cure<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.939> good<00:02:00.179> give<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.469> smoke<00:02:01.859> and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
cure it good give it a little smoke and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.300 
cure it good give it a little smoke and
then<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:04.020> cured<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.159> we

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
then it's going to be cured you know we

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.160 
then it's going to be cured you know we
can<00:02:05.490> cook<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.789> any<00:02:05.880> time<00:02:06.179> we<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.869> before

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
can cook it any time we want just before

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.279 
can cook it any time we want just before
serving<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.119> figure<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.140> this

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
serving it so and I figure I can do this

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
thing I failed to mention is that I

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.080 
thing I failed to mention is that I
think<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:31.980> pretty<00:02:32.160> important<00:02:32.700> that<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.850> put

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
a plate on this because these things

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.190 
a plate on this because these things

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
will pull it up to the top if you don't

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.070 
will pull it up to the top if you don't
so<00:02:37.410> just<00:02:37.620> put<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> plate<00:02:38.070> on<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.430> make<00:02:38.580> sure<00:02:38.790> that
