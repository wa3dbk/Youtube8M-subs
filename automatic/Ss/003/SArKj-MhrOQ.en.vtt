00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.239

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.870
 Well, I'm going to show you how to prepare 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.780
 a very easy and very economical so 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.960
 let's start but before obviously 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.000
 I will send greetings that are for jake 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.790
 the oscar in foil in sonrojan damiÃ¡n 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.710
 from old time rosbel faldita tender and the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.750
 feed with now yes we go to the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.580
 process 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.310
 the ingredients are very easy 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.880
 we only occupy a container for 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.440
 make the castor oil or honey mixture 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.170
 I am watching right now what I have on hand not 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.450
 I know where I left her two paper strips 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.880
 waxed since it is used so that it does not 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.000
 paste the cookies or the cakes in 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.450
 Use in pastry and 3 caps 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.220
 of multivitamins carries the brand as 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.510
 I've always said the one you have on hand 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.330
 it serves you and that are the 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.630
 multivitamins are pills that bring 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.330
 well composed of vitamin + bmc and all 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.240
 that are used as a nutritional supplement 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.950
 so let's see how it is prepared 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.680
 already empty a little castor oil 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.920
 Now you're going to do a little hole 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.069
 the multivitamins and it will be added 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.590
 what comes out already csbm of disgusting but 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.569
 do not worry do not know ugly good do not know 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.099
 I eat it because it tastes like medicine 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.260
 obviously this is what you are going to do with the 3 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.209
 multivitamins 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.579
 once I've put all the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.200
 multivitamins we are going to stir for 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.129
 that is mixed together with the oil of 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.129
 castor or honey 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.590
 then with a spoon we go good with 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.080
 the back of a spoon we are going to 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.060
 Take out a little bit of the mixture and we're going 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.060
 to put on waxed paper 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.710
 and with the little fingers we are going to spread 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.440
 and tb of the strip and stay now 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.720
 What follows is that you are going to put it on the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.390
 Syrian mouth on the lips for about 5 a 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.820
 10 minutes if between 5 to 10 minutes 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.250
 that you want in that lapse of time and 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.990
 obviously you should not talk because if not 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.870
 it's going to fall and you can get it 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.360
 try and believe me it tastes like medicine 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.700
 It tastes very tasty to say 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.200
 and well this every how much you will not do 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.810
 you will do it every eight days if in 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.490
 eight days or just when I see that 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.790
 my lips are very mistreated by the 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.010
 cold and then let's do the test and 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.500
 Well, I'm not going to talk after 10 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.500
 good minutes we're going to put it like that 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.209
 I was already saying goodbye and I do not know why 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.519
 good will already be about 10 minutes and I 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.409
 remove the piece of paper and now what are you going to 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.500
 do what you're going to rinse with water without 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.959
 normal cold hot does not matter and now 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.820
 yes because we can make up and then 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.500
 leave me - the voice because this is something 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.050
 cold 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.700
 now yes I already rinse but I have left 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.930
 like the little magic water and we're going to 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.930
 remove with paper towels 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.199
 Now, if you're ready, you'll notice that your 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:54.120
 lips are softer and like more 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:56.740
 fleshy and clean above all and therefore 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.360
 I also like how that looks if you 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.120
 are charged to crimes and cough but 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.949
 Well, it's obvious how hydration is and how 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.629
 cold weather and therefore dehydrate 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.229
 that's why they split and put two feitos 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:11.560
 so this is a very good option to not 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.930
 to spend spending on how they say this are 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.220
 licit labial truth that also if 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.060
 you have one so you can complement it 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.530
 true but this has been all if you 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.139
 liked the video do not forget to subscribe 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.379
 give light and share I have videos 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.719
 every week that day I do not know when I have 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:31.349
 time I do one or two videos so 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:31.349
 goodbye
