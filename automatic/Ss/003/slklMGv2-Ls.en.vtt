or<00:02:10.940> pilot<00:02:11.940> power<00:02:12.090> anything<00:02:12.600> like<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.780> was

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
or pilot power anything like that was

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.110 
or pilot power anything like that was
mainly<00:02:14.010> because<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:16.790> whenever<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.970> bought

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
mainly because I just whenever I bought

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.630 
mainly because I just whenever I bought
the<00:02:18.209> bike<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> guy<00:02:18.570> had<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.989> put<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.640> just

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the bike the guy had just put on just

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.060 
the bike the guy had just put on just
put<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> brand<00:02:21.390> new<00:02:21.630> tire<00:02:22.410> on<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.620> rear<00:02:22.800> and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
put on a brand new tire on the rear and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.060 
put on a brand new tire on the rear and
it's<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.459> Michelin<00:02:24.150> radial<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.070> figured

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
it's a Michelin radial so I figured

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.600 
it's a Michelin radial so I figured
there<00:02:26.220> was<00:02:26.370> no<00:02:26.550> reason<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.000> go<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.510> by<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.739> brand

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
there was no reason to go in by a brand

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.360 
there was no reason to go in by a brand
new<00:02:29.820> nice<00:02:30.209> expensive<00:02:30.690> front<00:02:31.049> tire<00:02:31.370> because

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
new nice expensive front tire because

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.490 
new nice expensive front tire because
I'm<00:02:33.060> going<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.360> ride<00:02:33.540> out<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.959> year<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.440> I

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
I'm going to ride out this year so I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.830 
I'm going to ride out this year so I
figured<00:02:34.769> I'd<00:02:34.860> get<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.040> cheap<00:02:35.340> tire<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:36.600> weight

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
figured I'd get a cheap tire that weight

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.420 
figured I'd get a cheap tire that weight
the<00:02:37.140> beginning<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.590> next<00:02:37.650> year<00:02:37.920> i<00:02:38.070> would<00:02:38.280> go

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the beginning of next year i would go

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.640 
the beginning of next year i would go
ahead<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.700> replace<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:40.080> front<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.620> rear

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
ahead and replace the front and the rear

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.500 
ahead and replace the front and the rear
because<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.040> real<00:02:41.220> have<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> decent

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
because the real have have a decent

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.789 
because the real have have a decent
amount<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.690> miles<00:02:42.870> also<00:02:43.290> figured<00:02:43.530> replace

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
amount of miles also figured replace

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.030 
amount of miles also figured replace
both<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.310> them

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
both of them

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:55.950 
both of them
just<00:02:45.280> get<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.459> over<00:02:45.549> with

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.070 

so<00:02:56.730> that's<00:02:57.730> why<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:57.970> opted<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.510> get<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.780> cheaper

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
so that's why I opted to get the cheaper

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.280 
so that's why I opted to get the cheaper
tire<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:01.240> obviously<00:03:01.600> I'm<00:03:01.720> have<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.900> take<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.230> a

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
tire and obviously I'm have to take it a

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.870 
tire and obviously I'm have to take it a
little<00:03:02.410> easy<00:03:02.650> on<00:03:02.740> it<00:03:02.950> right<00:03:03.070> now<00:03:03.100> but<00:03:03.520> i'll

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
little easy on it right now but i'll

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.610 
little easy on it right now but i'll
have<00:03:04.090> i'll<00:03:04.600> put<00:03:04.780> enough<00:03:04.990> miles<00:03:05.230> on<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.440> here

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620

6517 so I looked up on the forums they

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.990 
6517 so I looked up on the forums they
said<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.070> was<00:04:26.160> completely<00:04:26.490> Brian<00:04:26.789> basically

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
said it was completely Brian basically

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.850 
said it was completely Brian basically
all<00:04:27.539> it<00:04:27.570> does<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.110> kind<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.440> adds<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.740> little

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
all it does is it kind of adds a little

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.850 
all it does is it kind of adds a little
bit<00:04:28.979> bumps<00:04:29.789> it<00:04:29.880> up<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.090> little<00:04:30.240> bit<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:31.080> 65<00:04:31.620> is

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
bit bumps it up a little bit the 65 is

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.060 
bit bumps it up a little bit the 65 is
isn't<00:04:32.490> as<00:04:32.610> tall<00:04:32.850> as<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.150> 770<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.740> makes<00:04:34.949> the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
isn't as tall as the 770 so it makes the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
they're like it'll it'll dive in the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.260 
they're like it'll it'll dive in the
corners<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.500> little<00:04:43.590> bit<00:04:44.100> more<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.789> that's

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
corners a little bit more and that's

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.640 
corners a little bit more and that's

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
I'm just turning on to turning onto a

I'm just turning on to turning onto a
road<00:04:49.289> it<00:04:49.919> was<00:04:50.160> really<00:04:50.550> uh<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:51.150> really<00:04:51.389> just

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
road it was really uh it really just

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.710 
road it was really uh it really just
kind<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.780> tipped<00:04:52.620> over<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.160> I<00:04:54.030> like<00:04:54.389> it<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.690> like

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
kind of tipped over and I like it I like

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.110 
kind of tipped over and I like it I like
it<00:04:54.900> makes<00:04:55.349> me<00:04:55.440> feel<00:04:55.620> like<00:04:55.800> I'm<00:04:56.160> actually<00:04:56.310> going

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
it makes me feel like I'm actually going

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.659 
it makes me feel like I'm actually going
into<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.570> corner<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:57.990> diving<00:04:58.289> through<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.830> so

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
into the corner and diving through it so

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.709 
into the corner and diving through it so
obviously<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.699> can't<00:05:01.939> really<00:05:02.029> give<00:05:02.239> a<00:05:02.269> few<00:05:02.599> on

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719
