current<00:00:07.890> skill<00:00:08.099> so<00:00:08.730> let's<00:00:09.330> get<00:00:09.599> started<00:00:10.050> so

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
current skill so let's get started so

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.270 
current skill so let's get started so
before<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.290> begin<00:00:13.440> there<00:00:13.799> are<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> couple<00:00:14.160> of

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
before we begin there are a couple of

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.499 
before we begin there are a couple of
things<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.580> should<00:00:14.610> probably<00:00:14.849> keep<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.299> mind

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
things we should probably keep in mind

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.359 
things we should probably keep in mind
before<00:00:15.839> attempting<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.379> move<00:00:16.590> first<00:00:17.190> off

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
before attempting this move first off

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.170 
before attempting this move first off

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
alright so starting with the takeoff we

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.190 
alright so starting with the takeoff we
can<00:00:41.579> see<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.180> different<00:00:42.570> things<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.079> first

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
can see if you different things so first

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.660 
can see if you different things so first
off<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.829> want<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> make<00:00:44.190> sure<00:00:44.219> we're<00:00:44.489> taking

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
off we want to make sure we're taking

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.490 
off we want to make sure we're taking
off<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> our<00:00:45.180> toes<00:00:45.390> which<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.050> generate<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
off of our toes which will generate the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.650 
off of our toes which will generate the
most<00:00:46.590> height<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> power<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:48.120> me<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.360> start

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
most height and power for me I start

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.880 
most height and power for me I start
standing<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.140> toes<00:00:49.320> from<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> beginning

standing on my toes from the beginning

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
standing on my toes from the beginning
because<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> helps<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.640> form<00:00:50.969> during<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
because it helps with my form during the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
because it helps with my form during the
jump<00:00:51.570> secondly<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.800> want<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> make<00:00:53.190> sure<00:00:53.370> our

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
jump secondly we want to make sure our

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.740 
jump secondly we want to make sure our
backs<00:00:53.789> are<00:00:54.000> straight<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.239> our<00:00:54.449> bodies

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
backs are straight with our bodies

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.840 
backs are straight with our bodies
perpendicular<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.860> ground<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.579> lastly

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
perpendicular to the ground and lastly

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
perpendicular to the ground and lastly
we<00:00:57.059> want<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> make<00:00:57.390> sure<00:00:57.570> our<00:00:57.600> arms<00:00:58.050> are

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
we want to make sure our arms are

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
we want to make sure our arms are
starting<00:00:58.410> high<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> air<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.699> we're

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
starting high in the air and that we're

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
starting high in the air and that we're
looking<00:00:59.940> straight<00:01:00.210> ahead<00:01:00.390> next<00:01:01.289> right<00:01:01.469> before

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
looking straight ahead next right before

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.290 
looking straight ahead next right before
we<00:01:01.829> jump<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.309> want<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> make<00:01:02.670> sure<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.210> are

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
we jump we want to make sure that we are

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
we jump we want to make sure that we are
bending<00:01:03.570> our<00:01:03.780> knees<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> 90<00:01:05.010> degree

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
bending our knees at about a 90 degree

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980 
bending our knees at about a 90 degree
angle<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.760> way<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.240> lose<00:01:06.510> any<00:01:06.750> power

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
angle that way we don't lose any power

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.780 
angle that way we don't lose any power
so<00:01:07.350> don't<00:01:07.560> bend<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:07.920> too<00:01:08.100> far<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.520> don't

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
so don't bend them too far and don't

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.700 
so don't bend them too far and don't
bend<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.210> too<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.290> also<00:01:10.409> make<00:01:10.680> sure

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
bend them too little and also make sure

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.990 
bend them too little and also make sure
that<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:11.100> winding<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:11.549> arms<00:01:11.790> up<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that you're winding your arms up and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.670 
that you're winding your arms up and
throwing<00:01:12.270> them<00:01:12.479> far<00:01:12.840> enough<00:01:12.930> back<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
throwing them far enough back so that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.810 
throwing them far enough back so that
you'll<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:13.920> able<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.130> generate<00:01:14.490> enough<00:01:14.700> lift

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
you'll be able to generate enough lift

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.330 
you'll be able to generate enough lift
when<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> jump<00:01:15.420> into<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> air<00:01:16.100> all<00:01:17.100> right

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
when you jump into the air all right

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
when you jump into the air all right
here<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.610> we're<00:01:17.880> jumping<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.570> make

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
here we go we're jumping now so make

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.999 
here we go we're jumping now so make
sure<00:01:19.020> when<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> jump<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.680> you're<00:01:19.799> using

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
sure when you jump that you're using

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.920 
sure when you jump that you're using
your<00:01:20.220> toes<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.670> order<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> generate<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.750> most

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
your toes in order to generate the most

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.810 
your toes in order to generate the most
power<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.830> also<00:01:23.040> make<00:01:23.520> sure<00:01:23.670> that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
to generate that rotation and also take

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.420 
to generate that rotation and also take
note<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.200> your<00:01:40.350> head<00:01:40.530> still<00:01:40.799> stays<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
note that your head still stays in a

neutral position with your eyes looking
forward<00:01:44.149> okay<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.210> once<00:01:45.689> you're<00:01:45.840> about

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
forward okay so once you're about

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.359 
forward okay so once you're about
halfway<00:01:46.200> through<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.680> flip<00:01:46.890> which<00:01:47.130> means

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
halfway through the flip which means

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.800 
halfway through the flip which means
you're<00:01:47.520> definitely<00:01:47.759> upside<00:01:48.270> down<00:01:48.420> by<00:01:48.600> now

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you're definitely upside down by now

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.569 
you're definitely upside down by now
make<00:01:49.350> sure<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.619> tilt<00:01:49.920> your<00:01:49.950> head<00:01:50.070> back<00:01:50.189> enough

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
make sure you tilt your head back enough

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.889 
make sure you tilt your head back enough
to<00:01:50.610> where<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.060> actually<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> ground

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
to where you can actually see the ground

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.990 
to where you can actually see the ground
so<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.259> spot<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.799> land<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.399> then<00:01:53.820> also

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
so you can spot and land and then also

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.429 
so you can spot and land and then also
by<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.270> point<00:01:54.600> make<00:01:54.720> sure<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.960> continue<00:01:55.290> to

by this point make sure you continue to
tuck<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.460> rotate<00:01:56.880> completely

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
tuck so that you can rotate completely

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.840 
tuck so that you can rotate completely
and<00:01:57.689> make<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.960> flip<00:01:58.170> after<00:01:58.829> spotting<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and make the flip after spotting the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.209 
and make the flip after spotting the
ground<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.360> open<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.890> bit<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
ground you open up just a little bit and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.639 
ground you open up just a little bit and
then<00:02:02.610> BAM<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.689> land<00:02:04.049> your<00:02:04.229> backflip<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
then BAM you land your backflip and

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.069 
then BAM you land your backflip and
