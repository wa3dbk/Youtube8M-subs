00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
play and fantasy I am very excited I've

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.840 
play and fantasy I am very excited I've
been<00:00:18.930> doing<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.260> lot<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.440> research<00:00:19.950> on<00:00:20.250> both

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
been doing a lot of research on both

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.180 
been doing a lot of research on both
players<00:00:21.180> trying<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> get<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:22.560> background<00:00:22.740> on

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
players trying to get some background on

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.160 
players trying to get some background on
them<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.000> little<00:00:24.420> bit<00:00:24.540> hard<00:00:24.780> to<00:00:24.840> do<00:00:24.990> that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
them it's a little bit hard to do that

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.740 
them it's a little bit hard to do that
too<00:00:25.320> fat<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.830> fantasy<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.670> fantasy<00:00:27.300> has

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
too fat for fantasy because fantasy has

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.320 
too fat for fantasy because fantasy has
a<00:00:27.780> very<00:00:28.140> shallow<00:00:28.440> record<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.220> far<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.700> think

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
a very shallow record so far I think

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.720 
a very shallow record so far I think
he's<00:00:30.420> had<00:00:30.600> five<00:00:30.900> games<00:00:31.289> against<00:00:31.650> zerg<00:00:31.950> he's

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
he's had five games against zerg he's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.660 
he's had five games against zerg he's
lost<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.329> them<00:00:34.010> but<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.159> know<00:00:35.280> that's<00:00:35.519> only

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
lost for them but you know that's only

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.430 
lost for them but you know that's only
five<00:00:35.940> games<00:00:36.269> you<00:00:36.480> can't<00:00:36.690> tell<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.170> good<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
five games you can't tell how good a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.860 
five games you can't tell how good a
person<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.980> by<00:00:38.159> five<00:00:38.399> games<00:00:38.699> so<00:00:39.059> who<00:00:39.690> knows

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
person is by five games so who knows

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.559 
person is by five games so who knows
maybe<00:00:40.199> he's<00:00:40.409> great<00:00:40.620> against<00:00:40.859> desert<00:00:41.420> but<00:00:42.420> yeah

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:42.569 
maybe he's great against desert but yeah

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:45.049 
maybe he's great against desert but yeah
GG<00:00:42.839> play<00:00:43.230> I'd<00:00:43.739> kind<00:00:44.069> of<00:00:44.129> underestimated<00:00:44.429> him

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
GG play I'd kind of underestimated him

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.029 
GG play I'd kind of underestimated him
going<00:00:45.359> into<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.749> into<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.319> last<00:00:46.530> matches

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
going into this into the last matches

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.290 
going into this into the last matches
I'd<00:00:47.999> known<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.690> he<00:00:48.749> had<00:00:48.870> won<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.109> no<00:00:49.319> SL

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
I'd known that he had won a no SL

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.180 
I'd known that he had won a no SL
against<00:00:51.300> iris<00:00:51.719> last<00:00:52.319> year<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.829> I'd<00:00:53.010> never

that entire series of games because it's

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.080 
that entire series of games because it's
just<00:01:17.190> inspiring<00:01:18.980> yeah<00:01:19.980> GG<00:01:20.280> play<00:01:20.520> looking<00:01:20.880> very

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
just inspiring yeah GG play looking very

just inspiring yeah GG play looking very
confident<00:01:21.690> here<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.290> he's<00:01:22.440> hungry<00:01:22.620> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
confident here I think he's hungry to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.510 
confident here I think he's hungry to
get<00:01:23.040> another<00:01:23.340> OSL<00:01:23.960> championship<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.520> fantasy

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
get another OSL championship and fantasy

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.010 
get another OSL championship and fantasy
looking<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.090> bit<00:01:27.270> nervous<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.750> got<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
looking a little bit nervous I got to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.830 
looking a little bit nervous I got to
say<00:01:28.370> he<00:01:29.370> is<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> new<00:01:29.820> player<00:01:30.120> so<00:01:30.510> that's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
say he is a new player so that's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.690 
say he is a new player so that's
probably<00:01:31.350> understandable<00:01:32.250> once<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.550> get

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
probably understandable once you get

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
probably understandable once you get
this<00:01:32.820> high<00:01:33.060> you've<00:01:33.750> got<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> lot<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.200> pressure

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
this high you've got a lot of pressure

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.990 
this high you've got a lot of pressure
on<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.660> succeed<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:37.640> we'll<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:38.850> what

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
on you to succeed and we'll see what

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.960 
on you to succeed and we'll see what
happens<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.990> 5<00:01:40.260> 4<00:01:40.920> 3<00:01:41.820> 2<00:01:42.800> 1<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:44.370> game<00:01:44.670> is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
happens this is 5 4 3 2 1 this game is

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.330 
happens this is 5 4 3 2 1 this game is
going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.480> on<00:01:45.840> plasma<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:48.740> if<00:01:49.740> fantasy<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
going to be on plasma so if fantasy is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.650 
going to be on plasma so if fantasy is
going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.580> win<00:01:50.730> one<00:01:50.910> he's<00:01:51.060> probably<00:01:51.300> going<00:01:51.540> to

think he will win on this map this map

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.780 
think he will win on this map this map
will<00:02:30.900> be<00:02:31.050> played<00:02:31.290> late<00:02:31.530> later<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.430> goes<00:02:32.580> on

later but yeah this is not as herb
favored<00:02:35.610> map<00:02:35.819> GG<00:02:36.450> played<00:02:36.660> it'd<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:37.050> flash<00:02:37.410> on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
favored map GG played it'd be flash on

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.290 
favored map GG played it'd be flash on
this<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.040> that's<00:02:38.489> just<00:02:38.700> because<00:02:38.880> flash

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
this but that's just because flash

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.930 
this but that's just because flash
played<00:02:39.930> pretty<00:02:40.860> poorly<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.370> gotta<00:02:41.670> say

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
played pretty poorly I gotta say

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
played pretty poorly I gotta say
switching<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.870> mac<00:02:43.110> at<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.739> wrong<00:02:43.890> time

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
switching to mac at just the wrong time

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.500 
switching to mac at just the wrong time
and<00:02:44.550> GG<00:02:45.120> play<00:02:45.270> was<00:02:45.450> able<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.750> capitalize<00:02:47.510> but

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and GG play was able to capitalize but

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.830 
and GG play was able to capitalize but
who<00:02:48.959> knows<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.640> have<00:02:50.640> no<00:02:50.970> idea<00:02:51.000> who's<00:02:51.450> coming<00:02:51.510> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
who knows I have no idea who's coming to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.570 
who knows I have no idea who's coming to
win<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.320> very<00:02:52.500> unpredictable<00:02:53.130> match

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
win this is a very unpredictable match

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.140 
win this is a very unpredictable match
especially<00:02:53.880> with<00:02:54.330> fantasies<00:02:54.900> shallow<00:02:55.170> record

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.330 

see<00:03:00.150> my<00:03:00.989> advice<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.410> fantasy<00:03:01.890> would<00:03:02.010> probably

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
see my advice to fantasy would probably

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.059 
see my advice to fantasy would probably
be<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.640> go<00:03:02.790> air<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.720> get<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> lot<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.260> air<00:03:04.650> units

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
be to go air just get a lot of air units

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.800 
be to go air just get a lot of air units
take<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.580> air<00:03:05.700> get<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.569> map

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
take the air get that map

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.199 
take the air get that map
maneuverability<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:07.830> he<00:03:08.430> can<00:03:08.640> expand

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
maneuverability so he can expand

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.380 
maneuverability so he can expand
wherever<00:03:09.540> he<00:03:09.690> wants<00:03:10.940> because<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.060> takes<00:03:12.239> a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
wherever he wants because it takes a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.820 
wherever he wants because it takes a
while<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.690> break<00:03:12.840> those<00:03:13.080> eggs<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.620> see

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
while to break those eggs you see

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.770 
while to break those eggs you see
fantasy<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.489> moving<00:03:14.880> out<00:03:14.970> with<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.209> scout<00:03:15.510> right

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
fantasy is moving out with a scout right

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.380 
fantasy is moving out with a scout right
now<00:03:16.459> probably<00:03:17.459> going<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.640> see<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:17.970> Overlord

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
now probably going to see that Overlord

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.390 
now probably going to see that Overlord
headed<00:03:18.780> towards<00:03:19.110> space<00:03:19.440> there<00:03:19.890> are<00:03:20.100> white

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
each other at the right position so hey

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.240 
each other at the right position so hey
another<00:03:29.250> white<00:03:29.489> guy<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:30.720> lot<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.709> white<00:03:31.920> people

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
another white guy a lot of white people

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.830 
another white guy a lot of white people
in<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.400> audience<00:03:32.519> today<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:34.610> yeah<00:03:35.840> both

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
in the audience today but yeah both

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.150 
in the audience today but yeah both
players<00:03:37.049> are<00:03:37.320> going<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.590> scout<00:03:37.799> each<00:03:37.950> other

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
players are going to scout each other

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640 
players are going to scout each other
first<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:38.970> neither<00:03:39.720> player<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.260> really<00:03:40.530> going

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
first so neither player is really going

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.910 
first so neither player is really going
to<00:03:40.769> have<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:40.950> huge<00:03:41.250> advantage<00:03:41.370> there<00:03:42.769> wait<00:03:43.769> this

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
to have a huge advantage there wait this

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.670 
to have a huge advantage there wait this
is<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> scalp<00:03:44.880> from<00:03:45.630> fantasy<00:03:46.140> fantasy<00:03:46.380> is

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
is not a scalp from fantasy fantasy is

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.380 
is not a scalp from fantasy fantasy is
building<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.070> barracks<00:03:47.430> down<00:03:47.670> here<00:03:47.940> we'll<00:03:48.209> see

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
building a barracks down here we'll see

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.170 
building a barracks down here we'll see
what<00:03:48.420> he<00:03:48.570> does<00:03:48.660> with<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.410> his<00:03:49.530> gas<00:03:49.769> so

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
what he does with this and his gas so

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.250 
what he does with this and his gas so
fantasy<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.239> probably<00:03:51.570> going<00:03:51.720> for<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.049> mech

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
fantasy is probably going for a mech

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.039 
fantasy is probably going for a mech
build<00:03:52.500> here<00:03:53.269> he's<00:03:54.269> building<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.690> barracks

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
build here he's building that barracks

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.870 
build here he's building that barracks
kind<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.470> out<00:03:55.680> there<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:56.310> I'm<00:03:56.400> guessing<00:03:56.609> he's

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
kind of out there so I'm guessing he's

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.970 
kind of out there so I'm guessing he's
going<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.150> float<00:03:57.359> it<00:03:57.480> over<00:03:57.600> as<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.959> scalp<00:03:58.260> you

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
going to float it over as the scalp you

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.069 
going to float it over as the scalp you
see<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.489> GG<00:03:59.790> play<00:03:59.970> already<00:04:00.269> has<00:04:00.420> his<00:04:00.600> gas<00:04:00.840> up

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
see that GG play already has his gas up

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.710 
see that GG play already has his gas up
so<00:04:01.410> probably<00:04:02.370> looking<00:04:02.700> at<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.850> another<00:04:03.299> fast

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
so probably looking at a another fast

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.849 
so probably looking at a another fast
layer<00:04:04.079> build<00:04:04.350> from<00:04:04.560> from<00:04:05.190> chichi<00:04:05.640> play<00:04:06.859> which

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
layer build from from chichi play which

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.220 
layer build from from chichi play which
definitely<00:04:08.579> benefited<00:04:09.150> him<00:04:09.329> in<00:04:09.540> his<00:04:09.840> game

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
definitely benefited him in his game

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.289 
definitely benefited him in his game
against<00:04:10.590> flash<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:11.340> see<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.700> layer<00:04:11.910> going<00:04:12.180> up

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
against flash you see the layer going up

proxy factory here in the middle from
from<00:04:24.110> fantasy<00:04:25.110> I'm<00:04:25.680> not<00:04:26.159> sure<00:04:26.370> if<00:04:26.490> he<00:04:26.580> really

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
from fantasy I'm not sure if he really

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.410 
from fantasy I'm not sure if he really
needs<00:04:27.419> to

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
needs to

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.620 
needs to
built<00:04:28.600> her<00:04:28.780> proxy<00:04:29.350> on<00:04:29.500> this<00:04:29.710> map<00:04:29.950> I'm<00:04:30.630> trying

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
built her proxy on this map I'm trying

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.210 
built her proxy on this map I'm trying
to<00:04:31.780> think<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.530> what<00:04:32.620> he's<00:04:32.770> going<00:04:32.920> to<00:04:32.950> do<00:04:33.100> with

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
to think of what he's going to do with

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.640 
to think of what he's going to do with
this<00:04:33.370> probably<00:04:33.790> get<00:04:34.090> some<00:04:34.270> vultures<00:04:34.660> out<00:04:34.810> try

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
this probably get some vultures out try

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.260 
this probably get some vultures out try
to<00:04:35.710> push<00:04:36.160> them<00:04:36.370> through<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.670> eggs<00:04:36.820> with<00:04:37.060> that

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
to push them through the eggs with that

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.410 
to push them through the eggs with that
barracks<00:04:37.960> trick<00:04:38.760> landing<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.880> barracks<00:04:40.210> on

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
barracks trick landing the barracks on

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.850 
barracks trick landing the barracks on
the<00:04:40.570> vulture<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.080> pushing<00:04:41.440> it<00:04:41.560> through<00:04:41.590> the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
the vulture and pushing it through the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.690 
the vulture and pushing it through the
eggs<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:43.590> GT<00:04:44.590> play<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:44.770> think<00:04:44.920> needs<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.430> block

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
eggs and GT play I think needs to block

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.300 
eggs and GT play I think needs to block
his<00:04:45.910> ramp<00:04:46.240> right<00:04:46.540> now<00:04:46.810> if<00:04:47.440> he<00:04:47.590> wants<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:47.890> yeah

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
his ramp right now if he wants to yeah

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.590 
his ramp right now if he wants to yeah
it<00:04:48.430> looks<00:04:48.610> like<00:04:48.730> he<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:48.910> going<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.210> block<00:04:49.390> that

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
it looks like he is going to block that

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.510 
it looks like he is going to block that
ramp<00:04:51.300> yeah<00:04:52.300> on<00:04:52.480> this<00:04:52.690> map<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.350> ramp<00:04:53.650> up<00:04:53.860> into

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
ramp yeah on this map the ramp up into

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.850 
ramp yeah on this map the ramp up into
the<00:04:54.670> base<00:04:54.850> is<00:04:55.090> so<00:04:55.330> small<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.720> it's<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.410> think

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
the base is so small that it's I think

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.140 
the base is so small that it's I think
it's<00:04:57.130> definitely<00:04:57.430> in<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.790> players<00:04:58.090> that

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
it's definitely in the players that

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.540 
it's definitely in the players that
vanished<00:04:58.600> at<00:04:58.810> least<00:04:58.990> put<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.560> drone<00:04:59.980> there<00:05:00.250> or

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
vanished at least put a drone there or

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.880 
vanished at least put a drone there or
an<00:05:00.790> SCV<00:05:01.120> because<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.080> only<00:05:02.200> takes<00:05:02.470> like<00:05:02.590> one

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
an SCV because it only takes like one

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.510 
an SCV because it only takes like one
drone<00:05:03.160> or<00:05:03.310> SUV<00:05:03.820> to<00:05:04.360> block<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.810> ramp<00:05:05.020> and

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
drone or SUV to block the ramp and

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.370 
drone or SUV to block the ramp and
that's<00:05:06.520> not<00:05:06.730> much<00:05:07.210> of<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.420> sacrifice<00:05:07.570> at<00:05:08.050> all<00:05:08.170> to

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
that's not much of a sacrifice at all to

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.230 
that's not much of a sacrifice at all to
deny<00:05:08.620> scouting<00:05:09.070> information<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:09.700> see<00:05:09.880> GG

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
deny scouting information you see GG

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.420

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
base right now and yeah it looks like

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.370 
base right now and yeah it looks like
fancy<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.090> floating<00:05:16.540> his<00:05:16.630> barracks<00:05:16.960> over<00:05:17.230> so

down here but a sunken colony going up
already<00:05:47.260> it<00:05:47.380> looks<00:05:47.440> like<00:05:47.650> Gigi<00:05:47.950> play<00:05:48.160> has

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
already it looks like Gigi play has

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.410 
already it looks like Gigi play has
scouted<00:05:48.790> that<00:05:48.970> and<00:05:50.520> Gigi<00:05:51.520> play<00:05:51.730> is<00:05:51.940> prepared

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
scouted that and Gigi play is prepared

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.540 
scouted that and Gigi play is prepared
here<00:05:52.660> he's<00:05:52.810> keeping<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:53.710> vulture<00:05:53.950> away<00:05:54.340> and

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
here he's keeping that vulture away and

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
now that sunken is up so that vultures

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.490 
now that sunken is up so that vultures
not<00:05:56.500> going<00:05:56.650> to<00:05:56.710> do<00:05:56.860> anything<00:05:57.070> I<00:05:58.410> wonder<00:05:59.410> if

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
not going to do anything I wonder if

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.200 
not going to do anything I wonder if
Gigi<00:05:59.770> play<00:05:59.920> did<00:06:00.130> scout<00:06:00.490> that<00:06:00.730> in<00:06:00.850> the<00:06:00.940> middle

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
Gigi play did scout that in the middle
