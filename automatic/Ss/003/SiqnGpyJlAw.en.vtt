00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.690
 waves and andres of birds and survival and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.850
 in this video we're going to see how many 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 users we can take out a bag of 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.710
 garden garbage like this I have 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.210
 several pointed so you can see that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.700
 It may be a good idea to put it in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.500
 our backpack when we go out to the field 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.950
 so well let's see them 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.070
 making three cuts one in the part of 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.070
 down 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.080
 such that makes 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.080
 and then on the sides 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.949
 we got a poncho the sea ​​of ​​shocked 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.399
 in which we even fit a backpack 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:56.070
 little girl of about 20-30 liters like here 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.809
 you can see so good ones get a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.520
 downpour and we have our bag of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.070
 above junk not to worry 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.940
 to remove moisture from the ground or 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.790
 cover us if it starts to rain 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.460
 as a sealed bag if we need to cross 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.620
 a river and I do not think our things are 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.620
 wet we put it inside 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.250
 to the bottom 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.180
 with care that he did not get punctured because 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 It is a very delicate material 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.820
 we get all the air 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.820
 and by the mouth we began to bend it 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.180
 now we welcome the two corners 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.610
 we attach 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.630
 and we tie it with a piece of string to 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.630
 they do not separate t 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.980
 and we have a waterproof bag here 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.220
 how we see fruit 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.360
 It is totally waterproof 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.400
 the tapes they place to close the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.230
 bag through your mouth can serve us as 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.990
 rope directly if we want to jump 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.450
 something that does not need much force and 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.640
 the braiding if we can resist a 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.590
 little more for it we are going to tie it to the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.500
 half we are going to rotate it and we pass the other one 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.410
 we turn again and we pass 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.350
 we turn we passed the other side 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.350
 let's say and so we will go braiding 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.090
 and a pretty rope is going to form 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.090
 resistant lawrence whole and I teach it 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.200
 ale I'm going to make a knot here 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.200
 so that it does not fall apart 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.099
 and we have here a rope that is 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.099
 pretty tough 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.570
 as an improvised tourniquet 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.590
 they are there 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.540
 it does a lot of pressure 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.540
 if we hold it with some sticks 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.629
 we can get a cistern 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.069
 to cover a wound that does not enter 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.140
 dirt or humidity although you know that 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.170
 wounds it 's good that they ventilate so 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.670
 which would be something provisional to get 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.620
 to a medical center or a place that 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.310
 you can heal better but good the idea 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.310
 there is 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.680
 as an improvised gambler 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.270
 If it starts to rain, we'll take it over 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.270
 you can always build 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.000
 and finally to not let us use it anymore 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:52.310
 important as trash bag when 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.990
 let's go camping is very important 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.939
 carry a garbage bag to use 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.350
 as a garbage bag I say fully 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.810
 seriously 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.910
 well so far the uses that I have 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.440
 has happened to me but as a bag of 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.600
 you can get ten thousand uses 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.490
 more what we are going to do is that in the 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.710
 Comments are going to write everything 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.380
 happen to you all the uses that you 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.200
 I would give jce and if I exceed 20 I will 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.290
 catch the best there is written and 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.150
 I do in part 2 of this video so 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.920
 Well I hope you liked it or nothing 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.920

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:34.799
