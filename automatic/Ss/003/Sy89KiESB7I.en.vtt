inflammatory condition that typically

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.820 
inflammatory condition that typically
focuses<00:00:08.180> on<00:00:08.420> the<00:00:08.630> end<00:00:09.200> of<00:00:09.469> the<00:00:09.559> small

it typically focuses on those areas that
I<00:00:19.369> just<00:00:19.460> mentioned<00:00:20.080> some<00:00:21.080> of<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:21.289> symptoms

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
I just mentioned some of the symptoms

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.759 
I just mentioned some of the symptoms
that<00:00:21.800> show<00:00:22.160> up<00:00:22.369> with<00:00:22.609> this<00:00:22.759> condition<00:00:23.029> are<00:00:23.769> gas

this<00:00:30.890> condition<00:00:31.900> characteristically<00:00:32.900> have

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
this condition characteristically have

inflammation<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:48.020> this<00:00:48.170> area<00:00:48.500> can<00:00:48.770> limit<00:00:49.130> the

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
inflammation in this area can limit the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.970 
inflammation in this area can limit the
amount<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.580> b12<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.690> gets<00:00:50.870> absorbed<00:00:51.050> the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.760 
amount of b12 that gets absorbed the
blood<00:00:52.220> can<00:00:52.490> also<00:00:52.520> cause<00:00:53.120> iron<00:00:54.050> deficiency

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
blood can also cause iron deficiency

anemia<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:55.820> these<00:00:55.970> folks<00:00:56.210> typically<00:00:56.720> have

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
anemia so these folks typically have

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.860 
anemia so these folks typically have
issues<00:00:57.440> with<00:00:57.560> fatigue

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
behind the drugs is to suppress the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.850 
behind the drugs is to suppress the
immune<00:01:28.540> inflammatory<00:01:29.540> responses<00:01:30.200> occurring

suggests that imbalance in the gut
bacteria<00:04:34.550> is<00:04:35.120> actually<00:04:35.510> part<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.870> the
