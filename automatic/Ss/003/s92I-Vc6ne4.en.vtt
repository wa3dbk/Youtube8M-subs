00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hello everyone, let's talk about 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.220
 retrofit sewing machine own 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.259
 for this modernization I did not even 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
 fight if not for one thing but mine 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.340
 ripped belt connecting sewing 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.880
 a car with this drive wheel to have 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.340
 made of rawhide actually I 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.320
 I could not find it on sale I tried 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.910
 replace it with a rope but i have 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.279
 This shaft turned because 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.890
 load when stitching 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 let's say fruit fabric fireplaces for some reason 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.309
 but it was impossible for me to flash this 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.000
 way this came to the conclusion that I 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.879
 something must be done differently and by doing otherwise 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.289
 that's what we put here is the engine 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.200
 this is a special engine which 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.170
 produced in Soviet times for 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.289
 sewing machines bother with him not 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.930
 would i just set on a piece 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.449
 aluminum here is this piece of aluminum already 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.979
 attached using sorrel instructions 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.400
 cars like this either mike further 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.450
 what was done from this drive on 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:20.540
 pulley i set 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:25.460
 rubber such lines which are actually 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:29.810
 can be made of car camera 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.640
 got out because i used 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.549
 just such 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.810
 gum is from filament to concert magic 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.880
 block in my KAMAZ lie I will not 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.970
 This engine can work on 220 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:51.299
 volt but as it turned out at 220 volts it 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.060
 creates such mad revolutions that the rays with 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.630
 don't even embed it so i set 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.380
 down later 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.399
 Now I have 110 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.829
 100 volts more accurate operating voltage 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:12.590
 somewhere must be about 130 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:15.209
 here is this engine and without it 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.370
 breaker and a motor like you 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.200
 do you understand 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.590
 so control is not very convenient 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.840
 I had to make a switch which 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.750
 broke the vatra connection with the engine and 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.590
 Here he is that represents kontseviki 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.670
 I put such a pedal very rude 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.319
 done but nevertheless quite so 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.170
 working design turned out 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.360
 the console is a standard 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.760
 common on sessions volt limit switch 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.400
 He served on the 110 and that's the same name 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.940
 work Soviet quality talk about 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.069
 we still show ourselves how this whole thing 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.969
 working here i press the button 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.489
 this machine works need more 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:11.420
 the voltage is more accurate more turns to 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:15.560
 was adding a voltage of 220 not 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.980
 advised to add really on this 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.829
 I think just a danger 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.579
 voltage at about 130 is at harvard 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:29.840
 bang tried using such sewing 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.280
 machines stitch the skin basically nothing 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.430
 never scrolled anywhere 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.159
 did not slip this strap out 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:42.620
 resume pretty well behaved 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.659
 actually if anyone wants to repeat it 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.909
 will have any questions on my 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.810
 VKontakte page there can there 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:54.699
 go ask ask wish 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.699
 good luck to all your creativity
