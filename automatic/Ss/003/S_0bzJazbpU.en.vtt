seen at the same time or used together
if<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.690> only<00:00:12.929> using<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.950> top<00:00:14.190> half<00:00:14.429> the

if you are only using the top half the
treble<00:00:15.179> clef<00:00:15.210> then<00:00:16.109> you'd<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.529> looking<00:00:16.680> at<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the bottom half of the music maybe for a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.529 
the bottom half of the music maybe for a
bass<00:00:20.130> player<00:00:20.310> something<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.000> you'd<00:00:21.449> be

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bass player something like that you'd be

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.140 
bass player something like that you'd be
looking<00:00:21.689> at<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.199> bass<00:00:22.650> stave<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.970> together

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
looking at the bass stave but together

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.060 
looking at the bass stave but together
they<00:00:24.689> make<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.199> grand<00:00:25.470> staff<00:00:25.830> when

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
they make up the grand staff when

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.370 
they make up the grand staff when
they're<00:00:26.189> both<00:00:26.400> used<00:00:26.820> together<00:00:27.240> okay<00:00:27.869> now

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
they're both used together okay now

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.410 
they're both used together okay now
what's<00:00:29.070> really<00:00:29.250> important<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.820> remember<00:00:29.910> is

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
what's really important to remember is

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
what's really important to remember is
between<00:00:30.869> these<00:00:31.050> two<00:00:31.289> staves<00:00:31.560> there's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
between these two staves there's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.560 
between these two staves there's
actually<00:00:32.940> even<00:00:32.969> though<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.450> isn't

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
actually even though it isn't

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.600 
actually even though it isn't
represented<00:00:34.230> there's<00:00:34.620> actually<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.550> more

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
represented there's actually one more

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.549 
represented there's actually one more
line<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.540> draw<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.930> let's<00:00:37.290> draw

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
line that you can draw in let's draw

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.650 
line that you can draw in let's draw
that<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.920> now<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> didn't<00:00:38.730> draw<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
that in now it didn't draw it in all the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.450 
that in now it didn't draw it in all the
way<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.079> why<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.710> okay<00:00:41.160> well<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> reason

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
way and why is that okay well the reason

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.100 
way and why is that okay well the reason
why<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.940> didn't<00:00:42.149> draw<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.510> all<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> way<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
why I didn't draw it in all the way is

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
why I didn't draw it in all the way is
because<00:00:43.530> when<00:00:43.950> you're<00:00:44.070> looking<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.430> sheet

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
because when you're looking at sheet

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.970 
because when you're looking at sheet
music<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.300> line<00:00:45.660> isn't<00:00:46.320> actually<00:00:46.710> drawn

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
music that line isn't actually drawn

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.130 
music that line isn't actually drawn
there<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.969> drew<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.300> all<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> way<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
there so if I drew it all the way and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.750 
there so if I drew it all the way and
you<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.559> yourself<00:00:49.680> some<00:00:50.010> sheet<00:00:50.250> music<00:00:50.340> any<00:00:50.670> of

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you get yourself some sheet music any of

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.310 
you get yourself some sheet music any of
you<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.750> thinking<00:00:51.809> Pat

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you like what what are you thinking Pat

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.709 
you like what what are you thinking Pat
that's<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.460> I'm<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.090> putting<00:00:54.600> it

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
that's not right so I'm just putting it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
that's not right so I'm just putting it
there<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> remember<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> line

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
there so you remember there is a line

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.400 
there so you remember there is a line
but<00:00:57.000> unless<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.539> note<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.140> it's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
but unless you have a note on it it's

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.229 
but unless you have a note on it it's
actually<00:00:58.980> invisible<00:00:59.609> when<00:00:59.879> you're<00:01:00.030> looking

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
actually invisible when you're looking

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.689

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
where and I'll explain so let's go back

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.149 
where and I'll explain so let's go back
to<00:01:33.299> our<00:01:33.420> acronyms<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.770> remember<00:01:35.070> the

the musical alphabet easy it's a B so
the<00:02:07.649> space<00:02:07.920> between<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:09.030> invisible<00:02:09.479> C<00:02:09.720> line

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the space between the invisible C line

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.260 
the space between the invisible C line
and<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.800> top<00:02:11.190> line<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.030> a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
on the bass clef is a B so all it does

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.650 
on the bass clef is a B so all it does
is<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.590> goes<00:02:17.740> up<00:02:18.010> musically<00:02:18.580> again<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.210> the
