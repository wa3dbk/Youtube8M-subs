00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.830
 we are in the heart of Bordeaux in 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.870
 a street classified to the buildings of France 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.570
 and it's here a few years ago 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.349
 philippe surgeon today retired 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.719
 found his happiness 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.680
 I found this house by chance 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.630
 buy like that on a crush and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 after my children in water 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.000
 I did five years of renovation 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.289
 of buildings good space you like this 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 who was two years old we were not 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 it was a wake up call to all 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.950
 paradoxes was therefore to create a 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.050
 very contemporary interior in a 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.969
 building dating from the eighteenth century 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.860
 a task which is acquitted jacques 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.480
 partner the architect the apartment 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.180
 was in a building 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.579
 on two levels and distribute themselves around 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.710
 from a central courtyard to the 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.670
 the apartment by a large room that 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 today welcomes the kitchen 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.980
 this room the heart of the apartment and 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:07.119
 we wanted to keep all of 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.680
 cornices moldings flatly dcc 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.060
 wanted were cleverly put in 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.670
 value by low lights 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.970
 consumption 13 years otherwise in 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.289
 the whole house 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.690
 as to the destination of this piece 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.570
 quite remarkable jacques saliou had 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.030
 an idea for the least original 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.380
 very quickly we realized that it would be 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.360
 Well, but the letter is no less 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.690
 pieces and that we kept with 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.729
 moldings and make a kitchen that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.369
 be very contrasting allowing 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.259
 transform the kitchen into a beautiful 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.940
 object since caen per year of a 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.400
 apartment looking we see it's 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.530
 the kitchen 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.540
 they have the living room going on in the kitchen 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.550
 it was again impossible to 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.150
 modify the existing walls including the 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.250
 facade 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.390
 despite the desire of the owners of 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.910
 make everything contemporary 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.680
 uncomfortable so it was necessary to create a 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.640
 kind of box inside this 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.250
 completely dismountable piece originally 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.890
 she is completely not rated of wood 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.050
 18th that we have long of 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.700
 keep it going to look and we have 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.320
 builds a metal structure to 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.990
 inside this room allowing 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.300
 precisely not to damage the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.580
 English woodwork has pulled off totally 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.790
 independent of the walls but at the same time 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.520
 this allowed us a bevel the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.770
 thermally compared to the facade of 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.590
 can add doors 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.840
 sliding allowing not to do it 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.130
 double glazing I want to make a 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.970
 double insulation powerful laggard and the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.560
 original 18th century phonemes in single glazing 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.330
 cd sliding windows that are on the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.550
 street are also separated in the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.470
 kitchen thus also allowing a 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.319
 sound insulation and at the same time a 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.599
 transparency game 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.239
 with northern light and southern light 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.609
 that by putting a more pleasant lighting 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.659
 and for this insulation it's wool 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.659
 of rock that is chosen 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.870
 from the corridor we can see the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.819
 indoor pool that found its place 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.519
 almost naturally took advantage of the 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.159
 presence of vaulted cellars to create his 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.840
 water point at the same time soaring having 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.819
 a swimming pool but which is also a 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.819
 object visible from apartment 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.580
 hence the idea of ​​making a floor in 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.840
 glass to perceive the pool 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.819
 of levels below 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.190
 his name is today under made by 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.080
 an air-source heat pump instead of the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.519
 initial gas to decrease 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.750
 significantly the energy cost 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.989
 the supply of natural light has 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.849
 also been taken into account being in 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.080
 the northern part of the apartment 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.580
 we will finally do it to you 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.460
 light also we do not light of course 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.410
 so 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.300
 we created a canopy on the roof 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.070
 which illuminates the famous glazed floor 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.930
 allows to illuminate the cup pieces in 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.090
 below that overlooks the pool 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.770
 the restructuring lose allowed 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.940
 to integrate here a heated floor to 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.950
 at low temperatures 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.260
 connected to a gas boiler to 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.830
 condensation much more powerful than 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.830
 the old boiler 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.470
 so here we are in the northern part 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.890
 of the apartment of course open on 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.870
 the garden 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.170
 formerly there was a kind of cottage 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.880
 Swiss who was sitting on this garden is 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.560
 still closed the car but we have 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.780
 refurbished the facade 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.700
 So we did two carpentry 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.950
 sliding and retractable which 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.529
 allow these two rooms to be in 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.739
 maximum communication 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.299
 in relation to this garden hanging its 

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:45.919
 windows as well as all 

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:48.199
 other windows of the house located in 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.509
 the unclassified part are duplicate 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.369
 Argon glazing there is no 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.589
 support in the angle that allows 

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:56.769
 to have a lot more free space 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:56.769
 great 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.130
 we dared a metal veranda 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.759
 in the extension of lives very well 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.229
 than north but one to sift that a 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.900
 little light day you are 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.950
 always nice and more than that we 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.050
 allowed to isolate 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.580
 the Swiss chalet at least the roof of the 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.320
 Swiss chalet compared to the gardens of 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.170
 stay in a much bigger context 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.310
 modern balance sheet of this very renovation 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.320
 well thermally insulated and 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.090
 phonically equipped 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.640
 performing at the energy level 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.950
 this city center apartment brings 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.900
 calm and tranquility to his occupants him 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.900
 even giving a little country air
