my name is Nick mark REO and I ain't
graffiti<00:00:10.010> the<00:00:10.610> reason<00:00:11.000> for<00:00:11.030> this<00:00:11.389> is<00:00:11.690> that

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
graffiti the reason for this is that

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.350 
graffiti the reason for this is that
it's<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:14.240> values<00:00:14.719> property<00:00:15.670> right<00:00:16.670> there<00:00:17.030> and

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
it's the values property right there and

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.230 
it's the values property right there and
then<00:00:17.720> as<00:00:18.140> soon<00:00:18.350> as<00:00:18.830> put<00:00:19.370> up<00:00:19.490> graffiti

then as soon as put up graffiti

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.380 
then as soon as put up graffiti

on the walls of fresh graffiti they

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.840 
on the walls of fresh graffiti they
should<00:01:20.479> take<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:20.869> off<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.369> that<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.549> city<00:01:22.759> is
