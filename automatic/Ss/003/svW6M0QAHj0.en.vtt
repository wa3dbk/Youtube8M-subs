00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
that you found that will fit inside the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.590 
that you found that will fit inside the
threaded<00:02:21.770> holes<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.220> flywheel<00:02:22.640> as<00:02:23.540> a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
threaded holes in the flywheel as a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.710 
threaded holes in the flywheel as a
general<00:02:24.080> rule<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.440> want<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.710> screw<00:02:24.950> these<00:02:25.100> in

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
general rule you want to screw these in

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.910 
general rule you want to screw these in
1.5<00:02:26.720> times<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.290> diameter<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.980> bolt<00:02:28.270> so

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
1.5 times the diameter of the bolt so

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.050 
1.5 times the diameter of the bolt so
probably<00:02:30.920> about<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.310> much<00:02:31.550> but<00:02:31.580> since<00:02:31.970> I

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
probably about that much but since I

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.630 
probably about that much but since I

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
have plenty of room to spare I'm going

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.940 
have plenty of room to spare I'm going
to<00:02:34.730> I'm<00:02:34.940> going<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:35.750> tighten<00:02:36.380> these<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.500> as<00:02:36.800> much

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
to I'm going to tighten these up as much

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.650 
to I'm going to tighten these up as much
as<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.250> can<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:43.940> want<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.180> screw<00:02:44.390> them<00:02:44.540> in

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
as I can and you want to screw them in

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.910 
as I can and you want to screw them in
evenly<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.320> that<00:02:45.500> both<00:02:45.590> sides<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.530> you

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
evenly so that both sides so that you

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:01.860 
evenly so that both sides so that you
know<00:02:49.100> you're<00:02:49.640> pulling<00:02:50.110> evenly<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.410> bolts

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.509 

and<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:02.959> can<00:03:03.140> tell<00:03:03.379> by<00:03:03.409> how<00:03:03.769> much<00:03:03.920> thread<00:03:04.340> is

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
and I can tell by how much thread is

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.559 
and I can tell by how much thread is
sticking<00:03:04.879> out<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:07.340> they're<00:03:07.519> both<00:03:07.730> screwed

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
sticking out that they're both screwed

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:17.820 
sticking out that they're both screwed
in<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.810> same<00:03:09.019> amount<00:03:09.349> and<00:03:10.220> their<00:03:10.340> same<00:03:10.610> height

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.280 

now<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.129> have<00:03:19.480> both<00:03:20.480> these<00:03:20.690> uh<00:03:20.750> polar

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
now that you have both these uh polar

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.820 
now that you have both these uh polar
bolts<00:03:22.450> tightened<00:03:23.450> down<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.870> same<00:03:24.110> amount<00:03:24.470> so

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
bolts tightened down the same amount so

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.940 
bolts tightened down the same amount so
that<00:03:24.980> they're<00:03:25.129> both<00:03:25.280> even<00:03:26.440> take<00:03:27.440> your<00:03:27.590> strap

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
that they're both even take your strap

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.009 
that they're both even take your strap
wrench<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.519> attach<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.299> again<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
wrench and attach it again to the

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.569 
wrench and attach it again to the
flywheel<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:30.920> can<00:03:31.040> hold<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.370> flywheel

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
flywheel so you can hold the flywheel

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:43.330 
flywheel so you can hold the flywheel
and<00:03:40.750> find<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.870> socket<00:03:42.140> that<00:03:42.319> will<00:03:42.560> will<00:03:42.980> fit<00:03:43.190> the

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
and find a socket that will will fit the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:56.660 
and find a socket that will will fit the
end<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.579> this<00:03:43.700> puller<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:45.459> tighten<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:46.489> down

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.670 

oh<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.480> also<00:03:57.600> make<00:03:57.990> sure<00:03:58.020> that<00:03:58.170> your<00:03:58.410> puller

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
oh and also make sure that your puller

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:22.040 
oh and also make sure that your puller
is<00:03:58.920> centered<00:03:59.280> on<00:04:00.650> this<00:04:01.650> as<00:04:01.830> close<00:04:02.100> as<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.400> can

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:34.140 

and<00:04:23.050> that's<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:32.160> here's<00:04:33.160> another<00:04:33.490> angle<00:04:33.820> of

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
and that's it here's another angle of

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.640 
and that's it here's another angle of
the<00:04:34.210> pulley<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:34.690> can<00:04:34.930> see<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.110> had<00:04:35.440> those

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
the pulley you can see I had those

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.760 
the pulley you can see I had those
puller<00:04:36.250> bolts<00:04:36.990> tightened<00:04:37.990> down<00:04:38.140> pretty<00:04:38.410> even

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
puller bolts tightened down pretty even

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.510 
puller bolts tightened down pretty even
kind<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.490> bent<00:04:39.670> this<00:04:39.880> one<00:04:40.390> washer<00:04:40.810> here<00:04:41.520> but

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
kind of bent this one washer here but

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.880 
kind of bent this one washer here but
the<00:04:42.670> flywheel<00:04:43.090> is<00:04:43.120> off<00:04:43.440> if<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.590> was<00:04:44.710> going<00:04:44.860> to

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
the flywheel is off if I was going to

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.340 
the flywheel is off if I was going to
remove<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.460> flywheel<00:04:45.700> completely<00:04:46.510> I'm<00:04:47.140> just

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
remove the flywheel completely I'm just

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.840 
remove the flywheel completely I'm just
doing<00:04:47.560> this<00:04:47.650> for<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.890> sake<00:04:48.100> of<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.310> video<00:04:48.610> but

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
doing this for the sake of the video but

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.190 
doing this for the sake of the video but
I<00:04:48.910> would<00:04:49.150> get<00:04:49.330> rid<00:04:49.450> of<00:04:49.540> these<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.720> would<00:04:49.960> take

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
I would get rid of these I would take

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.400 
I would get rid of these I would take
these<00:04:50.350> coils<00:04:50.860> off<00:04:51.040> because<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.930> can<00:04:53.080> see<00:04:53.380> I

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
these coils off because you can see I

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.080 
these coils off because you can see I
don't<00:04:53.620> know<00:04:53.770> if<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:53.920> can<00:04:54.040> see<00:04:54.250> but<00:04:54.490> maybe<00:04:54.880> down

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
don't know if you can see but maybe down

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.820 
don't know if you can see but maybe down
here<00:04:55.120> you<00:04:55.390> can<00:04:55.510> see<00:04:55.690> there's<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.960> ring<00:04:56.230> gear<00:04:56.530> for

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
here you can see there's a ring gear for

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.490 
here you can see there's a ring gear for
the<00:04:57.180> there's<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.270> starter<00:04:58.750> gear<00:04:58.990> for<00:04:59.230> the<00:04:59.320> on

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
the there's a starter gear for the on

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.190 
the there's a starter gear for the on
the<00:04:59.620> flywheel<00:04:59.860> for<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.520> starter<00:05:00.970> that<00:05:01.840> if<00:05:02.110> I

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
the flywheel for the starter that if I

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.920 
the flywheel for the starter that if I
tried<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.530> pull<00:05:02.740> this<00:05:02.890> up<00:05:03.240> it<00:05:04.240> would<00:05:04.630> hit<00:05:04.780> these

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
tried to pull this up it would hit these

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.910 
tried to pull this up it would hit these
coils<00:05:05.320> so<00:05:06.510> but<00:05:07.510> you<00:05:08.050> can<00:05:08.080> also<00:05:08.320> do<00:05:08.680> this<00:05:08.860> with

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
coils so but you can also do this with

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.510 
coils so but you can also do this with
an<00:05:09.280> impact<00:05:09.670> wrench<00:05:10.440> but<00:05:11.440> Koehler<00:05:12.100> actually

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
an impact wrench but Koehler actually

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.580 
an impact wrench but Koehler actually
recommends<00:05:13.030> not<00:05:13.360> using<00:05:13.720> an<00:05:13.840> impact<00:05:14.170> wrench<00:05:14.350> in

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
recommends not using an impact wrench in

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.150 
recommends not using an impact wrench in
using<00:05:14.980> a<00:05:16.050> strap<00:05:17.050> wrench<00:05:17.200> to<00:05:17.650> hold<00:05:17.680> everything

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
using a strap wrench to hold everything

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.660 
using a strap wrench to hold everything
and<00:05:18.580> just<00:05:19.000> doing<00:05:19.360> it<00:05:19.540> you<00:05:19.690> know<00:05:19.720> manually<00:05:20.670> and

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
and just doing it you know manually and

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.810 
and just doing it you know manually and
most<00:05:21.940> people<00:05:22.330> that's<00:05:22.510> what<00:05:22.750> most<00:05:22.930> people<00:05:23.200> have

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
most people that's what most people have

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.100 
most people that's what most people have
it's<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:24.910> lot<00:05:25.060> easier<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:25.450> get<00:05:25.570> a<00:05:25.600> strap<00:05:25.900> wrench

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
it's a lot easier to get a strap wrench

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.570 
it's a lot easier to get a strap wrench
then<00:05:26.410> just<00:05:26.620> go<00:05:26.770> out<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:26.890> buy<00:05:27.340> an<00:05:27.400> air

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
then just go out and buy an air

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.850 
then just go out and buy an air
compressor<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:28.120> an<00:05:28.390> impact<00:05:29.050> wrench<00:05:29.260> so<00:05:29.620> I

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
compressor and an impact wrench so I

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.540 
compressor and an impact wrench so I
wanted<00:05:30.640> to<00:05:30.700> do<00:05:30.850> the<00:05:30.970> video<00:05:31.210> this<00:05:31.450> way<00:05:32.490> when<00:05:33.490> you

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
wanted to do the video this way when you

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.430 
wanted to do the video this way when you
get<00:05:33.670> ready<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:34.030> reinstall<00:05:34.300> your<00:05:34.630> flywheel<00:05:35.050> and

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
get ready to reinstall your flywheel and

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.770 
get ready to reinstall your flywheel and
get<00:05:35.560> everything<00:05:35.800> back<00:05:36.070> on<00:05:36.370> with<00:05:36.670> a<00:05:36.700> key<00:05:37.060> that

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
get everything back on with a key that

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.260 
get everything back on with a key that
holds<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:38.440> flywheel<00:05:38.680> to<00:05:38.920> the<00:05:39.220> helps<00:05:40.000> hold<00:05:40.150> the
