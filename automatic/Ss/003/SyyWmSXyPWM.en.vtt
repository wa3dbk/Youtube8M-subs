homage and tributes to John are wooden
and<00:00:41.470> when<00:00:42.470> people<00:00:42.890> talk<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.370> me<00:00:43.430> about<00:00:44.530> coming

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
and when people talk to me about coming

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.979 
and when people talk to me about coming
to<00:00:45.590> San<00:00:45.800> Diego<00:00:46.190> State<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.550> said<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.510> best<00:00:47.780> thing

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
to San Diego State I said the best thing

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.979 
to San Diego State I said the best thing
that<00:00:48.470> happened<00:00:48.860> to<00:00:48.920> me<00:00:49.100> at<00:00:49.250> San<00:00:49.489> Diego<00:00:49.520> State

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
that happened to me at San Diego State

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.740 
that happened to me at San Diego State
was<00:00:50.989> having<00:00:51.350> an<00:00:51.440> opportunity<00:00:51.830> to<00:00:52.720> not<00:00:53.720> only

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
was having an opportunity to not only

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.420 
was having an opportunity to not only
meet<00:00:54.290> but<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.830> get<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:55.100> know<00:00:55.600> John<00:00:56.600> wood<00:00:56.900> and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
meet but to get to know John wood and

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.780 
meet but to get to know John wood and
the<00:00:58.430> family<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.350> I<00:01:00.350> think<00:01:00.710> he<00:01:00.920> epitomizes

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
the family and I think he epitomizes

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.819 
the family and I think he epitomizes
what<00:01:01.820> we<00:01:02.239> all<00:01:02.450> should<00:01:02.809> aspire<00:01:03.200> to<00:01:03.440> be<00:01:03.620> his

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
what we all should aspire to be his

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.330 
what we all should aspire to be his
people<00:01:04.690> he<00:01:05.690> didn't<00:01:06.080> identify<00:01:06.229> himself<00:01:06.740> as<00:01:07.280> a

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
people he didn't identify himself as a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.010 
people he didn't identify himself as a
coach<00:01:07.610> but<00:01:07.940> as<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.090> teacher<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:10.130> think<00:01:10.520> he

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
coach but as a teacher and I think he

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.980 
coach but as a teacher and I think he
exemplifies<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.590> qualities<00:01:12.619> that<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.990> father

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
exemplifies the qualities that a father

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.100 
exemplifies the qualities that a father
should<00:01:15.229> have<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:16.070> friend<00:01:16.640> should<00:01:16.880> have<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.570> the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
should have a friend should have and the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.740 
should have a friend should have and the
teacher<00:01:18.410> should<00:01:18.830> have<00:01:19.040> in<00:01:19.399> a<00:01:19.850> fashion<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:20.479> we

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
teacher should have in a fashion that we

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.700 
teacher should have in a fashion that we
all<00:01:20.930> should<00:01:21.860> take<00:01:22.729> stock<00:01:23.060> in<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.660> try<00:01:24.470> not<00:01:24.649> to

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
all should take stock in and try not to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.550 
all should take stock in and try not to
imitate<00:01:25.250> but<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.210> take<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.899> qualities<00:01:27.530> that

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
imitate but to take the qualities that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.400 
imitate but to take the qualities that
he<00:01:27.800> had<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.520> see<00:01:29.210> how<00:01:29.450> we<00:01:29.509> can<00:01:29.869> use<00:01:30.080> them<00:01:30.320> in
