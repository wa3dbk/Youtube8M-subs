spotter<00:02:03.830> sighs<00:02:04.040> go<00:02:04.220> go<00:02:04.460> go<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:05.000> thought<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.509> was

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
spotter sighs go go go I thought it was

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.410 
spotter sighs go go go I thought it was
straight<00:02:06.320> enough<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.650> get<00:02:06.799> by<00:02:06.950> but<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:08.209> tagged

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
straight enough to get by but we tagged

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.150 
straight enough to get by but we tagged
me<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.690> right<00:02:08.810> rear<00:02:08.959> tail<00:02:09.170> light<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:09.800> I

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
me in the right rear tail light so I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.190 
me in the right rear tail light so I
don't<00:02:10.940> know<00:02:11.030> it's<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.239> bit<00:02:11.390> unfortunate<00:02:11.750> happen

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
don't know it's a bit unfortunate happen

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.410 
don't know it's a bit unfortunate happen
so<00:02:12.290> early<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.650> day<00:02:12.709> but<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.489> guess<00:02:14.390> that's

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
so early in the day but I guess that's

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:30.220 
so early in the day but I guess that's
racing

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:03:36.550 

Oh

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.690 

everything<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.650> up<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:38.010> start<00:03:38.250> here<00:03:38.520> at

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
everything is up to the start here at

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.560 
everything is up to the start here at
iie<00:03:39.200> nearly<00:03:40.200> i<00:03:40.470> made<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.070> in<00:03:41.370> focus<00:03:41.640> Tanner<00:03:42.060> and

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
iie nearly i made it in focus Tanner and

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.190 
iie nearly i made it in focus Tanner and
I<00:03:42.720> could<00:03:42.990> learn<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.290> first<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.250> corner<00:03:44.580> and

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
I could learn it first to the corner and

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.930 
I could learn it first to the corner and
that<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.440> was<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.680> key<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.250> then<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.580> will<00:03:47.820> do

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
that that was a key and then I will do

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.080 
that that was a key and then I will do
my<00:03:47.970> own

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
my own

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.910 
my own
we<00:03:49.330> are<00:03:49.450> past<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.810> fact<00:03:50.050> when<00:03:50.319> I<00:03:50.410> waited<00:03:50.769> when

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
we are past the fact when I waited when

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.210 
we are past the fact when I waited when
i<00:03:50.980> get<00:03:51.160> more<00:03:51.400> likes

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
i get more likes

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.680 
i get more likes
so<00:03:53.820> we<00:03:54.090> were<00:03:54.210> lucky<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.630> not<00:03:54.720> easy

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
so we were lucky to not easy

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.180 
so we were lucky to not easy
that<00:03:57.690> was<00:03:57.780> good<00:03:57.960> that<00:03:58.110> was<00:03:58.170> not<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:58.980> ideal

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
that was good that was not the ideal

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.500 
that was good that was not the ideal
finish<00:03:59.430> we<00:03:59.550> knew<00:03:59.700> that<00:03:59.730> this<00:04:00.000> part<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.420> the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
finish we knew that this part of the

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.120 
finish we knew that this part of the
track<00:04:00.630> had<00:04:00.960> some<00:04:01.230> danger<00:04:01.590> built<00:04:01.800> into<00:04:02.070> it

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
track had some danger built into it

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.730 
track had some danger built into it
because<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.400> cars<00:04:02.580> came<00:04:02.820> together<00:04:03.500> but<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.530> saw

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
because the cars came together but I saw

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.860
