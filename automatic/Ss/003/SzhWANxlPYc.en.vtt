 I hope you are well then 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.610
 today find themselves for a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.139
 new rom on the chain the one of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.850
 robert lewandowski team of the version 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.930
 season one goes to the bundesliga rate 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.240
 so this week it's the task 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.859
 bundesliga so we'll have to expect 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.420
 have a lot of review at the level of 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.619
 September this you could see I 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.960
 stall in the bundesliga team 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.250
 in rest we stay in the theme you 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.599
 have statins game of the new book this 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.710
 that they are scrolling I you 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.030
 invite to pause will have master in 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.050
 art to better observe them for those 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.309
 who want to buy credits where we 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.600
 follows 20 points like 5% discount 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.440
 with the fatwa credit code delivered in 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.030
 the five minutes after the purchase 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.070
 according to available stocks 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.719
 information in the description so the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.280
 lewandowski simone de season what is it 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.079
 what can be said of him he is really 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.550
 very very good here I overcuffed it 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.930
 is one of the best attackers of the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.910
 blow game so I put it to the same 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.170
 level that agüero the silks estos 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.390
 that I was able to test last week 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.489
 at the price level so its price is 1 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.940
 million 125,000 credit at the moment I'm doing 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.129
 the review 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.949
 so we're in the night of Wednesday to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.809
 Thursday it's exactly 3:30 in the morning and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.790
 its price of a million 125 me credit so 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.350
 we are at a price much more we have 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.110
 learned much less than 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.250
 review that the methods of the bpl that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.530
 I was able to do last week that 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 bpl the jackpot and it's still not 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.549
 much more interesting especially that the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.030
 price will surely drop in days 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.460
 to come up 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.990
 and suddenly it's for a player 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.240
 this quality there for me it's really 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.520
 it's not always a gift but it's 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 it's much more accessible than 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.880
 example if it's 2 million and that's me 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.500
 not mind to put so much for a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.000
 player of this quality there at the level of 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.200
 propose positive points or and because 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.340
 that the negative points there are not 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.570
 I almost put the kicks 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.400
 stopped but you will explain at the end 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.570
 why I did not put them in so 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.700
 the positives that is what I have 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.869
 put down just his finish already 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.509
 because in front of the goal he's really 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.070
 very very good 99 in finishing his 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.229
 positioning it's really me what 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.549
 me more if more interesting and 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.920
 more in fact his positioning and his 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.840
 stats in finish so it's always 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.280
 already the right call still in the process of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.750
 straw you make the right call to the limit 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.670
 of the offside really in the back of the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.370
 defense and that is very very bad 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.720
 but where really 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.400
 it is more interesting I found 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.880
 it's in his game back to the goal his game 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.370
 without balloon 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.479
 he is always well placed and back to the goal 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.560
 in fact when you give him the ball 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.090
 back to the goal as it is very technical 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.260
 of gold it is in the positive points 1 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.970
 technically and the other four 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.200
 technical gestures when you look back 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.910
 I'm really ravaging 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.560
 with the little scooter we're going to 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.730
 crochet the hook that I like to do 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.340
 in fact to return me directly 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.660
 in my race it really makes 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.310
 havoc and that's what made me the most 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.800
 impressed at home so technically 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.420
 very good 91 in dribble on the map with 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.080
 the 4 stars technical gesture necessarily 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.910
 it's wreaking havoc 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.230
 he has both feet 4 stars bad 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.880
 foot so that's still a big 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.080
 positive point for a scorer it's up to 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.360
 to say that you can hit in any 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.100
 what language meaning is 94 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.710
 in chat with 1.99 in power of 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.390
 hit the ball share really very very 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.010
 although I unfortunately do not 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.750
 marked you will see towards the end of the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.420
 review in a few clips at the level of 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.860
 clips rather than I've typed the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.270
 post on a languedoc I do not have 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.770
 managed to put back but well here you are 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.890
 see that there is still a 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.840
 shot language illustration 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.730
 99 in hitting power and 94 his game 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.990
 bad head like I did not manage to 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.790
 score finally I have not scored goal of 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.989
 the head what I have almost not centered 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.550
 on the few centers that I did 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.690
 on the other hand he was really very 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.010
 interesting I took the ball from the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.350
 head to david luiz to felipe 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.600
 santana without really without too much 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.560
 problem 91 years ago relaxing with at 90 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.060
 unspecified debt 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.470
 the thing is that the balloon down there 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.900
 did not leave for the purpose he left and be 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.760
 next door but his part was not it was 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.220
 not far away at all the goalkeeper was doing 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.050
 really decisive stop and blow bah 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.090
 that poses problems to mark 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.860
 goals obviously at the speed level 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.600
 I did not talk about it I'm trying 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.370
 to talk about it elsewhere but the speed 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.080
 big difference with the regular the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.180
 regular who can precisely times 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.930
 have some small deficiencies in 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.700
 speed level 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.770
 this is corrected he is really going very 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.170
 quickly 188 in speed on the map itself 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.400
 really and especially what 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.019
 also one of the stuff and me the most 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.930
 impressed that's it stats in force at 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.030
 physical level 85 in strength with 1.87 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.250
 in balancing 1.89 in agility he does 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.080
 really well here's his physique is 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.060
 really very interesting 85 in strength and 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.190
 87 in balance he really holds very 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.989
 very well on his legs and he moves 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.000
 even defenders so that's eva 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.830
 it's rather interesting so the robert 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.050
 lewandowski tos you have the be 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.390
 before your eyes so in the points 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.650
 positive gmi and flew recovery of 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.450
 fly you could see besides the 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.400
 nice cover last clip a 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.190
 really very very cute recovery 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.299
 by the way in 99 soaring in the guy he 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.400
 is at the level of the strike it's 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.130
 almost 99 everywhere so that's 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.420
 pretty cool finish 99 so that's it 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.910
 really the kind of guardian you 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.290
 flat strokes of the foot or in force even if 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.570
 I really advise the hit in force 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.860
 crossed is almost unstoppable for 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.570
 the guards from time to time ago 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.760
 a few stops but it's really rare 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.140
 his speed really correct the little ones 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.450
 problems we could have with the 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.910
 regular is not at all his physical 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.890
 85 in France 87 in balance he holds 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.240
 very very good on his long legs 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.490
 shot you could see that the balloons 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.900
 by very well the balloons by no means 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.070
 really good even though I 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.590
 unfortunately not had the opportunity to 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.300
 mark aggressiveness of the game in the process of 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.470
 squeeze the ball carrier and embarrassed 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.820
 in the raise so that's cool 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.190
 especially that he has a physique that can 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.660
 just embarrassed the defenders and it's going 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.900
 combine with his stats in aggression 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.770
 it's not bad to try to try 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.630
 to recover balloons 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.610
 goethe is very interesting 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.780
 positioning always well placed it's 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.990
 really for me the two biggest ones 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.210
 good thing is these finishes 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.590
 positioning his physical and the 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.330
 technique in fact so the 4 stars 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.010
 technical gesture with his tender and I 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.140
 by the way not put in the stat in 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.770
 dribbling in the more but that's it 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.270
 positioning always well placed 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.560
 four-star bad foot both 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.640
 feet so that's cool power of 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.990
 strike 99 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.669
 almost every time I have 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.720
 the 99 power printing of 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.200
 strikes so the ball always goes 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.580
 very good four-star technical gesture 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.660
 it's cool what you're not limiting to 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.160
 tables the technical gestures you can 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.320
 to do some skill and that's really 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.540
 nice you see the statistics with 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.730
 seven games 16 goals a assist 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.870
 I hesitated to put the pass quality 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.220
 in the most because it really does 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.960
 of he really makes beautiful passes 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.110
 but I have not made enough passes 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.460
 decisive for precisely for for the 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.900
 put in and suddenly I do not have 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.550
 decided to put it in the cleverest 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.530
 79 years not on the square so it's 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.640
 rather interesting and why I did 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.080
 not put the kicks stopped in 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.310
 is in the negative points because 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.810
 I could have put a content I 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.850
 pulled a few corners it went 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.260
 no matter how and at the level of the shots 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.430
 francs he still has 40 years pressure 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.410
 free kick what is simply 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.710
 beggars so do not try them 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:18.210
 shoot with but that's it 80 81 40 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.280
 free kick decision he still has to 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.140
 89 years penalty so that's pretty cool 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.490
 to shoot them but why I have beautiful 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.990
 me simply despite his stats 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.980
 disgusting form the way I have 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.300
 fired the free kicks and the way 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.920
 I was going to corner why I did not put 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.300
 the kicks stopped in the 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.530
 negatives simply because 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.390
 that with torchwood it's not him who 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.250
 draws and here are some players who 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.720
 times we shoot the penalties and even 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.360
 by being todd it's really difficult 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.610
 of two eps in order to up his stats there 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.200
 because he does not see it in 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.850
 in the season and it serves him 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.870
 absolutely not so that's all 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.550
 for the review of robert lewandowski 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.140
