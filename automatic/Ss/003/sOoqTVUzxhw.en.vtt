also possibly III 2015 so remember
December<00:02:16.319> 5th<00:02:16.680> 2014<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.569> year<00:02:18.840> or<00:02:19.400> as

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
December 5th 2014 of this year or as

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.000 
December 5th 2014 of this year or as
late<00:02:20.610> as<00:02:20.670> June<00:02:21.180> 2015<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.440> don't<00:02:22.709> think<00:02:22.920> it's

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
late as June 2015 but don't think it's

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.610 
late as June 2015 but don't think it's
going<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.220> be<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
going to be that

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.350 
going to be that
late<00:02:23.769> because<00:02:23.980> they<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.549> unveiled<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.150> game

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
late because they just unveiled the game

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.030 
late because they just unveiled the game
I<00:02:25.690> think<00:02:26.260> they're<00:02:26.500> gonna<00:02:26.590> want<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.890> show

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
I think they're gonna want to show

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.940 
I think they're gonna want to show
gameplay<00:02:27.519> sooner<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.360> then<00:02:28.840> there<00:02:29.739> are<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
gameplay sooner and then there are the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.259 
gameplay sooner and then there are the
screenshots<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.549> leak<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:30.970> we're<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.209> to

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
screenshots that leak so we're going to

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.000 
screenshots that leak so we're going to
go<00:02:31.390> over<00:02:31.420> those<00:02:31.690> right<00:02:32.019> now<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.620> something

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
go over those right now so something

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.369 
go over those right now so something
really<00:02:33.390> important<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.599> mention<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.349> guys

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
really important to mention to you guys

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.199 
really important to mention to you guys

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.500 
before I showed the screenshots to you
they<00:02:37.959> are<00:02:37.989> from<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.620> debug<00:02:39.250> version<00:02:39.549> supposedly

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
they are from a debug version supposedly

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.369 
they are from a debug version supposedly
of<00:02:40.959> an<00:02:41.290> Xbox<00:02:41.739> one<00:02:41.860> built<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.840> don't<00:02:43.840> take<00:02:44.110> them

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
of an Xbox one built so don't take them

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.899 
of an Xbox one built so don't take them
as<00:02:44.560> finalized<00:02:45.129> but<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.579> doesn't<00:02:45.849> really

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
as finalized but that doesn't really

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.240 
as finalized but that doesn't really
matter<00:02:46.209> with<00:02:46.569> Just<00:02:47.079> Cause<00:02:47.260> because<00:02:47.829> it<00:02:47.980> always

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
matter with Just Cause because it always

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.149 
matter with Just Cause because it always
looks<00:02:48.579> gorgeous<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.989> my<00:02:50.140> opinion<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:51.010> we're

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
looks gorgeous in my opinion and we're

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.250 
looks gorgeous in my opinion and we're
seeing<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.579> it's<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.150> case<00:02:52.329> right<00:02:52.720> here

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
seeing that it's the case right here

with<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.530> first<00:02:53.739> screenshot<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.430> looks

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
with the first screenshot it looks

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.990 
with the first screenshot it looks
beautiful<00:02:56.140> as<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.560> see<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:57.340> really<00:02:57.760> does

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
and vehicles - so that's Brittany and

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.790 
and vehicles - so that's Brittany and
here<00:04:48.940> we<00:04:49.090> see<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.570> protagonist<00:04:50.260> taking<00:04:50.710> a

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
here we see the protagonist taking a

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.550 
here we see the protagonist taking a
look<00:04:51.100> at<00:04:51.340> his<00:04:51.700> cool<00:04:52.240> little<00:04:52.450> wrist<00:04:52.840> gadget<00:04:53.380> and

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
look at his cool little wrist gadget and

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.270 
look at his cool little wrist gadget and
then<00:04:54.250> we<00:04:54.700> have<00:04:54.970> what<00:04:55.210> appears<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.600> be<00:04:55.720> a

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
then we have what appears to be a

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.160 
then we have what appears to be a
challenge<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.520> some<00:04:57.760> sort<00:04:58.030> for<00:04:58.210> our<00:04:58.480> time<00:04:58.900> and

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
challenge of some sort for our time and

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.080 
challenge of some sort for our time and
then<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.380> can<00:04:59.500> compare<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.980> to<00:05:00.010> your<00:05:00.430> friends

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
then you can compare it to your friends

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.420 
then you can compare it to your friends
so<00:05:01.840> there<00:05:02.260> appears<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.890> be<00:05:02.980> some<00:05:03.190> sort<00:05:03.370> of

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
so there appears to be some sort of

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.670 
so there appears to be some sort of
challenge<00:05:03.670> system<00:05:04.030> going<00:05:04.990> on<00:05:05.200> in<00:05:05.530> the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
challenge system going on in the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.770 
challenge system going on in the
background<00:05:05.950> running<00:05:06.820> just<00:05:07.090> like<00:05:07.270> Sleeping

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
background running just like Sleeping

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.810 
background running just like Sleeping
Dogs<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:08.110> guess<00:05:08.260> you<00:05:08.380> would<00:05:08.500> say<00:05:08.710> so<00:05:09.310> expect<00:05:09.700> to

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
Dogs I guess you would say so expect to

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.820 
Dogs I guess you would say so expect to
be<00:05:10.030> running<00:05:10.300> around<00:05:10.510> doing<00:05:11.140> stunts<00:05:11.620> have<00:05:11.680> been

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
be running around doing stunts have been

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.860 
be running around doing stunts have been
also<00:05:12.010> comparing<00:05:12.670> your<00:05:13.090> accomplishments

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
also comparing your accomplishments

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.020 
also comparing your accomplishments
against<00:05:14.410> your<00:05:14.650> friends<00:05:15.220> that's<00:05:15.520> just<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:15.880> rumor

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
against your friends that's just a rumor

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.030 
against your friends that's just a rumor
but<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.720> would<00:05:17.020> probably<00:05:17.200> expect<00:05:17.620> something

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
but I would probably expect something

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.710 
but I would probably expect something
like<00:05:18.160> that<00:05:18.340> in<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.730> game<00:05:18.910> from<00:05:19.330> this

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
like that in the game from this

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.020 
like that in the game from this
