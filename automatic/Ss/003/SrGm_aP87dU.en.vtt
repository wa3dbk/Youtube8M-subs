00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.310
 he said right now he left and never 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.470
 he came back and left the artist planted 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.119
 waiting for him forever for things of the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.140
 life I found with her we are going to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.269

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.300
 of cold grip of course I was 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.520
 filming everything now we can more 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.960
 affirming all this a superstar the 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.570
 today I would like to be a 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.670
 superstar but they are the friends that I 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.260
 does the battery a little congratulations 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.729
 in principle because paintings now there are 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.940
 one that catches my attention 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.190
 which of them is that box that is this 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.350
 a little more this more ornate with more 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.840
 elements and more gray handling and what 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.940
 I see a little lonely is a picture of 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.909
 complement that is a little more peaceful 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.040
 with a little more poetic in that detail 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.110
 I decided to put this a pigeon will accompany 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.460
 on the other side that is a bit opposite to 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.619
 they made that picture 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.450
 exclusively to accompany the other 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.259
 box , and I do not know is a picture that 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.460
 he has dedicated it to your picture exactly 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.369
 that's so deep but a little while 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.409
 the exhibition about the exhibition if of 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.780
 that you want to talk about but you have here 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.420
 your poster is nice but they are still 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.130
 autographed because it has roche not the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.009
 of having stepped down but because what 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.750
 you know or not if it's your friend if in my 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.400
 card if it's a friend that I know makes 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.830
 little to say that you met him 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.619
 of having in another position in another 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.259
 exposure position forgive me I was 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.009
 thinking about something else in a position 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.810
 where the two were of spectators 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.050
