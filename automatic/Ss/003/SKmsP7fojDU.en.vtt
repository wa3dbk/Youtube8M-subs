within the Canon and you know it would

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.459 
within the Canon and you know it would
be<00:00:33.210> silly<00:00:33.600> oh<00:00:33.690> we're<00:00:33.930> gonna<00:00:34.050> pull<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.290> thing

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the Kodiak we'll also bring it into the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.440 
the Kodiak we'll also bring it into the
2077

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
2077

so<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> Kodiak<00:00:46.620> aircraft<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
so the Kodiak aircraft was one of the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.910 
so the Kodiak aircraft was one of the
first<00:00:47.940> units<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.450> worked<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.170> coming<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
first units we worked on coming to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580 
first units we worked on coming to
campus<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
campus for and what I have here are a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.709 
campus for and what I have here are a
number<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> preliminary<00:00:53.640> drawings<00:00:54.570> we

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
number of the preliminary drawings we

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.319 
number of the preliminary drawings we
did<00:00:55.010> we<00:00:56.010> knew<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.699> wanted<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> look

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
did we knew that we wanted it to look

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.260 
did we knew that we wanted it to look
like<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.809> flying<00:00:58.260> aircraft<00:00:58.859> carrier<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.430> that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
like a flying aircraft carrier and that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.330 
like a flying aircraft carrier and that
it<00:01:00.420> should<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:01.710> conform<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
it should you know really conform to the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.070 
it should you know really conform to the
GDI<00:01:02.640> aesthetic<00:01:03.180> which<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> very<00:01:03.719> sort<00:01:04.019> of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
GDI aesthetic which is very sort of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.679 
GDI aesthetic which is very sort of
blocking<00:01:04.470> very<00:01:04.769> heavy<00:01:05.010> shapes<00:01:05.519> which<00:01:06.510> was

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
blocking very heavy shapes which was

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.120 
blocking very heavy shapes which was
kind<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.900> an<00:01:07.049> interesting<00:01:07.140> challenge<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:07.890> us

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
kind of an interesting challenge for us

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.010 
kind of an interesting challenge for us
because<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.939> know<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.479> wanted

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
because you know we really wanted

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.770 
because you know we really wanted
something<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:11.189> felt<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.420> though<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
something that that felt as though it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.359 
something that that felt as though it
was<00:01:12.900> part<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> GDI<00:01:13.590> arsenal<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
was part of the GDI arsenal but it

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.090 
was part of the GDI arsenal but it
wasn't<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.270> flying<00:01:16.080> brick<00:01:16.409> had<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:16.979> an

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
wasn't a flying brick had to be an

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.130 
wasn't a flying brick had to be an
interesting<00:01:17.310> shape<00:01:17.869> finally<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.049> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
interesting shape finally with this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.380 
interesting shape finally with this
version<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.680> felt<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.580> were<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.909> very

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
version we felt we were really very

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.600 
version we felt we were really very
close<00:01:21.770> kind<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.830> issue<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.250> had<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
close kind of issue we had with this

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
close kind of issue we had with this
concept<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> weapons<00:01:24.869> weren't<00:01:25.200> too

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
concept was that the weapons weren't too

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.350 
concept was that the weapons weren't too
visible<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:26.670> important<00:01:27.150> from

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
visible and that was very important from

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.210 
visible and that was very important from
a<00:01:27.750> gameplay<00:01:27.930> standpoint<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.950> finally

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
a gameplay standpoint so that finally

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.090 
a gameplay standpoint so that finally
led<00:01:29.520> us<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.909> version<00:01:30.750> 9<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.979> very

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
led us to version 9 here which is very

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.670 
led us to version 9 here which is very
very<00:01:32.579> close<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> in-game<00:01:33.509> asset<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.619> can

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
very close to the in-game asset you can

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.530 
very close to the in-game asset you can
see<00:01:34.890> we've<00:01:35.070> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> split<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> front<00:01:36.150> open<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
see we've kind of split the front open a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.679 
see we've kind of split the front open a
little<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:36.930> put<00:01:37.259> cannons<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:38.700> also<00:01:38.850> made

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
little bit put cannons and we also made

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.810 
little bit put cannons and we also made
very<00:01:40.079> prominent<00:01:40.710> engines<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.369> background

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
very prominent engines in the background

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940 
very prominent engines in the background
we<00:01:41.939> thought<00:01:42.090> that'd<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.509> give<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.380> VFX

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
we thought that'd really give the VFX

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.280 
we thought that'd really give the VFX
Department<00:01:44.490> an<00:01:45.479> opportunity<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> do

Department an opportunity to do

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
Department an opportunity to do
something<00:01:46.590> very<00:01:46.619> cool<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.220> back<00:01:47.399> hey<00:01:48.299> my

for<00:01:52.290> Team<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.799> I'm<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> show<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.369> some

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
for Team and I'm going to show you some

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.690 
for Team and I'm going to show you some
of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> Kodiak<00:01:54.240> event

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
of the Kodiak event

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
of the Kodiak event
here<00:01:55.390> we<00:01:55.479> have<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:56.039> Kodiak<00:01:57.039> in<00:01:57.369> its<00:01:57.700> old

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
here we have the Kodiak in its old

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.980 
here we have the Kodiak in its old
geometry<00:01:59.560> form<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:01.210> can<00:02:01.360> see<00:02:01.539> that<00:02:01.750> the

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
geometry form you can see that the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.319 
geometry form you can see that the
afterburners<00:02:02.619> are<00:02:02.770> back<00:02:02.890> here<00:02:03.100> are<00:02:03.340> set<00:02:03.939> in

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
afterburners are back here are set in

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.730 
afterburners are back here are set in
geometry<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:04.929> what<00:02:05.020> we<00:02:05.140> would<00:02:05.289> do<00:02:05.439> is<00:02:05.590> we

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
geometry and what we would do is we

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.910 
geometry and what we would do is we
would<00:02:05.770> just<00:02:05.920> hide<00:02:06.490> or<00:02:06.789> unhide<00:02:06.880> as<00:02:07.600> as<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.830> would

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
would just hide or unhide as as it would

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.940 
would just hide or unhide as as it would
move<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:10.450> wasn't<00:02:10.780> very<00:02:10.959> fluid<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.709> didn't

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
move it wasn't very fluid and didn't

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.830 
move it wasn't very fluid and didn't
feel<00:02:12.099> like<00:02:12.400> an<00:02:12.640> afterburner<00:02:13.300> kind<00:02:13.599> of<00:02:13.660> going

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
feel like an afterburner kind of going

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.410 
feel like an afterburner kind of going
on<00:02:14.019> so<00:02:14.230> our<00:02:14.410> art<00:02:14.950> director<00:02:15.099> wanted<00:02:16.060> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
on so our art director wanted the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.630 
on so our art director wanted the
aircraft<00:02:16.870> aircraft<00:02:17.200> bring<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.130> particle

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
aircraft aircraft bring it to particle

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.880 
aircraft aircraft bring it to particle
systems<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.690> trick<00:02:20.050> for<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.319> lot<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.769> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
systems the trick for a lot of the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.400 
systems the trick for a lot of the
aircraft<00:02:21.870> afterburner<00:02:22.870> stuff<00:02:23.140> was<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
aircraft afterburner stuff was the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.070 
aircraft afterburner stuff was the
making<00:02:23.680> sure<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.950> didn't<00:02:24.190> look<00:02:24.280> like<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.489> fire

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
making sure it didn't look like a fire

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.660 
making sure it didn't look like a fire
normally<00:02:26.080> when<00:02:26.349> we<00:02:26.680> have<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.010> are<00:02:27.280> damage

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
normally when we have the are damage

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.240 
normally when we have the are damage
effects<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.269> tend<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.870> apply<00:02:29.769> them<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
effects we tend to apply them to the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.960 
effects we tend to apply them to the
engines<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.989> if<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.620> aircraft<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.459> damaged

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
engines so if the aircraft is damaged

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.470 
engines so if the aircraft is damaged
smoke<00:02:34.209> billow<00:02:35.019> out<00:02:35.170> from<00:02:35.440> behind<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.940> if<00:02:37.299> we

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
smoke billow out from behind it so if we

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.479 
smoke billow out from behind it so if we
had<00:02:37.599> any<00:02:37.810> sort<00:02:38.019> of<00:02:38.170> thruster<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:38.950> looked<00:02:39.130> a

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
had any sort of thruster that looked a

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.080 
had any sort of thruster that looked a
fiery<00:02:40.090> we<00:02:40.840> would<00:02:40.989> have<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.530> kind<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.489> disconnect

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
fiery we would have a kind of disconnect

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.520 
fiery we would have a kind of disconnect
for<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.329> player<00:02:43.569> thinking<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:44.170> maybe<00:02:44.319> his

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
for the player thinking that maybe his

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.970 
for the player thinking that maybe his
aircraft<00:02:44.709> was<00:02:45.010> damaged<00:02:45.519> this<00:02:46.420> was<00:02:46.980> basically

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
aircraft was damaged this was basically

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.190 
aircraft was damaged this was basically
going<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.400> be<00:02:48.459> sky<00:02:48.790> artillery<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.810> large

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
going to be sky artillery in large

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.949 
going to be sky artillery in large
explosions<00:02:50.769> there's<00:02:50.980> actually<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.959> distortion

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
explosions there's actually a distortion

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.750 
explosions there's actually a distortion
around<00:02:53.049> there's<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.530> shockwave<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.610> air

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
around there's the shockwave of the air

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.740 
around there's the shockwave of the air
displacing<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.480> causes

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
displacing it causes

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.390 
displacing it causes
an<00:02:56.810> actual<00:02:56.990> distortion<00:02:57.620> effect<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.250> we

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
an actual distortion effect and we

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.430 
an actual distortion effect and we
wanted<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.700> get<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.210> this<00:02:59.330> game<00:02:59.600> the<00:03:00.320> way

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
wanted to get that in this game the way

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.710 
wanted to get that in this game the way
we<00:03:00.470> did<00:03:00.800> that<00:03:00.980> was<00:03:01.670> there's<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.390> separate

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
we did that was there's a separate

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.140 
we did that was there's a separate
render<00:03:03.110> layer<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.950> this<00:03:04.190> layer<00:03:04.250> we<00:03:05.120> have

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
render layer and this layer we have

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.450 
render layer and this layer we have
filled<00:03:05.600> with<00:03:05.900> distortion<00:03:06.800> we<00:03:07.070> had<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.280> make<00:03:07.430> a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
filled with distortion we had to make a

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.130 
filled with distortion we had to make a
pretty<00:03:07.730> big<00:03:07.880> explosion<00:03:08.060> but<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:08.720> had<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.020> keep

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
pretty big explosion but we had to keep

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.000 
pretty big explosion but we had to keep
that<00:03:09.320> very<00:03:09.620> compact<00:03:10.280> floor<00:03:10.610> of<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.820> gameplay

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
interesting upgrade he wants to go into

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.130 
interesting upgrade he wants to go into
a<00:03:30.480> defensive<00:03:31.230> mode<00:03:31.440> when<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:32.610> shields<00:03:33.480> itself

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
a defensive mode when it shields itself

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.080 
a defensive mode when it shields itself
and<00:03:34.500> certainly<00:03:34.980> unit<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.549> also<00:03:35.700> has<00:03:36.000> an

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
and certainly unit it also has an

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.479 
and certainly unit it also has an
anti-air<00:03:36.660> weapon<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.530> can<00:03:37.709> deal<00:03:38.459> with

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
anti-air weapon so you can deal with

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.990 
anti-air weapon so you can deal with
enemy<00:03:39.060> support<00:03:39.690> aircraft<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.700> that's<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
enemy support aircraft and that's the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.330 
enemy support aircraft and that's the
Kodiak<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.140> set<00:03:43.379> vastly<00:03:43.769> designer<00:03:44.190> of

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
Kodiak so this is set vastly designer of

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.260 
Kodiak so this is set vastly designer of
CNC<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:44.970> saying<00:03:45.659> hope<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.079> like<00:03:46.230> it
