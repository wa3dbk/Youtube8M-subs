00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.859
 Dr 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.039
 because I have the record 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.630
 and that's a new little done meant in case you titled yourself 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.630
 this flight 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.420
 if you have no contact with the subject of this flight is already one 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.980
 Check out this link a few times 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.490
 There you will find the exact explanation and a first small test league 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.820
 that's what the little witch's word is based on two engines Constance pressure 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.600
 Tours in the circle share one for the upward movement on the fingerboard and 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.550
 one for the downward movement 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.150
 at engines Konstanz pressure Turin the finger movements always remain the same 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.870
 only the location and the pages on which they are played change 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.390
 here first the finger sequence for the upward movement it starts in the 5 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.110
 Location on the a-side with the first second and fourth fingers 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.240
 and then changes to the page with the second first fourth second and 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
 again the first finger 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.790
 this thing episode now try on the b-side in the Fire Lake North 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.160
 January 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.620
 The Serbs are hot on it and they work in the colors 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.950
 we have repeated the reports 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.240
 now for the second four episodes for the downward movement 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.420
 You start on the Holy side in the seventh position with the first one 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.010
 second and the first four and six it then on the hair side with the fourth 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 and in first finger 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.430
 krh pages long letter brought how many successes there in the 8 suffer 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
 the one by a thread 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.450
 again a Sexton rank 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.479
 7 and move to the end on the a-side applications in the cloud 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.979
 a similar idea now slowly slow the complete upward movement 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.979
 using the ESI Strokes 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:18.439
 No 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 Dr 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.700
 now we are slowly changing the complete downward movement as well 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.700
 using the Isis grew 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.799
 Now, complete the entire run and try your pace gradually 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.029
 Are you up to 100 ppm in the sixteenth? 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.029
 for Niederberg theme with the metronome 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.519
 your next destination is St 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.749
 With Denis Shox is the 150 BPM mark in sixteenths to crack 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:17.989
 Again, I recommend you 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.230
 I progressively with this goal at least over five between tempos 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.230
 to approach the metronome 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:37.059
 if it has reached this far, it will continue to do so 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:40.640
 My next target is the 200 ppm mark in 16 cases 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.949
 Knartz gradually 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.949
 and happy with the Easy Strokes success 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.449
 2 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:52.959
 Bilal Philips 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.139
 gloriously 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:55.599
