foreign<00:00:15.780> policy<00:00:16.260> debate<00:00:16.650> some<00:00:17.609> instances

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
foreign policy debate some instances

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.490 
foreign policy debate some instances
there<00:00:18.300> was<00:00:18.480> some<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.840> summit<00:00:19.109> says<00:00:19.260> there

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
there was some in summit says there

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.279 
there was some in summit says there
wasn't<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> think<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.510> element<00:00:21.900> that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
wasn't but I think the one element that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.550 
wasn't but I think the one element that
is<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> resonate<00:00:23.420> most<00:00:24.420> electoral<00:00:25.410> II

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

speaking<00:00:26.359> from<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> debate<00:00:27.900> was<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> fact

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
speaking from the debate was the fact

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.100 
speaking from the debate was the fact
that<00:00:29.429> Mitt<00:00:29.910> Romney<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.949> continually<00:00:34.040> what

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
that Mitt Romney was continually what

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.930 
that Mitt Romney was continually what
Josh<00:00:37.110> Marshall<00:00:37.380> once<00:00:37.739> referred<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.610> being

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
Josh Marshall once referred to as being

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.220 
Josh Marshall once referred to as being
bitch-slapped<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:41.090> think<00:00:42.090> Mitt<00:00:42.360> Romney<00:00:42.899> looked

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
bitch-slapped I think Mitt Romney looked

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.540 
bitch-slapped I think Mitt Romney looked
weak<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.750> befuddled<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.039> his<00:00:47.160> depth

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
weak and befuddled and out of his depth

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.200 
weak and befuddled and out of his depth
and<00:00:48.050> did<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.230> stand<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> President<00:00:50.760> Obama

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and did not stand up to President Obama

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.360 
and did not stand up to President Obama
and<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.289> conservatives<00:00:52.770> are<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and I think conservatives are going to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.279 
and I think conservatives are going to
have<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> problem<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.149> he<00:00:54.600> sort<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.079> had

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
have a problem with this he sort of had

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.040 
have a problem with this he sort of had
his<00:00:55.469> face<00:00:55.710> rubbed<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.850> and

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
his face rubbed in it a little bit and

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.160 
his face rubbed in it a little bit and
conservatives<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.739> can't<00:00:59.070> stand<00:00:59.370> that

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
conservatives just can't stand that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.869 
conservatives just can't stand that
they're<00:01:01.170> okay<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.559> Mitt<00:01:01.890> Romney<00:01:02.309> flip-flop

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
they're okay with Mitt Romney flip-flop

they're okay with Mitt Romney flip-flop
and<00:01:02.910> they're<00:01:03.239> okay<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.600> Mitt<00:01:03.899> Romney

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
and they're okay with Mitt Romney

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.620 
and they're okay with Mitt Romney
moderating<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.580> saying<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.090> he<00:01:06.119> has<00:01:06.330> to

before<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.540> first<00:02:47.780> debate<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.350> seems<00:02:48.650> like

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
before that first debate it seems like

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.310 
before that first debate it seems like
uh<00:02:49.120> president<00:02:50.120> obama<00:02:50.150> had<00:02:50.660> been<00:02:50.810> practicing

uh president obama had been practicing
his<00:02:51.530> zingers<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.780> think<00:02:54.140> as<00:02:54.430> sort<00:02:55.430> of

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
his zingers and I think as sort of

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.670 
his zingers and I think as sort of
vacuous<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:56.600> superficial<00:02:57.320> as<00:02:59.170> the<00:03:00.170> idea<00:03:00.590> that

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
vacuous and superficial as the idea that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.340 
vacuous and superficial as the idea that
that<00:03:01.250> could<00:03:01.820> actually<00:03:01.970> mean<00:03:02.600> something<00:03:02.630> in

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
that could actually mean something in

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.960 
that could actually mean something in
terms<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.770> dampening<00:03:04.340> conservative

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
terms of dampening conservative

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.600 
terms of dampening conservative
enthusiasm<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.810> think<00:03:06.440> that's<00:03:07.130> what<00:03:07.400> we've

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
enthusiasm I think that's what we've

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.880 
enthusiasm I think that's what we've
seen
