00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.440
 Hello dear viewers and that wants to come to another special helmet video 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.440
 Special why do I hear faith you realize that 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:14.279
 If it was not for years, we would be right here in this windside side of the lawyer 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.669
 photograph from Rheine 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.380
 was in the next few 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.380
 as a specialist photographer our Mollo Boullier 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.230
 Sanborn never 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.560
 in front of us 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 there we were made quite simple 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.849
 the scissors a hole or a 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:29.800
 the point 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.310
 Tailor families leave that with them 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.640
 and then you can wonderfully experience the camera and as well as deep and what 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.640
 Bank gets you a white side 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.250
 which is now shaped objectively around that is called Jamie and do 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.330
 built up 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.460
 The sun comes from that direction, bangs on the white one in the background 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.650
 encloses the model 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.720
 part of it is flying back from the wide ball again now is called 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.870
 we should get stepped Raimund lamp because he is around them 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.390
 around 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.510
 a ring puts an effect around the lens and Helen really does that again 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.060
 Shadow on that means we get back in brightness from the front 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.660
 if you look closely at the reason 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.360
 there you see 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.500
 that is a heavy, very nice structure in the background we could have 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.200
 not this white side we could 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.850
 own plans wants less light yes 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.170
 return less light completely measured 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.470
 the light meter with the sector that now a bit bad stupid whole 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.800
 to rebuild the ball so that everything is very nice and sterile 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.200
 fixed constructed 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.240
 Jahns measured a diaphragm is the difference from this white side 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.940
 Therefore, relatively near distance is about 80 90 centimeters 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.070
 far away from 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.979
 the white side of the Nine Fekter and eating awesome and through 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.500
 this one blind we reach again that we look at the structure - and so 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.720
 Lemke keeps deep no shadows no black and yellow emile 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.650
 good but we have 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.860
 Effects so small midrange 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.580
 what now photograph Hanau heat Makovicky finds 5 mm at aperture 2 8g 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.240
 at an aperture of 5 at 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 one of these will be those of a 200 at the d700 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.190
 a respectable success that shows 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.289
 a super nice portrait 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:18.039
 beautiful subtle colors the background encloses our model still exists 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.469
 Light structure in the background and have too often the illumination 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.899
 of course we have this again in the other video from Schott and 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.989
 Effects this negro on box everything i am in you so here before me 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.699
 this acts as a light source and gives this low soft light 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.789
 I throw another execution at the end Special Video what yes Jarno over 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:39.559
 this supports 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.829
 it is cool thing you can use the reflector without problems as a whole 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.989
 normal reflecta use the slot goes to 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.670
 whether that is a millimeter at baptism or not it does not matter 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.479
 You can continue to use it but you have me right 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.679
 Light shone almost say yes 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:01.219
 KÃ¶hler also I wanted to show you what we do with our material 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.609
 Also, he just has to work with the name of the trial and that too 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.499
 to adjust 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.779
 but now there are shots 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:14.829
 Johannsen was the official could 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.219
 8 only Frankfurt
