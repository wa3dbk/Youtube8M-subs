hache<00:00:00.920> gonna<00:00:01.520> be<00:00:01.580> a<00:00:01.610> star<00:00:01.850> today<00:00:03.819> well<00:00:04.819> we're

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:04.940 
hache gonna be a star today well we're

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:16.890 
hache gonna be a star today well we're
looking<00:00:05.029> at<00:00:05.270> the<00:00:05.360> particular<00:00:05.660> filter

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.380 

so<00:00:17.260> you've<00:00:17.440> got<00:00:17.650> a<00:00:18.000> set<00:00:19.000> of<00:00:19.120> just<00:00:19.270> running

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
so you've got a set of just running

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.140 
so you've got a set of just running
straight<00:00:19.780> out<00:00:19.930> your<00:00:20.110> exhaust<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:21.640> got<00:00:21.790> it<00:00:21.940> run

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
straight out your exhaust you got it run

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150 
straight out your exhaust you got it run
here<00:00:22.660> what<00:00:23.650> is<00:00:23.770> that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
here what is that

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:33.810 
here what is that
that's<00:00:24.910> your<00:00:30.390> doesn't<00:00:31.390> it<00:00:31.450> fire<00:00:32.400> though<00:00:33.400> yet

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
that's your doesn't it fire though yet

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.160 
that's your doesn't it fire though yet
when<00:00:33.970> your<00:00:34.090> exhaust<00:00:34.360> gas<00:00:34.570> comes<00:00:34.840> out<00:00:34.960> it's

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
when your exhaust gas comes out it's

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.450 
when your exhaust gas comes out it's
dirty<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:35.559> they<00:00:35.800> try<00:00:35.949> to<00:00:36.010> clean<00:00:36.220> up<00:00:36.340> your

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
dirty so they try to clean up your

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.020 
dirty so they try to clean up your
emissions

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
emissions

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.670 
emissions
so<00:00:37.390> what<00:00:37.480> they<00:00:37.570> do<00:00:37.690> is<00:00:37.809> they<00:00:37.900> shoot<00:00:38.140> fuel<00:00:38.379> into

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
so what they do is they shoot fuel into

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.110 
so what they do is they shoot fuel into
it<00:00:38.830> and<00:00:39.129> spark<00:00:39.820> it<00:00:40.030> with<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:41.970> sparkler<00:00:42.970> right

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
it and spark it with the sparkler right

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.280 
it and spark it with the sparkler right
there<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.360> actually<00:00:43.480> burns<00:00:43.960> all<00:00:44.260> the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
there and actually burns all the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.840 
there and actually burns all the
emissions<00:00:44.559> over<00:00:44.830> there<00:00:45.190> birds<00:00:45.430> all<00:00:45.610> the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
emissions over there birds all the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.820 
emissions over there birds all the
carbon<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.660> stuff<00:00:46.840> so<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.230> burns<00:00:47.320> more<00:00:47.620> feel

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
carbon and stuff so it burns more feel

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.530 
carbon and stuff so it burns more feel
to<00:00:47.980> be<00:00:48.100> more<00:00:48.280> efficient<00:00:48.670> that's<00:00:49.059> exactly

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
to be more efficient that's exactly

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.950 
to be more efficient that's exactly
right

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
right

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.830 
right
now<00:00:50.290> on<00:00:50.530> these<00:00:53.250> when<00:00:54.250> you<00:00:54.340> run<00:00:54.610> them<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:55.719> can

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
now on these when you run them you can

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.319 
now on these when you run them you can
bypass<00:00:56.079> your<00:00:56.559> cleaning<00:00:56.890> cycle<00:00:57.280> mm-hmm<00:00:57.910> you

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
bypass your cleaning cycle mm-hmm you

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.729 
bypass your cleaning cycle mm-hmm you
can<00:00:58.420> only<00:00:58.540> do<00:00:58.690> so<00:00:58.719> many<00:00:59.079> times<00:00:59.350> where<00:00:59.620> the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
can only do so many times where the

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.459 
can only do so many times where the
motor<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:01.030> actually<00:01:01.450> detent<00:01:01.960> all<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.350> way

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
motor will actually detent all the way

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.650 
motor will actually detent all the way
down<00:01:02.710> or<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.340> can't<00:01:03.579> even<00:01:03.700> run<00:01:03.910> it<00:01:04.059> really<00:01:04.360> it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
down or you can't even run it really it

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.660 
down or you can't even run it really it
knows<00:01:04.869> you're<00:01:05.320> not<00:01:05.410> it<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:05.979> can<00:01:06.160> you<00:01:06.640> can

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
knows you're not it you can you can

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.690 
knows you're not it you can you can
bypass<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.210> once<00:01:07.540> or<00:01:07.720> twice<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.950> it<00:01:09.100> makes<00:01:09.490> you

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
bypass it once or twice but it makes you

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.120 
bypass it once or twice but it makes you
do<00:01:09.910> it<00:01:10.050> so<00:01:11.820> that's<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.970> new<00:01:13.090> teaser<00:01:13.330> point

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
do it so that's the new teaser point

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.100 
do it so that's the new teaser point
that<00:01:15.130> looks<00:01:15.310> like<00:01:15.399> a<00:01:15.460> mess<00:01:15.729> over<00:01:15.940> here<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.990> just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
that looks like a mess over here is just

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.420 
that looks like a mess over here is just
your<00:01:20.259> standard<00:01:20.500> c13<00:01:21.280> minutes

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
your standard c13 minutes

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.310 
your standard c13 minutes
while<00:01:23.060> you're<00:01:23.210> actually<00:01:23.330> mission<00:01:23.870> stuff<00:01:24.140> on

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
while you're actually mission stuff on

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.420 
while you're actually mission stuff on
the<00:01:24.580> removal<00:01:25.580> kind<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.120> waiting<00:01:26.390> all<00:01:27.430> all

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
the removal kind of waiting all all

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.670 
the removal kind of waiting all all
that's<00:01:28.730> extra<00:01:29.240> yeah<00:01:32.020> that's<00:01:33.020> why<00:01:33.230> I<00:01:33.260> can't<00:01:33.530> see

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
that's extra yeah that's why I can't see

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.060 
that's extra yeah that's why I can't see
out<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:33.830> back<00:01:34.010> of<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.160> cab<00:01:34.370> anymore<00:01:36.040> not<00:01:37.040> that

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
out the back of the cab anymore not that

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.090 
out the back of the cab anymore not that
you<00:01:37.340> need<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.670> anyways
