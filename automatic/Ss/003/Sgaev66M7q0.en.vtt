towards<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.230> an<00:00:49.350> open<00:00:49.620> match<00:00:49.860> even<00:00:50.160> though

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
towards see an open match even though

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.670 
towards see an open match even though
Atletico<00:00:51.210> are<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.629> tough<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> defense

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
Atletico are very tough on the defense

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.619 
Atletico are very tough on the defense
but<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> don't<00:00:53.640> think<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.149> will<00:00:54.329> enter

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
but I don't think that they will enter

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.260 
but I don't think that they will enter
on<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.960> match<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.469> defend<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.219> not<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:57.059> their

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
on this match to defend is not on their

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.959 
on this match to defend is not on their
interest<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.379> day<00:00:58.920> they<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.399> clearly

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969

they<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.289> clearly<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.190> chance<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.850> so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
they have clearly the first chance so so

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.270 
they have clearly the first chance so so
they<00:01:03.600> will<00:01:03.719> attack<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> match<00:01:05.040> with

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
does that mean you're gonna play the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.600 
does that mean you're gonna play the
winners<00:01:25.590> market<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:25.979> skip<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> winners

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610

market<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.299> will<00:01:28.290> play<00:01:28.590> too<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
market I will play too but in a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
market I will play too but in a
different<00:01:29.579> way<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.960> Atletico<00:01:31.350> will

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
different way I think that Atletico will

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.499 
different way I think that Atletico will
not<00:01:32.040> lose<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.460> one<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.299> play<00:01:33.479> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
not lose this one so I will play a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.539 
not lose this one so I will play a
critical<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.200> win<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.680> draw<00:01:34.979> no<00:01:35.159> bet<00:01:35.189> at

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
critical to win with draw no bet at

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.539 
critical to win with draw no bet at
another<00:01:35.820> 1.7<00:01:36.750> okay<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.740> covering<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
another 1.7 okay I like that covering a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.219 
another 1.7 okay I like that covering a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
couple of aces there now the lean on the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
couple of aces there now the lean on the
total<00:01:40.619> market<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.310> under<00:01:41.640> two<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.850> a

total market for the under two and a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.139 
total market for the under two and a
half<00:01:42.210> goals<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.689> 1.73<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.490> agree<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
half goals is 1.73 do you agree with the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.700

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710

personally<00:01:49.710> i<00:01:49.740> don't<00:01:49.860> i<00:01:50.310> don't<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.049> here

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
personally i don't i don't think so here

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.780 
personally i don't i don't think so here
i<00:01:52.079> want<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> arrive<00:01:52.680> i<00:01:52.740> think<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.280> will<00:01:53.520> see

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
i want to arrive i think that will see

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.270 
i want to arrive i think that will see
goals<00:01:54.119> from<00:01:54.360> both<00:01:54.630> sides<00:01:55.159> leverkusen<00:01:56.159> is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
goals from both sides leverkusen is

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.249 
goals from both sides leverkusen is
scoring<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.759> lot<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.540> considering<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
scoring a lot but is also considering a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.170 
scoring a lot but is also considering a
lot<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.369> both<00:01:59.670> teams<00:01:59.909> will

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
lot so I think that both teams will

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.010 
lot so I think that both teams will
score<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.659> another<00:02:00.930> 1.9<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.930> Atletico<00:02:03.930> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
score at another 1.9 and Atletico is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.499 
score at another 1.9 and Atletico is
also<00:02:04.350> considering<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.700> are<00:02:05.820> attacking

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
also considering when they are attacking

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.330 
also considering when they are attacking
a<00:02:06.810> lot<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.560> why<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> say<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
a lot this is why I say that the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.460 
a lot this is why I say that the
Leverkusen<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.119> score<00:02:09.360> also<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.349> will

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
Leverkusen will score also and we will

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.520
