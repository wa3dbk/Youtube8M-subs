00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
it reason Midlands strong like an

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.089 
it reason Midlands strong like an
asymmetric<00:00:10.629> ball<00:00:10.869> should<00:00:11.139> but<00:00:11.650> it's<00:00:11.799> just<00:00:11.980> I

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
asymmetric ball should but it's just I

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.589 
asymmetric ball should but it's just I
really<00:00:12.309> like<00:00:12.549> how<00:00:12.700> it<00:00:12.820> rolls<00:00:12.969> over<00:00:13.209> into<00:00:13.480> the

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
really like how it rolls over into the

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.989 
really like how it rolls over into the
pins<00:00:13.839> it<00:00:14.349> just<00:00:14.559> runs<00:00:14.769> them<00:00:14.919> over<00:00:15.099> when<00:00:15.219> you<00:00:15.400> Sam

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:15.999 
pins it just runs them over when you Sam

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.910 
pins it just runs them over when you Sam
yeah<00:00:16.689> it<00:00:16.810> goes<00:00:16.960> through<00:00:17.199> the<00:00:17.289> pins<00:00:17.500> really

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
yeah it goes through the pins really

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.109 
yeah it goes through the pins really
really<00:00:18.099> nice<00:00:18.250> it<00:00:18.490> goes<00:00:18.609> through<00:00:18.759> the<00:00:18.820> pins<00:00:19.029> the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
really nice it goes through the pins the

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.240 
really nice it goes through the pins the
right<00:00:19.269> way<00:00:19.420> oh<00:00:19.689> you're<00:00:20.170> right<00:00:20.289> up<00:00:20.410> with<00:00:20.560> you<00:00:20.740> it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
right way oh you're right up with you it

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.310 
right way oh you're right up with you it
really<00:00:21.339> chews<00:00:21.759> up<00:00:21.789> in<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.150> mid<00:00:22.330> but<00:00:23.050> what's

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
really chews up in the mid but what's

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.779 
really chews up in the mid but what's
amazing<00:00:23.589> is<00:00:23.859> I<00:00:24.009> super<00:00:24.369> clean<00:00:24.550> for<00:00:24.699> an

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
amazing is I super clean for an

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.339 
amazing is I super clean for an
asymmetrical<00:00:25.269> ball<00:00:25.449> it<00:00:25.990> is<00:00:26.109> through<00:00:26.289> the

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
asymmetrical ball it is through the

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.550 
asymmetrical ball it is through the
front<00:00:26.499> part<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:26.859> the<00:00:26.949> lane<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:29.349> that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
front part of the lane so with that

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.589 
front part of the lane so with that
maybe<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.099> guy<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:30.730> kind<00:00:30.910> of<00:00:31.029> rolls<00:00:31.179> it<00:00:31.329> a<00:00:31.419> bit

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
maybe a guy that kind of rolls it a bit

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.040 
maybe a guy that kind of rolls it a bit
I<00:00:31.810> can<00:00:32.200> still<00:00:32.670> maintain<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:34.240> retain<00:00:34.390> enough

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
I can still maintain and retain enough

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.690 
I can still maintain and retain enough
energy<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.470> get<00:00:35.620> that<00:00:35.800> ball<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:36.340> go<00:00:36.460> through

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
energy to get that ball to go through

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.160 
energy to get that ball to go through
the<00:00:36.760> pins<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.120> right<00:00:37.270> way<00:00:37.420> yeah<00:00:37.720> look<00:00:37.960> I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
the pins the right way yeah look I

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.600 
the pins the right way yeah look I
really<00:00:38.410> like<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.770> way<00:00:38.860> it<00:00:38.950> chews<00:00:39.100> up<00:00:39.130> the<00:00:39.280> mids

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
really like the way it chews up the mids

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.090 
really like the way it chews up the mids
yes<00:00:40.090> a<00:00:40.450> lot<00:00:40.660> of<00:00:40.690> times<00:00:40.990> people<00:00:41.680> don't<00:00:41.800> like

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
yes a lot of times people don't like

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.710 
yes a lot of times people don't like
asymmetric<00:00:42.700> fours<00:00:42.940> because<00:00:43.120> wildin<00:00:43.630> they

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
asymmetric fours because wildin they

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.230 
asymmetric fours because wildin they
move<00:00:43.870> in<00:00:44.080> ball<00:00:44.830> quits<00:00:45.160> right<00:00:45.580> they<00:00:46.000> reach<00:00:46.150> the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.240 
move in ball quits right they reach the

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.490 
move in ball quits right they reach the
middle<00:00:46.450> ain't<00:00:46.570> strong<00:00:46.810> but<00:00:47.050> it<00:00:47.140> quits<00:00:47.350> and

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
middle ain't strong but it quits and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.600 
middle ain't strong but it quits and
you've<00:00:47.620> moved<00:00:47.770> in<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.100> hooked<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.490> done

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
you've moved in and hooked it and done

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.160 
you've moved in and hooked it and done
just<00:00:49.300> about<00:00:49.390> everything<00:00:49.660> you've<00:00:49.900> wanted<00:00:50.020> to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
just about everything you've wanted to

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.960 
just about everything you've wanted to
do<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.650> it<00:00:50.770> still<00:00:50.980> continues<00:00:51.370> out<00:00:51.520> yeah<00:00:51.790> and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
do and it still continues out yeah and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.970 
do and it still continues out yeah and
if<00:00:52.180> it<00:00:52.330> starts<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.720> go<00:00:52.870> a<00:00:52.900> little<00:00:53.140> bit<00:00:53.380> I<00:00:53.560> just

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
if it starts to go a little bit I just

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.800 
if it starts to go a little bit I just
keep<00:00:54.070> chasing<00:00:54.130> it<00:00:54.640> in<00:00:54.760> and<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.360> haven't<00:00:55.540> round

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
keep chasing it in and I haven't round

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.190 
keep chasing it in and I haven't round
run<00:00:56.230> out<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.470> Lane<00:00:57.040> yet<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.520> still<00:00:58.150> I<00:00:58.750> mean<00:00:59.080> I'm

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
run out of Lane yet and still I mean I'm

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.440 
run out of Lane yet and still I mean I'm
standing<00:00:59.620> now<00:00:59.800> on<00:00:59.830> like<00:01:00.250> 39<00:01:00.700> I<00:01:00.850> still<00:01:01.330> have

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
standing now on like 39 I still have

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.910 
standing now on like 39 I still have
about<00:01:01.660> six<00:01:01.990> or<00:01:02.110> seven<00:01:02.350> more<00:01:02.500> left<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.710> go

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
about six or seven more left to go

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.799 
about six or seven more left to go
before<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:03.760> have<00:01:03.790> to<00:01:04.000> dodge<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.360> bar<00:01:04.540> II<00:01:04.570> turn

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
before I have to dodge the bar II turn

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.670 
before I have to dodge the bar II turn
and<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.379> ball<00:01:05.590> is<00:01:05.620> showing<00:01:06.100> no<00:01:07.680> resemblance

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
and the ball is showing no resemblance

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.580 
and the ball is showing no resemblance
of<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.280> ball<00:01:09.490> that's<00:01:09.670> losing<00:01:10.210> any<00:01:10.330> energy<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.110> it

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
of a ball that's losing any energy so it

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.780 
of a ball that's losing any energy so it
looks<00:01:11.860> phenomenal

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
looks phenomenal

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:21.690 
looks phenomenal
from<00:01:13.210> start<00:01:13.510> to<00:01:13.660> finish

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.760 

well<00:01:22.720> what<00:01:23.720> I'd<00:01:23.840> like<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.200> say<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.500> because

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
well what I'd like to say is because

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.100 
well what I'd like to say is because
it's<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.040> good<00:01:25.160> off<00:01:25.310> its<00:01:25.490> hand<00:01:25.670> now<00:01:25.880> every<00:01:26.870> time

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
it's so good off its hand now every time

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.460 
it's so good off its hand now every time
it<00:01:27.290> strikes<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:29.600> me<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:29.960> really<00:01:30.170> like

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
it strikes but to me I just really like

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.050 
it strikes but to me I just really like
how<00:01:30.620> it<00:01:30.680> because<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.310> me<00:01:31.340> when<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.640> ball<00:01:31.850> reads

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
how it because to me when a ball reads

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.130 
how it because to me when a ball reads
have<00:01:32.180> been<00:01:32.270> laying<00:01:32.450> strong<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:32.930> still

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
have been laying strong and still

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.870 
have been laying strong and still
continues<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:34.100> goes<00:01:34.400> through<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.640> pins

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
continues it goes through the pins

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.420 
continues it goes through the pins
extremely<00:01:35.480> well<00:01:35.660> and<00:01:36.230> that's<00:01:36.800> been<00:01:37.310> the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
extremely well and that's been the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.370 
extremely well and that's been the
secret<00:01:37.730> of<00:01:37.820> all<00:01:37.880> time<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.540> me<00:01:38.660> to<00:01:39.140> get<00:01:39.260> your

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
secret of all time to me to get your

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.750 
secret of all time to me to get your
ball<00:01:39.470> read<00:01:39.680> soon<00:01:39.890> enough<00:01:40.130> but<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.430> still<00:01:40.610> has

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
ball read soon enough but it still has

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.670 
ball read soon enough but it still has
to<00:01:40.880> continue<00:01:41.330> down<00:01:41.450> lane<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.290> if<00:01:42.410> it<00:01:42.500> does

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
to continue down lane and if it does

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
from a thousand to four thousand and the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.430 
from a thousand to four thousand and the
ball<00:02:14.150> actually<00:02:14.330> looks<00:02:14.690> like<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.959> has<00:02:15.080> polish

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
ball actually looks like it has polish

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
on it it doesn't zero so it's quite

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.920 
on it it doesn't zero so it's quite
quite<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.350> unique<00:02:18.920> cover<00:02:19.790> stock<00:02:20.120> from<00:02:20.780> that

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
quite it a unique cover stock from that

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.260 
quite it a unique cover stock from that
aspect<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:22.280> there's<00:02:22.490> no<00:02:22.640> hook<00:02:22.850> earlier<00:02:23.180> in

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
aspect but there's no hook earlier in

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.080 
aspect but there's no hook earlier in
that<00:02:23.300> cover<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:25.400> know<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.730> other<00:02:25.850> thing

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
that cover you know the other thing

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.060 
that cover you know the other thing
about<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.050> change<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.440> direction<00:02:27.590> down

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
about it is the change of direction down

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.320 
about it is the change of direction down
the<00:02:28.250> lane<00:02:28.459> is<00:02:28.760> not<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.540> big<00:02:29.780> sharp<00:02:30.140> l<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.760> I

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the lane is not that big sharp l and I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.479 
the lane is not that big sharp l and I
think<00:02:33.080> that's<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.500> reason<00:02:33.650> why<00:02:34.040> I've<00:02:34.340> only

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
think that's the reason why I've only

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.370 
think that's the reason why I've only
left<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.790> ten<00:02:35.120> pins<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.540> thirty<00:02:35.750> shots<00:02:36.050> is

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
left to ten pins and thirty shots is

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.050 
left to ten pins and thirty shots is
because<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.280> direction<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.850> it's<00:02:38.000> going

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
because of the direction that it's going

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.000 
because of the direction that it's going
through<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.420> pins<00:02:38.660> freeze<00:02:39.170> good<00:02:39.410> aim<00:02:39.590> yes<00:02:39.860> I
