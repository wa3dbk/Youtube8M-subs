00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
the horn where there are sensors on the

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.010 
the horn where there are sensors on the
back<00:06:15.500> so<00:06:16.250> all<00:06:16.490> over<00:06:17.060> and<00:06:17.240> again<00:06:17.539> there's<00:06:17.840> that

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
back so all over and again there's that

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.769 
back so all over and again there's that
technology<00:06:18.919> where<00:06:19.159> star<00:06:19.909> Lilly<00:06:20.150> hears<00:06:20.539> me

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:20.779 
technology where star Lilly hears me

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.839 
technology where star Lilly hears me
talking<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.440> star<00:06:21.800> Lilly<00:06:22.130> will<00:06:22.279> continue<00:06:22.699> to
