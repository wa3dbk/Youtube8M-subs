00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
where it should be with the farming base

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.400 
where it should be with the farming base
uh<00:01:05.950> let<00:01:06.430> me<00:01:06.460> I<00:01:06.670> want<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.450> just<00:01:07.660> put<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:07.869> stamp<00:01:08.229> on

out<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.220> that<00:04:12.519> you<00:04:12.700> could<00:04:12.970> freeze<00:04:13.569> both<00:04:13.840> of

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
out is that you could freeze both of

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.569 
out is that you could freeze both of
those<00:04:14.109> eight<00:04:14.290> offences<00:04:14.709> if<00:04:14.859> you're<00:04:15.280> really

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
those eight offences if you're really

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.819 
those eight offences if you're really
hard<00:04:16.030> latekka<00:04:16.329> so<00:04:16.539> if<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:17.349> really<00:04:17.620> want<00:04:17.799> to

quad lack love and unions or something

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:24.510 
quad lack love and unions or something
like<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:23.500> you're<00:04:24.130> going<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.310> attack<00:04:24.460> from

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
like that you're going to attack from

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.390 
like that you're going to attack from
this<00:04:24.880> side<00:04:25.120> here<00:04:25.479> so<00:04:26.289> what<00:04:26.470> I've<00:04:26.560> done<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:27.160> I've

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
this side here so what I've done is I've

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.159 
this side here so what I've done is I've
put<00:04:27.669> next<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:27.970> each<00:04:28.150> air<00:04:28.419> defense<00:04:28.720> I've<00:04:28.930> put<00:04:29.139> a

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
put next to each air defense I've put a

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.440 
put next to each air defense I've put a
black<00:04:29.410> bomb<00:04:29.620> so<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.880> black<00:04:31.030> bombs<00:04:31.300> are<00:04:31.419> going

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
black bomb so the black bombs are going

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.390 
black bomb so the black bombs are going
to<00:04:31.599> trigger<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.440> will<00:04:32.560> take<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:33.039> much

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
to trigger so it will take that much

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.089 
to trigger so it will take that much
more<00:04:33.639> in<00:04:33.849> a<00:04:33.880> little<00:04:34.150> bit<00:04:34.270> more<00:04:34.450> off<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.099> lava

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
more in a little bit more off the lava

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.920 
more in a little bit more off the lava
hounds<00:04:36.400> because<00:04:36.640> that's<00:04:36.820> that's<00:04:37.539> really<00:04:37.599> the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
hounds because that's that's really the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.680 
hounds because that's that's really the
danger<00:04:38.349> at<00:04:38.560> the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
danger at the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.990 
danger at the
then<00:04:40.690> of<00:04:40.780> course<00:04:40.840> I've<00:04:41.230> got<00:04:41.410> you<00:04:41.770> know<00:04:42.000> with

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
then of course I've got you know with

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.520 
then of course I've got you know with
arched<00:04:43.360> hours<00:04:43.630> which<00:04:43.930> are<00:04:44.170> you<00:04:44.500> know

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
arched hours which are you know

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.390 
arched hours which are you know
overlapping<00:04:45.100> in<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:46.240> fence<00:04:46.660> so<00:04:47.140> that<00:04:48.010> they

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
overlapping in the fence so that they

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.070 
overlapping in the fence so that they
you<00:04:49.090> know<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.300> complement<00:04:49.750> each<00:04:49.840> other

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
you know the complement each other

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.130 
you know the complement each other
pretty<00:04:51.010> much<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:52.450> let's<00:04:52.600> look<00:04:52.660> at<00:04:52.870> all<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.080> the

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
pretty much so let's look at all of the

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.690 
pretty much so let's look at all of the
single<00:04:56.140> tower<00:04:56.320> defense<00:04:57.100> so<00:04:57.310> we've<00:04:57.430> got<00:04:57.580> a

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
single tower defense so we've got a

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.720 
single tower defense so we've got a
whole<00:04:58.090> even<00:04:58.780> covers<00:04:59.290> there's<00:05:00.010> no<00:05:00.160> areas<00:05:00.550> where

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
whole even covers there's no areas where

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.020 
whole even covers there's no areas where
it's<00:05:00.880> too<00:05:01.090> white<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.410> it's<00:05:02.410> too<00:05:02.560> light<00:05:02.770> so<00:05:03.130> you

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
it's too white and it's too light so you

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.300 
it's too white and it's too light so you
know<00:05:04.150> everywhere<00:05:04.720> all<00:05:05.380> around<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.920> outside

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
know everywhere all around the outside

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.760 
know everywhere all around the outside
is<00:05:06.610> covered<00:05:06.910> by<00:05:07.030> single<00:05:07.390> target<00:05:07.690> defenses<00:05:08.230> if

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
is covered by single target defenses if

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.380 
is covered by single target defenses if
you<00:05:08.830> look<00:05:08.950> at<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.040> splash<00:05:09.400> as<00:05:09.760> I<00:05:09.820> said<00:05:10.180> it's

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.300 
you know augment that I put the top
there<00:05:25.240> for<00:05:25.450> troops<00:05:25.780> are<00:05:25.930> deployed<00:05:25.960> there<00:05:26.500> the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
there for troops are deployed there the

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.060 
there for troops are deployed there the
one<00:05:27.550> area<00:05:27.700> is<00:05:28.090> slightly<00:05:28.660> weaker<00:05:29.230> I<00:05:29.380> guess<00:05:29.710> is

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
one area is slightly weaker I guess is

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.580 
one area is slightly weaker I guess is
is<00:05:30.670> this<00:05:30.940> area<00:05:31.270> here<00:05:31.510> you<00:05:31.810> know<00:05:31.930> rallies<00:05:32.350> these

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
is this area here you know rallies these

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.970 
is this area here you know rallies these
dis<00:05:32.890> buildings<00:05:33.250> here<00:05:34.560> but<00:05:35.560> you<00:05:35.740> know<00:05:35.830> i<00:05:35.860> mean

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
dis buildings here but you know i mean

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.580 
dis buildings here but you know i mean
it's<00:05:36.250> it's<00:05:37.150> just<00:05:37.240> yeah<00:05:37.720> nothing's<00:05:38.440> ever

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
it's it's just yeah nothing's ever

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.120 
it's it's just yeah nothing's ever
perfect<00:05:39.900> so<00:05:40.900> that's<00:05:41.080> that's<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.590> base<00:05:41.740> really

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
perfect so that's that's the base really

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.550 
perfect so that's that's the base really
i've<00:05:42.610> tried<00:05:42.880> to<00:05:42.910> separate<00:05:43.330> out<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:43.750> the<00:05:44.380> loot

i've tried to separate out the the loot
what<00:05:45.310> you<00:05:45.430> could<00:05:45.730> do<00:05:45.910> was<00:05:46.780> that<00:05:46.930> jumped<00:05:47.260> up

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
what you could do was that jumped up

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.640 
what you could do was that jumped up
there<00:05:47.560> that<00:05:48.520> little<00:05:48.670> goblin<00:05:49.030> of<00:05:49.120> thing

remember anyway so what you could do is

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.660 
remember anyway so what you could do is

top here or most likely to attack from
this<00:06:14.950> bit<00:06:15.130> here<00:06:15.160> you're<00:06:16.000> going<00:06:16.150> to<00:06:16.240> get<00:06:16.330> either

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
this bit here you're going to get either

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.750 
this bit here you're going to get either

that one or that one but there's

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.760 
overlapping defences and there's walls
to<00:06:20.860> slow<00:06:21.070> you<00:06:21.130> down<00:06:21.250> and<00:06:22.240> it<00:06:22.720> limits<00:06:23.050> by

to slow you down and it limits by

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.160 
to slow you down and it limits by
putting<00:06:24.100> these<00:06:24.220> two<00:06:24.700> loot<00:06:25.330> into<00:06:25.510> pockets<00:06:25.960> it

putting these two loot into pockets it

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.800 
putting these two loot into pockets it
kind<00:06:26.380> of<00:06:26.410> limits<00:06:26.560> the<00:06:27.510> effectiveness<00:06:28.510> of

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
kind of limits the effectiveness of

I've been attacked I'll show it

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:05.140 
I've been attacked I'll show it
afterwards<00:07:03.560> but<00:07:03.740> it's<00:07:04.430> going<00:07:04.759> to<00:07:04.819> be<00:07:04.909> probably

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150
