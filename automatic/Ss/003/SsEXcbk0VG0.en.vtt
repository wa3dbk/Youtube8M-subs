00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
friend of mine gave this to me today he

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.980 
friend of mine gave this to me today he
found<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.620> garbage<00:00:14.690> figured<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.780> might

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
found it in the garbage figured I might

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.769 
found it in the garbage figured I might
want<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.789> and<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.910> even<00:00:18.150> had<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> remote

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
want it and it even had the remote

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.140 
want it and it even had the remote
control<00:00:19.260> laying<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.830> top<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.550> now<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> know

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
control laying on top of it now you know

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.840 
control laying on top of it now you know
I'm<00:00:21.420> not<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.660> big<00:00:21.930> fan<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.230> modern<00:00:22.680> Chinese<00:00:23.189> crap

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
I'm not a big fan of modern Chinese crap

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.109 
I'm not a big fan of modern Chinese crap
but<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.710> would<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.039> get<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.670> if<00:00:27.000> I

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
but I would like to get this going if I

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.540 
but I would like to get this going if I
can<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:27.840> no<00:00:27.990> other<00:00:28.019> reason<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:29.130> use<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
can if for no other reason I can use the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.179 
can if for no other reason I can use the
digital<00:00:29.820> tuner<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.800> thing<00:00:32.160> is

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
digital tuner in it this thing is

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.650 
digital tuner in it this thing is
totally<00:00:32.550> inoperative<00:00:33.350> totally<00:00:34.350> dead<00:00:35.660> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
totally inoperative totally dead and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.660 
totally inoperative totally dead and
when<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> remove<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.590> cover<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.010> noticed<00:00:38.520> this

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
when I remove the cover I noticed this

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.119 
when I remove the cover I noticed this
capacitor<00:00:39.360> right<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.170> imploded<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
capacitor right here is imploded out the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.970 
capacitor right here is imploded out the
top<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.300> bad<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.710> this

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
top so we know that's bad and this

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.680 
top so we know that's bad and this
capacitor<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.969> don't<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
capacitor here I don't know what the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.569 
capacitor here I don't know what the
deal<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.649> they<00:00:47.450> appear<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
deal is with it they appear to have it

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.900 
deal is with it they appear to have it
standing<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.969> stilts<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> speak<00:00:52.910> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
standing up on stilts so to speak so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.880 
standing up on stilts so to speak so
let's<00:00:54.059> cool<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.449> power<00:00:54.750> supply<00:00:55.020> board<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
let's cool this power supply board and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.110 
let's cool this power supply board and
see<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.550> easily<00:00:57.300> repaired<00:00:59.120> I'm

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
see if it can be easily repaired I'm

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.599 
see if it can be easily repaired I'm
finding<00:01:00.570> modern<00:01:00.960> electronics<00:01:01.739> cheap<00:01:02.070> quality

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
finding modern electronics cheap quality

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.050 
finding modern electronics cheap quality
capacitors<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> most<00:01:04.110> common<00:01:04.739> part<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.909> go

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
capacitors is the most common part to go

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.830 
capacitors is the most common part to go
bad<00:01:06.710> hopefully<00:01:07.710> that'll<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> case<00:01:08.460> here

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
bad hopefully that'll be the case here

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.690 
bad hopefully that'll be the case here
and<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.380> back<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.130> workshop

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and here we are back in the workshop

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.450 
and here we are back in the workshop
with<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.090> power<00:01:12.570> supply<00:01:12.840> board<00:01:13.110> removed<00:01:13.950> will

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
with the power supply board removed will

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.539 
with the power supply board removed will
now<00:01:14.670> replace<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.770> questionable<00:01:16.770> capacitor

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
now replace this questionable capacitor

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
now replace this questionable capacitor
and<00:01:17.729> check<00:01:18.450> anything<00:01:18.930> else<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.470> looks

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
and check anything else that looks

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.899 
and check anything else that looks
suspicious<00:01:21.110> well<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.229> definitely<00:01:22.650> bad<00:01:23.040> it's

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
suspicious well it's definitely bad it's

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.600 
suspicious well it's definitely bad it's
supposed<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> 470<00:01:25.470> micro<00:01:25.860> farad<00:01:26.310> it's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
supposed to be a 470 micro farad it's

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.560 
supposed to be a 470 micro farad it's
reading<00:01:26.970> only<00:01:27.530> 2.8<00:01:28.530> micro<00:01:28.979> farad<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.850> yeah<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
reading only 2.8 micro farad so yeah I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.109 
reading only 2.8 micro farad so yeah I
would<00:01:31.380> say<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.770> needs<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.189> changed<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
would say that needs to be changed and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.240 
would say that needs to be changed and
by<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.930> brand<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.560> let's<00:01:35.100> see

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
by the way what brand is this let's see

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.510 
by the way what brand is this let's see
let's<00:01:35.759> see<00:01:35.850> who<00:01:36.060> made<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.509> cap<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:38.310> whenever

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
let's see who made this cap and whenever

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.819 
let's see who made this cap and whenever
that<00:01:38.759> emblem<00:01:39.210> stands<00:01:39.689> forward<00:01:40.229> doesn't<00:01:40.470> tell

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that emblem stands forward doesn't tell

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.160 
that emblem stands forward doesn't tell
me<00:01:40.860> much

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
me much

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.420 
me much
obviously<00:01:43.170> most<00:01:43.290> likely<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> cheapest

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
obviously most likely the cheapest

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.539 
obviously most likely the cheapest
Chinese<00:01:45.149> crap<00:01:45.600> part<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.259> could<00:01:46.439> get<00:01:46.770> so

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
Chinese crap part they could get so

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.569 
Chinese crap part they could get so
let's<00:01:47.700> dig<00:01:47.909> around<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.479> 470<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.560> 16<00:01:50.100> volts

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
let's dig around for 470 it's 16 volts

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.050 
let's dig around for 470 it's 16 volts
and<00:01:50.759> see<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:51.840> happens<00:01:52.729> they'll<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and see what happens they'll have to

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.580 
and see what happens they'll have to
replacing<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.079> capacitor

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
replacing that one capacitor

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.240 
replacing that one capacitor
now<00:01:56.829> comes<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.429> life<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:59.619> it<00:01:59.770> wasn't<00:02:00.130> doing

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
now comes to life which it wasn't doing

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.429 
now comes to life which it wasn't doing
before<00:02:00.729> so<00:02:00.759> now<00:02:01.299> we<00:02:01.359> will<00:02:01.659> connect<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.409> a

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
before so now we will connect this to a

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.919 
before so now we will connect this to a
television<00:02:03.479> see<00:02:04.479> what<00:02:04.659> he<00:02:04.719> does<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.689> we're

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
television see what he does and we're

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.320 
television see what he does and we're
now<00:02:08.080> connected<00:02:08.440> do<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.800> little<00:02:09.069> 13<00:02:09.610> in<00:02:09.789> Zenith

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
now connected do a little 13 in Zenith

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:19.839 
now connected do a little 13 in Zenith
TV<00:02:10.360> will<00:02:11.200> try<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.580> VCR<00:02:12.580> side<00:02:13.000> first

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.250 

and<00:02:20.329> naturally<00:02:20.989> it's<00:02:21.079> not<00:02:21.290> working<00:02:23.079> okay<00:02:24.079> the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and naturally it's not working okay the
