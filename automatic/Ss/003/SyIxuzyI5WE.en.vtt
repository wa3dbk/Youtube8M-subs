00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.460
 so 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.889
 an inta inti agreement that was signed in 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.010
 September 2012 we are manufacturers 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.980
 us a company of palpalÃ¡ jujuy and 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.940
 an association of companies chaco 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.940
 we will be covering everything 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.220
 which is the central and southern zone of Argentina 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.650
 and there are geographical divisions 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.539
 let's say every each manufacturer is going to have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
 your coverage area on your plane 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.369
 shared today what you are seeing is 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.170
 If each manufacturer achieves 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 specialization or we will all be 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 working on the same plane and which 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.820
 is the basic quality of this machine what 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 which is first sought is that it be a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.690
 machine that can travel on land 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.790
 irregular and boys what is given 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.380
 all that is cordillera area 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.420
 mainly and good people like 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.220
 these are not large extensions that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.960
 large machines can not 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.739
 enter or lend contractors 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.559
 attention is aimed at producers of 50 to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.570
 100 hectares that can be high auto 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.610
 being supplied with what is harvest is 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.190
 a trawl drag machine that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.410
 will grab with the 3 points of the tractor 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.610
 in that way costs would be reduced 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.870
 of the engine transmission cabin and 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.120
 what the management part of the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.160
 machine then we have a machine with 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.800
 cutting edge technology but with a cost 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.020
 much lower than 10% harvester 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.090
 new and how capable you need to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.150
 power to push it to use it what 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.930
 which is recommended is 80 horses 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.150
 we are working for example 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.210
 with 70 and is doing well but more than the hp 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.650
 is the mass of the tractor that has the weight 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.960
 enough for the machine to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.060
 the drag tests with 50 hp with 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.700
 old tractors that are 5,000 kilos 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.440
 of fernando well the machine the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.760
 harvesters are storing what 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.050
 they harvest then they go unloading in the 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.720
 car that capable of storage has 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.670
 one and a half cubic meters with a discharge 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.400
 clockwise so it required 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.660
 there is a stop that was being seen in 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.570
 the posility in front of being a download 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.130
 back all this immature project but 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.380
 a back discharge to be able to carry 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.750
 the machine your own car today has a 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.420
 cubic meters are according to the crop 800 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.619
 kilos a ton approximately here 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.470
 away throwing mails but it's not 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.850
 specific for corn can not or is 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.630
 now it 's regulated for corn 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.670
 but you can grab soybean quinoa barley 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.260
 wheat the idea is that the machine can be 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.690
 make several crops quite flexible 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.400
 and what is sought is that one 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.350
 producer instead of specializing 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.870
 can have a diversification let's say 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.150
 50 hectares of corn 50 of soybeans and 50 hectares of 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.040
 wheat what you have to taste well 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.650
 now it's head loss in head 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.180
 of cut that out there is a little more 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.070
 high of what we would like and 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.740
 what is aimed at reaching a loss 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.380
 of 1 15 percent in total or a 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.880
 pretty high standard is being targeted 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:55.440
 as we know this in our area the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:59.670
 Irrigation we do not have large surfaces 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.210
 but they are relatively small and in 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.810
 actually what we need a machine 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.460
 a combine that allows us 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.540
 adapt it to the reality we have and in 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.030
 the moment we want is let's say the 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.770
 idea that we have we are in a 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.190
 adjustment process 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.920
 and this 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:28.940
 we calculate more or less that he will walk 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:33.080
 between 5 and 7 tasks per day so for 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:36.080
 we are important because to 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.950
 we are the opportunity more 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.960
 important that the amount of surface 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.660
 then for the producers that 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.650
 we have is a solution 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.820
 important and also it helps us to 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.100
 harvest other grain type grains 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.690
 fine francisco which is because now 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.490
 there is a machine that we see this proof of 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.770
 60 correcting errors that are natural 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.290
 in a first model laws that exposed 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.800
 It is manufactured in series has been offered to the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.490
 public how are we going to work if that 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.220
 is the idea that we have to manufacture and 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.060
 that the producer or the producers 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.980
 can access that type of machine 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.160
 what we have is to say to 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:28.120
 to the tendency for producers to 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.080
 group can buy a machine with 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.530
 these characteristics 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.530
 and that it can be used communally 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.380
 in the groups
