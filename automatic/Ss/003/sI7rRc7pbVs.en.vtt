moisture<00:00:57.770> but<00:00:58.770> air<00:00:58.949> plants<00:00:59.399> need<00:00:59.609> air<00:00:59.879> flow<00:01:00.329> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
moisture but air plants need air flow so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.170 
moisture but air plants need air flow so
it's<00:01:00.930> good<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.559> lid<00:01:01.770> off<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> they
