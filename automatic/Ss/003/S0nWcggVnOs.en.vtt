00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
 I 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.930
 who, as I hope, are super 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.119
 alright is a kim reader and we're 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.060
 starting the series that had already 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.910
 promised this he can barely record and that 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.190
 because he made me a little bit 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.410
 but good fast for people who 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.100
 do not know what this is about again 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.680
 as is required not in the channel as a 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.140
 time about tips or things 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.590
 experiences or talk about random things in 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.840
 the videos but leaving a gameplay is 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.690
 always a background gameplay so that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.239
 see it and so as not to deviate us so much 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.860
 of what is the video game channel ok 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.989
 so then that's why I want 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.330
 leave the video game there and my camera here 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.820
 so that it does not look like anything else 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.580
 blog because I do not want to develop 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.890
 both of the examples ok and good 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.620
 I had already uploaded a video announcing that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.119
 more or less wanted to talk something like that 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.440
 and well they came to me like 10 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.750
 messages in the private also what 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.549
 you can send your message of what 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.470
 you want me to speak or like that or if you want 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.950
 some say of advice do not know maybe 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.649
 I do not know 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.860
 counselor but of less listening and I can 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.990
 give you my opinion I do not know not then 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.210
 well the first little message that came to me 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.049
 It was a person who told me to talk 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.350
 about what careers to study 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.210
 and well I 'm not going to tell you what career 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.710
 you can study and I think this is going 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.569
 directed towards all those who are 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.869
 watching this video because it's like that 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.360
 like what I think in general ok 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.460
 this I can not tell you what career 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.500
 study because that is everyone what 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.990
 want not maybe you want to be 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.330
 doctor maybe there is another person who 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.599
 do not like medicine so much and 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.990
 wants to devote to not be as much as art 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:11.019
 not some people I do not know that you like 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.769
 acting already flat or that you like not 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.140
 I know engineering mechanics whatever 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.610
 it's up to everyone, so what I 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.430
 I will do is going to be commenting 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.799
 only what has happened to me 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.660
 during that I wanted to study and so on 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.850
 since I already have 19 years Yes 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.160
 having to go through several 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.530
 decisions and indecisions then good 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.530
 This color is smaller when one has 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.270
 78 years since they think standards that is the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.550
 veterinarian to help all 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.370
 animals of the planet not so I want 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.530
 do this has not been pain I do not know what 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.300
 that is not but the reality is another 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.100
 when one is growing they leave they go 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.460
 changing our interests for 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.560
 things and one of the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.450
 reality of things when one is 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.640
 veterinarian because nothing else think that goes 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.370
 to help the animals but you do not know 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.930
 how they lower them until you are going to help them and 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.820
 not everything you're going to have to 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.460
 study for example for your being 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.220
 veterinarian you need to study infinity 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.800
 of things both biology and 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.690
 mathematics et cetera etcetera and it's not 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.950
 nothing easy that when he arrived in high school 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.580
 had in the matter of biology 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.500
 but nothing simple this one they taught them a 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.000
 mold things that if I start telling them 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.459
 He and I bore them 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.069
 but it was very past that matter but 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.140
 yes I did not like it but there was always like 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.239
 that the shock and with the mathematics that 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.489
 for those who already know me they know that I am 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:45.940
 awful then this youtube youtube 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:50.049
 three racing options first I wanted 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.580
 no lawyer but for lawyers it's good 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.709
 I've always liked to know what 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.110
 My family thinks that I studied in 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.020
 certain career and always went like marley 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.180
 asked click what seemed 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.210
 she and many people feel 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.060
 that I can not study this race 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.800
 because I do not have a hard heart and 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.590
 I think that to be a lawyer you need 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.260
 have a very, very hard heart and about 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.299
 all a strong character or at least 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.280
 more outside that it is healthy risky but 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.590
 have a strong character that you know 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:26.530
 defend yourself and know how she knows this is , 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.510
 know the use of the word no and for those 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.450
 careers you need to speak 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.690
 extremist because then you go to trial if 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.820
 you go to all those things and then I do not know 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.070
 besides that it's a bit of a 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.650
 heavy for my opinion because then 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.800
 you need to be between fights you have to 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.170
 sometimes go to the prisons and I do not know 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.510
 I just realized little to 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.460
 little and like that is environmental for me 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.680
 obviously not nothing else until the criminal 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.510
 also be the civilian but then every 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.720
 who decides the area he wants but 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.160
 good in itself lawyer because not 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.330
 It was not my first choice , so I passed 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.830
 to think what relationships 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.680
 international which is what I 'm 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.470
 studying my brother 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.020
 I really like that race because good 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.300
 it is to read yes it is enough to read and 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.440
 especially because you have languages ​​and I 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.630
 I'm like a fan of English, the truth is 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.060
 I really like English has always 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.780
 liked and does not look for any pretext 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.120
 to practice it because I love it and not 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.789
 I know on that side I also wanted tourism 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.650
 not because tourism also the basics 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.930
 is that you learn English you need 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.449
 minimum be bilingual no longer there then to 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.970
 our languages ​​and whatever but if 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.320
 you need to have that in English and for 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.660
 that's what I encouraged to tourism the only 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.030
 problem is that they told me that in 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.210
 that race, let's say you need 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.860
 travel a lot and so on and so I do not 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.539
 convinced so much because I'm not a 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.449
 person who would like to move from a 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.250
 side to side this and so I think right now 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.400
 but maybe we give ourselves months changed 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.400
 of opinion 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.479
 then this 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.370
 Well, I went from there to what is good 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.460
 Now I want to study graphic design 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.919
 but graphic design is a career 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.840
 a bit expensive but well I'm going to 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.600
 see the possibility of how I had already 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.389
 commented between one and well you know that 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.010
 you need to study before doing the 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.260
 exam because I think that good to 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.360
 first, not everyone passes it, I think 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.180
 that the will without 2 percent 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.290
 it does not happen because it's not easy to enter 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.060
 So this is the race that I 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.300
 I want to study but that is, checks 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.330
 things I had to go through and everything for 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.100
 to be able to decide the end for one and then not 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.310
 you know it's just me I think it's a 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.530
 decision that you take for yourself only if it is 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.410
 good to ask advice to people but that 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.720
 in the end you should be the one who decides not 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.310
 You can go through life by asking 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.440
 half the world why half the world will 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.810
 to say differently to how you want it 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.490
 think not or just to sound 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.639
 response and that response does not arrive 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.440
 so then always finish doing 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.090
 what you want to study and others and with 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.979
 what you feel comfortable because neither 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.990
 you are going to study the ones of this one 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:15.090
 mechanical for example if you do not like no 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.639
 it always tries to be something that 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:20.310
 You like it and I do not know how to ask 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:22.680
 orientation to your teachers to not be what 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.979
 make it easier for you and well that 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.990
 it was my opinion and my advice I do not know if what 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:30.060
 they want to see like that but good is everything 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.710
 that has happened to me and still being 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.690
 as well as that in ultimate design 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.360
 graphic is still a bit indecisive but 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.009
 I do not have much time to think about it but 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.720
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:41.160
 the video that they enjoyed 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.080
 gameplay I do not know if they will have put more 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.759
 attention to my equal gameplay 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.000
 but good leave your like if you like 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:50.099
 please can not leave your topics here 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.630
 down about what they want me to talk about or 

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:53.729
 they want me to be a little more private 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.130
 you can send it on YouTube 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:58.440
 I leave my twitter here for me 

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:01.349
 follow if you like it there is more 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.270
 easy to answer them believe me and good 

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:04.860
 I hope you liked this new 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.500
 format because of the truth that I 

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:11.449
 loved the idea and already with this I say goodbye 

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.449
 take care very much we see you goodbye
