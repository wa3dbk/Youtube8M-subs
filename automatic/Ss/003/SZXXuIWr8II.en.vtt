actually was able to predict this guy's
combo<00:03:42.850> breakers<00:03:43.709> after<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:45.040> kind<00:03:45.459> of<00:03:45.519> saw<00:03:45.670> what

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
combo breakers after I kind of saw what

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.430 
combo breakers after I kind of saw what
he<00:03:45.880> was<00:03:45.910> doing<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.510> each<00:03:46.810> time<00:03:47.019> he<00:03:47.200> came<00:03:47.290> in

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
he was doing so each time he came in

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.660 
he was doing so each time he came in
with<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> combo<00:03:47.950> he<00:03:48.100> was<00:03:48.220> doing<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.489> lot<00:03:48.610> of

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
with a combo he was doing a lot of

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.300 
with a combo he was doing a lot of
lights<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.300> so<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:50.410> think<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:51.130> particular

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
lights and so I think this particular

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.250 
lights and so I think this particular
match<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:52.030> want<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.480> say<00:03:52.570> I<00:03:52.630> get<00:03:52.810> upwards<00:03:53.080> of
