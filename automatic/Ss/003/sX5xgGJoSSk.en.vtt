00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
hey guys what's up so I couldn't think

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.839 
hey guys what's up so I couldn't think
of<00:00:09.210> anything<00:00:09.420> for<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.860> red<00:00:11.219> smile<00:00:11.490> creation

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
of anything for a red smile creation

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.089 
of anything for a red smile creation
video<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.330> then<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.530> multiplayer

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
video but then on this multiplayer

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.490 
video but then on this multiplayer
server<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.730> have<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> huge<00:00:15.389> huge<00:00:15.809> garden<00:00:16.320> but

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
server I have a huge huge garden but

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.570 
server I have a huge huge garden but
I've<00:00:16.590> always<00:00:16.740> wanted<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.130> set<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.460> with

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
I've always wanted to set it up with

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.060 
I've always wanted to set it up with
pistons<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.289> never<00:00:19.410> got<00:00:19.619> around<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.949> it

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
pistons so I never got around to it

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.260 
pistons so I never got around to it
because<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.430> haven't<00:00:20.609> really<00:00:20.910> gotten<00:00:21.180> into

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
because I haven't really gotten into

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.550 
because I haven't really gotten into
resources<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:23.420> since<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:25.410> through

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
resources but since this just through

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.859 
resources but since this just through
eyes<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> ground<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:27.240> just<00:00:27.539> picked<00:00:27.779> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
eyes on the ground and I just picked it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.990 
eyes on the ground and I just picked it
up<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.410> since<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.400> know<00:00:29.490> creative

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
up so since this is you know creative

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.490 
up so since this is you know creative
and<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> single-player<00:00:30.750> world<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.349> do

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and it's a single-player world I can do

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.410 
and it's a single-player world I can do
it<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.920> first<00:00:32.820> off<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.190> my<00:00:35.190> melon<00:00:35.850> farm<00:00:36.149> um

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it so first off here is my melon farm um

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.569 
it so first off here is my melon farm um
my<00:00:37.410> melon<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.770> pumpkin<00:00:38.070> farm<00:00:38.309> once

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
my melon and pumpkin farm once

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.510 
my melon and pumpkin farm once
everything<00:00:38.969> grows<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.890> while<00:00:41.489> I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
everything grows you just and while I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.430 
everything grows you just and while I
everything<00:00:41.969> breaks<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.020> pick<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.350> all

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
everything breaks up and you pick it all

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.029 
everything breaks up and you pick it all
up<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.120> got<00:00:45.120> tons<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> junk<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.260> I'll<00:00:46.649> show<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
up and got tons of junk so I'll show you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.130 
up and got tons of junk so I'll show you
how<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.160> made<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.520> let<00:00:48.149> me<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.450> break<00:00:48.780> right<00:00:49.020> in

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
how I made it let me just break right in

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
how I made it let me just break right in
here<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.629> break<00:00:51.629> break<00:00:51.960> break<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:53.149> see

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
here and break break break and see

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.049 
here and break break break and see
there's<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> line<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> redstone<00:00:56.059> just

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
there's just a line of a redstone just

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
there's just a line of a redstone just
going<00:00:57.300> down<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:58.230> under<00:00:58.590> each<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.949> these

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
going down and then under each of these

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.689 
going down and then under each of these
is<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> sticky<00:01:00.000> piston<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:02.039> pretty<00:01:02.370> simple

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
is a sticky piston so it's pretty simple

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
is a sticky piston so it's pretty simple
there's<00:01:03.480> nothing<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
there's nothing really really to it and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
there's nothing really really to it and
you<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.549> bring<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> line<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.869> way<00:01:06.990> up

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you just bring the line all the way up

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.230 
you just bring the line all the way up
to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.409> switch<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> gotta<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.310> also

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
to the switch and so I gotta do also

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
to the switch and so I gotta do also
this<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.570> my<00:01:12.720> read<00:01:12.960> formula<00:01:13.470> everybody<00:01:13.860> knows

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
this is my read formula everybody knows

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.460 
this is my read formula everybody knows
whenever<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.939> not<00:01:15.210> water<00:01:15.600> next<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
whenever there is not water next to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
whenever there is not water next to
reads<00:01:16.770> they<00:01:17.189> break<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.939> does<00:01:18.090> take<00:01:18.299> while

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
reads they break but it does take while

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.850 
reads they break but it does take while
so<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.619> turn<00:01:22.619> off<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
so if you do this you just turn off the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.170 
so if you do this you just turn off the
water<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.799> break<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> reads<00:01:26.369> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
water and you break all the reads so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.730 
water and you break all the reads so
it's<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.479> too<00:01:27.659> complicated<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.380> walk

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it's not too complicated you just walk

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.640 
it's not too complicated you just walk
up<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> steps<00:01:29.450> grab<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.600> your<00:01:30.720> reads<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.580 

replant<00:01:34.650> whatever<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.939> then<00:01:36.470> do<00:01:37.470> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
replant whatever you have and then do it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.490 
replant whatever you have and then do it
all<00:01:37.650> over<00:01:37.680> again<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.750> that's<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.049> read<00:01:40.200> farm

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
all over again so that's the read farm

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.700 
all over again so that's the read farm
let<00:01:41.070> me<00:01:41.130> show<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> how<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.430> works<00:01:41.689> this<00:01:42.710> is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
let me show you how that works this is

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.530 
let me show you how that works this is
over<00:01:44.960> some<00:01:45.960> dirt<00:01:46.740> which<00:01:47.220> has<00:01:47.490> red<00:01:47.970> stone<00:01:48.270> under

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
over some dirt which has red stone under

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.300 
over some dirt which has red stone under
it<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.280> instants<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
it and then that just instants a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
it and then that just instants a
redstone<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.520> pass<00:01:53.700> through<00:01:53.970> stone<00:01:54.659> slabs<00:01:55.049> I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
redstone can pass through stone slabs I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.569 
redstone can pass through stone slabs I
have<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> stone<00:01:55.740> slab<00:01:55.920> here<00:01:56.509> covering<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.810> I

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
have a stone slab here covering that I

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.700 
have a stone slab here covering that I
have<00:01:59.579> stone<00:02:00.030> slab<00:02:00.299> here<00:02:00.630> covering<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.350> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
have stone slab here covering that and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.410 
have stone slab here covering that and
then<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.430> goes<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.880> block<00:02:03.180> which<00:02:03.390> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
then that goes to this block which is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.029 
then that goes to this block which is
the<00:02:03.630> source<00:02:03.869> block<00:02:04.229> for<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.369> piston<00:02:05.850> so

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
the source block for the piston so

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.440 
the source block for the piston so
that's<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.369> that's<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.270> set

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that's all that that's all that is set

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.860 
that's all that that's all that is set
up<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.920> once<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.730> new<00:02:12.060> update<00:02:12.270> comes<00:02:12.660> out<00:02:12.840> i

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
up and once the new update comes out i

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.730 
up and once the new update comes out i
will<00:02:13.080> show<00:02:13.379> you

because<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.360> have<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.750> torch<00:03:07.080> here<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:08.070> way

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
because I have a torch here and the way

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.030 
because I have a torch here and the way
the<00:03:08.430> torch<00:03:08.670> works<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.210> yet<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.170> build<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.740> under

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
the torch works is yet to build it under

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.890 
the torch works is yet to build it under
the<00:03:11.160> torch<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.790> doesn't<00:03:12.030> pout<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.540> torches

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the torch so it doesn't pout the torches

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.180 
the torch so it doesn't pout the torches
empower<00:03:13.200> everything<00:03:13.680> else<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.010> can

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
empower everything else so you can

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.160 
empower everything else so you can
unpowered<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.760> torch<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.240> then<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.930> just

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
unpowered the torch and then that just

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.980 
unpowered the torch and then that just
leads<00:03:16.380> out<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.920> two<00:03:17.430> pistons<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.210> then

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
leads out to the two pistons and then

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.160 
leads out to the two pistons and then
that's<00:03:19.290> how<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.980> works<00:03:20.270> so<00:03:21.270> that's<00:03:21.900> about<00:03:22.020> it

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170

too complicated but here's a switch I

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.319 
too complicated but here's a switch I
don't<00:04:18.650> want<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:18.979> cover<00:04:19.099> anything<00:04:19.669> up<00:04:19.940> because

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
don't want to cover anything up because

here is because everything will flood so

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.540 
here is because everything will flood so
