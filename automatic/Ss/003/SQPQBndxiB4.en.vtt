what's up everyone I'm DJ piecemeal and

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.190 
what's up everyone I'm DJ piecemeal and
you're<00:00:02.310> watching<00:00:02.490> expert<00:00:02.970> village<00:00:03.330> let's

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
you're watching expert village let's

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.070 
you're watching expert village let's
start<00:00:05.190> with<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.460> most<00:00:05.670> basic<00:00:05.940> scratch<00:00:06.540> this

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
start with the most basic scratch this

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.110 
start with the most basic scratch this
is<00:00:07.259> called<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.589> baby<00:00:07.770> scratch<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.849> where

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
is called the baby scratch this is where

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120 
is called the baby scratch this is where
essentially<00:00:09.809> scratching<00:00:10.410> was<00:00:10.590> given<00:00:10.950> birth

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
essentially scratching was given birth

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.110 
essentially scratching was given birth
by<00:00:11.550> Grandmaster<00:00:12.150> Theodore<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:13.190> 1975<00:00:14.190> let's

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
by Grandmaster Theodore in 1975 let's

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.290 
by Grandmaster Theodore in 1975 let's
take<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> look<00:00:15.540> at<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:19.289> baby<00:00:19.500> scratch

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
take a look at it so the baby scratch

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.189 
take a look at it so the baby scratch
essentially<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.390> fader<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.810> out<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
essentially the fader is out of the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.900 
essentially the fader is out of the
picture<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.310> leave<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> side

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
picture you have to leave it on the side

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.910 
picture you have to leave it on the side
where<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.119> record<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:25.199> all<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.529> is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
where the record is but all it is is

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.589 
where the record is but all it is is
just<00:00:26.130> with<00:00:26.699> your<00:00:26.820> left<00:00:27.000> hand<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.269> know<00:00:27.359> it's

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
just with your left hand you know it's

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.210 
just with your left hand you know it's
easy<00:00:27.750> right<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.680> bringing<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.099> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
easy right it's just bringing in that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.060 
easy right it's just bringing in that
sound<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:32.510> that's<00:00:33.510> that's<00:00:33.980> essentially<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
sound and that's that's essentially the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.160 
sound and that's that's essentially the
bass<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.059> most<00:00:36.780> video<00:00:37.050> okay<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:39.170> let's

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
bass it's the most video okay so let's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.360 
bass it's the most video okay so let's
take<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> look<00:00:40.620> at<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> baby<00:00:41.010> scratch

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
take a look at the baby scratch

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.299 
take a look at the baby scratch
essentially<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.329> easiest<00:00:42.750> scratch<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
essentially the easiest scratch and the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
essentially the easiest scratch and the
the<00:00:44.550> building<00:00:44.910> blocks<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> other

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the building blocks of all the other

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.940 
the building blocks of all the other
scratches<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.640> key<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.180> scratch<00:00:48.570> is

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
scratches the key to this scratch is

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.369 
scratches the key to this scratch is
having<00:00:49.950> an<00:00:50.039> open<00:00:50.160> fader<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.570> scratch<00:00:51.840> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
having an open fader this scratch you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.930 
having an open fader this scratch you
don't<00:00:52.620> use<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> fader<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.399> all<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
don't use the fader at all so that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.220 
don't use the fader at all so that
background<00:00:54.390> noise<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.809> something<00:00:54.960> that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
background noise is something that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.540 
background noise is something that
you're<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you're actually going for and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250 
you're actually going for and
essentially<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.020> pushing

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
essentially all it is is just pushing

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.420 
essentially all it is is just pushing
the<00:00:58.530> record<00:00:58.920> forward<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> backwards<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:01.430> get

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the record forward and backwards to get

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.240 
the record forward and backwards to get
that<00:01:02.609> nice<00:01:02.820> crisp<00:01:03.090> crisp<00:01:03.840> sound<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:05.100> don't

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that nice crisp crisp sound you don't

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.039 
that nice crisp crisp sound you don't
even<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.700> take<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:06.030> finger<00:01:06.420> off<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
even really take your finger off the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.520 
even really take your finger off the
record<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:08.000> just<00:01:09.000> sign<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.689> back<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
record you just sign up for back and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500 
record you just sign up for back and
forth<00:01:10.680> back<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:10.950> forth<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.060> what

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
forth back and forth and you know what

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.730 
forth back and forth and you know what
you're<00:01:12.600> gonna<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.900> essentially<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
you're gonna do essentially is put it to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.469 
you're gonna do essentially is put it to
some<00:01:13.920> music<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> scratch<00:01:14.880> done<00:01:15.119> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
some music and get the scratch done you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
some music and get the scratch done you
can<00:01:15.689> let<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.350> bring<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> back<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.369> so

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
can let it go and bring it back to so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.740 
can let it go and bring it back to so
the<00:01:18.630> baby<00:01:18.840> scratch<00:01:19.140> again<00:01:19.560> fader<00:01:20.009> open<00:01:20.720> put<00:01:21.720> in

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the baby scratch again fader open put in

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:35.240 
the baby scratch again fader open put in
system<00:01:22.110> music

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.859 

so<00:01:36.250> all<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:36.580> essentially<00:01:37.030> pushing<00:01:37.270> it<00:01:37.509> and

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
so all is essentially pushing it and

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.840 
so all is essentially pushing it and
pulling<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.990> as<00:01:44.170> far<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.460> mixing<00:01:45.460> up<00:01:45.700> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
pulling it and as far as mixing up the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.300 
pulling it and as far as mixing up the
scratch<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.500> want<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.799> do<00:01:47.890> is<00:01:48.039> you<00:01:48.159> can

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
scratch what you want to do is you can

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.190 
scratch what you want to do is you can
make<00:01:48.430> your<00:01:48.490> hand<00:01:48.850> move<00:01:49.090> faster<00:01:49.780> or<00:01:49.990> slower

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
make your hand move faster or slower

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.830 
make your hand move faster or slower
depending<00:01:50.680> on<00:01:51.039> the<00:01:51.159> beat<00:01:51.369> so<00:01:51.850> pushing<00:01:52.420> employ

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
depending on the beat so pushing employ

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.859 
depending on the beat so pushing employ
it<00:01:52.960> fast<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.560> can<00:01:54.460> switch<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.670> up<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:54.940> go<00:01:55.060> slow

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.020 

and<00:02:01.869> this<00:02:02.080> is<00:02:02.259> also<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.619> good<00:02:02.800> point<00:02:03.039> make<00:02:03.880> sure

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
and this is also a good point make sure

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.059 
and this is also a good point make sure
you<00:02:04.149> know<00:02:04.300> where<00:02:04.509> your<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:05.289> record<00:02:05.619> is<00:02:05.740> marked

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
you know where your the record is marked

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.529 
you know where your the record is marked
so<00:02:06.190> I<00:02:06.220> know<00:02:06.310> where<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.850> scratch<00:02:07.119> sample

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
so I know where the scratch sample

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.570 
so I know where the scratch sample
starts<00:02:07.960> right<00:02:08.890> here<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.190> arrow<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.399> going<00:02:09.429> to

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
starts right here the arrow is going to

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.400 
starts right here the arrow is going to
be<00:02:09.700> pointing<00:02:10.060> kind<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.509> off<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.869> side<00:02:10.959> at

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
be pointing kind of off to the side at

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.130 
be pointing kind of off to the side at
this<00:02:11.769> knob<00:02:12.040> or<00:02:12.519> side<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.630> right<00:02:13.930> where<00:02:14.110> the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
this knob or side a is right where the
