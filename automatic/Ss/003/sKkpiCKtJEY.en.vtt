00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.920 

streams<00:00:18.460> are<00:00:18.640> really<00:00:18.940> easy<00:00:19.090> to<00:00:19.270> install<00:00:19.360> when

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
streams are really easy to install when

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.620 
streams are really easy to install when
you<00:00:20.020> use<00:00:20.140> flexible<00:00:20.619> liner<00:00:20.980> a<00:00:21.310> stream<00:00:22.119> is

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
you use flexible liner a stream is

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.320 
you use flexible liner a stream is
formed<00:00:23.320> in<00:00:23.560> nature<00:00:23.980> when<00:00:24.189> water<00:00:24.520> erodes<00:00:24.970> soil

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
formed in nature when water erodes soil

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.269 
formed in nature when water erodes soil
away<00:00:25.509> so<00:00:25.689> it<00:00:25.960> always<00:00:26.110> has<00:00:26.380> a<00:00:26.410> Canyon<00:00:27.009> shape

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
away so it always has a Canyon shape

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.570 
away so it always has a Canyon shape
with<00:00:27.550> sidewalls<00:00:28.150> on<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:29.320> staircase<00:00:30.160> shape

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
with sidewalls on it the staircase shape

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.609 
with sidewalls on it the staircase shape
will<00:00:30.880> let<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.180> have<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.539> waterfall<00:00:31.900> so<00:00:32.379> we

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
will let you have the waterfall so we

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.979 
will let you have the waterfall so we
have<00:00:32.860> dug<00:00:33.580> out<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:34.030> side<00:00:34.239> of<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.449> hill<00:00:34.629> here

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
have dug out the side of the hill here

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.320 
have dug out the side of the hill here
with<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.590> canyon<00:00:36.160> shape<00:00:36.400> and<00:00:36.699> a<00:00:37.030> staircase

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
with a canyon shape and a staircase

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.290 
with a canyon shape and a staircase
shape<00:00:37.840> at<00:00:38.019> the<00:00:38.110> same<00:00:38.350> time<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:39.910> we<00:00:40.030> put<00:00:40.210> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
shape at the same time then we put the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.479 
shape at the same time then we put the
rubber<00:00:40.480> liner<00:00:40.780> in<00:00:41.110> and<00:00:41.410> we<00:00:41.739> put<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.070> rocks<00:00:42.280> in

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
rubber liner in and we put the rocks in

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.850 
rubber liner in and we put the rocks in
on<00:00:42.610> top<00:00:42.850> of<00:00:43.000> the<00:00:43.059> rubber<00:00:43.210> liner<00:00:43.510> we<00:00:44.199> didn't<00:00:44.589> use

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
on top of the rubber liner we didn't use

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.670 
on top of the rubber liner we didn't use
flat<00:00:45.460> flag<00:00:45.820> stones<00:00:46.210> on<00:00:46.510> round<00:00:46.809> rocks<00:00:47.199> because

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
flat flag stones on round rocks because

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.460 
flat flag stones on round rocks because
in<00:00:47.980> nature<00:00:48.309> you<00:00:48.430> don't<00:00:48.460> see<00:00:48.879> a<00:00:49.150> flat<00:00:49.839> flagstone

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
in nature you don't see a flat flagstone

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.930 
in nature you don't see a flat flagstone
sticking<00:00:50.860> out<00:00:50.979> of<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.129> hillside<00:00:51.519> with<00:00:51.699> water

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
sticking out of the hillside with water

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.060 
sticking out of the hillside with water
falling<00:00:52.239> off<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:52.479> it<00:00:52.600> water<00:00:53.170> erodes<00:00:53.589> soil<00:00:53.890> away

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
falling off of it water erodes soil away

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.219 
falling off of it water erodes soil away
gets<00:00:54.430> down<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.760> the<00:00:54.850> bedrock<00:00:55.330> and<00:00:55.570> so<00:00:56.080> the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
gets down to the bedrock and so the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.689 
gets down to the bedrock and so the
waterfalls<00:00:56.769> are<00:00:57.010> formed<00:00:57.309> out<00:00:57.400> of<00:00:57.430> bigger

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
waterfalls are formed out of bigger

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.329 
waterfalls are formed out of bigger
thicker<00:00:58.089> bolder<00:00:58.690> types<00:00:58.960> of<00:00:59.170> stones<00:00:59.470> so<00:00:59.769> in

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
thicker bolder types of stones so in

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.280 
thicker bolder types of stones so in
here<00:01:00.610> you<00:01:00.729> can<00:01:00.879> see<00:01:00.909> the<00:01:01.269> waterfall<00:01:01.570> drop-offs

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
here you can see the waterfall drop-offs

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.009 
here you can see the waterfall drop-offs
are<00:01:02.530> nice<00:01:02.949> big<00:01:03.369> thick<00:01:03.729> stones<00:01:04.119> not<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.780> little

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
are nice big thick stones not a little

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.960 
are nice big thick stones not a little
tiny<00:01:05.170> flagstone<00:01:05.830> sticking<00:01:06.280> out<00:01:06.400> over<00:01:06.430> space

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
tiny flagstone sticking out over space

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.510 
tiny flagstone sticking out over space
so<00:01:07.720> we<00:01:07.840> have<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.200> canyon<00:01:08.619> shape<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
so we have the canyon shape and the

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.920 
so we have the canyon shape and the
staircase<00:01:10.000> shaped<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.450> make<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:10.750> little

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
staircase shaped to make this little

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.870 
staircase shaped to make this little
stream<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.920> as<00:01:12.010> we<00:01:12.159> get<00:01:12.280> down<00:01:12.400> into<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.700> pond

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
stream and as we get down into the pond

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.000 
stream and as we get down into the pond
we've<00:01:13.479> got<00:01:13.659> some<00:01:13.840> more<00:01:14.170> rocks<00:01:14.439> for<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.740> water

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
we've got some more rocks for the water

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.380 
we've got some more rocks for the water
to<00:01:15.189> go<00:01:15.340> in<00:01:15.430> different<00:01:15.520> directions<00:01:15.729> as<00:01:16.270> it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
to go in different directions as it

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.780 
to go in different directions as it
spreads<00:01:16.720> out<00:01:16.930> into<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.320> pond<00:01:17.530> this<00:01:18.400> basic

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
spreads out into the pond this basic

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.520 
spreads out into the pond this basic
water<00:01:18.939> garden<00:01:19.299> has<00:01:19.450> several<00:01:19.840> shelves<00:01:20.170> there's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
water garden has several shelves there's

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.080 
water garden has several shelves there's
the<00:01:20.650> deep<00:01:20.799> area<00:01:21.009> in<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.250> bottom<00:01:21.549> for<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.789> fish

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
the deep area in the bottom for the fish

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.999 
the deep area in the bottom for the fish
to<00:01:22.119> overwinter<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.259> then<00:01:23.649> there's<00:01:23.829> some

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
to overwinter in and then there's some

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.859 
to overwinter in and then there's some
staircase<00:01:24.520> shaped<00:01:25.000> shelves<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.539> come<00:01:25.719> up

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
staircase shaped shelves that come up

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.899 
staircase shaped shelves that come up
the<00:01:26.409> shelves<00:01:26.740> are<00:01:26.920> different<00:01:27.340> widths<00:01:27.729> and

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
the shelves are different widths and

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.669 
the shelves are different widths and
different<00:01:28.390> heights<00:01:28.630> so<00:01:29.380> we<00:01:29.469> can<00:01:29.590> have

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
different heights so we can have

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.260 
different heights so we can have
different<00:01:30.009> types<00:01:30.219> of<00:01:30.399> plants<00:01:30.670> we've<00:01:30.939> got<00:01:31.119> some

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
different types of plants we've got some

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.330 
different types of plants we've got some
taller<00:01:31.570> plants<00:01:31.960> on<00:01:32.079> this<00:01:32.259> side<00:01:32.469> some<00:01:33.070> wider

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
taller plants on this side some wider

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.669 
taller plants on this side some wider
ground<00:01:33.789> cover<00:01:34.090> plants<00:01:34.420> on<00:01:34.659> this<00:01:34.869> side<00:01:35.079> the

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
ground cover plants on this side the

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.190 
ground cover plants on this side the
water<00:01:36.039> lily<00:01:36.310> is<00:01:36.460> here<00:01:36.729> are<00:01:37.060> planted<00:01:37.719> on<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.840> deep

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
water lily is here are planted on a deep

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.830 
water lily is here are planted on a deep
shelf<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.859> had<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.039> divot<00:01:39.549> dug<00:01:39.850> out<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.630> it's<00:01:40.749> a

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
shelf that had a divot dug out so it's a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.109 
shelf that had a divot dug out so it's a
flower<00:01:41.109> pot<00:01:41.469> in<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.009> shape<00:01:42.249> of<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.490> Shelf<00:01:42.850> and

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
flower pot in the shape of the Shelf and

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.480 
flower pot in the shape of the Shelf and
the<00:01:43.539> rubber<00:01:43.719> liner<00:01:43.990> conformed<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.189> then

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
the rubber liner conformed to that then

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.580 
the rubber liner conformed to that then
we<00:01:45.579> filled<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:45.969> with<00:01:45.999> gravel<00:01:46.600> so<00:01:47.109> the<00:01:47.319> water

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
we filled it with gravel so the water

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.219 
we filled it with gravel so the water
lily<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.039> planted<00:01:48.549> down<00:01:48.729> deep<00:01:49.090> enough<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.719> it

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
lily is planted down deep enough that it

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.779 
lily is planted down deep enough that it
will<00:01:50.350> survive<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.950> winter<00:01:51.219> without<00:01:51.369> being

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
will survive the winter without being

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.059 
will survive the winter without being
frozen<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.780> roots<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.289> water<00:01:53.499> lily<00:01:53.679> plant

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
frozen the roots of the water lily plant

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.980 
frozen the roots of the water lily plant
cannot<00:01:54.399> have<00:01:54.609> ice<00:01:54.819> around<00:01:55.240> them<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.719> survive

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
cannot have ice around them to survive

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
little blue flowers in here and they

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.450 
little blue flowers in here and they

form a little ground cover they're
growing<00:02:09.819> out<00:02:09.970> over<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.539> pond<00:02:10.750> edge<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.380> hide

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
growing out over the pond edge to hide

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.500 
growing out over the pond edge to hide
the<00:02:11.830> rubber<00:02:12.010> liner<00:02:12.220> that's<00:02:12.550> here<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.360> we've

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the rubber liner that's here and we've

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.970 
the rubber liner that's here and we've
got<00:02:13.540> some<00:02:13.840> sedum<00:02:14.230> here<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.590> are<00:02:14.650> growing<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
got some sedum here that are growing the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.949 
got some sedum here that are growing the
other<00:02:15.130> direction<00:02:15.640> over<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.940> liner<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.390> hide

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
other direction over the liner to hide

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.290 
other direction over the liner to hide
the<00:02:17.170> liner<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.740> nice<00:02:18.010> freeform<00:02:18.730> shape<00:02:19.090> is

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the liner so this nice freeform shape is

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.080 
the liner so this nice freeform shape is
easy<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.230> hide<00:02:20.440> with<00:02:20.800> these<00:02:20.950> plants<00:02:21.430> because

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
easy to hide with these plants because

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.520 
easy to hide with these plants because
they<00:02:22.209> grow<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.480> both<00:02:22.630> directions<00:02:23.050> from<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
they grow in both directions from the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.080 
they grow in both directions from the
dry<00:02:23.740> land<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.190> wet<00:02:24.340> land<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.730> back<00:02:24.880> and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
dry land to the wet land and back and

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.300 
dry land to the wet land and back and
forth<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.930> they're<00:02:26.080> very<00:02:26.380> easy<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.830> hide

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
forth and so they're very easy to hide

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.820 
forth and so they're very easy to hide
the<00:02:27.550> liner<00:02:27.940> instead<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.260> normal<00:02:29.620> way<00:02:29.710> of

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the liner instead of the normal way of

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.780 
the liner instead of the normal way of
puttin<00:02:30.100> stalling<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.520> pond

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
puttin stalling the pond

a lot of people use of a rock edge to

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.729 
a lot of people use of a rock edge to
try<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.819> hold<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.090> liner<00:02:34.299> in<00:02:34.540> place<00:02:34.719> in<00:02:35.170> that

try and hold a liner in place in that
rock<00:02:35.950> edge<00:02:36.219> making<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.819> separation<00:02:37.510> between

the dry land and the wet land and making
a<00:02:39.909> visible<00:02:40.439> line<00:02:41.439> that's<00:02:41.950> very<00:02:42.310> easy<00:02:42.549> to<00:02:42.700> see

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
a visible line that's very easy to see

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.630 
a visible line that's very easy to see
these<00:02:43.810> plants<00:02:44.290> are<00:02:44.409> now<00:02:44.560> growing<00:02:44.920> across<00:02:45.310> this

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
these plants are now growing across this

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.729 
these plants are now growing across this
border<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:46.090> making<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.629> hidden<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.620> is

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
border and making it hidden so this is

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.530 
border and making it hidden so this is
much<00:02:47.950> prettier<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.670> look<00:02:48.849> at<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.180> new<00:02:49.299> rock

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
much prettier to look at the new rock

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.050 
much prettier to look at the new rock
