barrels now legs

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.370 
barrels now legs
maybe<00:01:45.700> here<00:01:46.180> I<00:01:46.780> know<00:01:47.740> idea<00:01:48.010> of<00:01:48.930> Windhelm<00:01:49.930> also

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
maybe here I know idea of Windhelm also

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.580 
maybe here I know idea of Windhelm also
has<00:01:50.500> boats<00:01:50.830> but<00:01:51.220> if<00:01:51.430> they<00:01:52.330> if<00:01:52.540> there<00:01:52.810> are<00:01:53.290> boats

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
and they probably also have barrels

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.030 
and they probably also have barrels
there<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.430> anywhere<00:01:57.820> there<00:01:58.270> are<00:01:58.509> boats<00:01:59.040> where

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040
