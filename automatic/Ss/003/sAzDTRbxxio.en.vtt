00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.410
 I'm married to a military man and for a long time 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.109
 services 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.900
 participating relocate it happened 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:26.649
 strange story in the city of Stavropol 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.749
 more than a year ago but that moment in my 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.720
 son was a year and 2 months 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:34.120
 we rented an apartment with such cute 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 oldies for small in general 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.850
 money apartment was a three-room yes 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.580
 one room was closed with things 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.520
 owners and we use it became 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.950
 respectively two rooms 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.630
 the apartment was quite old and the pain was 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.290
 far from the first freshness 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.310
 but it was possible to live a child I slept in 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.620
 one room and my husband in another like 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.130
 I told my husband military 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.310
 leaves early and comes late 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.280
 business trips 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.859
 in charge or at home 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.899
 often do not spend the night and that's literally 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:14.469
 a week after the housewarming 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:17.189
 started to notice some oddities of mine 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:20.639
 I notice the dishes for the kitchen and out of the corner of my eye 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.639
 as if someone are standing behind their backs 

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:29.590
 turning around no one's nose up to some 

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:32.619
 bad stays on longer at Whelan 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.060
 my husband is a regular exercise and stayed in 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.630
 flat cheese 1 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.359
 and that's literally on my third night 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.469
 the child began to wake up several 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.859
 once a night 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:47.439
 just with a heartbreaking scream i 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.350
 never heard him so 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.570
 shouted 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.479
 even somehow quite small was and 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.500
 something ached naturally came 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.930
 reassured and the child fell asleep further in 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.560
 some evening got tired of running from the room to 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.490
 the room I put the baby to sleep in a 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.560
 that night my son woke up what 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.069
 strange 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.520
 igromkom then a one year old child and 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.310
 suddenly in a whisper I am half awake at first 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.230
 I understood what he babbled there and then 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.239
 woke up rather from surprise 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.540
 that does not scream whispers and already finally 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.660
 waking up 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.870
 heard from the front door ring out 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.410
 heavy such steps as if someone 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.799
 walked down the hall past my room and 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.790
 went to his brother's son creak or spring 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:47.120
 the sofa on which my son usually sleeps and 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:51.069
 then some sort of hissing who no treasure 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.860
 this diy this someone got up from the couch 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.370
 walked down the hall went brother killed and 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.430
 went to the door to my room say 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.209
 honestly only wild fear could 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.930
 explain what I did I'm tired of 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.750
 bed 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.989
 turned to face the door and literally 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.900
 burst get out of here you dare not 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.620
 hurt my baby I you him 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.799
 will not give it back 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.280
 after that, I heard some more 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:26.480
 sigh and steps towards the front door 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.989
 the rest of the night I didnâ€™t sleep really 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.450
 This someone will give no more worried we 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.290
 still moved out of this apartment not 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.690
 living up to the same month and leaving money 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.600
 when I gave the keys to the owners, they told me 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.440
 said no one from the lodger in this 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.220
 the apartment does not live more than a couple of months 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.220
 for some reason reduce 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.860
 tank
