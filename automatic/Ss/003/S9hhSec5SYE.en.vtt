00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.719
 so all passed layer maximum speed and his 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:17.529
 not looking one of the super power good 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.689
 high-quality line for weak 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.670
 from the friction of computers users 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.560
 who can't afford to play 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.050
 in crisis do not think no yes not 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.240
 smear is just a real fact that 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.160
 not everyone can grow rustling you another 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.990
 comp and some just do not go there 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.579
 I want to play so you can lose 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.260
 This shooter can be played even with 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.469
 friends because he drank without 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.269
 network that is here only network 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.190
 you can start the server with mats ride 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.379
 or join y with your sidekick 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.379
 pipes to roll and later work against 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.600
 play each other i show off 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.320

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.899
 she metal flame download on and you can 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.629
 either country under my video link 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.850
 lush deposit base how to rock like this 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.740
 per file with fast and high quality you can 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.350
 see me here a video from the sands on 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.940
 channel 1 and called so fast download 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.100
 c depositfiles and the door goes to the game, we 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.770
 run traces choose 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.000
 kharkov without any script without anything 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.990
 it's a type of shooter 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.350
 don't necessarily say power is not like 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.130
 the rule is just to play old man 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.130
 shot points 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.890
 actually in the game as such script 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.159
 not so we stick to the rule 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.329
 saw a shot choose a team we 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.509
 choose a team of red play 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.659
 attack aircraft and all who will not be ours 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.659
 research 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.289
 choose the drop-off point call in on 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.289
 the planet they start rush 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.310
 here the chip capture points more 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.390
 your team points on the principle 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.390
 battlefield so much cooler 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.440
 so great and 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.710
 now capture shooting 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.250
 so on 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.379
 conditions for slightly the same therefore 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.100
 so you will not look like it all depends 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.100
 only from your skill 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.040
 bomb 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:35.760
 yes me sllist and disembarking . b 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.360
 toy, too, based on the village given its 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.610
 principles of elephants character for 2013 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.690
 I started because this is some kind of garbage 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:49.560
 but I believe I do not want to review 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.940
 did you even see him for him that even 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.850
 this game you can find a lot of things 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.850
 enjoy we captured another point 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.770
 I will probably play next for a defender 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.770
 go 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.000
 he is fine 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.320
 blue dot capture blue behind 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.160
 proper 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.160
 us 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.030
 but 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.310
 one 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.210
 right way means helping the life of the year 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.210
 failed 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.180
 similar right shelf if already 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.130
 made sure that or 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.130
 I will look in vain 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.610
 Well, in general, the general capture of points and that is 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.370
 priority for the game 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.360
 and so I think on 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:16.009
 success say all this brief overview 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:19.300
 see subscribe put likes 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.300
