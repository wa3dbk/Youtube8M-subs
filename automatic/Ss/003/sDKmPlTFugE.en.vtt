all as the alluded to in this first post
is<00:04:42.349> wholly<00:04:43.039> possible<00:04:43.669> that<00:04:43.849> they're<00:04:44.000> just

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
is wholly possible that they're just

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.640

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
everything more current and they may

everything more current and they may
just<00:04:48.169> not<00:04:48.289> have<00:04:48.349> gotten<00:04:48.680> around<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:49.130> doing<00:04:49.400> the

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
just not have gotten around to doing the

just not have gotten around to doing the

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
is getting more clicks than the fallout

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.600 
is getting more clicks than the fallout
website<00:05:20.990> because<00:05:21.139> after<00:05:21.530> all<00:05:21.560> it<00:05:21.949> is<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.280> most

recent game and because of that my

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.710 
recent game and because of that my
thinking<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.310> that<00:05:25.639> they're<00:05:26.330> anticipating

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
thinking is that they're anticipating

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.500 
thinking is that they're anticipating
the<00:05:27.380> fallout<00:05:27.800> website<00:05:28.220> for<00:05:28.460> some<00:05:28.639> reason<00:05:29.090> to

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
the fallout website for some reason to

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.969 
the fallout website for some reason to
be<00:05:29.630> getting<00:05:29.900> more<00:05:30.050> traffic<00:05:30.260> in<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:30.770> near

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
be getting more traffic in the near

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.860 
be getting more traffic in the near
future<00:05:31.010> so<00:05:31.789> they<00:05:31.880> want<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.180> get<00:05:32.330> that<00:05:32.539> site

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
future so they want to get that site

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.300 
future so they want to get that site
right<00:05:33.110> they<00:05:33.320> want<00:05:33.530> to<00:05:33.590> make<00:05:33.710> everything<00:05:34.039> more

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
right they want to make everything more

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.790 
right they want to make everything more
current<00:05:34.760> for<00:05:35.180> that<00:05:35.360> website<00:05:35.659> and<00:05:36.080> then<00:05:36.470> once<00:05:36.680> I

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
current for that website and then once I

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.469 
current for that website and then once I
get<00:05:36.979> all<00:05:37.099> the<00:05:37.190> bugs<00:05:37.340> and<00:05:37.610> stuff<00:05:37.760> out<00:05:38.060> of<00:05:38.150> the

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
get all the bugs and stuff out of the

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.000 
get all the bugs and stuff out of the
way<00:05:38.510> for<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:38.930> website<00:05:39.139> then<00:05:39.590> they<00:05:39.710> can<00:05:39.860> move

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
way for that website then they can move

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.250 
way for that website then they can move
on<00:05:40.130> to<00:05:40.250> Skyrim<00:05:40.760> so<00:05:41.180> from<00:05:41.360> my<00:05:41.389> perspective<00:05:41.539> they

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
on to Skyrim so from my perspective they

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.170 
on to Skyrim so from my perspective they
seem<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.500> have<00:05:42.650> a<00:05:42.770> bit<00:05:42.949> of<00:05:42.979> a<00:05:43.190> prioritization

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
seem to have a bit of a prioritization

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.180 
seem to have a bit of a prioritization
going<00:05:44.630> on<00:05:44.750> here<00:05:44.990> if<00:05:45.500> they<00:05:45.740> didn't<00:05:46.039> have

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
going on here if they didn't have

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.800 
going on here if they didn't have
fallout<00:05:46.460> 4<00:05:46.760> in<00:05:46.849> production<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:47.419> it<00:05:47.659> was

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
fallout 4 in production and it was

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.570 
fallout 4 in production and it was
solely<00:05:48.080> Skyrim<00:05:48.620> that<00:05:48.740> they<00:05:48.860> were<00:05:48.919> working<00:05:49.430> on

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
solely Skyrim that they were working on

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
and the codes etc they would be focusing

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.620

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.330 
on the Elder Scrolls website but instead
they're<00:05:59.840> focusing<00:06:00.320> on<00:06:00.470> fallout<00:06:00.919> that

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
they're focusing on fallout that

they're focusing on fallout that
suggests<00:06:01.789> to<00:06:01.940> me<00:06:01.970> that<00:06:02.330> they're<00:06:02.900> anticipating

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
suggests to me that they're anticipating

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.960 
suggests to me that they're anticipating
that<00:06:03.889> they're<00:06:04.190> going<00:06:04.280> to<00:06:04.340> be<00:06:04.490> having<00:06:04.610> a<00:06:04.820> new

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
that they're going to be having a new

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.659 
that they're going to be having a new
site<00:06:05.240> launch<00:06:05.509> for<00:06:06.169> Fallout<00:06:06.860> and<00:06:07.009> it's<00:06:07.430> not

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
site launch for Fallout and it's not

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.540 
site launch for Fallout and it's not
merely<00:06:08.090> just<00:06:08.599> an<00:06:08.780> upgrade<00:06:09.650> and<00:06:09.830> me<00:06:10.070> upgrade

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
merely just an upgrade and me upgrade

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.279 
merely just an upgrade and me upgrade
because<00:06:10.729> if<00:06:10.970> it<00:06:11.090> was<00:06:11.300> just<00:06:11.330> a<00:06:11.659> mere<00:06:11.840> upgrade

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
because if it was just a mere upgrade

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.740 
because if it was just a mere upgrade
they<00:06:12.800> should<00:06:13.099> be<00:06:13.220> focusing<00:06:13.820> on<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.479> Elder

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
they should be focusing on the Elder

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.420 
they should be focusing on the Elder
Scrolls<00:06:14.780> because<00:06:15.500> that's<00:06:15.680> the<00:06:15.830> most<00:06:15.979> recent

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
Scrolls because that's the most recent

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.700 
Scrolls because that's the most recent
game<00:06:16.639> and<00:06:16.940> I<00:06:17.300> think<00:06:17.630> we<00:06:17.810> all<00:06:18.020> are<00:06:18.289> kind<00:06:18.650> of

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
game and I think we all are kind of

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.119 
game and I think we all are kind of
resigned

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:19.129 
resigned

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.949 
resigned
the<00:06:19.279> fact<00:06:19.489> now<00:06:19.669> that<00:06:19.699> it's<00:06:20.419> going<00:06:20.749> to<00:06:20.839> be

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:20.959 
the fact now that it's going to be

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:23.019 
the fact now that it's going to be
fallout<00:06:21.229> for<00:06:21.619> their<00:06:21.830> next<00:06:22.039> game<00:06:22.339> is<00:06:22.580> certainly

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
fallout for their next game is certainly

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:24.999 
fallout for their next game is certainly
going<00:06:23.239> to<00:06:23.300> be<00:06:23.360> fallout<00:06:23.689> simply<00:06:24.499> from<00:06:24.649> a<00:06:24.739> common

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
going to be fallout simply from a common

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.189 
going to be fallout simply from a common
sense<00:06:25.279> in<00:06:25.459> a<00:06:25.580> business<00:06:26.179> perspective<00:06:26.479> you

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
sense in a business perspective you

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.749 
sense in a business perspective you
don't<00:06:27.439> make<00:06:27.589> another<00:06:27.919> Elder<00:06:28.219> Scrolls<00:06:28.489> game

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
don't make another Elder Scrolls game

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.089 
don't make another Elder Scrolls game
when<00:06:29.360> you've<00:06:29.539> already<00:06:29.809> recently<00:06:30.439> done<00:06:30.589> Skyrim

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
when you've already recently done Skyrim

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.739 
when you've already recently done Skyrim
or<00:06:31.249> that<00:06:31.759> was<00:06:31.879> the<00:06:31.969> last<00:06:32.119> game<00:06:32.269> you<00:06:32.330> worked<00:06:32.629> on

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:32.749 
or that was the last game you worked on

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:34.749 
or that was the last game you worked on
anyways<00:06:33.169> when<00:06:33.679> elder<00:06:34.009> scrolls<00:06:34.249> online<00:06:34.369> is

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
anyways when elder scrolls online is

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.339 
anyways when elder scrolls online is
just<00:06:34.939> about<00:06:35.089> to<00:06:35.239> come<00:06:35.389> out<00:06:35.449> on<00:06:35.569> consoles<00:06:36.139> it

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
just about to come out on consoles it

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.619 
just about to come out on consoles it
just<00:06:36.889> doesn't<00:06:37.039> make<00:06:37.249> sense<00:06:37.309> so<00:06:38.179> if<00:06:38.360> we<00:06:38.389> are

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
just doesn't make sense so if we are

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.839 
just doesn't make sense so if we are
assuming<00:06:39.110> that<00:06:39.559> the<00:06:40.099> next<00:06:40.369> game<00:06:40.519> is<00:06:40.669> going<00:06:40.789> to

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:40.849 
assuming that the next game is going to

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.729 
assuming that the next game is going to
be<00:06:40.909> fallout<00:06:41.179> 4<00:06:41.539> yes<00:06:41.809> it<00:06:41.959> makes<00:06:42.110> sense<00:06:42.319> for<00:06:42.469> them

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:42.739
