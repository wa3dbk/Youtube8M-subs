Facebook tonight latisha okay so now the
contraction<00:00:37.740> is<00:00:37.950> when<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.490> contents<00:00:39.180> move

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
contraction is when the contents move

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.380 
contraction is when the contents move
inside<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.890> can<00:00:41.040> track<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.310> couple<00:00:41.790> times<00:00:42.000> every

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
inside it can track a couple times every

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.460 
inside it can track a couple times every
minute<00:00:42.990> and<00:00:43.770> water<00:00:44.340> arm<00:00:44.790> is<00:00:44.970> in<00:00:45.150> there

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
minute and water arm is in there

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.440 
minute and water arm is in there
extracted<00:00:46.470> rot<00:00:46.680> even<00:00:46.950> happens<00:00:47.430> she<00:00:48.000> can't<00:00:48.270> go
