a<00:00:38.309> year<00:00:38.399> ago<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.969> started<00:00:39.360> making<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.930> list

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
a year ago I started making this list

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
a year ago I started making this list
where<00:00:40.500> ever<00:00:40.860> flipped<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.640> say<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:41.790> example

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
where ever flipped just say for example

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.330 
where ever flipped just say for example
when<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.570> wax<00:00:42.750> or<00:00:42.870> leg<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:44.040> went<00:00:44.160> really

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
when a wax or leg and it went really

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.490 
when a wax or leg and it went really
well<00:00:44.489> I'd<00:00:45.030> write<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.480> down<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.719> list<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
well I'd write it down on my list to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.560 
well I'd write it down on my list to
flip<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.800> again<00:00:46.890> once<00:00:47.550> my<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.000> our<00:00:48.120> limit<00:00:48.450> had

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that I want to flip again and because I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.439 
that I want to flip again and because I
want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> fit<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.399> item<00:01:02.670> again<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.180> would<00:01:03.420> be

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
want to fit that item again it would be

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.780 
want to fit that item again it would be
on<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.719> list<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.170> flip<00:01:04.379> once<00:01:04.619> my<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.369> our<00:01:05.460> limit

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
on my list to flip once my for our limit

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.149 
on my list to flip once my for our limit
had<00:01:05.880> gone<00:01:06.060> past<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:07.170> usually<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.040> these

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
had gone past so usually with these

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.190 
had gone past so usually with these
lists<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:09.180> item<00:01:09.299> goes<00:01:09.600> bad<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> few<00:01:10.140> times

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
lists if an item goes bad a few times

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
lists if an item goes bad a few times
just<00:01:10.530> cross<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.920> off<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.850> still<00:01:12.150> have

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
just cross it off but you still have

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.969 
just cross it off but you still have
tons<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> tons<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.930> items<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:13.470> list<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
tons and tons of items on your list to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.370 
tons and tons of items on your list to
flip<00:01:14.220> every<00:01:14.909> four<00:01:15.119> hours<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.110> good<00:01:16.259> thing

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
flip every four hours and the good thing

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.929 
flip every four hours and the good thing
about<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.250> aren't<00:01:17.670> looking

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
about this is that you aren't looking

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.780 
about this is that you aren't looking
for<00:01:18.600> new<00:01:18.900> items<00:01:19.320> every<00:01:19.740> single<00:01:20.009> day<00:01:20.159> but

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
for new items every single day but

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.190 
for new items every single day but
instead<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.479> routine<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> go

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
instead you have this routine to go

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.260 
instead you have this routine to go
through<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> farm<00:01:24.060> one

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
through just like you do like a farm one

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
through just like you do like a farm one
you<00:01:24.479> know<00:01:24.570> you'd<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.930> from<00:01:25.259> each<00:01:25.439> patch<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you know you'd go from each patch to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310 
you know you'd go from each patch to
patch<00:01:26.100> doing<00:01:26.880> each<00:01:27.030> thing<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.020> same<00:01:28.170> with

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.510 
patch doing each thing and the same with
flipping<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.680> go<00:01:28.799> through<00:01:28.979> each<00:01:29.130> item

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
flipping you go through each item

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.030 
flipping you go through each item
looking<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.689> an<00:01:30.750> item<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.049> flip<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.860> for

every<00:02:13.920> single<00:02:14.069> one<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.540> will<00:02:15.540> make<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> total<00:02:15.930> of

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
every single one I will make a total of

every single one I will make a total of
fifteen<00:02:16.680> point<00:02:16.950> five<00:02:17.010> million<00:02:17.430> every<00:02:17.910> four

fifteen point five million every four

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.509 
fifteen point five million every four
hours<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.930> by<00:02:18.989> flipping<00:02:19.140> these<00:02:19.440> items<00:02:19.680> but

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
hours just by flipping these items but

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.369 
hours just by flipping these items but
of<00:02:20.640> course<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.970> does<00:02:21.120> vary<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.690> know<00:02:21.810> each<00:02:22.080> day

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
of course it does vary you know each day

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.990 
of course it does vary you know each day
you<00:02:22.440> might<00:02:22.650> make<00:02:22.800> more<00:02:23.069> profit<00:02:23.459> on<00:02:23.550> one<00:02:23.760> or

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you might make more profit on one or

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.850 
you might make more profit on one or
maybe<00:02:24.690> some<00:02:24.959> days<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.379> just<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:25.650> bad

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
maybe some days it's just really bad

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.710 
maybe some days it's just really bad
puffy<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.519> can't<00:02:26.730> make<00:02:26.819> as<00:02:26.970> much<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.660> on

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
puffy and just can't make as much but on

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.970 
puffy and just can't make as much but on
average<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.230> should<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.590> looking<00:02:28.739> at<00:02:28.860> about

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
average you should be looking at about

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.130 
average you should be looking at about
fifteen<00:02:29.340> point<00:02:29.550> five<00:02:29.610> million<00:02:30.060> every<00:02:30.930> four

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
fifteen point five million every four

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.509 
fifteen point five million every four
hours<00:02:31.170> by<00:02:31.620> flipping<00:02:31.860> everything<00:02:32.220> one<00:02:32.430> of

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
hours by flipping everything one of

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.759 
hours by flipping everything one of
those<00:02:32.640> items<00:02:32.849> once<00:02:33.810> your<00:02:33.989> limit<00:02:34.260> has<00:02:34.470> reached

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
those items once your limit has reached

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.350 
those items once your limit has reached
and<00:02:35.040> then<00:02:35.129> you<00:02:35.190> do<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.340> again<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.849> four<00:02:36.269> hours

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
and then you do it again in four hours

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.479 
and then you do it again in four hours
time<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:36.900> that's<00:02:37.140> quite<00:02:37.349> decent<00:02:37.799> if<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.370> do

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
time so that's quite decent if you do

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.039 
time so that's quite decent if you do
that<00:02:38.640> three<00:02:38.790> times<00:02:38.819> per<00:02:39.150> day<00:02:39.239> looking<00:02:39.510> at<00:02:39.599> 45

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
that three times per day looking at 45

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.960 
that three times per day looking at 45
million<00:02:40.349> per<00:02:40.709> day<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.220> those<00:02:41.370> items<00:02:41.580> of

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
million per day just on those items of

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.089 
million per day just on those items of
course<00:02:42.629> you<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:42.810> flip<00:02:42.959> more<00:02:43.140> items<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.769> the

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
course you can flip more items and the

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.350 
course you can flip more items and the
great<00:02:44.280> thing<00:02:44.340> about<00:02:44.459> these<00:02:44.700> items<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.239> that

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
great thing about these items is that

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.520 
great thing about these items is that
you<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.510> don't<00:02:45.660> have<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.959> sit<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:46.349> wait

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
you just don't have to sit there wait

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.500 
you just don't have to sit there wait
for<00:02:46.680> them<00:02:46.799> to<00:02:46.829> buy<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.579> can<00:02:47.849> go<00:02:48.030> away<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.239> come

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
for them to buy you can go away and come

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.720 
for them to buy you can go away and come
back<00:02:48.690> every<00:02:49.079> half<00:02:49.290> an<00:02:49.380> hour<00:02:49.560> see<00:02:50.250> what's<00:02:50.459> born

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
back every half an hour see what's born
