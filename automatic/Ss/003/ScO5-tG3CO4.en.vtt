this might be happening if you could

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.840 
this might be happening if you could
imagine<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.860> flat<00:00:38.250> line<00:00:38.550> right

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
imagine that I was on a flat line right

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.410 
imagine that I was on a flat line right
here<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.399> face<00:00:41.760> magnet

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
here you can see that the face magnet

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.490 
here you can see that the face magnet
and<00:00:42.600> my<00:00:43.469> target<00:00:44.340> line<00:00:44.370> pretty<00:00:45.030> much<00:00:45.500> are

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and my target line pretty much are

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.940 
and my target line pretty much are
parallel<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.430> each<00:00:47.579> other<00:00:48.230> but<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.500> further

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
parallel to each other but the further

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.049 
parallel to each other but the further
the<00:00:50.579> ball<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.149> below<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.719> feet<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.030> see

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the ball is below my feet you can see

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.680 
the ball is below my feet you can see
the<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.440> face<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.010> opening<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.850> am<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the more the face is opening I am and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.330 
the more the face is opening I am and
twisting<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.500> any<00:00:58.649> way<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.070> see

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
twisting this in any way you can see

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.229 
twisting this in any way you can see
that<00:00:59.520> if<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.899> haven't<00:01:00.899> well<00:01:01.530> below<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.190> feet<00:01:02.489> how

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that if I haven't well below my feet how

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.450 
that if I haven't well below my feet how
much<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.500> face<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.979> pointing

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
much to the right the face is pointing

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
much to the right the face is pointing
from<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.960> what's<00:01:07.200> happening

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
from here so this is what's happening

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.710 
from here so this is what's happening
when<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> ball<00:01:08.909> below<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.450> feet

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
when you have the ball below your feet

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.859 
when you have the ball below your feet
the<00:01:10.650> first<00:01:10.890> thing<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> need<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.090> aim

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the first thing you need to do is aim

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.270 
the first thing you need to do is aim
left<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.979> compensate<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.140> face<00:01:16.920> being

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
left to compensate for the face being

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300 
left to compensate for the face being
open<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.960> second<00:01:19.409> thing<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> do

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
open the second thing I want you to do

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
open the second thing I want you to do
you're<00:01:20.850> probably<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.540> gonna<00:01:21.810> see<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you're probably just gonna see if you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.950 
you're probably just gonna see if you
can<00:01:22.470> grip<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.770> club<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.720> bit

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
can grip the club just a little bit

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.530 
can grip the club just a little bit
longer<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> make<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
longer because we got to make up for the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.390 
longer because we got to make up for the
fact<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.650> sometimes<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> can

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
fact that you know sometimes it can

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.940 
fact that you know sometimes it can
anywhere<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:30.420> between<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.079> know<00:01:31.200> three<00:01:31.619> four

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
anywhere be between you know three four

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
anywhere be between you know three four
or<00:01:32.100> five<00:01:32.130> inches<00:01:32.490> below<00:01:32.820> our<00:01:32.970> feet<00:01:33.150> sometimes

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
or five inches below our feet sometimes

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.780 
or five inches below our feet sometimes
so<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.290> gotta<00:01:34.530> make<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.369> longer

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
so you gotta make it a little longer

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.819 
so you gotta make it a little longer
that<00:01:35.820> will<00:01:36.150> help<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.900> shot<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that will help you with this shot you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.859 
that will help you with this shot you
probably<00:01:38.220> find<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.390> might<00:01:39.600> actually

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
probably find that you might actually

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.130 
probably find that you might actually
need<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.259> stand<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:42.420> bit<00:01:42.630> closer

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
need to stand just a little bit closer

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.440 
need to stand just a little bit closer
to<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> make<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.759> easier

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
to it just to make it a little easier

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.130 
to it just to make it a little easier
for<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.310> hit<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.729> shot

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
for you to get down to hit this shot

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.030 
for you to get down to hit this shot
so<00:01:49.440> just<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.830> recap<00:01:49.980> aim<00:01:50.910> left<00:01:51.260> trying<00:01:52.260> grip<00:01:52.680> as

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
so just to recap aim left trying grip as

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.330 
so just to recap aim left trying grip as
far<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> shaft<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.360> possible<00:01:55.040> just<00:01:56.040> stand

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
far up the shaft as possible just stand

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.380 
far up the shaft as possible just stand
a<00:01:56.490> hair<00:01:56.730> closer<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:58.620> let<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.160> go<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.790> if<00:02:00.210> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
a hair closer and let it go and if you
