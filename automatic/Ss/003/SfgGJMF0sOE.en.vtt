there are a few little things that I can

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.870 
there are a few little things that I can
work<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.590> between<00:03:20.950> now<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.100> now<00:03:21.670> in<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
work on between now and now in the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.440 
work on between now and now in the
Olympics<00:03:23.010> turns<00:03:24.010> are<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.280> big<00:03:24.430> part<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:25.360> know

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
Olympics turns are a big part you know

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.490 
Olympics turns are a big part you know
that's<00:03:25.660> that's<00:03:27.120> how<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.780> was<00:03:28.900> touching<00:03:29.110> people

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
that's that's how it was touching people

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.710 
that's that's how it was touching people
out<00:03:29.620> in<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.860> last<00:03:30.040> last<00:03:30.880> few<00:03:31.120> races<00:03:31.270> in<00:03:31.600> that

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
out in the last last few races in that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.230 
out in the last last few races in that
event<00:03:31.990> so<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.320> know<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.590> think<00:03:32.970> being<00:03:33.970> able<00:03:34.090> to

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
event so you know I think being able to

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.190 
event so you know I think being able to
nail<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.660> finish<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:36.510> having<00:03:37.510> some<00:03:37.660> having

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
nail the finish and having some having

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.890 
nail the finish and having some having
better<00:03:38.380> terms<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:39.360> faster<00:03:40.360> speed<00:03:40.630> for<00:03:40.840> me

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
better terms and faster speed for me

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.110 
better terms and faster speed for me
going<00:03:41.050> out<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.530> think<00:03:41.740> is<00:03:41.890> somehow

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
going out and that I think is somehow

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.949 
going out and that I think is somehow
definitely<00:03:43.120> one<00:03:43.209> improve<00:03:43.510> on<00:03:43.600> between<00:03:43.840> now

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
definitely one improve on between now

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.009 
definitely one improve on between now
and<00:03:44.050> then<00:03:44.290> but<00:03:44.580> as<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:45.850> think<00:03:46.300> as<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> whole<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.989> a

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
and then but as I think as a whole is a

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:57.490 
and then but as I think as a whole is a
pretty<00:03:47.860> decent<00:03:48.190> week

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.190 

I<00:03:58.209> mean<00:03:59.209> this<00:03:59.299> week<00:03:59.510> turned<00:03:59.750> out<00:03:59.840> how<00:03:59.930> I<00:03:59.989> wanted

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
I mean this week turned out how I wanted

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.819 
I mean this week turned out how I wanted
it<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.439> you<00:04:00.739> know<00:04:00.860> I'm<00:04:01.760> excited<00:04:02.439> I'm<00:04:03.439> ready<00:04:03.709> for

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
it to you know I'm excited I'm ready for

the challenge lies ahead of me and you
know<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.560> think<00:04:06.890> at<00:04:07.129> the<00:04:07.220> Olympics<00:04:07.549> it's<00:04:07.670> gonna

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
know I think at the Olympics it's gonna

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.330 
know I think at the Olympics it's gonna
be<00:04:07.909> harder<00:04:08.209> than<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.599> was<00:04:08.750> here

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
be harder than it was here

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.360 
be harder than it was here
it's<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.430> higher<00:04:10.610> level<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.980> know<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.159> had

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
it's a higher level and you know you had

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.569 
it's a higher level and you know you had
to<00:04:13.489> realize<00:04:13.819> in<00:04:14.030> there<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:15.489> that's<00:04:16.489> the

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
to realize in there and that's the

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.640 
to realize in there and that's the
Olympic<00:04:16.910> Games<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:18.109> know<00:04:18.169> something<00:04:18.560> I'm

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
Olympic Games so you know something I'm

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
looking forward to and hopefully

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.320 
looking forward to and hopefully
