00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.480 
CVI outport I thought that was cool so
he<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.630> record<00:02:25.290> gameplay<00:02:25.650> from<00:02:26.220> older

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
he can record gameplay from older

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.330 
he can record gameplay from older
systems<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.270> was<00:02:27.390> well<00:02:28.320> actually<00:02:28.830> needing<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
systems it was well actually needing the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.400 
systems it was well actually needing the
old<00:02:29.490> system<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.240> can<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:30.930> use<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:33.410> icon

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
old system you can just use this icon

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.990 
old system you can just use this icon
would<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.650> COS<00:02:37.860> truck<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.580> control

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
would be the COS truck of the control

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.640 
would be the COS truck of the control
scheme<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.600> certain<00:02:39.900> games<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.440> can't

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
scheme for certain games you can't

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.130 
scheme for certain games you can't
really<00:02:40.830> change<00:02:41.130> them<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.670> mean<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:42.989> go

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
really change them I mean you can go

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.640 
really change them I mean you can go
into<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.920> game<00:02:44.989> options<00:02:45.989> like<00:02:46.350> why<00:02:46.590> you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
into the game options like why you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.560 
into the game options like why you
playing<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> game<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.580> change<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.060> controls

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
playing the game and change the controls

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.280 
playing the game and change the controls
but<00:02:49.550> it<00:02:50.550> doesn't<00:02:50.850> really<00:02:50.970> help<00:02:51.239> because<00:02:52.020> it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
but it doesn't really help because it

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.490 
but it doesn't really help because it
has<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> default<00:02:53.280> mapping<00:02:54.239> for<00:02:54.810> every

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
has like a default mapping for every

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.990 
has like a default mapping for every
button<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.950> don't<00:02:59.220> want<00:02:59.400> me<00:02:59.489> use<00:02:59.760> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
button and you don't want me use the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.080 
button and you don't want me use the
left<00:03:00.209> trigger<00:03:01.100> all<00:03:02.100> these<00:03:02.280> happen<00:03:02.670> time<00:03:02.850> in

left trigger all these happen time in

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.690 
left trigger all these happen time in
half<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.600> games<00:03:03.810> cuz<00:03:04.170> they<00:03:04.290> somehow<00:03:04.700> map

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
half the games cuz they somehow map

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.360 
half the games cuz they somehow map
everything<00:03:06.150> else<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.020> face<00:03:07.440> buttons<00:03:07.890> and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
everything else to the face buttons and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.030 
everything else to the face buttons and
a<00:03:09.120> d-pad<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.989> right<00:03:10.200> hand<00:03:10.410> having<00:03:10.739> the

a d-pad and the right hand having the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.830 
a d-pad and the right hand having the
right<00:03:11.190> trigger<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.790> some<00:03:11.940> reason<00:03:12.269> at<00:03:12.690> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
right trigger for some reason at the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.650 
right trigger for some reason at the
right<00:03:12.989> trigger<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.530> selecting<00:03:14.480> almost<00:03:15.480> all

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
right trigger is selecting almost all

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.120 
right trigger is selecting almost all
the<00:03:15.900> games<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.290> played<00:03:16.500> before

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
the games I played before

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.090 
the games I played before
yeah<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.180> can<00:03:18.390> use<00:03:18.540> start<00:03:18.930> select<00:03:19.920> as

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
yeah you can use start select as

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.650 
yeah you can use start select as
basically<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.790> Exile<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.480> game<00:03:23.660> escape

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
basically the Exile of the game escape

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.060 
basically the Exile of the game escape
is<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.870> same<00:03:25.200> thing<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:25.739> they're<00:03:25.890> basically

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
is the same thing so they're basically

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.150 
is the same thing so they're basically
the<00:03:26.459> same<00:03:26.700> button<00:03:27.200> which<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.320> thought<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:28.739> like

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
the same button which I thought was like

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.800 
the same button which I thought was like
pointless<00:03:29.580> like<00:03:29.940> why'd<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.239> have<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.360> trigger

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
pointless like why'd you have to trigger

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.580 
pointless like why'd you have to trigger
buttons<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.380> can't<00:03:31.590> use<00:03:31.799> them<00:03:33.320> I'll<00:03:34.320> use

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
buttons and you can't use them I'll use

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.560 
buttons and you can't use them I'll use
them<00:03:34.739> like<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.070> way<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:36.090> will<00:03:36.239> respect

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
them like the way you you will respect

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.369 
them like the way you you will respect
the<00:03:36.720> use<00:03:36.930> themself

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.860 

use<00:03:42.379> microSD<00:03:43.340> cards<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:43.879> thought<00:03:44.120> those<00:03:44.360> go<00:03:44.629> to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
use microSD cards I thought those go to

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.530 
use microSD cards I thought those go to
those<00:03:47.870> are<00:03:48.110> free<00:03:48.290> headphones<00:03:48.769> if<00:03:49.129> you<00:03:49.360> need<00:03:50.360> a

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
those are free headphones if you need a

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.869 
those are free headphones if you need a
cheap<00:03:51.409> pair<00:03:51.620> of<00:03:51.739> headphones<00:03:51.950> replace<00:03:52.640> them

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
cheap pair of headphones replace them

00:03:52.879 --> 00:04:01.350 
cheap pair of headphones replace them
that's<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.599> good<00:03:53.870> thing<00:03:56.110> get<00:03:57.110> watch<00:03:57.590> videos<00:03:58.159> and

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.180 

you<00:04:02.360> pictures<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.170> all<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:03.560> listen<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.099> the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
you pictures and all that listen to the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.440 
you pictures and all that listen to the
radio<00:04:04.370> on<00:04:04.760> this<00:04:05.120> system<00:04:06.970> so<00:04:07.970> that's<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.299> good

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
radio on this system so that's a good

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.229 
radio on this system so that's a good
thing<00:04:08.690> oh<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:09.019> can't<00:04:09.319> record<00:04:09.890> video<00:04:10.250> too<00:04:10.579> but<00:04:10.970> I

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
thing oh it can't record video too but I

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.589 
thing oh it can't record video too but I
thought<00:04:12.049> was<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.319> I<00:04:12.349> wouldn't<00:04:12.739> do<00:04:12.890> that

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
thought was you I wouldn't do that

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.420 
thought was you I wouldn't do that
it's<00:04:14.599> like<00:04:14.810> equivalent<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:15.950> cell<00:04:16.400> phone

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
it's like equivalent to a cell phone

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.170 
it's like equivalent to a cell phone
camera<00:04:16.940> like<00:04:17.359> back<00:04:17.780> in<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.310> early<00:04:19.310> 2000s<00:04:20.000> like

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
what the book camera Hey look and record

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.510

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
something they could these control

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.040 
something they could these control
sticks<00:05:25.630> like<00:05:25.810> they<00:05:25.960> kind<00:05:26.170> of<00:05:26.260> smashed<00:05:26.620> down<00:05:26.980> or

fall<00:05:29.050> out<00:05:29.080> of<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.440> position<00:05:30.010> so<00:05:30.790> I<00:05:30.820> wouldn't

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
fall out of the position so I wouldn't

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.820 
fall out of the position so I wouldn't
really<00:05:31.480> put<00:05:31.600> it<00:05:31.990> in<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.200> book<00:05:32.380> bag<00:05:32.620> or

something like in a tight apartment and

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.320 
something like in a tight apartment and
then<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:36.070> buttons<00:05:36.370> would<00:05:36.580> get<00:05:36.730> smashed<00:05:37.060> down

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
then the buttons would get smashed down

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.040 
then the buttons would get smashed down
or<00:05:37.600> locked<00:05:38.560> in<00:05:38.740> that<00:05:38.920> position<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:44.020> really

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
or locked in that position you really

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.010 
or locked in that position you really
have<00:05:44.350> to<00:05:44.440> go<00:05:44.560> into<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:44.890> settings<00:05:45.340> and<00:05:46.020> tweak

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
system like they say there's just made a

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.909
