00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
turned out looking like it's not

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.170 
turned out looking like it's not
completely<00:01:15.780> composted<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.670> looks<00:01:17.909> pretty

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
completely composted but it looks pretty

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.080 
completely composted but it looks pretty
darn<00:01:18.360> good<00:01:19.070> considering<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.580> started<00:01:20.970> out

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
darn good considering it started out

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.070 
darn good considering it started out
basically<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:22.320> hay<00:01:23.570> again<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.930> not

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
basically as hay again it's it's not

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.360 
basically as hay again it's it's not
100%<00:01:25.500> composted<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:27.440> for<00:01:28.440> our<00:01:28.500> purposes<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
100% composted but for our purposes and

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.030 
100% composted but for our purposes and
in<00:01:29.640> compared<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.060> our<00:01:30.240> big<00:01:30.659> compost<00:01:31.140> pile<00:01:31.350> this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
in compared to our big compost pile this

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.399 
in compared to our big compost pile this
is<00:01:32.190> really<00:01:32.580> really<00:01:32.790> done<00:01:32.940> nicely<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.290> can

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409

is really really done nicely as you can
see<00:01:34.560> here<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.990> think<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.140> an<00:01:37.290> inch

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
see here this is a I think it's an inch

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
see here this is a I think it's an inch
and<00:01:37.620> a<00:01:37.650> quarter<00:01:37.799> inch<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> half<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:39.060> was<00:01:39.180> an

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and a quarter inch and a half it was an

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910 
and a quarter inch and a half it was an
old<00:01:39.390> scrap<00:01:39.600> PVC<00:01:40.110> pipe<00:01:40.320> I've<00:01:40.530> got<00:01:40.680> holes

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
old scrap PVC pipe I've got holes

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.860 
old scrap PVC pipe I've got holes
drilled<00:01:41.640> into<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
drilled into it and then I just have it

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.830 
drilled into it and then I just have it
tie<00:01:43.080> wired<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.369> axle<00:01:44.820> goes<00:01:45.390> down<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
tie wired to the the axle goes down to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.280 
tie wired to the the axle goes down to
the<00:01:45.930> bottom<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.320> allow<00:01:46.590> oxygen<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.850> come<00:01:48.030> in

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
the bottom to allow oxygen to come in

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.380 
the bottom to allow oxygen to come in
and<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.470> also<00:01:49.650> what<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.430> use<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.850> fill<00:01:51.270> this

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and it's also what we use to fill this

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.219 
and it's also what we use to fill this
up<00:01:51.510> with<00:01:51.570> water<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:53.159> keep<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.400> compost

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
up with water just to keep the compost

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.230 
up with water just to keep the compost
with<00:01:55.229> some<00:01:55.409> moisture<00:01:55.740> content<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:56.970> anyway

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
with some moisture content so anyway

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.030 
with some moisture content so anyway
I'll<00:01:57.390> show<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.780> picture<00:01:58.260> of<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.920> this

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
I'll show you a picture of what this

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.640 
I'll show you a picture of what this
barrel<00:01:59.280> looked<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.670> before<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.930> composting

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
barrel looked like before the composting
