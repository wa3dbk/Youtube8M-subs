00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 Hello everyone, I decided to start 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.300
 shoot your talk show so to you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.820
 spout 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.519
 I shove put my onion here 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.369
 became the very best but which I 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.220
 collected at least 4 hours this bike is not 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.230
 it is assembled of course commercials well here you can 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.340
 find fasteners on the front wheel 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.800
 lots 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:35.200
 I better they are not so difficult 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.200
 you were such different parts 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.440
 the rear wheel is harder there that chain 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.260
 here 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.449
 on this wheel how to become a chain 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.089
 curled and black 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.600
 if you look closely you can notice these 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.510
 side here's another wheel this one 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.579
 spoiler it certainly rises and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:07.240
 falls on somewhere before you have to push or 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:10.600
 crazy then worthwhile considered footstep but 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.740
 then there is still there and things are different now 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.020
 I turned him over the question 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.390
 please on the other hand the other 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:26.170
 parties can be seen here 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:28.840
 filing phuket how would they say 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.860
 they need to find the amount if you have 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.960
 of course my eyes get carried away then we can 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.920
 go in it is sick or something like 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:43.240
 such turbines come up as they would 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.020
 easily taken oral such in 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.930
 by plane 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.960
 who has a large drainage planes here 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.619
 can sort of take them off and try 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.310
 collect from such a biker see 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.590
 role is so well blended into the rear 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.119
 the mirror but it is like a fairing not 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:07.229
 I will now about it so here you can 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.980
 This is still interesting to show well 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:15.360
 Basically, I liked the construction here 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.450
