00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 yes yes yes hello everyone 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.719
 especially for us watchdog videos this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.969
 Clown's go for a ride was bone 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.109
 so we'll go see what it's worth 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 first i'm doing i'm going out 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.840
 so the goal in my opinion it's going to be from 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.529
 to get in goes from the tower and then to 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.529
 to pose 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.689
 we will see well and after brice has like 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.090
 ubisoft he likes it unlocked stuff 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:44.180
 of areas theoretically I have to go in 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.180
 this is it jean guy america 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.989
 frequent purchase ok ok I can 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.989
 buy once I do not know 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.470
 it's not going to try to break in 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.500
 in there I never did I do not know 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.300
 too much my opinion this is a trick of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.930
 people when we do for 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.930
 get in there 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:29.640
 gold a door may be the crown in 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:29.640
 buildings no building there no no 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.380
 yeah well it starts well so say 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:02.970
 I can go up there if I do that and 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.280
 after I go over it should 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.280
 do it that no it should be fine 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.870
 here I could find the solution 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.700
 so 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.470
 I do not play the game not the real port of 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.050
 security connect a table what is 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.550
 damn chart with okay it's for 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.190
 what she has is the vagaries of agreement 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:03.350
 I understood, I understood, here we are 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:08.330
