region you're in the problem is that
sprites<00:00:11.870> have<00:00:12.870> lines<00:00:13.200> through<00:00:13.620> them<00:00:18.650> okay<00:00:19.650> now

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
sprites have lines through them okay now

this<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.220> common<00:00:20.970> problem<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.510> these<00:00:21.750> boards

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
this is a common problem on these boards

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.939 
this is a common problem on these boards
and<00:00:22.340> it's<00:00:23.340> now<00:00:23.519> all<00:00:23.820> me<00:00:23.939> down<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.949> motion

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and it's now all me down to the motion

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.550

here<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.189> believe<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.300> previous<00:00:30.750> owner

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
here I believe that the previous owner

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.950 
here I believe that the previous owner
or<00:00:31.830> someone<00:00:32.160> who's<00:00:32.250> worked<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.960> assumed

or someone who's worked on this assumed
it<00:00:34.110> was<00:00:34.200> these<00:00:34.350> realms<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.800> were<00:00:34.950> Fault<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it was these realms that were Fault in a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.130 
it was these realms that were Fault in a
place<00:00:35.610> those<00:00:35.910> actually<00:00:36.450> these<00:00:36.570> ones<00:00:36.780> here

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.360 

no<00:00:40.140> I've<00:00:40.410> actually<00:00:40.559> been<00:00:40.829> probably<00:00:41.070> around

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
no I've actually been probably around

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.330 
no I've actually been probably around
the<00:00:41.489> basic<00:00:41.820> notice<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:43.140> realm<00:00:44.040> here

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the basic notice that this realm here

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.819 
the basic notice that this realm here
has<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:44.969> issues<00:00:45.360> or<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:46.350> least<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.590> thought<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
has some issues or at least I thought it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.549 
has some issues or at least I thought it
was<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.309> Ram<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:49.230> had<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> quick

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
was this Ram and I just had a quick

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.290 
was this Ram and I just had a quick
probe<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.399> custom<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> basic<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
probe on this custom to basic the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.029 
probe on this custom to basic the
outputs<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:52.140> realms<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
outputs of these realms go to this

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.580 
outputs of these realms go to this
custom<00:00:53.550> chip<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:56.750> see<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.199> actually

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
custom chip here and see it's actually

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.270 
custom chip here and see it's actually
no<00:00:59.309> there's<00:01:00.149> no<00:01:00.300> outputs<00:01:00.920> there's<00:01:01.920> nothing<00:01:02.219> on

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
no there's no outputs there's nothing on

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.310 
no there's no outputs there's nothing on
most<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> pins<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.090> chip<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.080 

reveals<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> legs<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.130> bit<00:01:08.159> corroded

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
reveals that the legs are a bit corroded

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.600 
reveals that the legs are a bit corroded
I'm<00:01:09.510> also<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.869> sockets<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.650> dodgy<00:01:12.170> well<00:01:13.170> I

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
I'm also the sockets a bit dodgy well I

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:24.160 
I'm also the sockets a bit dodgy well I
can<00:01:14.610> apply<00:01:15.479> enough<00:01:15.750> pressure<00:01:17.299> there<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:19.189> so

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.830 

I'm<00:01:25.250> just<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> whip<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.240> butt<00:01:27.600> chip

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I'm just going to whip this butt chip

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.630 
I'm just going to whip this butt chip
out<00:01:28.020> clean<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> legs<00:01:28.619> off<00:01:28.860> might<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
out clean the legs off might have to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240 
out clean the legs off might have to
solder<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.119> into<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> 10<00:01:31.229> pin<00:01:31.470> socket<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.100> bad

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
solder it into a 10 pin socket that bad

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.039 
solder it into a 10 pin socket that bad
I've<00:01:33.000> bought<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> new<00:01:33.270> socket<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> board

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
I've bought a new socket on the board

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.630 
I've bought a new socket on the board
and<00:01:34.320> hopefully<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.979> will<00:01:35.159> resolve<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and hopefully that will resolve the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.969 
and hopefully that will resolve the
problem

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
problem

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.649 
problem
okay<00:01:37.979> I've<00:01:38.250> some<00:01:38.610> did<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> legs<00:01:39.090> down<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.540> this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
okay I've some did the legs down on this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
okay I've some did the legs down on this
chip<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.259> polished<00:01:40.619> them<00:01:40.740> off<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
chip and then polished them off and I

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120 
chip and then polished them off and I
fitted<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.150> low<00:01:42.540> profile<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:43.290> tight<00:01:43.649> fitting

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
fitted a low profile very tight fitting

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
fitted a low profile very tight fitting
socket<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.600> got<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> really<00:01:45.960> good

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
socket to it so it's got a really good

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.039 
socket to it so it's got a really good
grip<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> legs<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.689> it's<00:01:48.689> nice<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
grip on the legs and it's nice and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929 
grip on the legs and it's nice and
reliable<00:01:49.350> bang<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> chip<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> make<00:01:50.729> sure

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
reliable bang on the chip to make sure

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
reliable bang on the chip to make sure
no<00:01:51.270> loose<00:01:52.140> contacts<00:01:52.799> oh<00:01:54.020> these<00:01:55.020> high<00:01:55.320> score

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
quickly reset my high school tail just

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.139 
quickly reset my high school tail just
to<00:02:01.920> make<00:02:02.100> sure<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> wasn't<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> fault<00:02:02.880> current

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
to make sure I wasn't the fault current
