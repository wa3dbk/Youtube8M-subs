00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hello today I have something very special for you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.750
 you and you may wonder why 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.210
 no intro came to that more 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.420
 today I have my subscribers thousand 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 special 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.850
 I do not know why or why 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.580
 why why 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.590
 because i am not that funny i am 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.220
 can not play very well and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:34.380
 but you can see that I have to go 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:40.050
 from now on, which is always happy 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:44.160
 not i have the very cool stuff for 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.149
 you and you can 316 i which 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.329
 price gains 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.610
 that's what it looks like and I'll start 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.170
 stop with the first announcement and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.730
 Although here is a lot on one 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.980
 Channel input on this channel to and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 Although the first one there is a new intro 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.230
 that's why you do not have an intro 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.030
 profit 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.030
 you should do the intro 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.250
 yes that was just me is high and that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.430
 Intro probably more created by the guys 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 from jenix we hope so 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.210
 pronounced 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 All the links to those I pack you 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.510
 and the description but the firm 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.180
 page and once the right homepage 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.500
 from and on the spot in any case 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.770
 again a big thank you for a 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:44.930
 cool new intro maybe 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 noticed that fly so cool and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.680
 clapping and interrupts that is 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.020
 my new logo that have already 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.070
 is designed in advance of my guys 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.780
 already done 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.280
 I am to you simply times so the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.840
 Now they will be left one day 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.840
 judge or in the corner you will 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.180
 see this logo 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:19.860
 from now on in the video and I do that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.250
 now if semiprofessionell giving 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.250
 it new 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.470
 you know i load every three days now 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.900
 in the video and currently actually fits 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:37.440
 but etfs but it is now about a whole 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.540
 new full cool action man channel and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.010
 though that is the most frequently asked 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.010
 ask faq astana or something I still have 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.440
 no name and how taken 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.050
 that's she thought there you come in 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.050
 We have to answer two things 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.150
 so in the west not only if you are next to 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.470
 want to take part in the game 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:08.400
 then you are currently writing well 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.959
 this is yours as best peter kohl because 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.600
 it is not all part of it 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.390
 because at last others have skis and 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.910
 then you write the beta code the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.260
 So ask should be called as the series 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.400
 my free should be hot and what 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.830
 really wishes 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.370
 So you should at least write that 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.260
 a question your writing and have that 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.709
 her comments on all lines not 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.350
 want to participate in the games so 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:42.350
 we do not want any better 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.390
 they just let that cynic go 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.070
 that's how it was with mine 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.799
 a thousand subscribers special 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.900
 I feel right at the end 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.690
 Thanks to everyone who subscribes to me 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.480
 have and thank you for your support 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.230
 and also in facebook is always like that 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.850
 Great and always there for me and thanks 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.500
 nice again so all that 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.370
 but we can do that at gamescom 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.840
 all together dumpling because we will 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.780
 We definitely come to the games 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.060
 I see have indeed been a 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.959
 gangster employee he talks 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.880
 probably save the fans 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:28.919
 that too just so i post hey people 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.720
 I am doing what you look at therefore is 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.200
 it also works but you will be back 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.510
 take up 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.930
 However , that comes already 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.930
 firmly
