00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello my name is hooks and hooks 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.099
 shows I'm a technical advisor 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.900
 national to the French Federation of 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.400
 mountain and climbed and today 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.530
 I will introduce you to the node of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.150
 lorenzi is a self-locking knot 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.010
 that we often use when we can not 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.480
 make ours our heart and so when we 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 does not have a quickdraw so for 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.519
 to make that name we need two 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.050
 safety hooks with Virol 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.000
 can close here to show you 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.610
 I will put the safety carabiner 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.070
 on one point here I'm going to spend the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.829
 rope in there and there actually will be 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.020
 always a rope that will be stretched in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.620
 climber's direction and a rope that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 will be towards the insurer I take the rope 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.940
 from the bottom and here I'm going to iron it in the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.300
 carabiner as if I were doing a ride 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.039
 dead now 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.270
 and here I rock the knot on the outside 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.680
 carabiners reviews on the upper part 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.830
 this is unfortunately already we can see that the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.420
 knot they would almost block that by 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.729
 a mechanical system or the cordials 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.400
 crush the bottom rope so that it does not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.659
 do not do it alone for example 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.030
 in fact if ever the rope 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.830
 come here the knot is doing 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.720
 found on a dead turn so he's 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.650
 indispensable to take a second 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.470
 safety carabiners and pass it 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.170
 under the rope and there we will resume the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.810
 two strings and pass them in the EU this 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.200
 that you check well that everything is 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.829
 closed 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 and here I can assure the climber and there 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.570
 so does not always work by the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.149
 mechanical system the duo rope comes 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.490
 crush the bottom rope and the carabiner 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.140
 upper low that forgiveness is two 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.320
 years and says that the rope is going so much for 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.320
 death 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.080
 the Lorenzi knot is a self-locking 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.430
 we use when we have lost his reverso 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.160
 you that no self-locking 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.230
 cord to ensure for example a 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.240
 second that comes underneath or go up 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.180
 on a fixed rope it's a place 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.960
 often use after the heart 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.000
 when we do not have a quickdraw 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.460
 is obliged or two carabiners identical 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.200
 for our heart we use the name of 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.150
 lorenzi provided that we really 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.950
 two safety carabiners and that's it 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.380
 now you know how to make a knot 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.970
 of lorenzi do not forget that it is one of 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.100
 fortune that is used when one has lost 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.240
 material and it's not a node to 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.240
 use every day
