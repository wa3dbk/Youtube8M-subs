00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 oh there, nothing like what you do 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:12.570
 grill a good little cow by set 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:13.830
 tense air and well we salute everyone and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.109
 all and sat today we end up 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.600
 for a new episode euros history 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.150
 today we will talk about fashion and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 gravity gun as you may have like 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.510
 it could have been by whose the noticed thomas 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.310
 eat what is called a gravity gun 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.380
 so for those who played half life 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 2 and certainly know this beauty 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 small object that will actually allow you 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.899
 to simply control to gravitate 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.239
 have as you've seen I moved 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.890
 a cow but I cook them in the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.930
 fire it's great we can make some 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.280
 chops with his finally are already 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.950
 cooked in addition so it's top 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.430
 so I'm going to show you the principle of 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.469
 this mode 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 so it's very simple actually that you 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.640
 will move blocks actually 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.710
 we're going to right-click on a block 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.300
 hop I can take this block and yeah I 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.579
 the control there I can or red can 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.440
 turn everything with my ca it's a little 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 buggy it's a little jerky like that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.460
 it's not super nice anyway I 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.580
 find that rather interesting rather 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.229
 well done so good it's already a big 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.119
 progression compared to mode 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.830
 previous to the is really nothing but the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.790
 tears model a 3d model really 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.530
 very well done watching this 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.270
 financing f5 eric holmes 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.630
 really well done the army very well 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.000
 made 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.979
 so we're going back to normal and we can 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.900
 just do it hop I go over 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.720
 by left-clicking 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.729
 hop I ask them does the block arises 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.860
 in the place the blocks slot 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.810
 available more here chick but here 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.049
 will lay the block there if I put a little 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.750
 more by that it will arise if it is 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.600
 a little more by the exhibition 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.790
 so you can pick up blocks and 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.380
 ask them but you can do 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.820
 better if I'm going to show you this with a 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.280
 animal because it's funnier and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.050
 the animals we will take what we are going 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.570
 take to some of the witches I take them 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.850
 have never seen in stake so this is 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.729
 the opportunity or never hop there no 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.800
 science mans peaceful it's not going to do it 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.390
 hop we get in easy so we can 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.000
 take this witch in fact so 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.590
 here I control it la la la burn it if 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.790
 I want and I can even launched 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.200
 obvious you can do the same thing 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.470
 have blogs if I ever take this 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.150
 block the right and left click ah ben 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.620
 there I can launch so the block in 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.350
 water if I wish then I will you 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.570
 show something else I repair and that 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.680
 after I'm going to do this pony the witch 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.420
 north I 'm not sure that an overload 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.700
 and afraid that after even gaston figures the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.190
 dish we take a pig I will take 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.770
 a jump block and I'm going to run it on the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.090
 pig devours his tour we're just going 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.620
 put you back on track because otherwise c 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.000
 is the galley all because you believe 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.770
 not that it worked I do not know if it's 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.130
 always available in our 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.130
 up to date 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.920
 now we can not but I know 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.550
 that before could apparently hurt the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.170
 animals with my too bad I was typing with 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.630
 well it does not work too well you see 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.310
 that in my only is I have a second 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.690
 2nd gun actually if ever 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.740
 use this ice gun problem I 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.550
 want to take a blog I can not I'm 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.780
 too far must I get to the 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.910
 select like these here and there I 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.460
 can take it by cons with 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.920
 it is moving from a gravity gun to 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.020
 super charge 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.550
 gravity gun I can take so from here 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.570
 so launch it besides launches more 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.760
 there in addition you saw the items 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.230
 bounced it was great but I 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.459
 can take much further 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.510
 items up for example or not indeed in 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.070
 just makes sure the leaves can not 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.180
 to remove some blogs that we can not 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.680
 to return but here and there I pray them to 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.390
 super - this blog or push to let go 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.740
 and here I see the bluff here it is 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.800
 funny enough honestly it's really 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.790
 fun to play with all that it makes him 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.320
 still no damage he does not want or 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.070
 what are you going to kill in mode 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.260
 freestyle paul cauchon here is the pig 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.430

 use it if you ever want to 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.200
 burst a bit on minecraft even that 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.420
 will make a lot of things easier 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.950
 case honestly there are some cool things 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.820
 that are possible to do with this mode 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.290
