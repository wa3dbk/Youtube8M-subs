00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
to need to cut a slit in one side of it

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.100 
to need to cut a slit in one side of it
drill<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> hole<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.460> other<00:02:33.580> side<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.910> it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.660 
drill a hole on the other side of it
the<00:02:35.410> drill<00:02:35.590> bit<00:02:35.620> I'm<00:02:35.830> using<00:02:36.040> for<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:36.460> I<00:02:36.610> think

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
the drill bit I'm using for this I think

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.770 
the drill bit I'm using for this I think
is<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> 3/8<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.660> an<00:02:37.780> inch<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:39.660> I'm<00:02:40.660> actually

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
is a 3/8 of an inch and I'm actually

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.060 
is a 3/8 of an inch and I'm actually
gonna<00:02:40.990> do<00:02:41.230> this<00:02:41.320> on<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.590> floor<00:02:41.800> which<00:02:42.040> is

gonna do this on the floor which is

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.410 
gonna do this on the floor which is
gonna<00:02:42.310> be<00:02:42.370> slightly<00:02:42.670> out<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:42.940> your<00:02:43.030> range<00:02:43.300> of

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
gonna be slightly out of your range of

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.030 
gonna be slightly out of your range of
view<00:02:43.660> sorry<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.230> don't<00:02:44.410> have<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.560> coffee<00:02:44.740> table

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
but we are going to look for spot easily

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.970 
but we are going to look for spot easily
go

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.570 

as<00:02:59.760> close<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.390> scene<00:03:00.599> as<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.860> now

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
as close to the scene as I can and now

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.729 
as close to the scene as I can and now
we<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.209> lovely<00:03:03.659> little<00:03:03.810> hole<00:03:04.049> on<00:03:04.349> one<00:03:04.379> side

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
we have a lovely little hole on one side

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.750 
we have a lovely little hole on one side
of<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:06.019> go<00:03:07.019> ahead<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.560> take<00:03:08.190> our<00:03:08.370> utility

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
of it go ahead and take our utility

of it go ahead and take our utility
knife<00:03:08.909> and<00:03:10.129> find<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.430> spot<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.269> roughly<00:03:12.870> on

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
knife and find a spot that is roughly on

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.530 
knife and find a spot that is roughly on
the<00:03:13.110> other<00:03:13.319> side<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.269> once<00:03:15.269> again

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
the other side of it and once again

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.229 
the other side of it and once again
right<00:03:15.810> along<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.140> scene<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.790> can<00:03:18.000> go<00:03:18.090> ahead

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
right along the scene you can go ahead

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.089 
right along the scene you can go ahead
and<00:03:18.860> stick<00:03:19.860> your<00:03:20.040> utility<00:03:20.489> knife<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.910> into<00:03:21.360> it

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
and stick your utility knife on into it

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.190 
and stick your utility knife on into it
cut<00:03:23.099> a<00:03:23.129> hole<00:03:23.750> technically<00:03:24.750> speaking<00:03:24.989> I

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
cut a hole technically speaking I

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.119 
cut a hole technically speaking I
suppose<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.530> could<00:03:25.680> do<00:03:25.799> this<00:03:25.920> without

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
suppose you could do this without

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.220 
suppose you could do this without
putting<00:03:26.700> this<00:03:26.879> ball<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.360> other<00:03:27.510> side<00:03:27.810> but

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
putting this ball on the other side but

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.350 
putting this ball on the other side but
I<00:03:28.260> find<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.890> vastly<00:03:29.280> easier<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:32.030> get<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
I find it vastly easier to get the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.830 
I find it vastly easier to get the
required<00:03:33.660> not<00:03:34.019> work<00:03:34.230> through<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:38.840> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
required not work through it and the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.550 
required not work through it and the
size<00:03:40.109> of<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.349> slit<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.859> cut<00:03:41.099> on<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.280> other<00:03:41.310> side

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
size of the slit I cut on the other side

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.830 
size of the slit I cut on the other side
you're<00:03:43.560> roughly<00:03:47.120> roughly<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.329> third<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.750> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
you're roughly roughly a third of the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.640 
you're roughly roughly a third of the
search<00:03:49.019> methods<00:03:49.379> in<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.590> ball<00:03:49.910> like<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.650> so

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
search methods in the ball like so so

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.250 
search methods in the ball like so so
next<00:03:53.069> up<00:03:53.280> we<00:03:54.239> have<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.780> rope<00:03:56.030> which<00:03:57.030> will<00:03:57.930> very

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
next up we have a rope which will very

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.900 
next up we have a rope which will very
very<00:03:58.620> easily<00:03:58.829> fit<00:03:59.190> through<00:03:59.400> this<00:03:59.489> hole<00:03:59.700> now

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
very easily fit through this hole now

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.530 
very easily fit through this hole now
and<00:04:01.459> you<00:04:02.459> actually<00:04:02.609> want<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:03.030> be<00:04:03.180> able<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.359> fit

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
and you actually want to be able to fit

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.440 
and you actually want to be able to fit
easily<00:04:04.139> enough<00:04:04.709> because<00:04:05.069> they<00:04:06.030> discover<00:04:06.329> the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
easily enough because they discover the

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.970 
easily enough because they discover the
supplier<00:04:06.750> drums<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.169> past<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.739> can<00:04:07.889> do

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
supplier drums is past you you can do

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.009 
supplier drums is past you you can do
more<00:04:08.130> contact<00:04:08.609> tricks<00:04:08.880> with<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.239> if<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.780> can

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
more contact tricks with it if it can

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.289 
more contact tricks with it if it can
rotate<00:04:10.230> freely<00:04:10.650> inside<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.220> socket<00:04:11.639> so

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
rotate freely inside of the socket so

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.000 
rotate freely inside of the socket so
now<00:04:12.419> that<00:04:12.480> I've<00:04:12.599> stuck<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.930> rope<00:04:13.079> in<00:04:13.290> I'm

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
now that I've stuck the rope in I'm

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.779 
now that I've stuck the rope in I'm
going<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.730> split<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.389> open<00:04:15.419> as<00:04:15.720> such<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:17.310> I'm

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
going to split it open as such and I'm

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.960 
going to split it open as such and I'm
gonna<00:04:17.940> push<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.389> rope<00:04:18.539> through<00:04:19.609> if<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.760> need

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
gonna push the rope through if you need

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.279 
gonna push the rope through if you need
to<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.359> got<00:04:21.510> your<00:04:21.630> pliers<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:22.049> pull<00:04:22.200> it

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
to you got your pliers to pull it

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.180 
to you got your pliers to pull it
through<00:04:22.530> if<00:04:22.919> not<00:04:23.190> great<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.830> you're<00:04:26.070> just

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
through if not great and you're just

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:34.520 
through if not great and you're just
gonna<00:04:26.310> tie<00:04:26.610> off<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:27.150> simple<00:04:28.020> square<00:04:28.349> knot

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
like such and now I'm going to pull that

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.440 
like such and now I'm going to pull that
said<00:04:38.310> not<00:04:38.960> right<00:04:39.960> back<00:04:40.170> through<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.500> sled<00:04:41.450> so

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
said not right back through the sled so

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.060 
said not right back through the sled so
now<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.660> have<00:04:43.020> your<00:04:43.050> rope<00:04:43.350> nice<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.800> anchored

now you have your rope nice and anchored

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.240 
now you have your rope nice and anchored
inside<00:04:45.170> you<00:04:46.170> measure<00:04:46.410> out<00:04:46.530> how<00:04:46.920> long<00:04:47.100> it's

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
inside you measure out how long it's

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.630 
inside you measure out how long it's
going<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.490> need<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.790> be<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:49.620> find<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.310> good<00:04:50.490> rule

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
going to need to be I find a good rule

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.000 
going to need to be I find a good rule
of<00:04:50.670> thumb<00:04:50.820> is<00:04:51.660> actually<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.530> measure<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:52.920> out

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
of thumb is actually to measure it out

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.060 
of thumb is actually to measure it out
from<00:04:53.460> my<00:04:53.610> chest<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.900> very<00:04:55.440> tip<00:04:55.740> of<00:04:55.890> my

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
from my chest to the very tip of my

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:04.070 
from my chest to the very tip of my
thumb<00:04:57.200> like<00:04:58.200> so<00:04:59.630> at<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.930> point<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:03.780> takes

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
thumb like so at that point it takes

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.670 
thumb like so at that point it takes
some<00:05:04.470> masking<00:05:05.040> tape<00:05:08.960> tape<00:05:09.960> it<00:05:10.080> off<00:05:10.200> so<00:05:10.590> it

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
some masking tape tape it off so it

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.700 
some masking tape tape it off so it
doesn't<00:05:10.740> fray<00:05:11.190> when<00:05:11.340> we<00:05:11.460> cut<00:05:11.640> it

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.269 

take<00:05:17.710> your<00:05:17.830> scissors<00:05:18.159> cut<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:20.860> right<00:05:21.009> down<00:05:21.069> the

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.279 
take your scissors cut it right down the

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:26.720 
take your scissors cut it right down the
middle

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.730 

and<00:05:27.500> take<00:05:28.500> your<00:05:28.650> lighter<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.840> melt<00:05:31.320> off<00:05:31.530> the

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
and take your lighter and melt off the

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.130 
and take your lighter and melt off the
end<00:05:32.060> it's<00:05:33.060> okay<00:05:33.330> if<00:05:33.390> a<00:05:33.450> little<00:05:33.600> bit<00:05:33.750> of<00:05:33.840> masking

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
end it's okay if a little bit of masking

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:41.480 
end it's okay if a little bit of masking
tape<00:05:34.200> burns

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.100 

just<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.150> melt<00:05:42.360> off<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.720> end<00:05:42.840> make<00:05:43.080> sure

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
just to melt off the end make sure

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.700 
just to melt off the end make sure
that's<00:05:43.620> nice<00:05:44.870> now<00:05:45.870> we're<00:05:45.960> gonna<00:05:46.080> try<00:05:46.289> it<00:05:46.349> take

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
that's nice now we're gonna try it take

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.939 
that's nice now we're gonna try it take
our<00:05:46.919> chair<00:05:47.160> tip<00:05:48.289> and<00:05:49.289> there<00:05:49.470> are<00:05:49.560> power<00:05:49.710> drill

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
our chair tip and there are power drill

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.150 
our chair tip and there are power drill
once<00:05:50.099> again<00:05:51.020> we're<00:05:52.020> going<00:05:52.319> to<00:05:52.410> try<00:05:52.949> and<00:05:53.009> get

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
once again we're going to try and get

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.029 
once again we're going to try and get
close<00:05:53.370> to<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.639> mill<00:05:53.789> as<00:05:53.940> possible<00:05:54.860> it<00:05:55.860> can

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
close to the mill as possible it can

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.600 
close to the mill as possible it can
help<00:05:56.190> to<00:05:56.280> do<00:05:56.460> this<00:05:56.550> with<00:05:56.699> a<00:05:56.759> dipole<00:06:01.610> either

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
help to do this with a dipole either

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:11.749 
help to do this with a dipole either
which<00:06:02.729> way<00:06:02.759> I<00:06:09.710> now<00:06:10.710> have<00:06:10.979> my<00:06:11.130> furniture<00:06:11.430> foot

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
which way I now have my furniture foot

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.879 
which way I now have my furniture foot
with<00:06:12.300> a<00:06:12.569> lovely<00:06:13.370> hole<00:06:14.370> in<00:06:14.550> the<00:06:14.639> middle<00:06:14.759> of<00:06:14.940> it

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
with a lovely hole in the middle of it

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.210 
with a lovely hole in the middle of it
so<00:06:16.940> I'm<00:06:17.940> going<00:06:18.180> to<00:06:18.389> take<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:18.990> other<00:06:19.110> end<00:06:19.199> of<00:06:19.590> my

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
so I'm going to take the other end of my

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.159 
so I'm going to take the other end of my
rope<00:06:20.639> poke<00:06:21.599> it<00:06:21.720> through<00:06:23.630> once<00:06:24.630> again<00:06:24.780> we're

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
rope poke it through once again we're

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.240 
rope poke it through once again we're
just<00:06:25.319> going<00:06:25.500> to<00:06:25.680> tie<00:06:25.830> off<00:06:25.979> a<00:06:26.009> simple<00:06:26.400> knot<00:06:26.720> and

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
just going to tie off a simple knot and

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.980 
just going to tie off a simple knot and
I<00:06:29.250> found<00:06:29.490> that<00:06:29.580> the<00:06:29.729> amount<00:06:30.000> of<00:06:30.240> rope<00:06:30.659> that<00:06:30.690> it

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
I found that the amount of rope that it

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.620 
I found that the amount of rope that it
takes<00:06:31.229> to<00:06:31.440> tie<00:06:31.620> this<00:06:31.680> knot<00:06:32.630> generally

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
takes to tie this knot generally

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.920 
takes to tie this knot generally
speaking<00:06:33.930> we're<00:06:34.500> set<00:06:34.770> should<00:06:34.949> be<00:06:35.069> just<00:06:35.400> enough

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
speaking we're set should be just enough

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.050 
speaking we're set should be just enough
so<00:06:36.930> that<00:06:36.990> when<00:06:37.199> you<00:06:37.289> pull<00:06:37.590> it<00:06:37.740> on<00:06:37.800> down<00:06:38.060> pull

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
so that when you pull it on down pull

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.659 
so that when you pull it on down pull
the<00:06:39.180> furniture<00:06:39.659> foot<00:06:39.900> over<00:06:40.259> it<00:06:40.520> it<00:06:41.520> now

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
the furniture foot over it it now

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.670 
the furniture foot over it it now
magically<00:06:42.120> lines<00:06:42.509> up<00:06:42.720> with<00:06:43.020> your<00:06:43.080> thumb<00:06:43.349> joint

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
magically lines up with your thumb joint

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.209 
magically lines up with your thumb joint
so<00:06:44.669> we<00:06:45.659> now<00:06:45.840> have<00:06:46.139> a<00:06:46.500> new<00:06:47.270> boy<00:06:48.770> we<00:06:49.770> have<00:06:49.949> a<00:06:50.039> new

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219 
so we now have a new boy we have a new

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:54.879 
so we now have a new boy we have a new
pair<00:06:50.520> of<00:06:50.849> boy<00:06:51.360> and<00:06:51.690> if<00:06:52.590> they're<00:06:53.219> not<00:06:53.250> right

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
pair of boy and if they're not right

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.100 
pair of boy and if they're not right
voila<00:06:55.889> they<00:06:56.580> should<00:06:56.849> be<00:06:57.060> roughly<00:06:57.690> the<00:06:57.930> same

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
voila they should be roughly the same

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:06.890 
voila they should be roughly the same
length<00:07:02.330> so<00:07:03.330> um<00:07:03.770> yeah<00:07:04.770> that<00:07:05.370> is<00:07:05.719> this<00:07:06.719> how<00:07:06.840> you

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
length so um yeah that is this how you

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.480 
length so um yeah that is this how you
build<00:07:07.169> my<00:07:07.259> point

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
build my point

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.860 
build my point
I<00:07:08.580> believe<00:07:09.949> Ronin<00:07:10.949> well<00:07:11.880> I<00:07:11.909> got<00:07:12.419> this<00:07:12.539> design

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
I believe Ronin well I got this design

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.649 
I believe Ronin well I got this design
from<00:07:13.229> watching<00:07:13.650> running<00:07:13.949> videos<00:07:14.280> but<00:07:14.729> I<00:07:15.240> don't

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:15.659 
from watching running videos but I don't

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:17.300 
from watching running videos but I don't
know<00:07:15.750> who<00:07:15.870> originally<00:07:16.169> came<00:07:16.440> up<00:07:16.500> with<00:07:16.830> it<00:07:16.979> it

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
know who originally came up with it it

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.589 
know who originally came up with it it
might<00:07:17.400> be<00:07:17.460> right<00:07:17.789> I<00:07:17.880> might<00:07:18.060> not<00:07:18.240> know<00:07:18.479> but<00:07:20.599> yeah

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 
might be right I might not know but yeah

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:25.040 
might be right I might not know but yeah
so<00:07:22.020> if<00:07:22.229> you<00:07:22.319> like<00:07:22.469> this<00:07:22.650> you<00:07:23.639> now<00:07:24.509> have

yourself I believe some people superglue
these<00:07:29.370> seams<00:07:29.639> back<00:07:29.909> up<00:07:30.120> I<00:07:30.360> prefer<00:07:31.169> to<00:07:31.229> leave

these seams back up I prefer to leave

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.770 
these seams back up I prefer to leave
them<00:07:31.560> open<00:07:31.710> in<00:07:32.159> case<00:07:32.400> there's<00:07:33.030> an<00:07:33.330> example

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780
