00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.840
 and if I walk 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.360
 but we are one more day and we are 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.760
 in a new game mode that I think that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.360
 I have not raised the truth is not a tdt 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.880
 run is a bou split that is like tnt run 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.919
 but with an arch in the blocks below 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.990
 they do not fall when you step on, but when 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.090
 you shoot you have to make others 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.079
 fall and try to be the last of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.999
 foot so start the game 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.999
 let's try to throw some 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.789
 one 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.739
 I do not know if in the end it fell that I think so 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.660
 host miguel you live and how cool are there two 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.039
 vips in the game that does not cool me because 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.510
 there are too many possibilities to lose and 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.110
 It does not hurt a hair the truth that I do not 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.110
 cool a hair 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:06.110
 or not 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.170
 it seems to us not because the double doubles 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.700
 income 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.189
 father madness 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.189
 there are ten mother players left 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.770
 step by step step by step 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.479
 step by step as you can see now there is a 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.380
 floor so you have to put up with the maximum 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.600
 possible time 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.700
 well the maximum possible time there is no 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.240
 to hold the whole game whole 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.020
 if you do not lose logically 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.020
 nine players 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.930
