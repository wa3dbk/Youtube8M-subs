alright this is how I tell you how to

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.810 
alright this is how I tell you how to
use<00:00:05.970> conversion<00:00:07.189> basically<00:00:08.189> sit<00:00:08.579> in<00:00:08.669> blood

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
use conversion basically sit in blood

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.569 
use conversion basically sit in blood
presence<00:00:09.209> and<00:00:10.070> you<00:00:11.070> just<00:00:11.190> go<00:00:11.339> through<00:00:11.490> your

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:11.579 
presence and you just go through your

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.279 
presence and you just go through your
basic<00:00:11.879> rotation<00:00:12.299> so<00:00:12.419> you<00:00:12.509> see<00:00:12.659> there<00:00:12.839> I<00:00:12.869> stun

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:13.289 
basic rotation so you see there I stun

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.919 
basic rotation so you see there I stun
them<00:00:13.469> like<00:00:13.619> put<00:00:13.769> dots<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.159> them<00:00:14.249> and<00:00:14.429> then<00:00:15.329> I<00:00:15.690> go

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
them like put dots on them and then I go

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.810 
them like put dots on them and then I go
through<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.529> festering<00:00:16.830> strikes<00:00:17.130> into<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
through to festering strikes into to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.589 
through to festering strikes into to
skirt<00:00:18.119> strikes<00:00:19.009> which<00:00:20.009> will<00:00:20.269> start<00:00:21.269> generate

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
skirt strikes which will start generate

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.999 
skirt strikes which will start generate
my<00:00:21.810> runic<00:00:22.050> power<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.470> then<00:00:22.589> you<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.830> hid

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
my runic power and then you just hid

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.279 
my runic power and then you just hid
conversion<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.699> then<00:00:24.539> conversion<00:00:25.019> starts

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
conversion and then conversion starts

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.540 
conversion and then conversion starts
healing<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.589> can<00:00:25.710> see<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.980> rolling<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.429> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
healing you can see it rolling up to the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.569 
healing you can see it rolling up to the
side<00:00:26.759> there<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.839> my<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.259> all<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.400> heels

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
runic power and how I manage this is how

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.599 
runic power and how I manage this is how
I<00:00:38.340> do<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.820> more<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.859> more<00:00:40.859> professional

death Knights can manage their the runic
power<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.559> conversion<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.579> their

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
power with conversion up with their

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270 
power with conversion up with their
death<00:00:48.180> quills<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> beginner<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.829> best

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
death quills but for a beginner is best

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
death quills but for a beginner is best

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.410 
just to avoid death coils all in general
because<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.550> never<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.120> put<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.390> a

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
to us all as you can see conversion fell

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.390 
to us all as you can see conversion fell

best definite but this is just to show
how<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.400> manage<00:01:20.940> conversion<00:01:21.480> even<00:01:22.380> though<00:01:22.440> I'm

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
how to manage conversion even though I'm

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.010 
how to manage conversion even though I'm
doing<00:01:22.800> it<00:01:22.920> poorly<00:01:23.480> but<00:01:24.480> you'd<00:01:24.660> see<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
doing it poorly but you'd see up a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.420 
doing it poorly but you'd see up a
conversion<00:01:25.380> back<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.920> me<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.160> healing

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
conversion back up on me I'm healing

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.130 
conversion back up on me I'm healing
myself<00:01:26.610> back<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.120> I'm<00:01:27.330> still<00:01:27.660> way<00:01:27.840> ahead<00:01:27.960> in

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
myself back up I'm still way ahead in

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.860 
myself back up I'm still way ahead in
the<00:01:28.230> fight<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> boom<00:01:28.890> I'll<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> kill<00:01:29.870> but

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
the fight and boom I'll and the kill but

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.190 
the fight and boom I'll and the kill but
he<00:01:31.770> put<00:01:32.010> about<00:01:33.290> maybe<00:01:34.290> two<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.490> my<00:01:35.700> health<00:01:35.910> bar

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
he put about maybe two of my health bar

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.600 
he put about maybe two of my health bar
like<00:01:37.200> worth<00:01:38.010> of<00:01:38.190> damaging<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.730> me<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:40.610> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
like worth of damaging to me so the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.370 
like worth of damaging to me so the
conversion<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.450> absolutely<00:01:42.690> ridiculous

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
conversion is just absolutely ridiculous

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.350 
conversion is just absolutely ridiculous
and<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.710> definitely<00:01:44.280> worth<00:01:44.610> taking<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and it's definitely worth taking and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.360 
and it's definitely worth taking and
that's<00:01:45.870> how<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.050> manage<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.650> just<00:01:46.860> completely

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
that's how I manage I just completely

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.130 
that's how I manage I just completely
avoid<00:01:47.910> death<00:01:48.180> coils<00:01:48.570> altogether<00:01:50.960> alright<00:01:51.960> so

to show up and it's unusable because I'd

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.860

think<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.299> actually<00:02:46.450> unimportant<00:02:47.080> because<00:02:47.140> I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
think is actually unimportant because I

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.460 
think is actually unimportant because I
have<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.650> turned<00:02:47.860> off<00:02:47.950> when<00:02:48.130> it's<00:02:48.280> unusable<00:02:49.470> so

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
have it turned off when it's unusable so

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.449 
have it turned off when it's unusable so
