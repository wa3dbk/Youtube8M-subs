00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
sunken-in screws that are gonna go on

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.639 
sunken-in screws that are gonna go on
each<00:01:58.189> end<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.909> then<00:01:59.359> we<00:01:59.509> have<00:01:59.719> these<00:01:59.899> cap<00:02:00.439> head

screws they're gonna go in the middle
one<00:02:02.810> thing<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:03.170> suggest<00:02:03.349> while<00:02:03.740> doing<00:02:04.039> this<00:02:04.189> is

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
one thing I suggest while doing this is

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.940 
one thing I suggest while doing this is
don't<00:02:05.119> unscrew<00:02:05.749> both<00:02:05.990> sides<00:02:06.289> of<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.740> chassis

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
don't unscrew both sides of the chassis

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.770 
don't unscrew both sides of the chassis
brace<00:02:07.340> at<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.669> same<00:02:07.849> time<00:02:08.149> otherwise<00:02:08.569> your

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
brace at the same time otherwise your

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.570 
brace at the same time otherwise your
transmissions<00:02:09.319> gonna<00:02:09.530> fall<00:02:09.770> down<00:02:09.979> then

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
transmissions gonna fall down then

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.830 
transmissions gonna fall down then
you're<00:02:10.700> gonna<00:02:10.789> have<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.000> hold<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.300> place<00:02:11.510> while

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
you're gonna have to hold in place while

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.800 
you're gonna have to hold in place while
screwing<00:02:12.200> into<00:02:12.500> new<00:02:12.709> braces<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:13.910> let's<00:02:14.630> go

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
screwing into new braces so let's go

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.330 
screwing into new braces so let's go
ahead<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.110> get<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.410> one<00:02:15.470> installed<00:02:16.040> and

then I'll take care of the other so
before<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.530> even<00:02:18.650> put<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> screws<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.549> want

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
before I even put the screws in I want

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.640 
before I even put the screws in I want
to<00:02:19.790> go<00:02:19.879> ahead<00:02:19.939> and<00:02:20.090> clarify

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
to go ahead and clarify

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.949 
to go ahead and clarify
they<00:02:20.799> give<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.549> get<00:02:21.760> eight<00:02:22.030> cap<00:02:22.689> head

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
they give you you get eight cap head

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.350 
they give you you get eight cap head
screws<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.680> are<00:02:23.950> 12<00:02:24.129> millimeters<00:02:24.640> 8<00:02:24.939> cap

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
screws that are 12 millimeters 8 cap

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.390 
screws that are 12 millimeters 8 cap
head<00:02:25.540> screws<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.110> are<00:02:26.170> 10<00:02:26.530> millimeters<00:02:27.159> and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
head screws that are 10 millimeters and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.429 
head screws that are 10 millimeters and
then<00:02:27.939> we<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.239> these<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.659> go<00:02:28.870> on<00:02:28.989> each<00:02:29.200> side

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
then we have these that go on each side

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.800 
then we have these that go on each side
of<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.650> brace<00:02:29.920> now<00:02:30.700> since<00:02:30.970> these<00:02:31.239> ones<00:02:31.599> are

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
of the brace now since these ones are

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.690 
of the brace now since these ones are
going<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.989> be<00:02:32.049> going<00:02:32.439> into<00:02:32.620> aluminum<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.459> do

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
going to be going into aluminum you do

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.280 
going to be going into aluminum you do
need<00:02:33.909> to<00:02:34.000> put<00:02:34.150> some<00:02:34.329> thread<00:02:34.569> Locker<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:34.989> them

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
need to put some thread Locker on them

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.050 
need to put some thread Locker on them
these<00:02:35.829> are<00:02:35.890> gonna<00:02:36.310> be<00:02:36.489> going<00:02:36.700> into<00:02:36.879> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
these are gonna be going into the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.610 
these are gonna be going into the
transmission<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.079> don't<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.470> worry

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
transmission so you don't have to worry

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.170 
transmission so you don't have to worry
about<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.950> thread<00:02:39.159> lock<00:02:39.340> or<00:02:39.519> with<00:02:39.640> these

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
about the thread lock or with these

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.569 
about the thread lock or with these
now<00:02:40.720> with<00:02:41.049> mighty<00:02:41.349> mags<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.099> turns<00:02:42.310> out<00:02:42.519> that

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
now with mighty mags it turns out that

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.490 
now with mighty mags it turns out that
the<00:02:42.849> screws<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.299> go<00:02:43.450> into<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.810> transmission

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
the screws that go into the transmission

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500 
the screws that go into the transmission
are<00:02:44.799> only<00:02:45.099> 10<00:02:45.280> millimeters<00:02:45.819> so<00:02:46.239> I'm<00:02:46.329> just

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
are only 10 millimeters so I'm just

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
are only 10 millimeters so I'm just
gonna<00:02:46.599> go<00:02:46.780> ahead<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:46.930> replace<00:02:47.140> them<00:02:47.409> with<00:02:47.439> a

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.860 
gonna go ahead and replace them with a
10<00:02:47.769> millimeter<00:02:48.099> screws<00:02:48.549> however<00:02:49.420> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
10 millimeter screws however the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.990 
10 millimeter screws however the
standard<00:02:50.140> nowadays<00:02:50.439> is<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> 12<00:02:51.400> millimeters

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000
