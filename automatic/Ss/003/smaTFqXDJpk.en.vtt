00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.380

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.059
 Equally states that all these murders 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.549
 so-called Russian wines 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.650

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.270
 a week 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:43.170
 what are the us doing to force cues 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.539
 stop these shots are honestly shocked 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 saying we get information from the place 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.370
 events and the vast majority of people 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 reports what exactly supported 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.170
 Russia separatists repair violence there 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.750
 trying to seize the building and attack with 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.820
 innocent civilians they don't have 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.489
 the right to do it in an independent country 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.220
 such as Ukraine village place in. and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.200
 on market consolidation led keychain with 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.000
 was stated that shelling kondrashov ki could 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.340
 be caused by a pilot error but the State Department 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.650
 the United States adamantly protects cues independently 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.520
 from what mistakes he makes number 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.439
 here are the places x 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.259
 you fireplaces the government of Ukraine 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.180
 defends his country and think has 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.970
 this is a complete right like international 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.680
 community but these people have the right to live 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.030
 don't you think levin think ukrainian 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.799
 people have the right to live in peace and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.900
 security without Russia supported 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.210
 separatists who attack their homes and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.850
 seize buildings we should not 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.610
 forget the reason for what is happening above 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.200
 ride last week another 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.360
 State Department spokesman Mari Harf 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.100
 questioned the accuracy of the report he 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.439
 about a sharp increase in the number of refugees 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.119
 coming from the east of Ukraine to Russia 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.070
 Harp suggested that these people 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.840
 went to visit her grandmothers she 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.670
 ignored numerous messages 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.890
 about horrors faced 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.930
 citizens of Ukraine and about the true reason 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.689
 why they leave the east of the country 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.670
 I asked today about this answer jen 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.709
 psaki was more restrained but common 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.209
 the impression is made like 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.290
 the state department is trying to downplay 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.879
 scale we 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.680
 and tare crisis in the east of Ukraine 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.680
