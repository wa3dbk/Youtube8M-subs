00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
honestly think these pictures up look a

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.920 
honestly think these pictures up look a
little<00:03:36.760> worse<00:03:37.030> than<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.480> is<00:03:37.720> but

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
little worse than it is but

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.679 
little worse than it is but
whatever<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.769> yes<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.010> was<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:41.700> skin<00:03:42.150> before

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
whatever so yes that was my skin before

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.229 
whatever so yes that was my skin before
using<00:03:43.409> this<00:03:43.680> PMD<00:03:44.219> for<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.640> two<00:03:44.879> to<00:03:45.060> three

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
using this PMD for the two to three

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.420 
using this PMD for the two to three
months<00:03:45.390> I've<00:03:45.599> been<00:03:45.629> using<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.140> now<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:47.370> will

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
months I've been using it now and I will

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.089 
months I've been using it now and I will
include<00:03:47.849> a<00:03:48.090> clip<00:03:48.329> of<00:03:48.450> how<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:49.109> use<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.799> device

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
include a clip of how I use the device

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.089 
include a clip of how I use the device
and<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.730> can<00:03:50.879> see<00:03:51.090> me<00:03:51.269> without<00:03:51.420> any<00:03:51.780> makeup

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
and you can see me without any makeup

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.140 
and you can see me without any makeup
unfortunately<00:03:53.099> I<00:03:53.129> film<00:03:53.549> this<00:03:53.579> why<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.909> sun

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
unfortunately I film this why the sun

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.789 
unfortunately I film this why the sun
was<00:03:54.269> setting<00:03:54.329> so<00:03:54.810> it's<00:03:55.049> not<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.290> brightest

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
was setting so it's not the brightest

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.800 
was setting so it's not the brightest
clip<00:03:56.040> but<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.549> can<00:03:56.760> definitely<00:03:56.909> see<00:03:57.389> I

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
clip but you can definitely see I

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.110 
clip but you can definitely see I
actually<00:03:58.590> prefer<00:03:59.040> using<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.519> larger<00:03:59.909> disk

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
actually prefer using the larger disk

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.789 
actually prefer using the larger disk
which<00:04:00.359> I'm<00:04:00.510> using<00:04:00.719> in<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.049> cliff<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:01.560> I

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
which I'm using in the cliff because I

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.709 
which I'm using in the cliff because I

this<00:04:06.329> big<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.689> just<00:04:06.840> takes<00:04:07.019> forever<00:04:07.139> to<00:04:07.409> use<00:04:07.620> I

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
so much my face still isn't perfect

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.240 
so much my face still isn't perfect
because<00:04:39.060> i<00:04:39.120> still<00:04:39.449> break<00:04:39.810> out<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:41.039> can

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
because i still break out so it can

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.610 
because i still break out so it can
treat<00:04:41.460> my<00:04:41.550> scars<00:04:41.849> and<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.810> have<00:04:42.960> new<00:04:43.110> ones<00:04:43.139> from

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
on breaking the breakout cycle it has

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.610 
on breaking the breakout cycle it has
gotten<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.419> lot<00:04:48.539> better<00:04:48.780> as<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.139> can<00:04:49.289> see<00:04:49.500> might

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
gotten a lot better as you can see might

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.860 
gotten a lot better as you can see might
see<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:49.800> doesn't<00:04:49.979> look<00:04:50.159> too<00:04:50.370> bad<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:51.000> lot<00:04:51.840> of

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
see it doesn't look too bad a lot of

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.110 
see it doesn't look too bad a lot of
juicing<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.560> lot<00:04:52.740> of<00:04:52.830> water<00:04:53.010> a<00:04:53.159> lot<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.610> tea<00:04:53.820> have

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
juicing a lot of water a lot of tea have

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.939 
juicing a lot of water a lot of tea have
all<00:04:54.389> helped<00:04:54.750> with<00:04:54.930> breaking<00:04:55.409> the<00:04:55.530> breakout

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
all helped with breaking the breakout

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.909 
all helped with breaking the breakout
cycle<00:04:56.400> in<00:04:56.610> addition<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.419> PMD<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:58.020> also<00:04:58.289> do<00:04:58.889> a

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
cycle in addition to the PMD I also do a

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.640 
cycle in addition to the PMD I also do a
honey<00:04:59.490> treatment<00:05:00.000> some<00:05:00.270> mornings<00:05:00.539> if<00:05:01.440> I've

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
honey treatment some mornings if I've

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.339 
honey treatment some mornings if I've
done<00:05:01.860> like<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.070> really<00:05:02.280> deep<00:05:02.639> clean<00:05:03.120> or<00:05:03.510> a<00:05:03.990> clay

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
done like a really deep clean or a clay

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.830 
done like a really deep clean or a clay
mask<00:05:04.590> or<00:05:05.010> something<00:05:05.120> really<00:05:06.120> drying<00:05:06.539> to<00:05:06.750> my

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
mask or something really drying to my

mask or something really drying to my
skin<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.229> next<00:05:07.409> morning<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.770> might<00:05:07.889> feel<00:05:08.070> a

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
skin the next morning it might feel a

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.800 
skin the next morning it might feel a
