if there is only one accessory with this

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.780 
if there is only one accessory with this
figure<00:03:49.670> why<00:03:50.120> not<00:03:50.150> use<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:51.490> guess<00:03:52.490> I'll<00:03:52.640> do

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
figure why not use it I guess I'll do

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.670 
figure why not use it I guess I'll do
some<00:03:53.000> more<00:03:53.030> close-ups<00:03:56.890> little<00:03:57.890> fence<00:03:58.100> service

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
some more close-ups little fence service

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:21.520 
some more close-ups little fence service
looks<00:04:00.680> very<00:04:00.920> good<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:08.260> our<00:04:09.260> backside

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.920 

probably<00:04:22.530> my<00:04:22.740> only<00:04:22.949> only<00:04:23.490> complaint<00:04:24.120> about

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
probably my only only complaint about

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.659 
probably my only only complaint about
this<00:04:25.319> figure<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:26.509> if<00:04:27.509> you<00:04:27.719> look<00:04:27.930> from<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.169> side

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
this figure is if you look from the side

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.610 
this figure is if you look from the side
you'll<00:04:29.669> notice<00:04:29.939> that<00:04:30.360> she's<00:04:30.659> a<00:04:30.689> little<00:04:30.960> flat

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
you'll notice that she's a little flat

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.249 
you'll notice that she's a little flat
over<00:04:32.069> there<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:33.090> yeah<00:04:33.659> that<00:04:33.900> could<00:04:34.080> have<00:04:34.169> been

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
over there so yeah that could have been

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.159 
over there so yeah that could have been
better<00:04:34.439> she<00:04:34.710> looks<00:04:34.740> like<00:04:35.009> a<00:04:35.039> surfboard<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:35.789> I

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
better she looks like a surfboard but I

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.890 
better she looks like a surfboard but I
guess<00:04:37.169> these<00:04:37.379> make<00:04:37.740> up<00:04:37.770> for<00:04:38.129> it<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:39.360> yeah<00:04:39.599> all<00:04:39.870> I

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
guess these make up for it so yeah all I

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.240 
guess these make up for it so yeah all I
know<00:04:40.139> very<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:42.090> very<00:04:42.719> good<00:04:42.930> figure<00:04:43.139> very<00:04:44.039> good

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
know very a very good figure very good

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.869 
know very a very good figure very good
representation<00:04:44.639> of<00:04:45.120> Robyn<00:04:45.509> and<00:04:46.699> as<00:04:47.699> I

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
representation of Robyn and as I

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.040 
representation of Robyn and as I
mentioned<00:04:48.210> before<00:04:48.449> it<00:04:48.539> might<00:04:48.719> be<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.900> little

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
mentioned before it might be a little

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.550 
mentioned before it might be a little
expensive<00:04:49.409> so<00:04:49.740> if<00:04:50.099> you<00:04:50.219> can<00:04:50.400> backtrack<00:04:50.909> this

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
expensive so if you can backtrack this

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.589 
expensive so if you can backtrack this
go<00:04:52.560> for<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.830> but<00:04:53.069> try<00:04:53.490> not<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.699> overpay<00:04:54.240> because

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
go for it but try not to overpay because

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.769 
go for it but try not to overpay because
they<00:04:54.930> will<00:04:55.349> ask<00:04:55.500> some<00:04:56.120> ridiculous<00:04:57.120> prices<00:04:57.360> for

00:04:57.769 --> 00:04:57.779 
they will ask some ridiculous prices for

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.170 
they will ask some ridiculous prices for
all<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.319> figures<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:58.949> yeah<00:04:59.639> keep<00:04:59.879> that<00:05:00.060> in

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
all the figures so yeah keep that in

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.550 
all the figures so yeah keep that in
mind<00:05:00.389> I<00:05:00.830> rate<00:05:01.830> this<00:05:02.069> a<00:05:02.449> 9<00:05:03.449> out<00:05:03.629> of<00:05:03.689> 10<00:05:03.960> it's<00:05:04.259> very

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
mind I rate this a 9 out of 10 it's very

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.640 
mind I rate this a 9 out of 10 it's very
good<00:05:04.889> and<00:05:05.629> although<00:05:06.629> the<00:05:06.990> pose<00:05:07.169> is<00:05:07.379> a<00:05:07.409> little

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
good and although the pose is a little

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.769 
good and although the pose is a little
bit<00:05:07.770> boring<00:05:08.009> but<00:05:08.310> it's<00:05:08.849> an<00:05:09.000> older<00:05:09.210> figure<00:05:09.539> they

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
bit boring but it's an older figure they

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:13.670 
bit boring but it's an older figure they
don't<00:05:09.990> really<00:05:10.379> have<00:05:10.620> much<00:05:11.719> poseability<00:05:12.719> but

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
don't really have much poseability but

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.610 
don't really have much poseability but
yeah<00:05:14.219> the<00:05:14.550> good<00:05:14.639> figure<00:05:15.199> rate<00:05:16.199> comment
