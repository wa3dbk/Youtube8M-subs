real<00:01:07.340> out<00:01:07.700> here<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.930> e<00:01:08.960> 5<00:01:09.229> +<00:01:09.380> e<00:01:09.440> 7<00:01:09.799> were

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
real out here the e 5 + e 7 were

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.529 
real out here the e 5 + e 7 were
completely<00:01:10.250> redesigned<00:01:10.789> from<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.030> ground<00:01:11.149> up

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
completely redesigned from the ground up

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.510 
completely redesigned from the ground up
have<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.080> brand<00:01:12.380> new<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.770> form<00:01:12.979> factor<00:01:13.369> and

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
have a brand new of form factor and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.609 
have a brand new of form factor and
actually<00:01:14.210> much<00:01:14.390> more<00:01:14.509> ergonomic<00:01:15.110> much<00:01:15.350> easier

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
actually much more ergonomic much easier

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.920 
actually much more ergonomic much easier
to<00:01:15.740> Palm<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.759> finally<00:01:17.210> we<00:01:17.299> have<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.450> lightweight

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
to Palm so finally we have a lightweight

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.570 
to Palm so finally we have a lightweight
real<00:01:18.140> one<00:01:18.770> with<00:01:18.920> power<00:01:19.130> all<00:01:19.549> with<00:01:19.789> one<00:01:19.970> package

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
real one with power all with one package

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.219 
real one with power all with one package
that<00:01:22.580> we<00:01:22.670> fished<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.060> Corrado<00:01:23.360> e<00:01:23.479> we<00:01:23.929> actually

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
that we fished the Corrado e we actually

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.570 
that we fished the Corrado e we actually
like<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:24.500> rule<00:01:24.740> quite<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.009> bit<00:01:25.190> better<00:01:25.340> than

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
like this rule quite a bit better than

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.940 
like this rule quite a bit better than
the<00:01:25.700> old<00:01:25.850> B<00:01:25.970> version<00:01:26.319> much<00:01:27.319> better<00:01:27.560> -<00:01:27.740> palm

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
the old B version much better - palm

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.730 
the old B version much better - palm
much<00:01:28.940> smoother<00:01:29.390> actually<00:01:30.020> cast<00:01:30.259> better<00:01:30.530> as

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
much smoother actually cast better as

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.149 
much smoother actually cast better as
well

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
well

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.999 
well
the<00:01:31.759> Corrado<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.179> 7<00:01:32.569> overall<00:01:33.259> is<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.470> very<00:01:33.800> very

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
the Corrado a 7 overall is a very very

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.010 
the Corrado a 7 overall is a very very
nice<00:01:34.220> real<00:01:34.490> but<00:01:35.000> what<00:01:35.149> really<00:01:35.300> surprised<00:01:35.780> us

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
nice real but what really surprised us

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.380 
nice real but what really surprised us
for<00:01:36.229> $60<00:01:36.770> left<00:01:37.009> with<00:01:37.429> how<00:01:37.580> good<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.940> acidic<00:01:38.240> it

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
for $60 left with how good the acidic it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.270 
for $60 left with how good the acidic it
really<00:01:38.630> was<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.740> sit<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.009> ke

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
really was the sit of ke

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.630 
really was the sit of ke
offers<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:40.880> same<00:01:41.090> form<00:01:41.420> factor<00:01:41.840> as<00:01:42.020> the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
offers the same form factor as the

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.899 
offers the same form factor as the
Corrado

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
Corrado

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.630 
Corrado
but<00:01:44.509> with<00:01:44.690> $60<00:01:45.229> less<00:01:45.440> it's<00:01:45.979> actually<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.429> very

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
but with $60 less it's actually a very

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.490 
but with $60 less it's actually a very
very<00:01:46.970> good<00:01:47.119> value<00:01:47.330> so<00:01:48.049> some<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.350> main

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
very good value so some of the main

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.139 
very good value so some of the main
differences<00:01:49.009> are<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:49.610> can<00:01:49.759> notice<00:01:50.000> right

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
differences are you can notice right

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.910 
differences are you can notice right
away<00:01:50.209> at<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.569> knobs<00:01:50.780> if<00:01:51.319> you<00:01:51.470> like<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> power

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
away at the knobs if you like the power

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.100 
away at the knobs if you like the power
knobs<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.880> larger<00:01:53.179> knobs<00:01:53.360> Kel<00:01:53.690> actually<00:01:53.960> like

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
knobs the larger knobs Kel actually like

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.200 
knobs the larger knobs Kel actually like
these<00:01:54.320> for<00:01:54.469> tossing<00:01:54.799> swim<00:01:55.159> bait<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.969> you<00:01:56.060> have

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
these for tossing swim bait and you have

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.209 
these for tossing swim bait and you have
to<00:01:56.299> go<00:01:56.420> with<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.600> Corrado<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.860> other<00:01:57.979> main

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
to go with the Corrado the other main

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.560 
to go with the Corrado the other main
difference<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.640> we've<00:01:58.820> really<00:01:59.060> seen<00:01:59.299> is<00:01:59.360> not

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
difference that we've really seen is not
