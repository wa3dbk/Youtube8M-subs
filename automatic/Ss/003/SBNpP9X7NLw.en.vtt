00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
section that they weren't playing right

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.340 
section that they weren't playing right
on<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.310> beach<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.300> was<00:03:23.450> like<00:03:23.630> phrasing

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
on the beach and it was like phrasing

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:59.619 
on the beach and it was like phrasing
over<00:03:24.650> top<00:03:24.890> woohoo<00:03:25.700> bubblers<00:03:26.090> at<00:03:28.090> 17

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.720 

but<00:04:00.629> now<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.470> kind<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.950> thing<00:04:02.159> that<00:04:02.430> I

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
but now this is the kind of thing that I

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.759 
but now this is the kind of thing that I
think<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:03.150> truly<00:04:03.659> can<00:04:03.840> only<00:04:04.019> be<00:04:04.260> developed<00:04:04.680> and

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
think is truly can only be developed and

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.500 
think is truly can only be developed and
practicing<00:04:05.220> with<00:04:05.370> records<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.909> don't<00:04:06.180> think

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
practicing with records I don't think

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.970 
practicing with records I don't think
that<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.840> can<00:04:06.870> teach<00:04:07.230> them<00:04:07.260> when<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.620> music

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
that you can teach them when the music

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.649 
that you can teach them when the music
