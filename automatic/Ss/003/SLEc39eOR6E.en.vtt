 actor mimoun is a dire 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.429
 prankster it seems like the only one 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.410
 what he does and jokes a bit 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.750

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.750

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.130
 in first show ever not mother until the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.230
 laugh last week he took a risk 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.240
 to show its sensitive side 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.240
 and that worked out surprisingly well 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.290
 yes i thought it was very nice that you like him 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.970

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.260
 smile on the ice on the ice is really true 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.400
 I was enjoying myself 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.739
 yes it is high anyway 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.730
 cuddly patricia 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.460
 still going out to dinner 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.260
 maurice is the only one that criticizes this 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.629
 cure of man slowly going 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.970
 a snail also reached the ark of noah 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.220
 by holding on and this snail goes 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.350
 always better because only 5 weeks 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.430
 Lime stood out for the first time since 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.710
 his life on skates 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.839
 is getting better fear on the ice 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.480
 He has overcome the old funny 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.800
 who moon is back from the only moments 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.540
 that i have no for just how i like 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.340
 I'm going backwards 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.200
 this week , mimoun puts everything on top 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.900
 he wants to entertain but also skate 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.039
 and that combination is sweating for this 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.210
 making jokes 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.210
 normally i never have laps 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.650
 yes you have to get the book from further 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.500
 things with cool names let us talk 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.590
 when was it that you know them 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.590
 to do 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.159
 nice wza this is of course a lot 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.450
 well i just wanted to say that 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.920
 you this seat 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.079
 thus which have not really begun 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.420
 need more you are so incredibly 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:32.540
 enthusiastic and we love you so much 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:34.879
 we have just said I had been 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.650
 still working on my laces and I have them 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.849
 not too tight 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.200
 but the joke was just this afternoon 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.639
 such a nice color and you always became 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.620
 whiter during direct 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:46.189
 I think what happens you gave everything 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.659
 really everything i have known color look 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.569
 and here you drop on your moroccan 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.819
 asterisks out here but it doesn't matter 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.659
 and that is how I want you to stand 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.760
 you think 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.049
 yes what are we going to do you grab him again 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.400
 on 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.349
 you always have to make a show of it 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:06.650
 things don't go so well so well 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.329
 hey yeah it just didn't taste good 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.919
 but I'm jealous of that anyway 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.959
 it's about her but I'm not talking about it 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.409
 it removes the seat for a moment or we add to it 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.530
 to hold 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:20.810
 oh ok ok ok well you think it will be one 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.180
 whole circus broken 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.169
 I will just go to the jury Johnny had 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.300
 for you from this act 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.550
 yes entertainer it was sure you got it 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.259
 have taken risks because before you 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.970
 belly started with the cure were you really 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.310
 yourself it had on the audience pepe 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.860
 Dab and you start now really started before 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.240
 the full 1000% started it and therefore 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.820
 there came plenty of you 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.680
 yes on the ice but it came purely because you 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.599
 was so enthusiastic and wanted so much 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.250
 and yes there I have a lot there 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.710
 respect them in particular 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.659
 yes see the image still forming that your own 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.270
 for the first time with the tough ijssel ass 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.099
 and the yes helmet on knee protection 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.320
 elbows screen and now this late 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.849
 see and skate backwards that is 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.259
 very difficult what on none with what you 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.479
 skate backwards and you need this 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.310
 turn around and it's da and that's one 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.120
 very annoying fitting good 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.050

 certainly know as biesbrouck and there is also 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.870
 purely on energy this one 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.490

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.530
