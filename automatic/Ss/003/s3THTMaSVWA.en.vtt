00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.630
 Now let's talk about 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.490
 timbales if you watch the timbales as 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.370
 which is another story even though they are 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.700
 very similar to that they have the ironwork 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.610
 which serves to refine the leather let me you 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.150
 I show quickly 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.310
 in this case these timbales are from a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.830
 material called bronze 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.180
 and so the different ones 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.920
 different manufacturers have it 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.739
 different materials including also 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.760
 there are of bronze metal 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.239
 different actions of the same is not 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.820
 drum 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.129
 if you notice you have a special attachment 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.870
 to put in the hills 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.720
 enclosures there are different sizes too 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.070
 of different models of different 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.010
 metal shares and therefore 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.870
 different sounds and both the confinements 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.799
 how timpani are embedded by 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.960
 say it one way or are you this 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.290
 adjusted or placed on a stent that 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.619
 allows me to upload them and have them at 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.970
 right size this if you look like 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.369
 he commented they have the hardware that 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.830
 allows you to press to adjust 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.659
 refine the hides in this case are 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.460
 synthetic leathers 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.560
 and they are definitely the ones I prefer 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.539
 there are different sizes of timbales there 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.130
 from 10 inches 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.789
 there are even about 8 inches 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.039
 they are very small mini timbal and cough and so 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.740
 goes up to even up to 18 inches that 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.679
 they are the sounders of timbales no 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.869
 well let's talk about a little bit of 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.899
 the position that is something much more uma 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.630
 extremely important I consider that the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.439
 The drum position must be in conformity with the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.450
 timbalero feels more comfortable 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.299
 definitely but I think the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.459
 correct position is like the height of 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.340
 the waist a little lower because a 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.939
 the time that had to do with the timbal 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.939
 you must make the most of 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.840
 the degree that you have the arm 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.880
 in this way not in this case the timbal 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.500
 is doing the performer is 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.550
 doing this on the timbal and I 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.190
 I think it's how you better go 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.090
 take advantage if you have it below 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.160
 just the stick will hit more 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.530
 down and you can break the drumstick you can 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.850
 break the timbal leather or if it is 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.490
 above , you will not take advantage of it 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.370
 neither then in broad strokes these 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.370
 are the characteristics of the timbal
