the<00:02:16.460> ground<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.790> they<00:02:16.910> were<00:02:16.970> all<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.720> baby

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
the ground and they were all so baby

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.870 
the ground and they were all so baby
human<00:02:18.560> babies<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.950> assume<00:02:19.250> have<00:02:19.490> some<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.850> that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
human babies I assume have some of that

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.170 
human babies I assume have some of that
not<00:02:20.840> giraffe<00:02:21.200> DNA<00:02:21.770> but<00:02:22.070> definitely<00:02:22.670> some<00:02:22.940> kind

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
not giraffe DNA but definitely some kind

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.060 
not giraffe DNA but definitely some kind
of<00:02:23.240> survival<00:02:23.660> mechanism<00:02:24.500> where<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:24.860> your

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
of survival mechanism where like your

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.800 
of survival mechanism where like your
the<00:02:25.490> plates<00:02:25.760> on<00:02:25.940> your<00:02:26.060> head<00:02:26.240> haven't<00:02:26.690> grown

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
the plates on your head haven't grown

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.240 
the plates on your head haven't grown
together<00:02:27.200> your<00:02:27.410> bones<00:02:27.590> are<00:02:27.830> soft<00:02:28.010> because

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
together your bones are soft because

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.620 
together your bones are soft because
they<00:02:28.430> know<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.640> can't<00:02:29.000> really<00:02:29.270> figured<00:02:29.570> out

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
they know you can't really figured out

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.570 
they know you can't really figured out
the<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:30.260> know<00:02:30.320> that's<00:02:30.440> evolutionarily<00:02:31.280> our

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
the you know that's evolutionarily our

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.160 
the you know that's evolutionarily our
bones<00:02:31.820> are<00:02:32.000> softer<00:02:32.390> wood<00:02:32.540> were<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
bones are softer wood were you the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.030 
bones are softer wood were you the
minion<00:02:33.590> toy<00:02:33.770> really<00:02:34.280> break<00:02:34.490> or<00:02:34.670> follow<00:02:39.040> we'll

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
minion toy really break or follow we'll

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.370 
minion toy really break or follow we'll
never<00:02:40.280> know<00:02:40.580> but<00:02:41.030> I'm<00:02:41.180> sure<00:02:41.480> science<00:02:42.200> will

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
never know but I'm sure science will

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.500 
never know but I'm sure science will
recreate<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:43.010> somehow<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.120> future<00:02:44.480> I

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
recreate it somehow in the future I

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.300 
recreate it somehow in the future I
think<00:02:44.780> we<00:02:44.900> can<00:02:45.050> do<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.230> any<00:02:45.560> fouls

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
think we can do it any fouls
