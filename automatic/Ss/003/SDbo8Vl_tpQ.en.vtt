currently retails for 10 pounds and is
an<00:00:20.310> awesome<00:00:20.880> set<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:21.960> were<00:00:22.020> four

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
an awesome set so there were four

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.660 
an awesome set so there were four
figures<00:00:22.439> included<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.130> set<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.550> we'll

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
figures included in the set and we'll

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.519 
figures included in the set and we'll
start<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.090> two<00:00:24.330> brutes<00:00:24.720> there<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
start with the two brutes there is a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.700 
start with the two brutes there is a
standard<00:00:25.920> brute<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:27.539> cobalt<00:00:28.140> jump<00:00:28.500> pack

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
standard brute and a cobalt jump pack

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.679 
standard brute and a cobalt jump pack
brute<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> matching<00:00:29.580> cobalt<00:00:30.179> jump<00:00:30.480> pack

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
brute with a matching cobalt jump pack

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.069 
brute with a matching cobalt jump pack
now<00:00:31.320> these<00:00:31.500> two<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.550> confused<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
now these two can be confused with the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.830 
now these two can be confused with the
old<00:00:34.410> jump<00:00:35.100> pack<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.610> standard<00:00:36.239> brute<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.690> we

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
old jump pack and standard brute that we

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.920 
old jump pack and standard brute that we
have<00:00:36.960> seen<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.559> standard<00:00:38.399> blue<00:00:38.670> color<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
have seen in standard blue color and I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.060 
have seen in standard blue color and I
thought<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.379> first<00:00:40.410> when<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> saw<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
thought that at first when I saw the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
thought that at first when I saw the
original<00:00:41.550> design<00:00:42.059> concepts<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.260> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
original design concepts but when you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.529 
original design concepts but when you
compare<00:00:43.559> them<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> old<00:00:44.399> figures<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.510> can

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
compare them to the old figures you can

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.240 
compare them to the old figures you can
see<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.020> are<00:00:46.170> completely<00:00:46.469> different<00:00:46.950> colors

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
see they are completely different colors

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.700 
see they are completely different colors
here<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> cobalt<00:00:48.750> combat<00:00:49.200> unit<00:00:49.469> brute

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
here is the cobalt combat unit brute

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.520 
here is the cobalt combat unit brute
compared<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.969> old<00:00:51.390> brute<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.320> can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
compared with the old brute now you can

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.229 
compared with the old brute now you can
see<00:00:52.770> they<00:00:52.920> are<00:00:52.949> completely<00:00:53.760> different<00:00:54.120> in

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
see they are completely different in

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.590 
see they are completely different in
many<00:00:54.570> different<00:00:54.960> ways<00:00:55.370> first<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.090> new

compared to a brown old ammo pack and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.789 
compared to a brown old ammo pack and
the<00:01:02.399> color<00:01:03.180> blue<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.510> completely<00:01:04.379> different

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the color blue is completely different
