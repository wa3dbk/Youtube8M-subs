00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.450
 champion to everyone that leads 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.250

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.450
 difference of this mark to that of the 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.579

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.030

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.580
 face regarding this woman to the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.520
 Australian each one concentrates as 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.040

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.920
 the medals are distributed 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.610
 we respect more the silence we 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.160
 curious starts the test has run 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.440
 very good the tacos in the adriana rolling 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.760
 let's go out are and bread and porter you're going 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.740
 to look for is going back to the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.240
 American attention to the young girl 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.010
 it is bright that can be champion 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.640
 of the world and will effectively do it 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.700
 with 12 44 champion title for the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:33.110
 winner of usa to open it rollins 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:37.260
 that has beaten the favorite and I think that 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.080
 is the best global brand of the year 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.290
 It was confirmed that fit has 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.410
 beaten the athlete with the most laureate of 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.140
 the final but it has been a great end of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.569
 anyway I always stressed when a 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.780
 athlete has 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.569
 look, it has arrived 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.459
 world champion and also the 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.170
 young girl who has been able to with the pressure 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.780
 when an athlete is so young that he has 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.510
 as a favorite it is very difficult it is very 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.940
 difficult to manage that situation has not 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.310
 perfectly managed has been 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.540
 superior from the first moment has not 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.770
 had none 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.200
 and the impression that he could 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.739
 be beaten by the others and has been 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.510
 one final printed hour is 1244 champion 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.190
 of the world opened to rolling 1250 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.380
 equaled the sally semifinal mark 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.200
 pearson for silver outfit and porter 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.440
 get the bronze medal with 12 55 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.230
 so harbert that stays out of the podium 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.060
 the girl takes and look at the exit 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.980
 has been much 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.830
 and from here it has started to 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.260
 progress from a great exit porter and 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.970
 of personnel 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.250
 we have the moment when he put 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.460
 first to get the victory 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.380
 fourth harper 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.449
 third contribution is to save a time of 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.919
 rollins reaction is the worst long 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.030
 of all the finalists and still he has 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.280
 given to get the victory the 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.270
 world champion a great future for 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.270

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.599
 with 100 meters hurdles 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.770

 university champion this year in the 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.360

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:29.580
 Olympic trailers of 2012 when not
