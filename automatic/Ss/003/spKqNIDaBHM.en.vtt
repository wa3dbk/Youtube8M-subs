you're<00:01:06.750> aiming<00:01:07.049> down<00:01:07.200> sights<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.909> just

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
you're aiming down sights but from just

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
you're aiming down sights but from just
experience<00:01:09.960> playing<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.590> gun<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.979> feel

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
experience playing with this gun I feel

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.149 
experience playing with this gun I feel
like<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.790> aim<00:01:11.970> down<00:01:12.000> sights<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.960> um

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
like when you aim down sights with it um

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.010 
like when you aim down sights with it um
you<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> hit<00:01:15.420> markers<00:01:15.780> more

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
you know you get the hit markers more

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.130 
you know you get the hit markers more
you<00:01:16.259> get<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> kills<00:01:16.799> better<00:01:17.130> um<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.390> instead

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you get the kills better um so instead

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
you get the kills better um so instead
of<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.560> off<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.460> pure

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
of just going off with just pure

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240 
of just going off with just pure
knowledge<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.600> experience<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.530> decided<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
knowledge and experience I decided to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
knowledge and experience I decided to
actually<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.640> test<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.479> see<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
actually go test it out and see if that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
actually go test it out and see if that
actually<00:01:25.439> happened<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.030> actually

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
actually happened and if it actually

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.060 
actually happened and if it actually
worked<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.720> we're<00:01:28.200> about<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.470> get<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.009> in

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
worked so we're about to get in here in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.460 
worked so we're about to get in here in
a<00:01:29.130> second<00:01:29.549> after<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.329> more<00:01:30.509> clip<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.140> think

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
a second after one more clip and I think

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
a second after one more clip and I think
I<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.560> pretty<00:01:31.650> good<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.970> want

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I do pretty good right here if you want

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.149 
I do pretty good right here if you want

them slower flashing them giving you the
jump<00:04:27.880> on<00:04:28.030> them<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.449> definitely<00:04:29.289> key<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:29.830> quick

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
jump on them is definitely key so quick

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.550 
jump on them is definitely key so quick
draw<00:04:30.280> helps<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.729> do<00:04:30.849> that<00:04:31.050> I'm<00:04:32.050> steady<00:04:32.320> aim

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
draw helps you to do that I'm steady aim

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.370 
draw helps you to do that I'm steady aim
i<00:04:32.740> use<00:04:32.889> that<00:04:33.070> too<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:34.570> reason<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:34.930> use<00:04:34.960> this

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
i use that too and the reason I use this

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.230 
i use that too and the reason I use this
is<00:04:35.650> not<00:04:35.860> because<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.280> hip<00:04:36.550> firing<00:04:36.820> which<00:04:37.120> it

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
is not because a hip firing which it

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.430 
is not because a hip firing which it
also<00:04:37.539> helps<00:04:37.810> with<00:04:37.840> if<00:04:38.080> you're<00:04:38.260> in<00:04:38.410> that

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
also helps with if you're in that

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.520 
also helps with if you're in that
situation<00:04:38.910> but<00:04:39.910> also<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.660> helps<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:41.110> bring<00:04:41.349> up

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
situation but also it helps you bring up

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.529 
situation but also it helps you bring up
your<00:04:41.680> gun<00:04:41.949> faster<00:04:42.430> after<00:04:42.580> sprinting<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:43.300> like

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539

the<00:05:18.400> shotgun<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:19.120> i<00:05:19.479> hope<00:05:19.570> that<00:05:19.630> is<00:05:19.930> somehow

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
the shotgun and i hope that is somehow

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.930 
the shotgun and i hope that is somehow
he<00:05:20.320> could<00:05:20.530> see<00:05:20.710> this<00:05:20.860> which<00:05:21.190> would<00:05:21.430> be<00:05:21.580> kind<00:05:21.880> of

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
he could see this which would be kind of

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.020 
he could see this which would be kind of
awesome<00:05:22.120> um<00:05:22.889> he<00:05:23.889> uh<00:05:23.919> maybe<00:05:24.610> he<00:05:24.760> could<00:05:24.880> learn<00:05:24.969> a

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
awesome um he uh maybe he could learn a

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.459 
awesome um he uh maybe he could learn a
little<00:05:25.300> bit<00:05:25.389> too<00:05:25.630> i'm<00:05:25.810> not<00:05:25.960> saying<00:05:26.229> he's<00:05:26.440> a

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
little bit too i'm not saying he's a

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:27.999 
little bit too i'm not saying he's a
great<00:05:26.740> player<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.159> everything<00:05:27.490> i'm<00:05:27.610> not

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
great player and everything i'm not

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.739 
great player and everything i'm not
anything<00:05:28.430> wrong<00:05:28.550> about<00:05:28.819> them<00:05:28.999> but<00:05:29.419> i<00:05:29.479> just

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:29.749 
anything wrong about them but i just

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:31.450 
anything wrong about them but i just
think<00:05:29.930> this<00:05:30.020> class<00:05:30.259> setup<00:05:30.650> is<00:05:30.830> better<00:05:31.069> for

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
think this class setup is better for

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.119 
think this class setup is better for
better<00:05:31.969> suited<00:05:32.300> for<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.719> shotgun<00:05:33.349> and<00:05:33.529> one

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:34.129 
better suited for the shotgun and one

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.100 
better suited for the shotgun and one
