00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.129
 and good s all here the summary 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.020
 I bring gameplay from the wash dogs was one of 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.600
 the games that I could play during that 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.000
 last week at gamescom in germany 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.860
 and the truth is that I called much the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.510
 unfortunately I could not record 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.029
 floating what you are seeing here of 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.650
 background is something that was shown in the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.029
 e3 and later on you are going to see a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.339
 new gameplay that they have taken out during 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.220
 this week I'm going to summarize a little bit what 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:29.039
 the game consists because honestly I 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.349
 I did not know what it was until he could 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.340
 play it I can tell you it does not have 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.230
 nothing to do with what had been seen 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.390
 previously I can not tell you that the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.970
 game that is what the world is not 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 has like different ways of playing it 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.180
 is the part of the history of the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.250
 challenges and everything that this entails and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.390
 apart has the sandbox part not the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 part of saints for those who do not know 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.990
 is what is like the open world that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.290
 you have nothing to do and you go as a 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.360
 little to yours and what I called the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.100
 attention of the game is that it is alive 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.800
 ie you're going down the street and as 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.920
 comes here and there are things that are alive 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 that is to say there is life in the city is 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.020
 it goes on things like six watching 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.460
 here robberies or are we say that the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.049
 people have their job 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.999
 from his side to another has a goal 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.859
 what to do and it's not just walking and 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:15.840
 moving like puppets and going 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.939
 disappearing let's say that the one that generates 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.090
 the corner but each one has a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.100
 task is not to say is super well done 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.439
 I think this obviously could not be 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.579
 see that without all these new consoles 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.030
 and the new generation that they are going to take 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.560
 because the amount of things and actions and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.600
 everything that moves in this game is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.490
 bestial and as you have seen for example 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.009
 we have found that poor woman who 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.389
 they had just docked then one of the 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.340
 things that strikes me the most is 

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.649
 that you can control everything and when 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 I say everything is everything I can say of a 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.600
 security camera to another you can 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.259
 change convert semaphores 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.700
 practically to explain in three to 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.799
 four you want or to make those who 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.100
 they follow you suddenly they turn red and 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.630
 can not cross and publicis between cars 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.909
 everything you see that is electronic is 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.319
 You can find out how you see too 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.659
 let's say that the pivots that are in the 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.850
 floor to escape from any other 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.170
 side everything you imagine and be 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.600
 electronic we are practically going to 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.790
 power 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.850
 use to loot it and use what 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.440
 our our benefit and it is something that 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.110
 no doubt has called me a lot 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.260
 attention and it's something I had not seen 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.260
 let's say until now that I could 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.850
 play the game so I do not know 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.370
 it would be better to serve as a thousand 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.260
 videos to be able to explain everything that 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.060
 can really be done in the game and 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.560
 keep in mind that the part that I 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.170
 I will have played because it will be a minimal part 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.610
 of what will eventually not play a 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.830
 very important role the whole issue of the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.240
 cameras and others because they are going to 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.500
 help to continue as it were to say it 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.630
 researching and reaching sites to which 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.400
 We could not reach us physically 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.630
 so well I'll show you now 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.360
 same the part that most called me the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.980
 attention and is how it works with all the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.290
 subject of the tablets and even that 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.540
 can play the game for free there is no 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.150
 way in which when you are playing 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.150
 you alone in your world and you are between 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.460
 missions and missions in which there are people 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.380
 of random people or friends of yours can 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.230
 to be watching what you do is to say 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.150
 you can be playing so 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.970
 quiet and meanwhile your friends 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.410
 they can be 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.120
 with your tablet is let 's say that the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.800
 application work in any 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.290
 mobile device or tablet or whatever 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.180
 and you can see exactly what you notice 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.470
 a view like of a map and sees in everything 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.820
 moment what is what you are doing for 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.590
 where those in the city and so on and 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.850
 when you are between missions any 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.470
 person who is watching you will be able to 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.360
 throw a challenge and you if you want but 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.860
 you can accept or not then when 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.930
 come this time when you do not 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.120
 have nothing to do and suddenly you 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.560
 send a challenge then accept it and the 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.420
 person who is from the table of everything 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.010
 from your mobile you can catch and 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.390
 put you say what obstacles or 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.360
 prepare your own challenge so that you 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.459
 you do it is not a little something like oysters 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.350
 I will be able to continue playing and if thanks 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.000
 challenge because you earn little things like points 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.770
 of experience etcetera and for the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.209
 person who is not playing is to say 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.560
 for the person who in that player 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.180
 consoles we'll have played them in their 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.130
 mobile also get things is to say 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.720
 you are going to have a way to play the game 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.250
 without even having to buy the one 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.680
 let's say I think it's super good because 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.350
 many very few people who are going to have 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.120
 the console as it comes out let's say this 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.230
 game is art that is to wait a year or 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.600
 two until you get it and yet 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.880
 You can go conjugating and go forward in 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.799
 the game is not something that practically 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.730
 I did not know and it can also be 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.620
 that if you have activated the option 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.260
 anyone gets in your game 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.420
 and I can, as it were, try 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.740
 makes you compete like you is 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.390
 hacking and you have to try 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.220
 find out who it is because you're going to 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.660
 see how a pedestrian more is to say do not 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.770
 you will see with it the same 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.780
 appearance that you are having now 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.400
 same is something quite complicated of 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.020
 explain but here I will know the subject 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.050
 the tablet and what I commented not 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.400
 you are between different missions and 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.450
 Suddenly it becomes a challenge to the person 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.310
 on the right is the one with the tablet 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.200
 and anyone who knows ture and 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.550
 goals is to say if I am playing and 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.810
 I have any of this option now 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.160
 person is to say any of you 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.230
 will be able to see what I'm doing 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.120
 at all times they were made to see 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.310
 five hundred people that you are seeing 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.990
 what am I playing or doing what 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.340
 you want objects are from the mobile in 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.200
 the street anywhere is not to say I'm going to 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.580
 I'm going to be playing now you can 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.320
 throw me challenges during this media 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.990
 I'm going to record something and you can enter 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.000
 there and do any challenge to know how 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.129
 I'm playing and so on other things 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.619
 that as in six videos can be done 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:21.439
 how to hack the panels you are going to see 

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:22.009
 on the subject of everything that is electronic 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:25.819
 here 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.319
 using a blackout therefore you 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.319
 you control your practice of all energy 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.050
 not all electricity and how are you going to 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.089
 seeing is also a super cool way 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.219
 after interacting I mean is 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.899
 as youtube so to speak with 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.429
 you who can play directly 

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:41.899
 without urging something in the same game 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:44.269
 even have the game the island console 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.889
 or without we can even have or bought 

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:48.559
 no or what good I think it's something 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.059
 something pretty cool and I think you can 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:52.249
 be pretty good without a doubt I have a 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.509
 week of the game coming out so they 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.249
 I liked the video was helpful 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.990
 etcetera you can vote and we 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:58.990
 approximate ones that all means
