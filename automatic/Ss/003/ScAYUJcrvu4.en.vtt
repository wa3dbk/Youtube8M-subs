00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.319 
show you how the qadian is being done
okay<00:03:56.150> we'll<00:03:56.299> take<00:03:56.450> out<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:57.910> funnel<00:03:58.910> with<00:03:59.180> a

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
okay we'll take out the funnel with a

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.280 
okay we'll take out the funnel with a
filter<00:03:59.450> in<00:03:59.930> it

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
filter in it

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.839 
filter in it
yeah<00:04:01.069> we'll<00:04:01.310> slowly<00:04:01.700> pour<00:04:02.590> last<00:04:03.590> be<00:04:04.400> with<00:04:04.730> the

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
yeah we'll slowly pour last be with the

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.240 
yeah we'll slowly pour last be with the
soloqueue<00:04:05.150> no<00:04:05.360> powder<00:04:05.599> unit<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:06.739> filter<00:04:07.069> out

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
soloqueue no powder unit to filter out

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.750 
soloqueue no powder unit to filter out
the<00:04:08.260> soil<00:04:09.260> phenom<00:04:09.680> powder<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:11.109> show<00:04:12.109> you<00:04:12.170> the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
the soil phenom powder and show you the

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:21.580 
the soil phenom powder and show you the
final<00:04:13.760> solution

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.570 

this<00:04:22.580> will<00:04:23.030> take<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.240> little<00:04:23.510> bit<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.690> time<00:04:24.550> okay

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
this will take a little bit of time okay

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.290 
this will take a little bit of time okay
meanwhile<00:04:26.210> we'll<00:04:26.570> let<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:26.750> drop<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:28.300> we'll

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
meanwhile we'll let it drop and we'll

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.610 
meanwhile we'll let it drop and we'll
also<00:04:30.020> take<00:04:30.380> flask<00:04:30.860> C<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:32.110> pour<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.230> into<00:04:33.320> the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
also take flask C and pour it into the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:45.350 
also take flask C and pour it into the
funnel<00:04:34.070> culture

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.689 

okay<00:04:46.370> so<00:04:47.370> we<00:04:47.550> let<00:04:47.789> it<00:04:47.909> sit<00:04:48.090> for<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.330> while<00:04:48.509> and

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.240 

meanwhile<00:04:53.699> you<00:04:54.030> can<00:04:54.240> see<00:04:54.560> less<00:04:55.560> be<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:55.949> being

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
meanwhile you can see less be is being

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.450 
meanwhile you can see less be is being
filtered<00:04:59.689> okay<00:05:00.689> and<00:05:01.050> very<00:05:01.080> clear<00:05:01.740> solution<00:05:02.310> is

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
filtered okay and very clear solution is

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.149 
filtered okay and very clear solution is
coming<00:05:02.729> out<00:05:02.879> so<00:05:03.870> this<00:05:04.110> is<00:05:04.169> a<00:05:04.349> drinkable<00:05:05.039> water

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
coming out so this is a drinkable water

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:10.010 
coming out so this is a drinkable water
now<00:05:06.050> without<00:05:07.050> any<00:05:07.560> heavy<00:05:07.740> metals<00:05:08.750> okay<00:05:09.750> and

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
now without any heavy metals okay and

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.969 
now without any heavy metals okay and
then<00:05:10.199> we'll<00:05:10.439> also<00:05:10.979> here<00:05:11.370> we<00:05:11.550> have<00:05:12.289> blasts<00:05:13.289> see

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
then we'll also here we have blasts see

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.040 
then we'll also here we have blasts see
with<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.580> competitors<00:05:16.069> karela<00:05:17.069> and<00:05:18.050> the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
with the competitors karela and the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.640 
with the competitors karela and the
coral<00:05:19.409> itself<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.919> being<00:05:20.159> filtered<00:05:20.430> out<00:05:20.669> but

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
coral itself is being filtered out but

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.189 
coral itself is being filtered out but
if<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.710> see<00:05:23.009> the<00:05:23.159> final<00:05:23.520> solution<00:05:24.199> dripping

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
if you see the final solution dripping

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.330 
if you see the final solution dripping
down<00:05:25.409> it's<00:05:25.830> still<00:05:26.810> not<00:05:27.810> quite<00:05:28.020> clear<00:05:28.159> in<00:05:29.159> fact

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
down it's still not quite clear in fact

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.439 
down it's still not quite clear in fact
it's<00:05:29.849> still<00:05:30.000> yellow<00:05:32.449> okay<00:05:33.449> so<00:05:35.300> that's<00:05:36.300> a

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
it's still yellow okay so that's a

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.610 
it's still yellow okay so that's a
little<00:05:36.689> bit<00:05:36.930> more<00:05:37.110> of<00:05:37.289> the<00:05:39.349> solution<00:05:40.349> in<00:05:40.560> the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
little bit more of the solution in the

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.070 
little bit more of the solution in the
flask<00:05:40.740> B<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.460> plus<00:05:41.729> C<00:05:42.000> let<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.479> talk<00:05:42.779> a<00:05:42.810> little

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
flask B and plus C let it talk a little

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.300 
flask B and plus C let it talk a little
bit<00:05:43.199> more<00:05:48.259> okay<00:05:49.259> I<00:05:49.529> think<00:05:50.039> that<00:05:50.190> would<00:05:50.279> be

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
bit more okay I think that would be

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.809 
bit more okay I think that would be
enough<00:05:50.639> and<00:05:51.389> flask<00:05:52.199> C<00:05:54.770> just<00:05:55.770> got<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.339> little<00:05:56.580> bit

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
enough and flask C just got a little bit

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.999 
enough and flask C just got a little bit
more<00:05:57.000> of<00:05:57.089> the<00:05:57.270> solution<00:05:57.719> so<00:05:57.900> we<00:05:58.020> can<00:05:58.050> take<00:05:58.979> a

00:05:58.999 --> 00:05:59.009 
more of the solution so we can take a

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:04.550 
more of the solution so we can take a
very<00:05:59.370> definitive<00:06:00.770> look<00:06:01.770> at<00:06:02.039> the<00:06:02.310> final<00:06:03.560> filter

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
very definitive look at the final filter

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.200 
very definitive look at the final filter
our<00:06:04.650> solution

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:22.590 

okay<00:06:11.210> I<00:06:11.240> think<00:06:11.510> it<00:06:12.020> shows<00:06:12.410> pretty<00:06:12.650> clearly<00:06:12.770> now

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.140 

plus<00:06:23.600> speak<00:06:24.100> with<00:06:25.100> these<00:06:25.310> Photokina<00:06:25.910> powder

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
plus speak with these Photokina powder

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.770 
plus speak with these Photokina powder
and<00:06:27.190> in<00:06:28.190> fact<00:06:28.490> we<00:06:28.700> sort<00:06:29.000> of<00:06:29.030> kina<00:06:29.300> powder<00:06:29.510> has

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
and in fact we sort of kina powder has

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.610 
and in fact we sort of kina powder has
heated<00:06:30.350> at<00:06:30.500> the<00:06:30.680> heavy<00:06:30.980> metal<00:06:31.340> solution<00:06:31.790> and

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
heated at the heavy metal solution and

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.950 
heated at the heavy metal solution and
holding<00:06:33.620> the<00:06:33.800> heavy<00:06:34.400> metal

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
holding the heavy metal

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.920 
holding the heavy metal
I<00:06:37.060> guess<00:06:38.060> the<00:06:38.540> mono<00:06:39.230> fuels<00:06:39.530> and<00:06:40.600> what<00:06:41.600> you<00:06:41.720> have

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
I guess the mono fuels and what you have

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.710 
I guess the mono fuels and what you have
left<00:06:42.229> is<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.710> clear<00:06:42.979> water<00:06:43.310> and<00:06:43.669> on<00:06:44.540> the<00:06:44.630> other

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
left is the clear water and on the other

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.590 
left is the clear water and on the other
hand<00:06:45.070> you<00:06:46.070> have<00:06:46.100> flat<00:06:46.669> C<00:06:48.820> or<00:06:49.820> heavy<00:06:50.150> metal

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
hand you have flat C or heavy metal

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.310 
hand you have flat C or heavy metal
solution<00:06:50.930> and<00:06:51.139> competitors<00:06:51.830> chlorella<00:06:52.220> and

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
solution and competitors chlorella and

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.120 
solution and competitors chlorella and
you<00:06:54.320> still<00:06:54.560> have<00:06:54.770> the<00:06:56.290> heavy<00:06:57.290> metal<00:06:57.680> solution

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
you still have the heavy metal solution

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.070 
you still have the heavy metal solution
coming<00:06:59.090> out<00:06:59.210> of<00:06:59.419> the<00:06:59.680> filtrate<00:07:01.870> okay<00:07:02.870> then

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
coming out of the filtrate okay then

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:12.190 
coming out of the filtrate okay then
that's<00:07:04.120> take<00:07:05.120> out<00:07:05.300> the<00:07:06.700> funnel

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.200 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:22.280 

hey<00:07:13.850> and<00:07:14.850> check<00:07:15.710> out<00:07:16.710> the<00:07:16.890> other<00:07:17.010> funnel<00:07:21.290> okay

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.290 
hey and check out the other funnel okay

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.730 
hey and check out the other funnel okay
so<00:07:22.350> let's<00:07:22.890> go<00:07:23.130> see<00:07:25.160> very<00:07:26.160> very<00:07:26.280> clear<00:07:26.760> water

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
so let's go see very very clear water

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.200 
so let's go see very very clear water
step<00:07:28.740> for<00:07:28.920> drinking<00:07:29.340> and<00:07:30.350> on<00:07:31.350> the<00:07:31.470> other<00:07:31.560> hand

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.210 
step for drinking and on the other hand

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.720 
step for drinking and on the other hand
fluffy<00:07:33.210> with<00:07:33.570> the<00:07:33.750> competitors<00:07:34.560> Corella<00:07:35.010> it's

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:35.730 
fluffy with the competitors Corella it's

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.030 
fluffy with the competitors Corella it's
still<00:07:36.030> very<00:07:36.210> yellowish<00:07:36.810> I<00:07:37.110> don't<00:07:37.830> think<00:07:37.980> I

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.040 
still very yellowish I don't think I

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.600 
still very yellowish I don't think I
want<00:07:38.250> to<00:07:38.310> drink<00:07:38.460> this<00:07:38.640> okay<00:07:40.460> thank<00:07:41.460> you

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610 
want to drink this okay thank you

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.380 
want to drink this okay thank you
this<00:07:42.060> will<00:07:42.300> be<00:07:42.390> our<00:07:42.660> demonstration<00:07:43.350> today
