00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that's a fairly straightforward common

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.800

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
respectable perfectly nice the only

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.120 
respectable perfectly nice the only
thing<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.840> everybody's<00:01:28.409> using<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.860> same

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
thing is that everybody's using the same

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.490 
thing is that everybody's using the same
backgrounds<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.930> may<00:01:31.079> want<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> do

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
backgrounds and you may want to do

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.280 
backgrounds and you may want to do
something<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> little<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:32.369> different<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
something a little bit different so the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.499 
something a little bit different so the
first<00:01:34.530> thing<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.060> title

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
first thing is that the the title

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.289 
first thing is that the the title
comprises<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> two<00:01:37.590> parts<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.790> background

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
comprises of two parts the background

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
comprises of two parts the background
image<00:01:39.689> whether<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> be<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> still<00:01:41.280> image<00:01:41.400> or<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
image whether it be a still image or a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.210 
image whether it be a still image or a
moving<00:01:42.030> image<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.860> actual

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
moving image like this and the actual

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.289 
moving image like this and the actual
title<00:01:45.380> text<00:01:46.380> itself<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:47.939> I'm<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.180> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
title text itself so what I'm going to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.010 
title text itself so what I'm going to
do<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.990> make<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.770> new<00:01:50.340> title<00:01:50.840> doing<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
do is make a new title doing it a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
do is make a new title doing it a
slightly<00:01:52.290> different<00:01:52.439> way<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
slightly different way and I'm going to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330 
slightly different way and I'm going to
start<00:01:54.420> off<00:01:54.689> by<00:01:55.530> using<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.979> different

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
start off by using a different

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.440 
start off by using a different
background<00:01:56.960> now<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.290> found<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.189> website<00:01:59.450> giving

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
background now I found a website giving

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.830

away<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.020> rather<00:02:01.439> nice<00:02:01.799> looping

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
away this rather nice looping

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.870 
away this rather nice looping
high-definition<00:02:03.840> background<00:02:04.380> I've<00:02:04.880> put

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
high-definition background I've put

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
high-definition background I've put

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.890 
the kind of that the nice background
makes<00:02:50.799> all<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.160> difference<00:02:51.280> but<00:02:52.239> rather<00:02:52.510> than

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
makes all the difference but rather than

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.509 
makes all the difference but rather than
stick<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.650> straightforward

to use these fonts you know you don't

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.849 
to use these fonts you know you don't

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
have to restrict yourself to these and

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.330 
have to restrict yourself to these and
particularly<00:03:09.730> some<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.359> serif<00:03:10.870> fonts<00:03:11.349> the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.800 
ones with little curly twiddles on them
aren't<00:03:14.019> so<00:03:14.140> good<00:03:14.590> for<00:03:15.430> using<00:03:15.940> titles<00:03:16.480> because

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
aren't so good for using titles because

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.110 
aren't so good for using titles because
they're<00:03:16.989> not<00:03:17.079> very<00:03:17.260> easy<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.799> read<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.280> let's

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
they're not very easy to read so let's

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.809

go ahead and click system font panel and
we<00:03:22.720> can<00:03:22.750> now<00:03:23.400> get<00:03:24.400> access<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:24.940> all<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.389> fonts

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750

just can go ahead and see what these

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.180 
just can go ahead and see what these
fonts<00:03:39.010> look<00:03:39.190> like<00:03:39.480> some<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.510> them<00:03:40.750> are<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:41.290> bit<00:03:41.829> a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
fonts look like some of them are a bit a

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.339 
fonts look like some of them are a bit a
bit<00:03:42.519> strange<00:03:42.910> some<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.810> them<00:03:43.900> are<00:03:44.019> pretty<00:03:44.199> good

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
bit strange some of them are pretty good

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.580 
bit strange some of them are pretty good
and<00:03:45.239> earlier<00:03:46.239> on<00:03:46.389> I<00:03:46.419> found<00:03:46.930> one<00:03:47.139> that<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.319> like

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
and earlier on I found one that I like

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.069 
and earlier on I found one that I like
the<00:03:47.620> look<00:03:47.919> of<00:03:48.129> and<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.370> was<00:03:48.459> called<00:03:48.730> fish<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:50.019> it

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
the look of and it was called fish so it

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.960 
the look of and it was called fish so it
can<00:03:50.199> go<00:03:50.349> ahead<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.769> either<00:03:50.980> scroll<00:03:51.519> down<00:03:51.760> and

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
can go ahead and either scroll down and

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.509 
can go ahead and either scroll down and
find<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.569> or<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:53.319> simply<00:03:53.650> type<00:03:54.010> in<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.250> word

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
find it or just simply type in the word

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.259 
find it or just simply type in the word
fish<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:56.019> search<00:03:56.260> pane<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.579> there<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.060> is

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
fish in the search pane and there it is

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.220 
fish in the search pane and there it is
fish<00:03:59.079> them<00:03:59.859> can<00:04:00.160> either<00:04:00.310> have<00:04:00.519> light<00:04:00.819> or<00:04:01.660> bold

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
fish them can either have light or bold

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.250 
fish them can either have light or bold
I<00:04:02.560> quite<00:04:03.340> like<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.730> bold<00:04:04.000> but<00:04:04.780> I'm<00:04:04.870> not<00:04:05.019> too

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
I quite like the bold but I'm not too

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.140 
I quite like the bold but I'm not too
keen<00:04:05.500> on<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.799> outline<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:06.849> can<00:04:07.000> actually

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
keen on the outline and you can actually

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.970 
keen on the outline and you can actually
switch<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.810> outline<00:04:08.169> off<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.620> if<00:04:08.709> you<00:04:08.739> look

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
switch the outline off and if you look

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.550 
switch the outline off and if you look
down<00:04:09.370> into<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.730> style<00:04:10.150> palettes<00:04:10.660> there's<00:04:11.470> a

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
down into the style palettes there's a

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.170 
down into the style palettes there's a
little<00:04:11.799> button<00:04:11.980> at<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.190> far<00:04:12.430> right<00:04:12.459> hand<00:04:12.879> side

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
little button at the far right hand side

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.020 
little button at the far right hand side
that<00:04:13.209> actually<00:04:13.780> switches<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:15.129> outline<00:04:15.849> on

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
that actually switches the outline on

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.319 
that actually switches the outline on
and<00:04:16.209> off<00:04:16.329> I<00:04:17.130> like<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.370> now<00:04:18.579> but<00:04:18.820> it's<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.060> bit<00:04:19.209> on

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
and off I like it now but it's a bit on

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.360 
and off I like it now but it's a bit on
the<00:04:19.479> small<00:04:19.660> side<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:20.590> let's<00:04:20.919> make<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.340> bit

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
the small side so let's make it a bit

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.580 
the small side so let's make it a bit
bigger

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
bigger

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.250 
bigger
yeah<00:04:23.590> 72<00:04:24.400> that's<00:04:24.700> not<00:04:24.909> too<00:04:25.090> bad

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
yeah 72 that's not too bad

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.960 
yeah 72 that's not too bad
okay<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:26.830> I<00:04:27.040> think<00:04:27.130> that's<00:04:27.430> an<00:04:27.580> improvement

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
okay so I think that's an improvement

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.190 
okay so I think that's an improvement
over<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.870> standard<00:04:29.860> font<00:04:30.240> but<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.780> can<00:04:31.990> also

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
over the standard font but you can also

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.200 
over the standard font but you can also
play<00:04:32.710> around<00:04:32.740> with<00:04:33.220> some<00:04:33.490> things<00:04:33.820> such<00:04:34.180> as

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
play around with some things such as

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.950 
play around with some things such as
shadow<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:36.210> there's<00:04:37.210> no<00:04:37.330> right<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:37.810> wrong

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
shadow and there's no right and wrong

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.660 
shadow and there's no right and wrong
way<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.140> do<00:04:38.500> this<00:04:38.740> just<00:04:38.980> play<00:04:39.310> around<00:04:39.520> with

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
way to do this just play around with

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.990 
way to do this just play around with
these<00:04:39.910> various<00:04:40.810> shadow<00:04:41.050> settings<00:04:41.880> until<00:04:42.880> you

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
these various shadow settings until you

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.440 
these various shadow settings until you
get<00:04:43.180> something<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.110> like<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.500> look<00:04:44.530> of

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
get something that you like the look of

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.280 
get something that you like the look of
okay<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:47.940> result<00:04:48.940> is<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.270> angle<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.960> the

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
okay the result is the angle of the the

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.390 
okay the result is the angle of the the
light<00:04:50.500> hitting<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.670> font<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:53.890> think

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
light hitting the the font and I think

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.440 
light hitting the the font and I think
are<00:04:54.640> quite<00:04:55.980> quite<00:04:56.980> like<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:57.490> if<00:04:57.940> you<00:04:58.210> can't

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
are quite quite like that if you can't

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.450 
are quite quite like that if you can't
see<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.870> shadow<00:04:59.320> controls<00:04:59.860> by<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.130> way<00:05:00.340> and

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
see the shadow controls by the way and

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.340 
see the shadow controls by the way and
if<00:05:00.550> you're<00:05:00.700> using<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:01.030> MacBook<00:05:01.240> it<00:05:01.660> may<00:05:01.840> be<00:05:02.110> that

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
if you're using a MacBook it may be that

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.040 
if you're using a MacBook it may be that
when<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:02.560> first<00:05:02.800> open<00:05:03.310> this<00:05:03.460> panel<00:05:03.820> up<00:05:04.050> it's

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
when you first open this panel up it's

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.960 
when you first open this panel up it's
so<00:05:05.260> narrow<00:05:05.560> that<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:06.040> doesn't<00:05:06.340> show<00:05:06.580> the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
so narrow that it doesn't show the

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.960 
so narrow that it doesn't show the
shadow<00:05:07.210> setting<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:08.140> just<00:05:09.040> make<00:05:09.520> that<00:05:09.730> wider

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
shadow setting so just make that wider

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.640 
shadow setting so just make that wider
and<00:05:10.300> then<00:05:10.450> you<00:05:10.540> build<00:05:10.750> to<00:05:10.930> get<00:05:11.230> access<00:05:11.410> to

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
and then you build to get access to

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.700 
and then you build to get access to
these<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:13.300> other<00:05:13.420> thing<00:05:13.720> I'm<00:05:13.990> going<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.440> do

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
these the other thing I'm going to do

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.640 
these the other thing I'm going to do
now<00:05:14.980> is<00:05:15.430> also<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.970> kerning<00:05:16.570> now<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:16.930> kerning

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
now is also the kerning now the kerning

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.570 
now is also the kerning now the kerning
is<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.580> distance<00:05:19.060> between<00:05:19.660> each<00:05:20.170> letter

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
is the distance between each letter

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.830 
is the distance between each letter
they're<00:05:21.580> a<00:05:21.610> bit<00:05:21.850> look<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.000> bit<00:05:22.180> bunched<00:05:22.510> up<00:05:22.630> to

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
they're a bit look a bit bunched up to

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.930 
they're a bit look a bit bunched up to
me<00:05:23.020> so<00:05:23.260> if<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:23.500> click<00:05:23.740> on<00:05:23.890> the<00:05:24.040> kerning<00:05:24.520> setting

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
me so if I click on the kerning setting

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.430 
me so if I click on the kerning setting
down<00:05:25.150> here<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.930> actually<00:05:26.520> widen<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.670> kerning

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
down here and actually widen the kerning

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.520 
down here and actually widen the kerning
it<00:05:29.440> kind<00:05:29.770> of<00:05:30.600> makes<00:05:31.600> the<00:05:31.810> thing<00:05:32.020> look<00:05:32.230> a<00:05:32.350> whole

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
it kind of makes the thing look a whole

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.920 
it kind of makes the thing look a whole
lot<00:05:32.770> better

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
lot better

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.900 
lot better
okay<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:34.990> let's<00:05:35.440> stick<00:05:35.620> with<00:05:35.830> that<00:05:36.010> and<00:05:36.790> I'm

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910
