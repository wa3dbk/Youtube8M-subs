00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.280
 if you're tired of windows phone 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.440
 blackberry os android and ios 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.980
 you can always go back to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.990
 an alternative is sail fish bones etc 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.550
 the Finnish manufacturer djola who 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.109
 offers a smartphone equipped with this 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.390
 system a smartphone that we had 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.830
 already approached at the last mwc of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.750
 barcelona but we have 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.130
 today in first lab test 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.770
 strong points obviously it's 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.989
 the aesthetics of ceg bone sheet of this 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.360
 operating system whose interface 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.899
 is very nice to watch and his 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.000
 ergonomics also quite effective rather 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.360
 easy then certainly confusing at first 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.190
 since we are not used to 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.710
 this gestural control that allows for 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.010
 go back to the home without a dedicated button 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.199
 without physical buttons or virtual bar 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.899
 under the screen as on android but 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.540
 it is a gesture that one learns enough 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.640
 fast which is very easy to use 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.920
 so we will necessarily talk about the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.180
 os cellfish system which is finally 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.140
 a strong point since it has very 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.210
 pleasantly surprised 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.100
 it is based on a classic linux it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.670
 never planted during our tests 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.580
 no bug 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.259
 so it works very well and in addition 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.970
 it is compatible with applications 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.409
 android so I say apps 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.259
 because not all are compatible 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.729
 but facebook twitter the messenger of 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.380
 facebook works perfectly 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.390
 the integration of facebook accounts 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.740
 twitter natively in the system 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.060
 also works very well with the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.670
 instant messaging management 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.890
 integrated in the SMS interface 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.840
 so it's very handy to use the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.149
 virtual keyboard is very nice to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.189
 also use that reacts very well it's 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.829
 fluid despite the low power of the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.450
 phone so very good point for 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.490
 bone cellfish despite the blur is 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.920
 actually be it to a system 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.270
 rather a proto operating system 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.520
 who does not have an army of developers 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.899
 behind to make it evolve very quickly 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.479
 like ios or android 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.920
 but it's already pretty good then among the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.060
 weaknesses among the handicaps we are going 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.940
 rather cited the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.190
 browser that is of poor quality 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.540
 happily google chrome works 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.760
 on the system 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.970
 the crash of the youtube app and 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.890
 some other minor disabilities 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.380
 finally weak point side is 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.849
 rather the quality of the material that we 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.500
 Disappoint a little then necessarily it's a 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.930
 phone that came out a year ago that 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.220
 been designed a year ago that was already there 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.560
 a year ago not high-end 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.540
 so in terms of specifications 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.120
 hardware the processor is little 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.380
 powerful the screen is only 4 5 inches 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.330
 diagonal in it's not bad for 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.850
 use one hand it remains ip is this 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.400
 its definition is not great it's still 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.459
 hd quartz classic clock and case 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.470
 the all-plastic case the design 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.299
 is quite nice with very original 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.430
 interchangeable shells a battery 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.250
 removable but it's still 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.049
 plastic the photo sensor too and from 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.420
 rather poor quality and she was 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.880
 very average so we'll say yes it's 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.489
 a smartphone today from input of 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.640
 range the only problem which costs 250 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.310
 euros and compared to the competition 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.049
 current smartphone is 150 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.180
 euros that it does not make weight at all 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.370
 so we should go down the price 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.069
 around 150 euros or so make a 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.480
 new smartphone more to the order of the 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.480
 day for john a 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.700
 in conclusion a phone so a little 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.010
 expensive but that has the merit of proving the 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.020
 possibility to run a 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.580
 phone quite efficiently and 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.010
 nice especially with a beautiful 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.680
 interface aesthetics on a system 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.630
 different from android and ios with its 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.970
 own ergonomics a fairly ergonomic 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.870
 nice too so all the merit and the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.030
 at jo there is to be able to develop 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.200
 bone cellfish who is still at his 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.790
 beginnings and that there are still some 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.280
 disabilities but it's not very serious 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.680
 we are mainly expecting a second smartphone 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.400
 and a drastic price drop for 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.400
 that one
