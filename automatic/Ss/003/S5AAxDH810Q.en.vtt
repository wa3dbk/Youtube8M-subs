fluorocarbon all right so this thing can
stand<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> teeth<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.160> these<00:02:20.310> fish

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
stand up to the teeth that these fish

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.280 
stand up to the teeth that these fish
are<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.970> going<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.750> put<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.019> this<00:02:22.230> thing

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
are going to going to put on this thing

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.930 
are going to going to put on this thing
so<00:02:22.739> whether<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.160> Pike<00:02:23.370> or<00:02:23.549> walleye<00:02:23.790> or

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
so whether it's Pike or walleye or

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.000 
so whether it's Pike or walleye or
whatever<00:02:24.299> it<00:02:24.420> may<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:24.570> but<00:02:24.870> then<00:02:25.440> what<00:02:25.650> we<00:02:25.769> have

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
whatever it may be but then what we have

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.280 
whatever it may be but then what we have
is<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.790> crawler<00:02:27.120> harness<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.750> this

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
is we have a crawler harness and this

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.500 
is we have a crawler harness and this
thing<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.709> tied<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.280> such<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.549> way<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.090> we<00:02:30.420> have

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
thing is tied in such a way that we have

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.060 
thing is tied in such a way that we have
a<00:02:30.540> lot<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.840> distance<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:31.470> between<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.769> hooks

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
a lot of distance in between the hooks

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.680 
a lot of distance in between the hooks
that's<00:02:32.519> going<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> make<00:02:33.060> sure<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.239> we<00:02:33.510> can

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
that's going to make sure that we can

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.690 
that's going to make sure that we can
get<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.049> hook<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:34.920> back<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.400> crawler

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
get that hook in the back of the crawler

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.759 
get that hook in the back of the crawler
then<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.630> other<00:02:36.780> thing<00:02:37.049> that<00:02:37.079> we<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.530> is

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
then the other thing that we have is

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.100 
then the other thing that we have is
beads<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.790> all<00:02:38.940> kind<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.540> match<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.720> color

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
beads that all kind of match the color

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.650 
beads that all kind of match the color
of<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> bodies<00:02:40.680> but<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.400> body<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.329> a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
of the bodies but this body is is a

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.289 
of the bodies but this body is is a
plastic<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.590> what<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:43.950> thing<00:02:44.190> does<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
plastic and what this thing does is it

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.780 
plastic and what this thing does is it
runs<00:02:45.630> like<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.840> crankbait<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.739> water<00:02:46.950> but

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
runs like a crankbait in the water but

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.199 
runs like a crankbait in the water but
it<00:02:48.090> also<00:02:48.239> floats<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:50.010> body<00:02:50.220> will

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
it also floats so this little body will

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.670 
it also floats so this little body will
attract<00:02:51.690> them<00:02:51.900> from<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> distance<00:02:52.380> and

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
attract them from a distance and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.319 
attract them from a distance and
actually<00:02:53.220> look<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.579> crankbait<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
actually look like a crankbait in the

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.210 
actually look like a crankbait in the
water<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:55.019> I'm<00:02:55.170> running<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.620> down<00:02:55.650> at<00:02:55.980> crawler

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
water but I'm running it down at crawler

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.430 
water but I'm running it down at crawler
harness<00:02:56.700> speed<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:58.079> makes<00:02:58.260> them

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
harness speed and that just makes them

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.990 
harness speed and that just makes them
attack<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.920> now<00:02:59.280> one<00:02:59.459> other<00:02:59.579> thing<00:02:59.700> that's

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
attack it now one other thing that's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.789 
attack it now one other thing that's
really<00:03:00.120> cool<00:03:00.600> about<00:03:00.630> how<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.079> can<00:03:01.350> fish<00:03:01.560> this

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
really cool about how you can fish this

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.039 
really cool about how you can fish this
thing<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.400> because<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.030> little<00:03:03.390> body<00:03:03.540> floats

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
thing is because this little body floats

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.170 
thing is because this little body floats
when<00:03:04.769> I'm<00:03:04.890> pulling<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.430> thing<00:03:05.670> back<00:03:05.850> behind

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
when I'm pulling this thing back behind

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.030 
when I'm pulling this thing back behind
that<00:03:06.329> bottom<00:03:06.630> bouncer<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.110> lot<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.680> times<00:03:07.860> I'll

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
that bottom bouncer a lot of times I'll

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.400 
that bottom bouncer a lot of times I'll
just<00:03:08.250> set<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.549> down<00:03:08.750> where<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> spinner<00:03:10.170> would

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
just set it down where a spinner would

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.140 
just set it down where a spinner would
drop<00:03:10.680> into<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> bottom<00:03:11.459> at<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.730> point<00:03:12.000> and

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
drop into the bottom at that point and

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.210 
drop into the bottom at that point and
be<00:03:12.239> ineffective<00:03:12.720> what<00:03:13.470> happens<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.070> this

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
be ineffective what happens is this

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.030 
be ineffective what happens is this
little<00:03:14.579> guy<00:03:14.730> actually<00:03:15.480> floats<00:03:16.140> up<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.769> when

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
little guy actually floats up and when

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.560 
little guy actually floats up and when
this<00:03:17.190> thing<00:03:17.400> floats<00:03:17.640> up<00:03:17.880> if<00:03:18.060> there's<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.329> fish

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
this thing floats up if there's a fish

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.390 
this thing floats up if there's a fish
following<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.079> they<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.530> attack<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.130> and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
following it they just attack it and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.770 
following it they just attack it and
that's<00:03:20.519> exactly<00:03:20.820> what<00:03:21.180> happened<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.570> that

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
that's exactly what happened on that

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.479 
that's exactly what happened on that
fish<00:03:21.989> right<00:03:22.230> there<00:03:22.470> when<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.100> get<00:03:23.160> back<00:03:23.340> in

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
fish right there when you get back in

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.440 
fish right there when you get back in
the<00:03:23.579> water<00:03:23.669> because<00:03:24.030> I'll<00:03:24.120> tell<00:03:24.269> you

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
the water because I'll tell you

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.270 
the water because I'll tell you
what<00:03:24.569> I<00:03:24.870> guarantee<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:25.950> we're<00:03:26.099> going<00:03:26.190> to

what I guarantee you we're going to
catch<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.550> lot<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.790> fish<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.239> these<00:03:27.360> things

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
catch a lot of fish on these things

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.420 
catch a lot of fish on these things
today<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.170> because<00:03:28.860> we're<00:03:29.040> out<00:03:29.069> here<00:03:29.310> at

today and because we're out here at

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.400 
today and because we're out here at
Devils<00:03:29.580> Lake<00:03:29.910> we<00:03:30.390> get<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.599> fish<00:03:30.750> two<00:03:30.959> lines<00:03:31.200> so

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
Devils Lake we get to fish two lines so

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.780 
Devils Lake we get to fish two lines so
I<00:03:31.440> got<00:03:31.590> one<00:03:31.739> out<00:03:31.860> over<00:03:32.129> here<00:03:32.340> trying<00:03:32.580> some

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
I got one out over here trying some

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.300 
I got one out over here trying some
different<00:03:32.819> colors<00:03:33.360> -<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.860> neat<00:03:41.069> thing

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
different colors - that is a neat thing

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.070 
different colors - that is a neat thing
about<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.610> gloves<00:03:42.500> just<00:03:43.500> pick<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:43.980> fish<00:03:44.250> up

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
about the gloves just pick that fish up

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.699 
about the gloves just pick that fish up
and<00:03:46.080> then<00:03:46.260> break<00:03:46.530> me<00:03:46.709> in<00:03:46.800> my<00:03:46.920> hooks<00:03:48.260> now<00:03:49.260> just

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
and then break me in my hooks now just

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.780 
and then break me in my hooks now just
come<00:03:49.860> up<00:03:50.040> smacked<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.670> when<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.819> stopped<00:03:51.239> it

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
come up smacked it when I stopped it

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.640 
come up smacked it when I stopped it
let's<00:03:53.390> hope<00:03:53.569> this<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:53.959> an<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:54.909> it<00:03:55.909> is<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.450> oh<00:03:57.109> yeah

same thing on a spinner to a certain
point<00:04:37.099> and<00:04:37.550> that's<00:04:38.509> a<00:04:38.630> dynamite<00:04:39.110> eye<00:04:39.139> right

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
point and that's a dynamite eye right

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.499 
point and that's a dynamite eye right
there<00:04:39.800> but<00:04:40.699> you<00:04:40.789> put<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.090> two<00:04:41.240> of<00:04:41.389> them

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
there but you put the two of them

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.060 
there but you put the two of them
together<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.080> you<00:04:42.169> slow<00:04:42.500> this<00:04:42.710> thing<00:04:42.770> down

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
together and you slow this thing down

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.800 
together and you slow this thing down
because<00:04:43.639> I<00:04:43.729> can<00:04:43.880> go<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> little<00:04:44.210> slower<00:04:44.599> than

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
because I can go a little slower than

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.749 
because I can go a little slower than
crankbait<00:04:45.259> speed<00:04:45.560> but<00:04:46.099> yet<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.340> can<00:04:46.639> go<00:04:46.729> a

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
crankbait speed but yet I can go a

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.610 
crankbait speed but yet I can go a
little<00:04:47.030> bit<00:04:47.300> faster<00:04:47.780> than<00:04:47.960> spinner<00:04:48.289> speed

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
little bit faster than spinner speed

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.439 
little bit faster than spinner speed
it's<00:04:49.099> the<00:04:49.430> perfect<00:04:49.849> bait<00:04:50.060> for<00:04:50.090> that

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
it's the perfect bait for that

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.159 
it's the perfect bait for that
neighborhood<00:04:50.660> of<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.560> know<00:04:51.680> maybe<00:04:51.919> 1<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.699> 1.5

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
1.6 miles an hour and it just catches

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.200 
1.6 miles an hour and it just catches
fish<00:04:56.449> that's<00:04:56.780> awesome<00:04:57.699> throw<00:04:58.699> him<00:04:58.880> in<00:04:59.030> there

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
trying it for the first time there's a

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.209 
trying it for the first time there's a

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
it and tell you number one is what I'm

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.119 
it and tell you number one is what I'm
doing<00:06:39.269> a<00:06:39.360> lot<00:06:39.509> of<00:06:39.569> the<00:06:39.779> time<00:06:40.019> here<00:06:40.349> is<00:06:40.649> I'm

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
doing a lot of the time here is I'm

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:42.859 
doing a lot of the time here is I'm
pinching<00:06:41.580> off<00:06:41.699> my<00:06:41.939> crawler<00:06:42.269> right<00:06:42.569> behind

00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:42.869 
pinching off my crawler right behind

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.869 
pinching off my crawler right behind
that<00:06:42.990> second<00:06:43.499> hook<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:44.279> reason<00:06:44.610> I'm<00:06:44.699> doing

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:44.879 
that second hook the reason I'm doing

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:46.699 
that second hook the reason I'm doing
that<00:06:44.999> is<00:06:45.149> because<00:06:45.569> we<00:06:45.689> have<00:06:45.719> so<00:06:46.019> much<00:06:46.139> space<00:06:46.439> in

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:46.709 
that is because we have so much space in

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:48.679 
that is because we have so much space in
between<00:06:46.829> these<00:06:47.189> hooks<00:06:47.430> and<00:06:47.729> by<00:06:48.300> the<00:06:48.360> time<00:06:48.569> you

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:48.689 
between these hooks and by the time you

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:50.480 
between these hooks and by the time you
put<00:06:48.869> that<00:06:49.019> body<00:06:49.229> here<00:06:49.619> if<00:06:49.740> you<00:06:49.860> left<00:06:50.099> that<00:06:50.219> full

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
put that body here if you left that full

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.489 
put that body here if you left that full
crawler<00:06:50.759> back<00:06:50.999> here<00:06:51.269> that's<00:06:51.749> an<00:06:51.990> awful<00:06:52.469> big

00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:52.499 
crawler back here that's an awful big

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.439 
crawler back here that's an awful big
meal<00:06:52.889> and<00:06:53.219> too<00:06:53.459> often<00:06:53.639> they'll<00:06:53.999> come<00:06:54.180> up<00:06:54.209> and

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:54.449 
meal and too often they'll come up and

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:56.149 
meal and too often they'll come up and
grab<00:06:54.629> the<00:06:54.659> back<00:06:55.019> end<00:06:55.289> of<00:06:55.379> it<00:06:55.499> and<00:06:55.680> you<00:06:55.979> won't

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
grab the back end of it and you won't

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.949 
grab the back end of it and you won't
get<00:06:56.309> a<00:06:56.339> hook<00:06:56.519> in<00:06:56.669> them<00:06:56.759> so<00:06:57.149> all<00:06:57.389> I'm<00:06:57.599> doing<00:06:57.629> is

00:06:57.949 --> 00:06:57.959

I'm<00:06:58.079> pinching<00:06:58.499> that<00:06:58.589> thing<00:06:58.800> off<00:06:58.949> about<00:06:59.249> an

00:06:59.359 --> 00:06:59.369 
I'm pinching that thing off about an

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:01.429 
I'm pinching that thing off about an
inch<00:06:59.610> behind<00:06:59.969> the<00:07:00.329> back<00:07:00.479> hook<00:07:00.749> the<00:07:01.289> other

inch behind the back hook the other
thing<00:07:01.709> I'm<00:07:01.860> doing<00:07:02.189> is<00:07:02.369> I'm<00:07:02.759> putting<00:07:02.789> constant

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:03.509 
thing I'm doing is I'm putting constant

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:04.939 
thing I'm doing is I'm putting constant
movement<00:07:03.689> down<00:07:04.019> there<00:07:04.050> now<00:07:04.589> when<00:07:04.800> you're

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:04.949 
movement down there now when you're

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:06.589 
movement down there now when you're
working<00:07:05.309> this<00:07:05.430> thing<00:07:05.669> you're<00:07:06.059> actually<00:07:06.419> even

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.509 
working this thing you're actually even
on<00:07:06.689> monofilament<00:07:07.079> when<00:07:07.709> you<00:07:07.829> pull<00:07:08.129> that<00:07:08.249> thing

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:08.519 
on monofilament when you pull that thing

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:10.009 
on monofilament when you pull that thing
forward<00:07:08.759> if<00:07:08.969> you're<00:07:09.119> at<00:07:09.209> a<00:07:09.269> 45<00:07:09.689> degree<00:07:09.719> angle

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:10.019 
forward if you're at a 45 degree angle

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:12.019 
forward if you're at a 45 degree angle
you're<00:07:10.469> going<00:07:10.499> to<00:07:10.679> feel<00:07:10.949> the<00:07:11.129> wobble<00:07:11.579> just

like in a crank bait I'm doing a lot of
work<00:07:14.279> in<00:07:14.490> that<00:07:14.639> bait<00:07:14.849> then<00:07:15.389> every<00:07:15.659> now<00:07:15.779> and
