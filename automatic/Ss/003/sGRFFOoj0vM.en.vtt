00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.440
 bmw m3 for over 20 years is the 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.570
 most sporty thaler for the 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.910
 driving dynamic olymp of the automobiles 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.810
 middle class such a car is fast to 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.540
 heart affair a first three 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.070
 remember as our father to us 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.080
 home came with the pictures and says that 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.120
 car example ordered that works 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.129
 not when he was standing in the yard from 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.739
 the time was simply love for 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.199
 the bmw m3 series was the first 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.290
 times you never never forget already in 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.540
 a m3 first girl with a bmw m3 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.250
 driving without possession of a driving license 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.769
 on the go kart still on the sheep pastures 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.900
 my old gentleman with the kart down the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.850
 fathers would have had the bang was beautiful 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.320
 threaded and the boys have the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.510
 car keys of parents steals and 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.370
 are nice on the kartbahn umgefahren 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.720
 until sometime the mother france 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.710
 ran and heard me drive 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.659
 actually this car out there this 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.970
 There are cars out there in the meantime 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.440
 the fourth generation likes that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.630
 sheet metal dress and the number of cylinders 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.790
 have changed over the years his 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.490
 Style remains the M3 dream powerful 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.240
 masculine just like that and not otherwise 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.240
 him the fans 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.380
 Under the hood meanwhile rules 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.380
 high speed v8 with 420 ps 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.640
 Closed country roads are his helps 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.490
 who or just main form as 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.330
 natural enemies know a m3 here 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.869
 good as no 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.869
 or maybe 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.260
 as confident as the new c 63 amg 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.190
 you have to blow his ass 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.650
 doubt 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.350
 finally affolterbach meant seriously 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.630
 the mercedes c-class long that 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.430
 stepchild in the amg product range 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.340
 He now spearheads sporting 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.170
 are the convincing he has to ensure 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.170
 Alone the 6.3 liter v8 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.730
 hammer up the car 457 hp exactly 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.110
 be always fascinating how 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.460
 mercedes just creates so much 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.840
 pack power in his car 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.380
 that it still holds everything and on the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.380
 road goes 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.510
 He presses on the gas pedal 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.150
 they are really cheering 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.630
 Rear pushes 600 newton meters are too 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.310
 installs 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.890
 The circuit is an automatic transmission 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.260
 but when I am at the lever for 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.670
 shift down draw then there 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.080
 Meanwhile gasstoß first there 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.850
 something thought broken something 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.290
 but that's just really that's it 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.670
 just that belongs in the car when 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.380
 I already say I need that 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.670
 machine with automatic then I have to 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.840
 be at least the location which is 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.000
 in the meantime a little bit really 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.630
 race feeling in the ear in the sound on it 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.020
 to come 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.490
 and it helps dynamic driving dynamics 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.020
 is the keyword 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.210
 just the paraded discipline of 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.530
 predecessor models blame that esp 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:39.590
 here pretty worn out for the first time in hpc 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.870
 63 we are allowed to turn everything off 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.030
 the driving pleasure has previously been prohibited 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.740
 enjoy 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.990
 Sensational a c63 stop who 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.180
 the mountain roads on the côte d'azur too 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.790
 It's just that it had to move 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.190
 Let's be the ingredients are all 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.730
 available to the m3 right paroli too 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.350
 Offer 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.180
 but it also manages the Mercedes 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.040
 rivals 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.610
 or does he have bmw the end but the 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.610
 nose in front 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.209
 race track paul ricard in le castellet 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.800
 a special covering for the two 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.690
 right to feel the tooth here 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.079
 otherwise quite different bolides turn theirs 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.079
 round 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.180
 the more than 66,000 euros expensive bmw goes as 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.730
 first and is full in its element 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.710
 here the v8 organ may just like him 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.280
 needs macken the predecessor were 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.670
 consistently hidden 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.770
 they are easy to find in the new m3 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.080
 better the agile front axle out of the 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.370
 old ones just just creates the ones 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.690
 Rear axle that much better 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.139
 take 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.389
 that is very balanced very harmonious 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.889
 in the predecessor and specifically in the csl was 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.950
 it so that you are a super strong 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.690
 demanded the track rose wider that 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.040
 problem was only the rear axle had 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.630
 get noticed if I steered one 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.490
 the forwards have turned off 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.930
 but the rear has fallen over like one 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.930
 Sack must have confessed with way 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.479
 can the c63 counter this 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:24.009
 visually already a beading there 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.949
 powerdome and down a few faster 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.160
 from taxi image at this c-class no 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.160
 track 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.250
 for proud 67800 euro but you can 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.669
 also expect 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.830
 mileage 0 to 100 km / h in 4 7 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.370
 seconds and that with 18 tons 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.440
 fighting weight at 250 km / h attacks the 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.389
 involuntary self-control too 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.870
 we owe this mileage 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.520
 the 6.2 liter v8 of which is potential 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:00.139
 far from exhausted so 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:02.370
 casually, he shakes 457 ps off his sleeve 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.770
 the engine pushes out of the 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.629
 speed cellar so vehemently forward 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.340
 that can scare you 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:10.259
 except for a slight understeer 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.659
 There is a trend in the slow corners 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.370
 almost nothing to moan on a grand 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:18.199
 Prix ​​track with long straights see 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.199
 we even front the c63 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:28.170
 m3 against c 63 m gmbh against amg 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.330
 what used to be like a game of bavaria 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:34.050
 against meppen ended today is a duel 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.940
 be evaluated at eye level including package 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.680
 But one thing never was 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.680
 result between the two works so well 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.180
 how was the place in the bmw is 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.920
 still the author did himself in 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.110
 an overall composition easy and has 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.140
 a wonderful driving dynamics with 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.220
 appropriate performance that fits 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.710
 together that it really is a whole 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.880
 Round story is the Mercedes is 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.530
 people on the pelt put the thing 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.170
 has steam that is really incredible 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.930
 Nativity out of gas that pulls a squeeze 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.860
 in the rows of seats immense but 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.260
 driving dynamics is all about the 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.940
 bmw both exciting then stays simple 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.860
 The question is what will it look like when we leave 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.300
 sometime in three four years over here 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.070
 the next generation sit again 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:19.510
 then I believe in the air again 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:23.100
 M3 already felt thinner the breath of the c63 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.100
 now clearly in the neck
