00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
why I didn't like it at first when I did

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.859 
why I didn't like it at first when I did
apply<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> foundation<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:29.570> because<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> feels

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
apply a foundation is because it feels

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.109 
apply a foundation is because it feels
really<00:01:31.079> tacky<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> face<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.400> example<00:01:32.880> I

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
really tacky on the face for example I

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.880 
really tacky on the face for example I
feel<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.780> put<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.140> hand<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:34.470> face<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
