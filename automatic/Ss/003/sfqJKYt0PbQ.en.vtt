about a seven minute flight time with
the<00:00:41.309> s107<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> included

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the s107 so here we have the included

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.619 
the s107 so here we have the included
remote<00:00:44.040> control<00:00:44.460> which<00:00:44.579> operates<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.329> four

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
remote control which operates with four

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.360 
remote control which operates with four
double<00:00:45.960> A<00:00:46.050> batteries<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:46.829> also<00:00:46.980> able

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
double A batteries and you're also able

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.610 
double A batteries and you're also able
to<00:00:47.550> charge<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.210> helicopter<00:00:48.899> via<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> remote

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to charge the helicopter via the remote

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.130 
to charge the helicopter via the remote
control<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> will<00:00:51.239> drain<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:51.719> doublea's

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
control but it will drain your doublea's

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.380 
control but it will drain your doublea's
faster<00:00:52.670> here<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.270> off

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
faster here we have the on and off

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.450 
faster here we have the on and off
switch<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:55.020> also<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> throttle<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
switch we also have the throttle and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.299 
switch we also have the throttle and
then<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.719> look<00:00:57.870> at<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.230> stick<00:00:58.559> this

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
then if we look at the right stick this

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.400 
then if we look at the right stick this
will<00:00:59.550> turn<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.789> helicopter<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.629> left<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
will turn the helicopter right left and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.899 
will turn the helicopter right left and
I<00:01:02.129> believe<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.489> also<00:01:02.969> sort<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> turn<00:01:04.909> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
I believe will also sort of turn the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.630 
I believe will also sort of turn the
s107<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> different<00:01:07.530> direction<00:01:07.680> so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
s107 into a different direction so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.730 
s107 into a different direction so
flying<00:01:09.060> these<00:01:09.210> RC<00:01:09.600> helicopters<00:01:10.200> are<00:01:10.350> very

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
