00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.830
 splif if guys this one looks there's also 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.500

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.630
 I have to share with this video and if 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.610
 they like this server please can i 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.279
 leave the comments that you think and 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.840
 As you can see, a character has fallen 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.000
 it's burning I do not know why it's 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.079
 burning to see let's see why 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.579
 they were burning we're going up 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.940
 well it could be 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.090
 it is a bug 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.800
 in guys as you can see here is the 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.800
 server that is very cool 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.540
 and if we do not go on the left 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.329
 we can see that there is a small one like 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.500
 parkour which is very difficult do not 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.739
 I can pass it and well going out here 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.229
 would be what had been the games 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.920
 of split between can not be tent 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.690
 white with red and we push ourselves and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.180
 how they see maracay with a small portal 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.940
 and good guys can enter the game 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.850
 of split we have to give the board of 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.130
 below that says tap and if we want to be 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.460
 spectators we should enter where 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.200
 is the water very little guys are we going to be 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.050
 spectators a moment because they can 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.670
 see and well there we went to do 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.030
 spectators and how can we see there 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 they are as can be said if the games 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.649
 to be able to see our friends that 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.929
 are playing and if you do not want to see 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.690
 you throw around here with a road NomÃ¡s 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.770
 so you can throw yourself away 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.420
 it gives you xunta down at work and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.640
 you have to wait a few seconds for 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.950
 I loaded and as you can see it already loaded me 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.920
 and we would be playing the Server 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.470
 write which is falling very 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 fast is falling off the map 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.410
 let's try to try a game 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.470
 let's run we are the first and we 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.520
 we fell very young I'm going to stop for not 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.450
 make this video so long 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.750
 so another day I'll do a gameplay 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.660
 from server with is very cool to know 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.540
 break this one and how can we see what we 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.610
 we fall there 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.670
 that's why people are 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.010
 fire because they just lost the game 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.659
