 today 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.139
 for the defenders it's called the 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.639
 half early the establishment is simple on 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.290

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.750
 inside the red line with 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.029
 round a defender at the level of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.439
 ears of the circle of faceoffs and 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.079
 all the other defenders in the corner 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.329
 or if he is the coach the defender 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.250
 which is represented by number two is going 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.200
 make a quick start you have to skate 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.690
 at full speed to the blue line 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.520
 where he will make a complete stop at this 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.560
 moment there the coach will make him a 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.570
 past 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.090

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.780
 a pivot and your mornings of recoil on 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.690

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.260
 bus to get to the goal line he wants 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.510
 pivot and continues to control the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.390
 washer behind the net is like 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.790
 if you make it an exit in 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.700

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.640
 nets cut at the level of the net 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.469
