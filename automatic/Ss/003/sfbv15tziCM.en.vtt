anyway<00:00:25.289> yes<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.769> think<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.640> clean<00:00:26.880> up

anyway yes I think we have to clean up

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.029 
anyway yes I think we have to clean up
our<00:00:27.119> human<00:00:27.539> footprint<00:00:28.050> not<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.529> our<00:00:28.680> carbon

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
our human footprint not just our carbon

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.009

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
cleaning up the inequality yes is a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.319 
cleaning up the inequality yes is a
great<00:00:33.180> idea<00:00:33.600> my<00:00:34.590> argument<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.340> don't

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
great idea my argument is don't

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.080

think<00:00:51.510> i<00:00:51.570> should<00:00:51.719> point<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
think i should point out that the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
think i should point out that the
average<00:00:52.440> age<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.039> an<00:00:53.160> import<00:00:53.610> entering<00:00:54.030> new

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
average age of an import entering new

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.250 
average age of an import entering new
zealand<00:00:54.660> isn't<00:00:55.170> 14<00:00:55.739> years<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.460> eight<00:00:57.260> okay

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
zealand isn't 14 years it's eight okay

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260 
zealand isn't 14 years it's eight okay
the<00:00:58.620> average<00:00:59.070> age<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> vehicle<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.059> comes

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the average age of a vehicle that comes

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
the average age of a vehicle that comes
off<00:01:00.539> our<00:01:00.899> roads<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.500> means<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.010> gets<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
off our roads that means when it gets to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.969 
off our roads that means when it gets to
the<00:01:02.489> end<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.760> its<00:01:03.239> life<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.690> an<00:01:04.229> average<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.650> 18

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the end of its life is an average of 18

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.070 
the end of its life is an average of 18
years<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.299> wouldn't<00:01:06.570> make<00:01:06.600> sense<00:01:06.900> in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
years so it just wouldn't make sense in

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
years so it just wouldn't make sense in
putting<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> car<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.799> 14<00:01:08.130> years<00:01:08.250> old<00:01:08.520> so
