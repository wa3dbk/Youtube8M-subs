00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 moin moin love angelfreunde beautiful that 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.290
 I turned it on today 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.639
 welcome you with a strong petri 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:16.740
 healing and today is about different 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.670
 Roll types once best 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.920
 stationary role 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.920
 but first of all the intro 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.790
 yes so today I wanted you once the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.310
 Advantages of the world caster and of course 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.690
 also the disadvantages and the advantages of 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.330
 stationary and also the disadvantages 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.100
 explain stationary role 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.780
 we have two relative here 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.320
 quality roll with lace mother on 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.210
 be on it 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.530
 I'll start with the bed kaster 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.650
 and then it actually continues 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.660
 with the city of the role so the world 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.090
 Kaster consists of the following parts 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.979
 just as we roll that from stationary 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.940
 once we know here at the side 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.180
 the brake 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.690
 this is an alternate wall remorse that 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.940
 click 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.890
 you can set that very precisely and 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.560
 at the drill when I'm getting straight 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.330
 I can also crank up shortly 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.270
 just did not even stop here 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.640
 is the short introduction to the fish 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.020
 maybe a brake setting 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.110
 to give that he can escape better 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.340
 or that I'm a bit stronger 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.320
 brake needs because the fish is watching too 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.710
 makes a lot of noise then it goes on 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:45.070
 then we have here it is one 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:50.899
 the two brakes of the stationary roll 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.039
 that's the coarser looks partner 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.240
 and maybe a little click 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.960
 when you can very accurately 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.550
 to adjust 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.929
 even more accurate here on the 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.390
 on the other side, I'll get you right away 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.800
 again from the inside show up here 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.690
 Maybe you do not know if you see it now 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.500
 the camera focus up here stands up 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.270
 each case max and it holds the maximum 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.250
 Brake down adjustment is the minimum 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.290
 I have it on minimal white already very much 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.750
 long with bate karsten fischer and that 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.060
 can also estimate very well 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.000
 important if you are with this role 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.010
 throw that you take care that he the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.110
 thumb on it the throw on the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.750
 Although only have school because otherwise 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.450
 Can it happen? I'll show you this 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.819
 the whole thing will be back here that the art 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.819
 hold but has here so a button 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.580
 so that we are unlocked one is 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.360
 ready as here with the stationary roll 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.400
 the bar and if I look now 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.720
 if you see it, maybe 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.710
 I'm just moving here a bit 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.450
 If I have one now 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.150
 put a bit more pressure on it 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.879
 do 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.650
 often he saw that now it has 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.310
 that has been redistributed 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.659
 because the role has overturned so much 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.060
 I'll do it again now 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:04.530
 it can be there if you throw right 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.290
 that's a huge bird's nest or one 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.739
 wig, whatever you call it 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.450
 wants in there so now I wanted 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.810
 sometimes show what the front here is just 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:22.260
 the guide ring for the cord when 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:26.099
 I now see you here on the side 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.349
 here's the magnets that's the other one 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.750
 magnet brake so you can do the whole thing 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:36.840
 we adjust a bit more accurately 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.040
 there is just still the coil and that's it 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.750
 then actually 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.939
 maybe I could say if 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.769
 you like us that we do a whole that 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.540
 whole back so if I am 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.819
 now have the button down here 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.269
 then when the body is in the water 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.430
 you just have to stay here 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.959
 I press that was just it 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.859
 start cranking and stand out 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.139
 alone again 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.519
 So no annoying bark fold over there 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.079
 I'll give you a few as well 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.349
 to name advantages where to do it better 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.730
 use as a punch roll 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.069
 stationary or probably knows of 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.150
 I can give you each one again 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.730
 I have to explain a bit now 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.690
 do not do like the world class that 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.849
 is just the crank 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.459
 this will speed up the engine 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.079
 In turn, it's only going to school 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.880
 we have the brake up here 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.620
 it can also be with your can 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.539
 also be back then we have here 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.630
 another lever so I'm just one 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:36.510
 tripod came here we have a lever 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.400
 thinking makes it possible that we do not 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.699
 just crank forward but also sometimes 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.490
 cranking back is quite good considering the 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:46.490
 has to lie on the floor and the 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.460
 offers of money and then suddenly 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.349
 Of course you can also fit the fish 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.210
 Brake is easily set up 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:59.840
 matter of taste so there is more to the 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.840
 not really to say 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.190
 now you can still have a pub me 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.169
 Would you like some now ? 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:10.750
 Benefits therefore call once in the world 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.630
 kaarster the city in the roll away then 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.490
 I have a bit more freedom and 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.229
 the whole better to present so 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.570
 We have the world caster once 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.759
 advantage that we stop relatively fast 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.139
 can falsify are then relative 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.520
 quickly mastered it easily 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.699
 then push the cooler off 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.430
 directly back and we can directly 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.010
 boost 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.510
 that clearly has the advantage for 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.250
 vertical fishing where I am relatively flexible 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.199
 If you want to be downstairs , for example 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.419
 I would have to be with the rock 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.970
 stationary role is of course also 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.729
 not difficult now open the bar 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.440
 drain or if the straight velten 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.449
 is cranking up again then again 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.000
 drain off if it continues around 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.289
 So I'm always down 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.660
 I can do that almost with one hand 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:03.810
 that rutter catch on something again 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:07.510
 catch up on it much easier 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.000
 but most people have of course 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.919
 fear of his world caster because the 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.110
 just are not used to throw it 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.340
 I will do that in another one 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.590
 show video again how to 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.260
 properly with his band kaster throws like 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.229
 you make the right attitude and 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.500
 of course has a stationary role 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.090
 Of course, benefits if I am now 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.020
 for example, to throw small children 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:35.050
 this one is much better because here 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.460
 You can believe so you one gives it 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.960
 can of course also be smaller so that bait 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.659
 but throw if the stationary roll 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.330
 you get them much further that is 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:45.880
 clearly 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.919
 but I find here at the world 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.360
 casa I still have one if the 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.669
 fish now while falling at the predator fish 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.289
 you have a much better bite 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:56.770
 feeling 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:07:00.099
 and what is crucial here is 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.139
 that diverted the cord with the yes 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:04.000
 Here he gets and will be here 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.130
 redirected and then only on the roll 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.570
 played 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.909
 that has the disadvantage that the cord 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.070
 It is a buzz and how fast it stops 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.940
 worn out at the bike cups we have the 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.250
 advantage 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.500
 stop right on the spool on it comes 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.010
 and that there is no grudge there came 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.760
 in the cut fish much longer but 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:25.390
 everything a matter of taste 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.840
 I wanted to show you again 

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.730
 I thank you for your attention 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.250
 if you liked the video give 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:35.020
 thumbs up 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.650
 so that at the arge per second something 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.110
 you like it when their subjects wish 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:44.910
 unlike in the comments so i 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.910
 would say that basta 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.530
 Oh yeah, exactly 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.330
 but next time there still exist 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.990
 it's the long-awaited action video 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:58.480
 in the next weeks 

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:02.370
 I think we go after the pike 

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:07.150
 the first time to fish again 

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:11.290
 after first just like that hello when the 

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:14.980
 topics economy burden commentary with it 

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.510
 basta it then from me so under the motto 

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.530
 again looking clean 

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.530
 Bye my friends
