00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 and then to the crowd beauty coir iben 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.140
 add another video this time I'll bring 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.900
 for you a very short video that I 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.849
 talk about the new geforce ex kills if 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.900
 recently upgraded its driver from 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.519
 nvidia 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.550
 probably noticed that came one 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.990
 program called force spears is this 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 a really short video because it does not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.510
 there is a lot to talk about this program is 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.369
 this is the link that can download the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.800
 program do not have it yet will 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.179
 put the registration link 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 I'll tell you the main ones. 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.829
 things that this program does it does in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.570
 basically four things 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.370
 first of all he sees the games 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.540
 compatible with the program because it has 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.160
 a list of games compatible with a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.200
 just for you later he uses 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.090
 the game and now let's make it clear that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.039
 to optimize is nothing less than the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.989
 adjust the settings that the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.969
 nvidia thinks they are better for you 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 graphics card for that game then 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.329
 this program is doing nothing 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.340
 he is only adjusting his 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.079
 because people think that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.830
 are good settings for your board 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.780
 graphic and it updates the card driver 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.360
 so I'm here on the drivers tab 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.880
 will be able to update and search for 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 updates and he will then see if he is 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.689
 the video card driver and also 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.740
 even tell you the new driver 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.900
 I think it's really cool, I'm a 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.400
 person who loves to read the blog of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 Updates 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.920
 if you are going to identify talent will 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 you can completely open the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.920
 hoodie here gives of the differences of the new 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.810
 drive that they will then 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.610
 give graphs and such improvements as the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.259
 new driver brought that I think it is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.790
 very cool i really like ridgewell 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.840
 that she does it and besides that he 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.520
 and it will also give you information about the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.780
 that each configuration does this too 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.240
 I found it very interesting then 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.070
 example taking the child of 13 is having 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.659
 who see settings so violent 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.750
 to download a hit 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.270
 Simba effects koller iguape school and 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.590
 Mexico warned that only it does and it's legal 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.210
 that this program, which says exactly what 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.799
 What do you do then you have seen that I click 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.410
 on top of a school and put mouse 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.240
 on top and appeared better controls the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.580
 level of detail 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.640
 the memory used by objects such as trees 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.320
 rocks and buildings so it's very cool 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.480
 that this deforestation program if the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.010
 that each easy option then boss of which 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 He'll take you a picture, will you? 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.060
 show what is changing and will 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.160
 have a quick explanation of what that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.300
 option does this for all games 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.130
 compatible 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.870
 for example here quality and 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.460
 texture will get you an image in this 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.250
 if the number is text in three 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.050
 images that make up the whole explanation of 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.970
 all the graphic qualities and the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.280
 texture in texture quality will 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.200
 whether to increase or decrease the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.050
 texture resolution depending on the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.720
 quality proposing can click ok 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.640
 and he will then put the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.530
 settings that nvidia thinks are 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.810
 best practices in my case I do not use 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.460
 aa version optimized for no games 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.960
 because for me for example graphics card 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.150
 nvidia I think I have to use everything 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.000
 at most but I like to use at most 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.980
 10 was 35 Savvis Inc. , and when that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.660
 choose more beauty will stay what else 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.370
 he will show me with the green line 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.230
 cool bar looks like it's going to be 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.880
 super good but in my case I prefer 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.490
 shut down the v5 i have fps yet 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.600
 better then do not delude yourself here 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.880
 this is not making any changes 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.590
 drastic but simply apply the 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.870
 settings that nvidia finds better 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.010
 for you guys 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.900
 so I 'll give you another example here 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.090
 showing what each easy option 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.020
 for example here does not hesitate to 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.310
 example definition of definition leaves the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.740
 so the most defined image is ee 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.000
 deactivates the chambord to sit but only to 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.520
 To tell the truth, I did not know that. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.980
 when shinichi itoh try 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.440
 disables the young man though he did not know 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.180
 interesting then it's cool because he 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.430
 will explain exactly what each option 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.230
 easy and that's why we have a 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.880
 list of compatible games because the 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.860
 nvidia must have information about 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.600
 that game and about the graphics card to 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.730
 so I can give you a recommendation of the 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.560
 better options and they also have to 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.990
 what each option does then it is by 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.040
 this has a limited list of games 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.200
 compatible 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.730
 this one here she is limited games 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.070
 compatible you can put to flight 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.680
 to read or enter the link in the description 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.270
 that I will leave and remembering that too 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.280
 this program is not compatible with all 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.479
 swimmers must have at least one 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.430
 geforce 8001 thing so you can 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.800
 automatically update drivers 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.660
 the program will equip aa use 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.949
 must have at least one 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.669
 geforce 400 or 400 m 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.720
 so if you have the program and it does not 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.340
 is updating your drivers 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.009
 automatically then probably not 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.110
 has aa minimum graphics card required 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.970
 so you can update the drivers and 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.590
 if you have the program it is 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.970
 using the drivers only that it does not 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.500
 I'm giving you a configuration 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.169
 used for your games probably 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.800
 is because it does not have a geforce 400 or 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.539
 higher 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.370
 Other than that he'll tell you here what's the 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.960
 computer configuration and even 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.610
 on the same screen you can see if your 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.650
 computer fully compatible with 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.259
 the program and its uses or not 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.970
 That's a good program. 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.639
 it will only give you more explanations about what 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.330
 graphic settings make it puts 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.710
 so it downloads a nvidia profile from 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.270
 that they think it is 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.770
 better for your computer 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.449
 it updates the drivers here one thing 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.820
 very cool obviously keep the drivers 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.310
 updated and it gathers the games 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.740
 that you can and open them 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.479
 they directly from the program and that's it 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.099
 thank you guys for attending to 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.750
 Did you like this video please leave it? 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.610
 favorite if you want to see more videos

 With this, please sign up. 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.020
 You 'll be playing a lot doing 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.020
 it and that's it was worth
