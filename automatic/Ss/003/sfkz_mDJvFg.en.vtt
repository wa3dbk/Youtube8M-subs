00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:36.910
 and here is a work by rubens crista 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.850
 between two thieves that shows the 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.290
 technique and virtuosity of this painter 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.090
 this great canvas whose freshness is more 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.670
 that remarkable is in the museum of 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.800
 the Augustinians in Toulouse to answer 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.690
 to his commissions rubens needed a 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.699
 flexible and solid technique that could 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.860
 preserve the freshness of their colors 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.710
 but above all that allowed its 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.230
 transport throughout europe is where 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.480
 we discover the scientific side of this 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.579
 painter rubens mixed in varnish 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.950
 special and walnut oil and these 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.820
 they reacted by forming a paste their 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.360
 secret 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.190
 chew liquids you like doves and 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.580
 tonga with a toy because even with 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.580
 rodri 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.410
 comes from a tree called disco liu 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.119
 it is harvested by incision of the bark it 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.300
 preserved in the form of grains and 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.280
 transports easily was widely used 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.250
 as resin to clean the teeth and 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.900
 strengthen the gums in the 15th century was 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.090
 intensely marketed 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.310
 the witches city next to the studio 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.010
 de rubens and the genoa republic of the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.080
 that the island of chios is part of 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.820
 mastique is heated in the bain-marie and a 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.820
 Once liquid will suffice to give a layer of 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.680
 varnish to protect the canvas rubens 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.630
 I preferred to mix it with walnut oil 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.400
 to create by chemical reaction a 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.740
 exceptional pasta that added its 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.840
 pigments thus obtaining effects 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.120
 unpublished thanks to a fluid paste and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.400
 transparent so you get a 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.620
 true speed of execution away from 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.900
 slow and fragile process of techniques 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.970
 classic painting thanks to this 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.320
 light and dynamic procedure rubens 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.140
 could perform in a very short time 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.730
 canvases full of life and movement 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.560
 being thus very appreciated by the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.560
 great powerful of this era 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.090
 to 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.850
 ah
