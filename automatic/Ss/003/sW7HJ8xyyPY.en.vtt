might be asking well I've read another

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.440 
might be asking well I've read another
article<00:01:38.200> about<00:01:38.679> this<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.369> they<00:01:39.789> said<00:01:40.420> that

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
article about this and they said that

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.379 
article about this and they said that
spider-man<00:01:41.259> 3<00:01:41.889> which<00:01:42.340> apparently<00:01:42.670> active<00:01:43.240> and

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:43.389 
spider-man 3 which apparently active and

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:45.449 
spider-man 3 which apparently active and
Activision<00:01:44.049> makes<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.469> game<00:01:44.679> for<00:01:45.100> spider-man

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
Activision makes the game for spider-man

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:46.410 
Activision makes the game for spider-man
I

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
I

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.359 
I
that<00:01:47.420> that<00:01:47.689> could<00:01:47.869> be<00:01:47.960> coming<00:01:48.290> out<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:48.979> most

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
that that could be coming out but most

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.450 
that that could be coming out but most
likely<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:50.090> sounds<00:01:50.570> more<00:01:50.810> like<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:51.500> trilogy<00:01:52.280> of

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
likely it sounds more like a trilogy of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.160 
likely it sounds more like a trilogy of
a<00:01:52.610> series<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:53.240> we'd<00:01:53.420> like<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.689> little<00:01:54.049> bit

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
a series that we'd like a little bit

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.800 
a series that we'd like a little bit
more<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.799> being<00:01:55.039> black<00:01:55.340> ops<00:01:55.820> 3<00:01:56.299> so

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
more and that being black ops 3 so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.050 
more and that being black ops 3 so
hopefully<00:01:57.229> this<00:01:57.680> does<00:01:57.979> mean<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.310> like

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
hopefully this does mean that like

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.810 
hopefully this does mean that like
officially<00:02:00.020> we<00:02:00.200> are<00:02:00.470> getting<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.579> call<00:02:01.759> of

duty black ops 3 that is assuming that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.139

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
mean I don't know if it really is or it

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.220
