00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.220
 hello today I'll teach you how you can 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.680
 get these lovely curls in shape 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.050
 of spiral without using absolutely anything 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.120
 of heat this method not only did not have 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.519
 hair and gives us beautiful results 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.349
 but it is also very cheap only 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.270
 requires a single tool the 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.580
 hairpin my favorite part though 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.900
 is that you sleep very comfortably 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.270
 curls are perfect for any 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.430
 occasion because you can use a little 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.930
 more casually or you can also 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.330
 make it look a bit more elegant 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.460
 depending on what clothes you like and how 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.620
 you use your hair here you have two examples 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.329
 of how I liked to comb my hair when I 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.949
 August curls these hairstyles are 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.530
 perfect for autumn and winter 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.389
 because how it keeps us in our hair 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.859
 out of our face we have to 

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:44.959
 worry about the wind making us 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.499
 our hairstyle good and if you like this 

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:46.969
 video 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:49.489
 the other two videos please do not 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.600
 forget to comment subscribe give me 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.010
 thumbs up and also 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.749
 share my videos that helps me 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.429
 very much and good since I start 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.530
 after I had made sure that my 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:59.839
 Hair is free of tangles or knots 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.850
 then my first match I like 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.499
 make my first section a 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.580
 box that is about 2 inches in 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.920
 wide and long 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.740
 that this mere opposite and above me 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.680
 head then you just want to start 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.020
 to roll up your hair as you can see 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.090
 each time he placed the hair under the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.190
 section that I just created 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.780
 although the theory is very easy to have in 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.850
 note that this does require a bit of 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.250
 practice by continuing to wind this knot 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.740
 that we have created is going to get more and more 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.110
 tight then at first you want 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.390
 take that into account and compensate so that 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.420
 then your knot is not too tight and 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.130
 so you can sleep comfortably at the same time 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.600
 However, they do not want to be very 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.300
 loose if you are not going to stay in your 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.580
 place since I finished I like to use 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.560
 a couple of guides to make sure that 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.229
 I often fall down while I sleep in 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.900
 the night then you just want 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.940
 repeat this same process in the rest 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.280
 of our hair the other sections 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.470
 however they are going to be not very wide but 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.320
 if long this is going to give us an effect 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.030
 similar to that of a waterfall means 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.550
 that although all our hair is going to 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.159
 be curly and beautiful the sections of 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.039
 up will be 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.500
 from above but the sections below 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.840
 for example good until curled from 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.840
 as in the middle in this way our 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.580
 Hair stays long to get 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.440
 this result at the end is also very 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.379
 important that we put the knots what 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.480
 highest possible as you can see all 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.340
 the knots are concentrated in the part 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.650
 from above my head and in this way 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.989
 you can sleep very comfortably because 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.200
 they will not bother us at all while 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.420
 I slept I have experienced enough 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.269
 I have put them in different ways 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.519
 I have put few then many and this has 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.829
 been my favorite method and that's why 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.840
 I'm sharing with all of you if 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.959
 are you liking the video please do not 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.610
 forget to subscribe to share and give me 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.680
 thumbs up if they have not done it 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.079
 still 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.359
 I would like to mention that in this video 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.849
 Water is not my product and not 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.950
 I recommend you do it if 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.219
 they decide to use it, I recommend that they use 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.079
 as little as possible because or if they do not run 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.629
 the risk that they have not dried 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.530
 in the morning when they are ready to 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.530
 remove the knots 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.659
 as you can see this process is very 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.360
 repetitive and that way you 'll be an expert 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.760
 finish the first time you do this 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.340
 it's going to be a bit difficult but with 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.709
 the practice we see very easy and it is done 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.049
 very fast I can do it in about 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.750
 10-15 minutes and so in the morning 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.310
 awake with lovely hair and the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.360
 I really do not take much time to 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.360
 get ready in the morning 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.319
 since you've finished rolling everything 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.870
 your hair should you see a little 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.909
 A) Yes 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.610
 and well now you just have them 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:57.010
 to leave for about 4 hours but 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.920
 I like to sleep with them and the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.170
 tomorrow they are very very easy to undo 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.819
 they simply take out the forks and 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.819
 then they develop them 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.010
 and well that's how we can get 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.380
 unused spiral curls 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.940
 absolutely nothing really warm 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.519
 I hope you liked this method 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.560
 as much as I like it to me is one of my 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.020
 favorites not only because you sleep very 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.750
 comfortably but also because it is very 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.419
 easy and only requires a 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.190
 tool the fork and good since 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.650
 I 've taken all the knots now 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.440
 you just want to take each section and 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.150
 then separate it into many sections this 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.150
 will give us a lot of volume at the end 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.029
 and that's all I hope you liked 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:02.039
