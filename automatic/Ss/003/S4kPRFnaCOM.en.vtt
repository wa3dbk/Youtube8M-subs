hey guys how's it going this is Tom
Burkhart<00:00:04.620> for<00:00:04.830> top<00:00:05.009> speed<00:00:05.279> calm<00:00:05.670> we're

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
Burkhart for top speed calm we're

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.400 
Burkhart for top speed calm we're
sitting<00:00:06.359> here<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.720> new<00:00:06.810> Pathfinder

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
sitting here in the new Pathfinder

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.440 
sitting here in the new Pathfinder
platinum<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.760> wanted<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.059> take<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> quick

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
platinum and I wanted to take a quick

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.830 
platinum and I wanted to take a quick
video<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.809> show<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.769> guys<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> couple<00:00:11.340> things

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
video to show you guys a couple things

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.910 
video to show you guys a couple things
namely<00:00:12.840> about<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.110> drivetrain<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.340> cbt

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
namely about the drivetrain and the cbt

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.900 
namely about the drivetrain and the cbt
lockable<00:00:16.920> all-wheel<00:00:17.250> drive<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
lockable all-wheel drive at the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.570 
lockable all-wheel drive at the
Pathfinder<00:00:18.390> platinum<00:00:18.779> comes<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.520> you

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
Pathfinder platinum comes with so you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.920 
Pathfinder platinum comes with so you
know<00:00:20.760> we've<00:00:20.939> obviously<00:00:21.060> grabbed<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.660> lot<00:00:21.779> about

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
know we've obviously grabbed a lot about

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.870 
know we've obviously grabbed a lot about
cvts<00:00:22.470> here<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.769> top<00:00:22.949> speed<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.699> they're

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
cvts here on top speed and they're

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.060 
cvts here on top speed and they're
typically<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.390> great<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.260> is

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
typically not great but this one is

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.189 
typically not great but this one is
really<00:00:26.760> very<00:00:26.970> surprising<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.840> number<00:00:28.109> of

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
really very surprising for a number of

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.830 
really very surprising for a number of
reasons<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.830> first<00:00:29.609> off<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.539> three<00:00:30.810> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
reasons the first off is this three and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.830 
reasons the first off is this three and
a<00:00:30.929> half<00:00:31.080> liter<00:00:31.349> v6<00:00:31.910> only<00:00:32.910> makes<00:00:33.180> 260

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
a half liter v6 only makes 260

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.139 
a half liter v6 only makes 260
horsepower<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.640> 240<00:00:35.640> pound<00:00:35.850> feet<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> torque

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
horsepower and 240 pound feet of torque

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.720 
horsepower and 240 pound feet of torque
so<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:37.620> we're<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:37.829> talking<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
so you know we're not talking the the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.940 
so you know we're not talking the the
top<00:00:39.000> output<00:00:39.450> level<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.110> engine<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
top output level of this engine but it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.209 
top output level of this engine but it
is<00:00:41.070> more<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> door<00:00:41.969> durability<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
is more of the door durability and

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.760 
is more of the door durability and
torque<00:00:44.219> truck<00:00:44.789> type<00:00:45.030> engine<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:46.379> anyway<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
torque truck type engine but anyway the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.470 
torque truck type engine but anyway the
thing<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.070> makes<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> CVT<00:00:47.640> special<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.360> me

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
thing that makes the CVT special for me

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
thing that makes the CVT special for me
is<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.289> when<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.590> driving<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> road

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
is that when you're driving on the road

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.360 
is that when you're driving on the road
at<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:50.579> 35<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.180> 40<00:00:51.420> miles<00:00:51.570> an<00:00:51.750> hour<00:00:52.190> like<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
at about 35 or 40 miles an hour like you

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.970 
at about 35 or 40 miles an hour like you
would<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:54.289> tons<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.500> roads<00:00:55.739> all

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
would on you know tons of roads all

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.220 
would on you know tons of roads all
across<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.430> country<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.719> want<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> just

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
across the country and you want to just

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.830 
across the country and you want to just
do<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> quick<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.850> quick<00:01:00.300> increase<00:01:00.690> in

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
do a quick you know a quick increase in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.650 
do a quick you know a quick increase in
speed<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.199> actually<00:01:01.530> has<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> kick<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.660> it's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
speed it actually has a kick down it's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179 
speed it actually has a kick down it's
you<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.350> rough<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:05.040> it's

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you know and it's not rough but it's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.789 
you know and it's not rough but it's
it's<00:01:05.460> definitely<00:01:05.640> perceptible<00:01:06.590> I'd<00:01:07.590> say

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it's definitely perceptible I'd say

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.640 
it's definitely perceptible I'd say
along<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> lines<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.750> latest<00:01:10.080> ZF<00:01:10.350> box

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
along the lines of the latest ZF box

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.350 
along the lines of the latest ZF box
it's<00:01:10.950> got<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.790> has<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> kick<00:01:12.180> down

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it's got you know it has a kick down

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.640 
it's got you know it has a kick down
that<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.780> feel<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.380> which<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that you can feel which is which is

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.440 
that you can feel which is which is
better<00:01:13.920> than<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.369> alternative<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> CVT

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
better than the alternative for a CVT

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.080 
better than the alternative for a CVT
which<00:01:15.840> previously<00:01:16.310> would<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.490> sort<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.759> rev

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
which previously would just sort of rev

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.140 
which previously would just sort of rev
up<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> car<00:01:19.470> would<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> few<00:01:20.670> seconds

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
up but the car would take a few seconds

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.109 
up but the car would take a few seconds
to<00:01:21.350> catch<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.979> noise<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
to catch up with that noise that you

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
to catch up with that noise that you
heard<00:01:24.270> from<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.570> engine<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:26.100> other<00:01:26.250> thing

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
heard from the engine the other thing

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.710 
heard from the engine the other thing
that<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:27.030> find<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> know

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that I really find it you know

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.780 
that I really find it you know
incredible<00:01:28.259> about<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> cv<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.950> first<00:01:29.220> up<00:01:29.369> cbc

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
incredible about the cv is first up cbc

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.520 
incredible about the cv is first up cbc
boxes<00:01:30.299> could<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.659> even<00:01:30.810> handle<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.290> much

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
boxes could not even handle this much

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.770 
boxes could not even handle this much
torque<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.340> very<00:01:32.790> recently<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.600> they've

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
torque you know very recently so they've

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.120 
torque you know very recently so they've
been<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.229> investing<00:01:34.740> pretty<00:01:34.920> heavily

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
been you know investing pretty heavily

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.730 
been you know investing pretty heavily
and<00:01:35.549> making<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> CB<00:01:36.630> t<00:01:36.780> box<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.170> viable<00:01:37.350> thing

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and making the CB t box a viable thing

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.859 
and making the CB t box a viable thing
and<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> reasons<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.780> very

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
and the reasons for that are it's very

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.160 
and the reasons for that are it's very
cheap<00:01:40.320> its<00:01:40.680> durable<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.490> its<00:01:42.360> lightweight<00:01:42.570> so

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
cheap its durable and its lightweight so

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.990 
cheap its durable and its lightweight so
something<00:01:43.950> that's<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.280> often<00:01:44.460> talked<00:01:44.759> about

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
something that's not often talked about

something that's not often talked about
with<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> dual<00:01:45.450> clutch<00:01:45.659> boxes<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.799> they<00:01:46.979> weigh

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
with the dual clutch boxes is they weigh

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.580 
with the dual clutch boxes is they weigh
twice<00:01:47.399> as<00:01:47.579> much<00:01:47.729> i<00:01:47.909> mean<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
twice as much i mean they have to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.399 
twice as much i mean they have to
huge<00:01:48.859> budgets<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.210> that's<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.140> that's<00:01:51.320> a

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
huge budgets so that's so that's a

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.639 
huge budgets so that's so that's a
problem<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.799> Lamborghini<00:01:52.219> has<00:01:52.609> mentioned

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
problem that Lamborghini has mentioned

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.590 
problem that Lamborghini has mentioned
many<00:01:54.649> times<00:01:54.740> but<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:56.240> know<00:01:56.329> I<00:01:56.359> don't<00:01:56.570> think

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
many times but you know I don't think

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.270 
many times but you know I don't think
they'll<00:01:56.840> be<00:01:56.899> going<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.229> CBT<00:01:57.649> route<00:01:57.890> anyway

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
they'll be going the CBT route anyway

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.459 
they'll be going the CBT route anyway
but<00:01:58.609> but<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.359> Pathfinder<00:01:59.899> really<00:02:00.170> isn't<00:02:00.319> a

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
but but the Pathfinder really isn't a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.889 
but but the Pathfinder really isn't a
worse<00:02:00.710> car<00:02:01.100> for<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.299> think<00:02:02.359> it's<00:02:02.630> gotten

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
worse car for it and I think it's gotten

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.190 
worse car for it and I think it's gotten
really<00:02:03.490> unjustified<00:02:04.490> sort<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:06.069> shaming<00:02:07.069> for

really unjustified sort of shaming for

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
I mean what I was thinking is just this

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.080 
I mean what I was thinking is just this
might<00:02:45.140> be<00:02:45.290> kind<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.470> clever<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.910> know<00:02:47.030> if

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
might be kind of clever but you know if

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.520 
might be kind of clever but you know if
the<00:02:47.209> Pathfinder<00:02:47.750> can't<00:02:47.989> find<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.379> way<00:02:48.470> to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
the Pathfinder can't find the way to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.759 
the Pathfinder can't find the way to
