harder<00:00:52.079> altogether<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.800> instead<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.310> make

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
harder altogether and instead just make

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.680 
harder altogether and instead just make
games<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:53.940> other<00:00:54.060> consoles<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.600> the

so I don't know where I'm going half the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.850 
so I don't know where I'm going half the
time<00:03:11.689> even<00:03:11.900> though<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.230> game<00:03:12.379> is<00:03:12.500> meant<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.769> be
