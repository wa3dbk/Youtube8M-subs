works is there are five different game

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.929 
works is there are five different game
levels<00:01:51.469> with<00:01:51.679> four<00:01:51.950> rounds<00:01:52.340> each<00:01:52.460> each

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
levels with four rounds each each

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.330 
levels with four rounds each each
pyramid<00:01:53.359> consisting<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.140> around<00:01:54.560> so

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
pyramid consisting of around so

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.950 
pyramid consisting of around so
basically<00:01:55.670> after<00:01:55.850> every<00:01:56.210> four<00:01:56.450> pyramids

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
basically after every four pyramids

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.990 
basically after every four pyramids
there'll<00:01:57.259> be<00:01:57.289> some<00:01:57.590> changes<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:58.789> first

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
there'll be some changes in the first

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.029 
there'll be some changes in the first
level<00:01:59.359> you'll<00:01:59.539> jump<00:01:59.780> on<00:01:59.899> a<00:01:59.929> cube<00:02:00.259> it'll<00:02:00.799> change

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
level you'll jump on a cube it'll change

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.859 
level you'll jump on a cube it'll change
to<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.490> destination<00:02:02.060> color<00:02:02.299> and<00:02:02.539> that's

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
to the destination color and that's

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.020 
to the destination color and that's
pretty<00:02:03.049> much<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.469> in<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:04.219> second<00:02:04.520> level<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
pretty much it in the second level the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.459 
pretty much it in the second level the
first<00:02:05.240> time<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.570> jump<00:02:05.780> on<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:05.899> cube<00:02:06.200> it'll

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
first time you jump on a cube it'll

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.469 
first time you jump on a cube it'll
change<00:02:06.679> to<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.130> intermediate<00:02:07.729> color<00:02:07.969> and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
change to the intermediate color and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.850 
change to the intermediate color and
you'll<00:02:08.600> have<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.810> jump<00:02:08.990> on<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.289> against<00:02:09.619> change

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
you'll have to jump on it against change

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.500 
you'll have to jump on it against change
it<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.130> destination<00:02:10.340> color<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.450> you

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
it to the destination color so you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.670 
it to the destination color so you
basically<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.960> jump<00:02:12.140> on<00:02:12.200> every<00:02:12.440> cube

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
basically have to jump on every cube

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.340 
basically have to jump on every cube
twice<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:14.240> third<00:02:14.420> level<00:02:14.630> you'll<00:02:15.050> jump<00:02:15.260> on

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
twice in the third level you'll jump on

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.809 
twice in the third level you'll jump on
a<00:02:15.380> cube<00:02:15.680> it'll<00:02:16.250> go<00:02:16.370> straight<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
a cube it'll go straight to the

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.670 
a cube it'll go straight to the
destination<00:02:17.330> color<00:02:17.540> again<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.260> if<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.440> jump

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
destination color again but if you jump

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.500 
destination color again but if you jump
back<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.160> again<00:02:19.400> it'll<00:02:20.000> go<00:02:20.180> back<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
back on it again it'll go back to the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.330 
back on it again it'll go back to the
original<00:02:20.840> color<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.860> this<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.190> when<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
original color so this is when the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.100 
original color so this is when the
strategy<00:02:22.819> really<00:02:23.000> starts<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.420> come<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.750> you

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
strategy really starts to come in you

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.059 
strategy really starts to come in you
don't<00:02:24.170> want<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.410> paint<00:02:24.560> yourself<00:02:24.620> into<00:02:24.890> a

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
don't want to paint yourself into a

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.680 
don't want to paint yourself into a
corner<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.700> hop<00:02:25.850> on<00:02:26.030> some<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.420> ones<00:02:26.600> you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
corner and hop on some of the ones you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.390 
corner and hop on some of the ones you
already<00:02:26.870> changed<00:02:27.380> because<00:02:27.890> you'll<00:02:28.190> need<00:02:28.340> to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
already changed because you'll need to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.809 
already changed because you'll need to
change<00:02:28.640> them<00:02:28.790> again

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
change them again

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.369 
change them again
and<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> fourth<00:02:30.420> level<00:02:30.629> you'll<00:02:30.989> jump<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.349> a

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
and the fourth level you'll jump on a

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.990 
and the fourth level you'll jump on a
cube<00:02:31.680> it'll<00:02:32.310> change<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.790> intermediate

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
cube it'll change to the intermediate

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.300 
cube it'll change to the intermediate
color<00:02:33.540> then<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.260> destination<00:02:34.560> color<00:02:35.129> when

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
color then the destination color when

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.280 
color then the destination color when
you<00:02:35.370> jump<00:02:35.609> on<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.879> again<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:36.900> when<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.079> jump

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you jump on it again but when you jump

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.780 
you jump on it again but when you jump
on<00:02:37.439> in<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.590> third<00:02:37.739> time<00:02:38.040> it'll<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.459> back<00:02:38.640> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
on in the third time it'll go back to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.069 
on in the third time it'll go back to
the<00:02:38.909> intermediate<00:02:39.120> color<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:39.870> you'll<00:02:39.989> have

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
the intermediate color and you'll have

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.599 
the intermediate color and you'll have
to<00:02:40.200> jump<00:02:40.409> back<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.859> again<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.250> change<00:02:41.489> it

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
to jump back on it again to change it

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.819 
to jump back on it again to change it
through<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.909> destination<00:02:42.510> color<00:02:42.719> and<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
through the destination color and the

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.589 
through the destination color and the
fifth<00:02:44.040> level<00:02:44.310> you'll<00:02:44.489> jump<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.819> cube<00:02:45.120> it'll

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
fifth level you'll jump on a cube it'll

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.240 
fifth level you'll jump on a cube it'll
change<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.140> intermediate<00:02:46.560> color<00:02:46.829> than

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
change to the intermediate color than

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.280 
change to the intermediate color than
the<00:02:47.400> destination<00:02:47.579> color<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.959> jump<00:02:49.170> on

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
the destination color but if you jump on

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.960 
the destination color but if you jump on
it<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.439> third<00:02:49.650> time<00:02:49.950> it'll<00:02:50.280> go<00:02:50.489> back<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
it a third time it'll go back to the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:51.920 
it a third time it'll go back to the
original<00:02:51.060> color

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
original color

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.140 
original color
it<00:02:52.680> gets<00:02:52.859> pretty<00:02:53.010> freakin<00:02:53.459> challenging<00:02:53.939> cuz

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
it gets pretty freakin challenging cuz

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.610 
it gets pretty freakin challenging cuz
it's<00:02:54.390> not<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:54.989> just<00:02:55.019> hop<00:02:55.319> through<00:02:55.590> a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
it's not like you can just hop through a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.559 
it's not like you can just hop through a
specific<00:02:56.159> sequence<00:02:56.370> with<00:02:56.670> blocks<00:02:56.939> you<00:02:57.510> have

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
specific sequence with blocks you have

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.449 
specific sequence with blocks you have
to<00:02:57.720> avoid<00:02:57.959> all<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:58.200> other<00:02:58.500> too<00:02:58.889> so<00:02:59.219> your

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
to avoid all this other too so your

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.699 
to avoid all this other too so your
path<00:02:59.639> could<00:02:59.909> be<00:02:59.969> thwarted<00:03:00.510> all<00:03:01.469> these

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
path could be thwarted all these

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.500 
path could be thwarted all these
elements<00:03:01.950> basically<00:03:02.280> makes<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:02.909> a<00:03:02.970> puzzle

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
elements basically makes this a puzzle

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.720 
elements basically makes this a puzzle
platformer<00:03:04.049> an<00:03:04.530> interesting<00:03:05.189> fusion<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.609> the

get an extra life after the first five
rounds<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.879> then<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:12.359> get<00:03:12.480> one<00:03:12.540> after<00:03:12.930> every

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
rounds and then you get one after every

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.349 
rounds and then you get one after every
four<00:03:13.349> rounds<00:03:13.680> thereafter<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.519> can<00:03:15.150> change

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
four rounds thereafter you can change

four rounds thereafter you can change
the<00:03:15.540> difficulty<00:03:15.870> adjustments<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:16.829> there<00:03:17.069> are

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
the difficulty adjustments but there are

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.949 
the difficulty adjustments but there are
no<00:03:17.400> game<00:03:17.639> variations<00:03:18.000> which<00:03:18.540> isn't<00:03:18.689> a<00:03:18.840> big

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
simplicity although it would have been

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.509 
simplicity although it would have been

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
nice to have the option to start out on

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.979 
nice to have the option to start out on
one<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:26.909> more<00:03:27.060> difficult<00:03:27.239> levels<00:03:27.810> for

one of the more difficult levels for

shits and giggles I do have two

shits and giggles I do have two
complaints<00:03:30.720> although<00:03:31.319> they're<00:03:31.530> both<00:03:31.560> minor

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010

first<00:03:32.939> is<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.359> control<00:03:33.720> scheme<00:03:34.019> moving<00:03:34.769> the

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
first is the control scheme moving the

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.559 
first is the control scheme moving the
joystick<00:03:35.040> up<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.669> move<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.940> up<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.329> write

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
joystick up and move you up and write

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.439 
joystick up and move you up and write
down<00:03:37.169> moves<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.709> down<00:03:37.919> and<00:03:38.159> left/right<00:03:39.090> moves

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
down moves you down and left/right moves

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.330 
down moves you down and left/right moves
you<00:03:39.569> down<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.049> right<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.530> left<00:03:40.560> moves<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.310> up

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
you down and right and left moves you up

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.699 
you down and right and left moves you up
and<00:03:41.609> left<00:03:41.819> it's<00:03:42.479> weird<00:03:42.780> but<00:03:42.989> it's<00:03:43.199> not<00:03:43.379> hard<00:03:43.620> to

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
and left it's weird but it's not hard to

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.830 
and left it's weird but it's not hard to
get<00:03:43.889> used<00:03:44.069> to<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.519> an<00:03:44.909> even<00:03:45.120> better<00:03:45.269> idea<00:03:45.329> is

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
get used to and an even better idea is

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.479 
get used to and an even better idea is
to<00:03:46.019> turn<00:03:46.199> the<00:03:46.379> joystick<00:03:46.769> at<00:03:46.859> an<00:03:46.979> angle<00:03:47.280> so

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
to turn the joystick at an angle so

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.819 
to turn the joystick at an angle so
you'll<00:03:47.699> be<00:03:47.849> directed<00:03:48.329> appropriately<00:03:48.959> so

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
you'll be directed appropriately so

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.559 
you'll be directed appropriately so
although<00:03:49.979> it's<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.310> little<00:03:50.519> funky<00:03:50.699> it's<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.359> very

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
although it's a little funky it's a very

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.439 
although it's a little funky it's a very
minor<00:03:51.870> issue<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:53.250> other<00:03:53.370> flaw<00:03:53.669> is<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.269> lack

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
minor issue the other flaw is the lack

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.270 
minor issue the other flaw is the lack
of<00:03:54.479> animation<00:03:55.139> with<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.379> objects<00:03:55.829> aside<00:03:56.129> from

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
of animation with the objects aside from

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.369 
of animation with the objects aside from
cuber<00:03:56.669> you<00:03:57.209> just<00:03:57.389> magically<00:03:57.870> appear<00:03:58.169> on<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
cuber you just magically appear on the

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.839 
cuber you just magically appear on the
next<00:03:58.530> block<00:03:58.739> which<00:03:59.129> makes<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.519> harder<00:03:59.819> to

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
next block which makes it harder to

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.539 
next block which makes it harder to
react<00:04:00.239> if<00:04:00.510> they're<00:04:00.750> nearby<00:04:01.019> so<00:04:01.979> I<00:04:02.010> say<00:04:02.340> just

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
react if they're nearby so I say just

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.800 
react if they're nearby so I say just
try<00:04:02.699> to<00:04:02.790> keep<00:04:02.940> as<00:04:03.090> far<00:04:03.120> away<00:04:03.359> from<00:04:03.449> them<00:04:03.659> as

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
try to keep as far away from them as

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.469 
try to keep as far away from them as
possible<00:04:04.220> other<00:04:05.220> than<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.699> this<00:04:06.030> port<00:04:06.359> is

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
possible other than that this port is

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.129 
possible other than that this port is
well<00:04:06.690> done<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.169> highly<00:04:07.620> recommended
