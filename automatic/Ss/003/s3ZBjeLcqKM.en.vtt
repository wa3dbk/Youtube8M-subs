 I'm really grateful to you 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.570
 that production is not the opposite 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.520
 we know it's going to be a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.410
 tremendous presentation tomorrow 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.390
 but we talk about where you are from 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.460

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.460

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:56.809
 brothers and sisters of a man that you 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.809
 it's great 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.700
 that dragged and how the taste for 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.650
 the music and how he started to like that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.070
 little worm of music and from there 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.070
 relatives within music 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.299
 usually you see all sing 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.810
 times well scenarios that have 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.810
 family musicians 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.220
 and how do you feel as a woman do 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.229
 missing more women at noon you see the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.110
 disappeared selena quintanilla now 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.729
 recently what happened with jane and the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.220
 great talents of music how do you 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.360
 you feel on behalf of the woman 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.360
 in the singing at this time 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:47.270
 and I think it's not like a man or a 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.160
 woman in that I believe while you have the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.800
 desire 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.750
 everything can be is as if it is a 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.280
 bit harder because we are in a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.870
 other genres that come in the region the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.690
 Mexican you already see that so 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.850
 regulate those who excel in that genre 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.979
 it's the men but the women also 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.480
 you have everything to succeed you bring a great 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.910
 promoter that goes around from that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.340
 been on several occasions in the famous 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.630
 wave and house and we go directly to 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.970
 organized we are going to present before the day 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.530

 also to them live 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.120
 then but I think it's going to be something 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.920
 unforgettable because I'll put in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.270
 too many issues that I was as well as 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.080
 I never thought I was going to meet them 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.080
 so 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.280
 an opportunity something to be able to follow 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.290
