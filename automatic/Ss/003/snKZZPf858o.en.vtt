00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
each other and then realized that they

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.260 
each other and then realized that they
had<00:01:04.680> actually<00:01:05.189> gone<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> call<00:01:05.729> us<00:01:05.939> together

had actually gone to call us together

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.719 
had actually gone to call us together
and<00:01:06.780> initially<00:01:07.530> they<00:01:07.920> hadn't<00:01:08.310> recognized

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and initially they hadn't recognized

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.920 
and initially they hadn't recognized
each<00:01:08.939> other<00:01:09.150> which<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.780> not

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
each other which I know is not

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.899 
each other which I know is not
necessarily<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.650> good<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.790> then

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
necessarily a good thing but then

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.340 
necessarily a good thing but then
eventually<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.540> figured<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.229> they

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
eventually they figured out that they

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140
