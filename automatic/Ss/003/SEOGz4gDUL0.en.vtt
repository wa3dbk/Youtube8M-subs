00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.850
 in this video we will tell you what is 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.250
 cassette hub try to explain 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.389
 principle of its work 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.110
 consider the most common 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.450
 problems, their causes and remedies 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.279
 before the appearance of cassette bushings 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.369
 used threaded bushings with 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.990
 they looked like ratchets 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.580
 way 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.050
 the body of the shelf had a thread on which 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.740
 twisted ratchet with the right 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.740
 number of teeth 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.460
 unfortunately with this design 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.440
 the minimum number of teeth will be 13 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.559
 riders desire was to reduce the front 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.110
 leading star while leaving the same 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.000
 gear ratio to smaller star 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 everyone wanted to come first because 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.730
 less weight but someone did it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.160
 just because of the appearance to 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.840
 keep transmission ratio decreasing 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.260
 front star must be reduced and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.149
 the back therefore meaning ratchets 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.530
 moved the idea inside the sleeve 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.080
 borrowed from mtb 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.299
 so there were bmx cassette bushings 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 the industry has now become possible 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.680
 use changeable stars with 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.549
 number of teeth from 16 to 12 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.040
 but that was n't enough for bmx either. 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.439
 its whole body driver was invented 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.170
 reduces the number of teeth to 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.610
 8 9 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.759
 principle of operation of the cassette mechanism and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.530
 The drivers are the same fairly simple with 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.409
 On the one hand, we have flags 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.280
 pushing the springs with another body 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.280
 Turks gear 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.609
 today most riders 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.520
 around the world riding with cassettes bushings 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.740
 some of you have probably knocked on 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.530
 We will deal with them most often. 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.189
 meeting and diner easy driver 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:03.920
 broken bearings cleaned 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:06.549
 skipping driver 4 flags exact 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.869
 axle bearing seat 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.720
 as you see most problems 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.680
 arises with the driver and these problems 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.470
 There are only two reasons: the first one 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.150
 constructive classic driver with 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.400
 four flags and 1 spring 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.239
 initially have apt and zapa 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.420
 checkboxes it happens because 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:36.920
 the spring has a break and a load on 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:39.019
 flash drive is distributed unevenly in 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.239
 the result of sticking flags driver 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.579
 loses one point of support and starts 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.829
 rotate axially skewed in such 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.380
 cases, you notice that the driver like 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.560
 slips off 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.019
 bearing load increases dramatically 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.150
 as a result 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.040
 the ball holdings both collapse 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.769
 the so -called separator and pasu instant 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.480
 splits most often first not 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.030
 withstand the most loaded on the far 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.739
 shinnik located closer to pashka after 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.260
 which under the influence of increased 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.040
 loads and broken fragments break 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.829
 remaining 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.900
 This situation most often occurs with 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.940
 ninth drivers where unlike 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.910
 tenths are smaller fragile 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.190
 bearings compare most often 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.579
 used bearings in tenths and 9 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.220
 Drivers on the principle of working these 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.690
 bearings is no different 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.690
 Differences only in size than more 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.920
 Pashin topic large ball and tougher 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.210
 kind of 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.140
 damaged bearings increase 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.300
 driver skew 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:46.270
 and their fragments begin to grind the neck 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.920
 axes are what it can lead to 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.620
 these problems solved some 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.630
 manufacturers of sleeves as we found out 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.660
 the basis of all the problems in the mechanism of the driver 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.940
 bad checkbox as you remember 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.190
 the reasons for this were uneven 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.770
 spring pressure on the flash drive and for them 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.480
 different distances from the gap such 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.100
 brands like hoffman and demolisher 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.530
 solved this problem by adding 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.000
 additionally spring is now breaking 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.410
 the springs are on opposite 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.780
 driver side 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.870
 thus uniform 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.950
 pressure on all four spoons 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:24.190
 features of this design are 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.700
 unusual double flags company 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.340
 odyssey 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.370
 went in an easier way by setting in 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.660
 driver instead of four flags 3 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.700
 thereby they achieved more 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.860
 uniform removal of flags from a gap 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.720
 springs and respectively more 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.580
 uniform pressure on them besides in 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.280
 flag design has been added 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.410
 special pin on the example of this 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.900
 drive 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.980
 we see as a flag when triggered 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.990
 rolls its nest does not slide 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.440
 by on this rule we put 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.180
 and grease the name pin 4 it holds 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.370
 so that it spins in its nest 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.910
 and lubrication also contributes to the mind easy 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.710
 rotation beyond that 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.710
 innovation in the driver touched and 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.240
 bearings as you remember problems with 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.150
 bearings arise mainly in 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.070
 nines drivers that's why long 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.640
 Odyssey time did not want to let go 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.919
 drivers 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.130
 trying to find a solution to this problem and 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.100
 she was found instead of three little ones 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:31.120
 bearings they installed one wide 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.690
 needle bearing more 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.290
 powerful separator besides you goal they 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.810
 hidden away 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.390
 which is much safer is hindering him 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.260
 resolution and therefore destruction 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.260
 bearing whole 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.590
 top it all 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.300
 This bearing is securely held on 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.520
 its place with the help of a special 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.830
 dowels david with all constructive 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.060
 solutions to extend the life of your sleeves 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.190
 help timely technical 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.360
 service 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.280
 most breakdowns are not due to 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.110
 design flaws both and fault 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.790
 birth itself 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.280
 admit 1 symptom just a real account 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.040
 it means you need a peek mechanism 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.220
 and eliminate the reason for what should 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.660
 pay special attention first to none 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.600
 In no case should you ride 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.730
 tightened lock nuts as a result 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.710
 This appears a backlash that automatically 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.470
 crosses out all of the above 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.600
 improved secondly on time 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.630
 change deleted flags and springs and 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.790
 solve the problem and rubbing watch for 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.570
 the presence of grease contact points flags 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.100
 carps from the driver and not the gear grease 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.350
 should be a lot and should not be a little 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.690
 and and should be lubricating enough 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:45.610
 only huge parts of the mechanism where 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.610
 directly contacts the checkbox 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.910
 also need to smear the place of contact with 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.790
 annika 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:01.350
 he black gum is on 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.350
 inner side of the arm 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:16.160
 Now we grease the back of the flag 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.160
 directly on what the spring presses 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:24.390
 combining the spring slot 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:27.650
 with locking socket on the driver 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:33.740
 holding with one finger slightly 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:39.270
 we stretch the spring and dress up the hands 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:41.880
 lubrication is complete can 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:46.520
 the top of the flags where it will be 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:50.490
 in contact gear too fluff 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.320
 no more lubrication here in this video 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.390
 review we will not deliberately talk about 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.130
 tom how to replace the bearings so as 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.170
 We believe that at home to do 

00:07:56.130 --> 00:08:00.180
 it's qualitatively almost impossible 

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.640
 similar procedures should be performed 

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.200
 only in the workshop I am for this 

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.500
 have all the necessary specials 

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.500
 instruments
