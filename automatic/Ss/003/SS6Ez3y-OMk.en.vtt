done<00:00:05.040> here<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.370> I've<00:00:05.520> created<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:06.060> roller

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
done here is I've created a roller

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.360 
done here is I've created a roller
that's<00:00:06.600> gonna<00:00:07.080> be<00:00:07.319> better<00:00:07.710> than<00:00:07.859> foam<00:00:08.130> in

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
that's gonna be better than foam in

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.120 
that's gonna be better than foam in
pretty<00:00:08.610> much<00:00:08.670> every<00:00:09.120> way<00:00:09.559> it's<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.679> roller<00:00:11.010> that

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
pretty much every way it's a roller that

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.400 
pretty much every way it's a roller that
you<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.639> tell<00:00:11.849> from<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> shape<00:00:12.540> he's<00:00:13.230> going

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
you can tell from the shape he's going

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.930 
you can tell from the shape he's going
to<00:00:13.469> target<00:00:13.710> your<00:00:13.950> trigger<00:00:14.160> points<00:00:14.580> more

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
to target your trigger points more
