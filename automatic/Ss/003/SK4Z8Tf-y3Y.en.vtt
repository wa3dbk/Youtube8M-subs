00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
looking for to figure out if we have

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.050 
looking for to figure out if we have
enough<00:00:18.869> insulation<00:00:19.439> up<00:00:19.560> here<00:00:19.770> well<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> first

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
is 22 inches of insulation so we're not

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.760 
is 22 inches of insulation so we're not
even<00:00:45.539> close<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.930> what<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.739> be

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
even close to that what would we be

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.170 
even close to that what would we be
doing<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:48.710> probably<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
doing for in this one probably in

doing for in this one probably in
shooting<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.300> our<00:00:51.390> 49<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.140> our<00:00:52.260> sixty<00:00:52.800> okay

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
shooting for our 49 to our sixty okay

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.209 
shooting for our 49 to our sixty okay
okay<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.989> type<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> energy<00:00:55.440> loss<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
okay so what type of energy loss is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.549 
okay so what type of energy loss is
there<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.000> an<00:00:57.270> attic<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.899> highest<00:00:58.170> percentage

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
there in an attic the highest percentage

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
there in an attic the highest percentage

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
of energy loss and in your home is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.790 
of energy loss and in your home is
through<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.899> Attic<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.500> through<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.020 
today what are some of the benefits of
the<00:01:34.320> blowin<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.890> we're<00:01:34.979> looking<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.400> using<00:01:35.610> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the blowin that we're looking at using I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
the blowin that we're looking at using I
think<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> biggest<00:01:36.960> benefit<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
think the biggest benefit is the the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.670 
think the biggest benefit is the the
ease<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.400> use<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.600> Attic<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:39.990> system<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.470> very

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
problem using the machine so in every

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.969 
problem using the machine so in every
time<00:01:48.780> oh<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.110> use<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.649> we're<00:01:49.950> just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
time oh I can use it and we're just

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.289 
time oh I can use it and we're just
gonna<00:01:50.250> blow<00:01:50.430> right<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.790> top<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.149> what's

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
gonna blow right on top of what's

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.940 
gonna blow right on top of what's
already<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.290> correct<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.740> don't

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
already here that's correct you don't

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.530 
already here that's correct you don't
need<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.340> remove<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> existing<00:01:54.119> insulation

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
need to remove the existing insulation

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
that's great so okay so let's get

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:01.969 
that's great so okay so let's get
started

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
started

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:35.070 
started
sounds<00:02:02.310> great<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.790> right

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.720 

so<00:02:36.080> Eric<00:02:36.350> we<00:02:36.440> worried<00:02:36.620> about<00:02:36.710> five<00:02:37.310> inches<00:02:37.670> of

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
so Eric we worried about five inches of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.670 
so Eric we worried about five inches of
insulation<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.570> now<00:02:38.660> we're<00:02:38.840> up<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.110> about<00:02:39.170> 18

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
insulation and now we're up to about 18

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.560 
insulation and now we're up to about 18
is<00:02:39.830> quite<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.070> bit<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.550> was<00:02:41.120> surprised<00:02:41.450> at<00:02:41.540> how

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
is quite a bit I was surprised at how

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.240 
is quite a bit I was surprised at how
easy<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.590> really<00:02:42.740> isn't<00:02:43.100> that

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
easy it is and it really isn't that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.040 
easy it is and it really isn't that
dusty<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:44.360> I'm<00:02:44.480> guessing<00:02:44.780> there's<00:02:44.930> some

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
dusty but I'm guessing there's some

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.720 
dusty but I'm guessing there's some
precautions<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.920> some<00:02:46.070> equipment<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.580> want

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
precautions and some equipment you want

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.490 
precautions and some equipment you want
to<00:02:46.850> want<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.360> have<00:02:47.540> absolutely<00:02:48.050> that's<00:02:48.230> one<00:02:48.410> of

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
to want to have absolutely that's one of

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.990 
to want to have absolutely that's one of
the<00:02:48.560> benefits<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.010> this<00:02:49.160> system<00:02:49.490> it<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> low

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
the benefits of this system it is a low

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.850 
the benefits of this system it is a low
dust<00:02:50.300> system<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:50.990> certainly<00:02:51.290> anytime<00:02:51.710> in

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
dust system but certainly anytime in
