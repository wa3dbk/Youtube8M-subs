so<00:00:15.240> then<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.780> clip<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.029> try<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
so then I clip this to here and try to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.529 
so then I clip this to here and try to
match<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.320> up<00:00:20.960> and<00:00:22.369> see<00:00:23.369> how<00:00:23.580> why--yes<00:00:24.180> did

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
match this up and see how why--yes did

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.200 
match this up and see how why--yes did
and<00:00:24.810> see<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.560> need<00:00:25.740> any<00:00:25.949> more<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.880> any<00:00:26.910> less

so I start at the bottom of the armhole
kind<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.570> when<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.869> were<00:00:30.929> pinning<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:32.820> we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.220 
kind of like when we were pinning and we
started<00:00:33.300> at<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> bottom<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.200> same

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
right sides together but i'm sewing it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.120 
right sides together but i'm sewing it
from<00:02:25.860> inside<00:02:27.350> i'm<00:02:28.350> going<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.590> sew<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.070> a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
from inside i'm going to sew it and a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.500 
from inside i'm going to sew it and a
half<00:02:29.340> because<00:02:30.090> when<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.930> reach<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:32.360> like<00:02:33.360> we

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
half because when you reach the like we

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.120 
half because when you reach the like we
already<00:02:33.660> talked<00:02:33.990> about<00:02:34.230> how<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.530> pulls<00:02:34.800> on<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
already talked about how it pulls on the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.770 
already talked about how it pulls on the
back<00:02:35.370> all<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> time<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
back all the time but really the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.720 
back all the time but really the
intersection<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.440> gets<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.890> most<00:02:37.920> abuse<00:02:38.520> is

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
intersection that gets the most abuse is

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.990 
intersection that gets the most abuse is
the<00:02:38.910> bottom<00:02:39.330> hmm<00:02:40.280> because<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.490> is<00:02:41.670> where<00:02:41.880> it

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the bottom hmm because this is where it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.050 
the bottom hmm because this is where it
pulls<00:02:42.300> from<00:02:42.740> so<00:02:43.740> i<00:02:43.770> always<00:02:44.100> begin<00:02:44.640> at<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
pulls from so i always begin at the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.410 
pulls from so i always begin at the
bottom<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.959> begin<00:02:46.350> by<00:02:46.550> mashing<00:02:47.550> down<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
bottom and I begin by mashing down the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.510 
bottom and I begin by mashing down the
seam<00:02:48.630> allowance<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.320> going<00:02:50.040> all<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.400> way

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
seam allowance and going all the way

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.460 
seam allowance and going all the way
around<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.120> running<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.600> over<00:02:51.900> again<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.410> I

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
around and running that over again so I

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.080 
around and running that over again so I
actually<00:02:52.620> sew<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.190> bottom<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.670> armholes

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
actually sew the bottom of the armholes

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
good to do a French article but again

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.410 
good to do a French article but again
we're<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.460> fitting<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:17.880> on<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.150> mannequin

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
we're just fitting this on the mannequin

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:29.410 
we're just fitting this on the mannequin
so<00:03:19.430> it's<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.610> couch<00:03:20.850> for<00:03:21.060> sewing<00:03:21.480> classes

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.470 

so<00:03:30.650> because<00:03:31.650> we're<00:03:32.070> starting<00:03:32.550> at<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.209> bottom

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
so because we're starting at the bottom

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.500 
so because we're starting at the bottom
and<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:34.020> a<00:03:34.110> circle<00:03:34.670> nothing<00:03:35.670> can<00:03:35.910> lay<00:03:36.120> flat

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
and it's a circle nothing can lay flat

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.740 
and it's a circle nothing can lay flat
except<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.200> part<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.650> you're<00:03:37.740> sewing<00:03:38.750> so

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.780 
except the part that you're sewing so
all<00:03:39.990> you're<00:03:40.170> trying<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.530> keep<00:03:40.800> flat<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.430> what's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
all you're trying to keep flat is what's

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.229 
all you're trying to keep flat is what's
right<00:03:42.090> ahead<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.350> none<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.940> going

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
right ahead of you none of this is going

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.270 
right ahead of you none of this is going
to<00:03:45.330> lay<00:03:45.450> flat<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:46.140> have<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.500> literally<00:03:46.860> roll

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
to lay flat you have to literally roll

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.430 
to lay flat you have to literally roll
the<00:03:47.459> whole<00:03:47.640> dress<00:03:47.940> through<00:03:48.540> does<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.260> make

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
the whole dress through does that make

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.940 
the whole dress through does that make
sense<00:03:53.090> just<00:03:54.090> leaves<00:03:54.320> first<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.560> then<00:03:55.709> like

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
sense just leaves first and then like

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.010 
sense just leaves first and then like
side<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:57.150> end<00:03:58.610> it's<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.850> worst<00:04:00.120> way<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.450> do<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
side the end it's the worst way to do it

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.190 
side the end it's the worst way to do it
it<00:04:01.680> isn't<00:04:01.980> easy<00:04:04.070> okay<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:06.420> just<00:04:06.660> doesn't<00:04:06.840> fit
