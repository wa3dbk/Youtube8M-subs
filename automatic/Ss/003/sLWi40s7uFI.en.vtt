00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
 no one has ever understood the premise of the supermarket one has the impression that 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.420
 the one who did that his goal was to make it work as long as possible 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.209
 because when you do not know other places 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.659
 that's what you have to go 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.729
 when I was on vacation 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.409
 is it an afternoon for shopping 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.439
 already when you make in the shop melodies that we pass it is a little 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.439
 this life goes on 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.399
 the shot 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.579
 that's when tamba concept is peeps this someone's surrounded doing the 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.500
 racing 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 in the back of a super league 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.280
 me it's me today a lot of stuff in fact so we will need so 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.610
 that ravioli you would have to buy from the highlands dough 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.850
 vegetables have everything that was in rest or package choice the rsa 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.770
 we will do all that is sure not a toilet paper all that 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.730
 for the barbecue tonight it would take as long as say for them coal 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.700
 by the very admission of the mounted matches fly away for the aunt sees the bce 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.090
 buys a gas stove yes here are soon small picnic tables 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.470
 condemned then showed itself is not bad maybe 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.150
 patrols were seized last night here is the clemency of agreement here 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.170
 and then no place is perfect 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 thank you again for your help 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.220
 who always has a lot of memories of the supermarket when witnesses I 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.380
 believe that the first thing we put all are trying to do 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.970
 it's trying to catch the piece that was already in the cart 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.010
 with chains 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.270
 we spent hours 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.980
 we always asked for many things but never at the right time 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.100
 the scene that will follow pretty goal last week 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.310
 3 all around yet simple 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.310
 I do not know why super schumi in France 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.010
 chain 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.830
 here is not by the jury can not resume 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.920
 and I do not know why for little ones always has the gift of losing everything in the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 supermarket 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.790
 I believe that when one gets lost he is the universal technique 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.840
 wholesale grid we want to iron all the rays like that 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.329
 to try to find your mother 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.869
 m 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.539
 parra 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:32.909
 then shortly before his deposit 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.099
 I think the biggest anxiety that when you're small at the supermarket 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.900
 it is that your mother of pink impressing at the checkout when she understood some 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.579
 thing 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.059
 and that the parties that advance 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.059
 not a word is not said 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.459
 you start growing up and you trust 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.459
 you become teenagers and you start to be interested in a few things 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.419
 Saint-AndrÃ© 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.419
 fathers 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.970
 there are a lot of young people to do in a supermarket 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.970
 the first of them is the game of the year 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.629
 m 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.679
 rain of passings and returns 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:26.819
 somewhat erotic need to place him in the top 10 of the balloon year 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.059
 why no suspense 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.169
 without waiting 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.209
 the convention also in supermarkets is the speakers 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.689
 and you can pass any cd in 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.689
 I call it musical terrorism 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.559
 fed up 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.949
 at 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:54.459
 explanations 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.459
 wearing 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.379
 it is nice also lamented the cheeses 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.689
 between each product against the wind 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 always the same sentence that comes back 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.409
 with these sites successfully 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.029
 in hindsight again froze colette deromme 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.039
 and especially 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.289
 the alcohol department on Friday evening 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.289
 it's mythical 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.819
 a pileup 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.819
 maybe I was sad 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.120
 we are in a team 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.669
 mayor 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:52.120
