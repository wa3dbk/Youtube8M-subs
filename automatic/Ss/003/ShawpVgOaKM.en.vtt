00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
could really go by without some mention

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.689 
could really go by without some mention
of<00:00:21.259> that<00:00:22.259> whole<00:00:22.560> phenomenon<00:00:23.399> that<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
of that whole phenomenon that is

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.329 
of that whole phenomenon that is
Groundhog<00:00:24.149> Day<00:00:24.470> but<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.649> in<00:00:25.769> Maine

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
Groundhog Day but here in Maine

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.549 
Groundhog Day but here in Maine
we<00:00:26.669> got<00:00:26.909> enough<00:00:27.300> heavy<00:00:27.509> snow<00:00:27.839> today<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.409> I'm

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:28.559 
we got enough heavy snow today that I'm

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.649 
we got enough heavy snow today that I'm
pretty<00:00:28.890> sure<00:00:29.130> no<00:00:29.399> groundhog<00:00:29.970> ventured<00:00:30.449> out<00:00:30.630> of

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:30.659 
pretty sure no groundhog ventured out of

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.200 
pretty sure no groundhog ventured out of
any<00:00:31.050> burrow<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.550> guess<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.910> would<00:00:33.059> mean

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
any burrow and I guess that would mean

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.970 
any burrow and I guess that would mean
the<00:00:33.300> winners<00:00:33.570> about<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> end<00:00:34.140> soon<00:00:34.469> instead<00:00:34.710> of

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the winners about to end soon instead of

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.750 
the winners about to end soon instead of
go<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.699> another<00:00:35.789> six<00:00:36.210> weeks<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.289> I<00:00:37.760> don't

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
go on for another six weeks but I don't

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.310 
go on for another six weeks but I don't
think<00:00:39.179> that<00:00:39.359> that's<00:00:39.539> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:40.019> the<00:00:40.140> case

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
think that that's going to be the case

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
think that that's going to be the case
it<00:00:40.589> seems<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.550> may<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:41.969> only<00:00:42.149> just

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it seems here that we may have only just

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.750 
it seems here that we may have only just
got<00:00:42.660> started

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
got started

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.250 
got started
