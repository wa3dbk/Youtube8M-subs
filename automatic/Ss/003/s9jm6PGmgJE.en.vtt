00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.330 
think it's really smart to have one
person<00:01:39.479> who's<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.770> able<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> say

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
person who's in the know be able to say

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.429 
person who's in the know be able to say
like<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.899> can't<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.259> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
like we can do this we can't do that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.230 
like we can do this we can't do that
this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.860> how<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.009> make<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:44.490> da<00:01:44.939> didn't

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
this is how we make this all da didn't

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.550 
this is how we make this all da didn't
work<00:01:45.329> as<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> unit<00:01:45.570> especially<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.290> having

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
work as a unit especially just having

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.069 
work as a unit especially just having
like<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.640> set<00:01:48.119> direction<00:01:48.630> where<00:01:48.930> no

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
like just one set direction where no

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.990 
like just one set direction where no
one's<00:01:49.229> overlapping<00:01:49.619> storylines<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.880> not

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
one's overlapping storylines it's not

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.490 
one's overlapping storylines it's not
breaking<00:01:51.240> continuity<00:01:51.869> anywhere<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.350> for

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
breaking continuity anywhere just for

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.560 
breaking continuity anywhere just for
the<00:01:52.590> fans<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.700> big<00:01:53.850> thing<00:01:53.880> well

which<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.399> would<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.270> dream

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
which is that would kind of be a dream

which is that would kind of be a dream
team<00:02:06.810> i'm<00:02:06.960> gonna<00:02:07.140> say<00:02:07.409> i<00:02:07.439> think<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:07.950> be

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.859 
team i'm gonna say i think that would be
really<00:02:08.129> really<00:02:08.550> legit<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.149> see<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.450> happen

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
really really legit to see that happen

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.790 
really really legit to see that happen
and<00:02:10.110> i<00:02:10.440> think<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.739> if<00:02:11.129> they

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
and i think that if they

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.890 
and i think that if they
I move<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.400> area<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:13.420> gonna<00:02:13.600> be<00:02:13.810> an

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
think issues kind of take the with the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.190 
think issues kind of take the with the
new<00:02:45.340> 52<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.420> just<00:02:46.630> happened<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.960> year<00:02:46.990> ago

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
new 52 that just happened a year ago

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.930 
new 52 that just happened a year ago
with<00:02:47.560> where<00:02:47.980> they<00:02:48.070> kind<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.250> started<00:02:48.520> over<00:02:48.880> in

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
with where they kind of started over in

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.100 
with where they kind of started over in
the<00:02:49.030> first<00:02:49.210> few<00:02:49.330> issues<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.690> Justice<00:02:49.960> League

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
the first few issues of Justice League

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.540 
the first few issues of Justice League
was<00:02:50.230> like<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.440> group<00:02:50.590> coming<00:02:50.770> together<00:02:50.950> you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
was like the group coming together you

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.980 
was like the group coming together you
really<00:02:51.730> got<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.910> see<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.360> characters

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
really got to see that the characters

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.900 
really got to see that the characters
shine<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.500> who<00:02:53.650> they<00:02:53.800> really<00:02:54.070> are<00:02:54.370> which<00:02:54.760> i

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
shine is who they really are which i

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.310 
shine is who they really are which i
think<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.150> what<00:02:55.330> made<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.570> Avenger<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.110> great

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
think is what made the Avenger so great

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.470 
think is what made the Avenger so great
so<00:02:56.800> they<00:02:56.950> can<00:02:57.100> kind<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.310> take<00:02:57.460> that<00:02:57.790> story<00:02:58.240> arc

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
so they can kind of take that story arc

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.510 
so they can kind of take that story arc
and<00:02:58.630> kind<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.930> expand<00:02:59.470> on<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.070> make<00:03:00.430> the

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
and kind of expand on that and make the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.880 
and kind of expand on that and make the
script<00:03:00.820> around<00:03:01.030> those<00:03:01.470> specific<00:03:02.470> characters

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
script around those specific characters

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.410 
script around those specific characters
I<00:03:03.160> think<00:03:03.580> that's<00:03:03.850> what's<00:03:04.060> going<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.240> sell<00:03:04.390> a

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
I think that's what's going to sell a

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.970 
I think that's what's going to sell a
good<00:03:04.630> movie<00:03:04.900> yes<00:03:05.410> face<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.830> they<00:03:05.950> should

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
good movie yes face it they should

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.710 
good movie yes face it they should

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
that makes sense to everyone else that's

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.350

watching<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.860> film<00:03:36.040> yeah<00:03:36.190> if<00:03:36.370> if<00:03:36.880> they<00:03:37.120> don't

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
watching the film yeah if if they don't

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.810 
watching the film yeah if if they don't
do<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:38.010> reboot<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.190> Justice<00:03:39.550> League<00:03:39.610> where

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
do a reboot of the Justice League where

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.160 
do a reboot of the Justice League where
they<00:03:39.910> start<00:03:40.090> from<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.330> beginning<00:03:40.420> yeah<00:03:40.810> I

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
they start from the beginning yeah I

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.479 
they start from the beginning yeah I
think<00:03:41.260> Joseph<00:03:41.709> gordon-levitt's<00:03:42.040> would<00:03:42.370> be<00:03:42.459> a

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
think Joseph gordon-levitt's would be a

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.400 
think Joseph gordon-levitt's would be a
great<00:03:42.670> way<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.940> great<00:03:43.630> direction<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.080> go<00:03:44.200> I

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
great way to great direction to go I

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.630 
great way to great direction to go I
think<00:03:44.980> they<00:03:45.040> should<00:03:45.190> definitely<00:03:45.489> keep

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
think they should definitely keep

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.860 
think they should definitely keep

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
then that's a different skewed version

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.720 
then that's a different skewed version
of<00:03:56.560> Batman<00:03:56.830> that<00:03:56.920> we<00:03:57.010> would<00:03:57.100> be<00:03:57.130> used<00:03:57.370> I

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
totally agree because to have him come

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.890 
totally agree because to have him come
back<00:04:00.130> it<00:04:00.970> would<00:04:01.180> sort<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.510> just<00:04:01.660> feel<00:04:01.780> like

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
back it would sort of just feel like

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.840 
back it would sort of just feel like
retconning<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.650> whole<00:04:02.800> thing<00:04:03.070> like<00:04:03.370> crisper

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
retconning the whole thing like crisper

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.790 
retconning the whole thing like crisper

left<00:04:14.819> enough<00:04:15.150> like<00:04:15.390> strings<00:04:15.900> dangling<00:04:16.350> that

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
left enough like strings dangling that

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.349 
left enough like strings dangling that
he<00:04:16.680> could<00:04:16.859> move<00:04:16.979> on<00:04:17.190> from<00:04:17.340> there<00:04:17.609> yeah<00:04:18.060> the

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
he could move on from there yeah the

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.030

great<00:04:18.570> thing<00:04:18.600> is<00:04:18.780> Christian<00:04:19.590> Bale<00:04:19.769> could

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
great thing is Christian Bale could

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.439 
great thing is Christian Bale could
always<00:04:20.310> come<00:04:20.459> back<00:04:20.579> if<00:04:20.790> they<00:04:20.880> ever<00:04:21.000> took<00:04:21.239> the
