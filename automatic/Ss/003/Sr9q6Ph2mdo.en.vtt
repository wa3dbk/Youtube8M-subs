00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.470
 the educational scrambler is here 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.510
 arrives with different versions each 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.789
 with a unique style that you are seeing 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.830
 here is the so-called icon the basis of the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.930
 range costs a little more than 8,300 euros 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.880
 but there are three more versions are called 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.590
 classic and urban enduro and full throttle 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.530
 each one costs about nine thousand 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.150
 eight hundred euros the scrambler is a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.920
 light motorbike that moves well between 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.260
 legs and that gives a tremendous feeling 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.880
 of agility the seat is near the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 soil so the people of minor 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.050
 height can support the feet well 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.880
 this increases the sense of dominance 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.160
 and allows maneuvers with greater 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.930
 security but all this what 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.760
 we will verify once we can drive it 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.860
 for now let's take a look at 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.720
 its general characteristics 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.130
 The scrambler has a tubular chassis 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.050
 steel and a swingarm manufactured in 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.480
 aluminum the front fork was silent 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.890
 41 millimeter is not adjustable and the 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.630
 Rear shock absorber is also very 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.990
 simple since it only has regulation in 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.990
 preload 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.480
 There is a brake disc on each wheel with 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.980
 brembo clamps and always with system 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.770
 anti- block abs 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.600
 the tires are a hospi del imt 60 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.370
 rs that according to ducati have been 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.470
 developed specifically for this 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.450
 motorcycle and that can be used on 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 asphalt and earth 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.740
 the engine is a two- cylinder drift 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.180
 which had the monster 796 but 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.310
 education has reduced the crossing of 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.020
 valves to 11 degrees in order to 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.719
 improve the response to low and medium 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.429
 refrigeration regime is by air and 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.470
 the valve train distribution is 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.569
 type of course that way mico 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.280
 there is a gearbox of six 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.540
 speeds and a clutch with function 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.730
 anti rebound 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.320
 some remarkable aesthetic details and 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.660
 common to all versions of the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.000
 scrambler are the lighthouse and the light of 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.380
 led position with circular shape the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.990
 exit above the cable 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.840
 accelerator as in the old motorcycles the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.970
 wide handlebar 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.400
 digital instrumentation with appearance 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.319
 retro and the usb socket under the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.890
 Very useful seat for charging a phone 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.890
 mobile 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.180
 each of the four versions has 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.130
 own characteristics 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.170
 the icon is the base of the range its 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.820
 handlebar is tall has some wheels 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.130
 black aluminum and a mudguard 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.890
 short front is the only one that is 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.400
 available in two colors in yellow and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.370
 for 100 euros more in red 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.269
 the class that has spoke rims 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.970
 front and rear fenders 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.129
 metallic a seat with a lattice of 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.560
 rhombs and the deposit with a black band 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.720
 reminiscent of the cables of the 70s 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.030
 as the next two versions costs 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.250
 nine thousand eight hundred fifty euros 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.470
 lay urban enduro is different because it goes 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.170
 painted in green has wheels of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.300
 spokes a fender high a grid 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.300
 of protection for the headlight a handlebar 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.130
 enduro type a specific seat and ones 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.069
 protectors for the motor and the bars 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.170
 of the fork 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.420
 the ful rub black them in chassis and 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.819
 seat has a handlebar under a 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.219
 seat with yellow inserts a 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.709
 sports front fender and some 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.629
 black aluminum wheels however 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.850
 its most striking element is the escape 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.830
 I finish neither of double exit 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.660
 this escape is not exclusive to the full 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.940
 throttle but it can be installed in 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.890
 the other versions and that's the grace 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.710
 of this bike that can be configured 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.690
 to the taste of each one 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.400
 for example the icon can be put 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.140
 the radio wheels of the urban 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.840
 enduro has low blue handlebar 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.880
 rub but there's more because the catalog 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.740
 accessories is extensive and there are things so 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.850
 interesting as a high escape and some 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.070
 luggage bags 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.540
 It is definitely a motorcycle that feels 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.700
 do and lightly that has a 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.530
 simple mechanical configuration and some 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.110
 very personalization possibilities 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.240
 wide this is the world of ducati 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.920
 scrambler that it's not just a 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.930
 new bike but also a brand 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.760
 new within the educational one itself 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.860
 brand with a more youthful identity and 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.580
 more carefree is going to approach thus a 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.580
 different public
