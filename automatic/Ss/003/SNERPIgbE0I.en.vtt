with the performances that he came up
with<00:00:54.040> I<00:00:54.430> think<00:00:54.670> it's<00:00:55.210> it's<00:00:56.080> fantastic<00:00:56.339> and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
with I think it's it's fantastic and

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.829 
with I think it's it's fantastic and
also<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.940> fact<00:00:58.180> you<00:00:58.330> know<00:00:58.360> when<00:00:58.570> you<00:00:58.690> are

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
also the fact you know when you are

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.729 
also the fact you know when you are
getting<00:00:59.680> Patterson<00:01:00.339> you<00:01:01.119> know<00:01:01.210> for<00:01:01.420> your

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
getting Patterson you know for your

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.140 
getting Patterson you know for your
international<00:01:02.739> people<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.430> considerable

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
international people a considerable

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.440 
international people a considerable
period<00:01:04.330> of<00:01:04.600> time<00:01:05.010> everybody<00:01:06.010> sleep<00:01:06.640> in<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:07.090> and

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
period of time everybody sleep in is and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.060 
period of time everybody sleep in is and
everything<00:01:07.750> you<00:01:08.680> know

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
everything you know

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.740 
everything you know
when<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.460> score<00:01:09.700> runs<00:01:09.939> and<00:01:10.180> you<00:01:10.240> don't<00:01:10.479> score

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
when you score runs and you don't score

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.080 
when you score runs and you don't score
runs<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.260> I<00:01:11.530> think<00:01:12.040> there<00:01:12.189> was<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.310> plenty<00:01:12.939> that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
runs so I think there was a plenty that

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.550 
runs so I think there was a plenty that
we<00:01:13.210> had<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.600> deal<00:01:13.840> with

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
we had to deal with

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.280 
we had to deal with
apart<00:01:15.280> from<00:01:15.490> predicting<00:01:16.480> or<00:01:16.600> cricket<00:01:16.960> opposed

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
apart from predicting or cricket opposed

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.410 
apart from predicting or cricket opposed
versus<00:01:17.710> fashion<00:01:18.100> but<00:01:18.280> we<00:01:18.910> have<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.180> deal<00:01:19.390> with

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
versus fashion but we have to deal with

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.630 
versus fashion but we have to deal with
other<00:01:20.230> thing<00:01:20.560> that<00:01:20.590> goes<00:01:20.800> on<00:01:21.040> how<00:01:21.280> we<00:01:21.340> go

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
other thing that goes on how we go

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.300 
other thing that goes on how we go
cricket<00:01:22.030> so<00:01:22.870> if<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.500> see<00:01:23.710> all<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.100> I

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
cricket so if you see all of that I

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.240 
cricket so if you see all of that I
think

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.910 
think
fantastic<00:01:26.250> idea<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.910> to<00:01:26.940> forget<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> other

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
well I think it's each and everything to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.010 
well I think it's each and everything to
point<00:02:55.620> out<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:57.060> say<00:02:57.270> okay<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.720> one

particular<00:02:58.530> thing<00:02:58.740> that<00:03:00.260> will<00:03:01.260> be<00:03:01.380> very

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
particular thing that will be very

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.210 
particular thing that will be very
difficult<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.880> think<00:03:03.560> whatever<00:03:04.560> opportunity<00:03:05.190> I

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
difficult I think whatever opportunity I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.210 
difficult I think whatever opportunity I
got<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.790> fact<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.420> thing<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.920> learned<00:03:07.920> how<00:03:08.190> to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
beat the game especially nobody is that

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.370 
beat the game especially nobody is that
way<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.850> time<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.210> spent<00:03:12.360> how<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.780> target<00:03:13.110> a

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
way the time is spent how to target a

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.500
