00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello today we cook a rabbit stew 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.320
 with prunes and raisins the ingredients 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.290
 rabbit sliced â€‹â€‹tomatoes onions 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.410
 prunes and a splash of wine 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.410
 red 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.150
 we start feeding the rabbit 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.419
 and browning it in a pan with a little 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.419
 of oil 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.960
 when it is golden, we remove it from 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.960
 fire and we reserve it 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.940
 now we chop the onion and the tomatoes 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.040
 and we add them to the casserole in which 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.040
 we have gilded the rabbit 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.339
 the vegetables will help us raise the 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.789
 burnt bottom that has remained in the 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.789
 casserole 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.030
 next we add the pieces of 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.030
 rabbit 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.490
 the trickle of wine 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.640
 and the water 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.700
 a sprig of thyme we cover and leave 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.790
 on fire for 30 minutes after 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.320
 we add the prunes and the raisins and 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.320
 we cook another 30 minutes 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.970
 After that time, all that remains is to serve 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.970
 the plate 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.020
 we place the pieces 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.240
 a little sauce 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.240
 and that's it until soon 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.360
 Y 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360
