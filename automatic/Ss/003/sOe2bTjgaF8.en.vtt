with Jazza i'm Jezza and in this video

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.629 
with Jazza i'm Jezza and in this video
i'm<00:00:12.420> going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.780> be<00:00:12.870> drawing<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.530> big<00:00:13.860> beastie

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
i'm going to be drawing this big beastie

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.960 
i'm going to be drawing this big beastie
Minotaur<00:00:15.299> character<00:00:16.049> now<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.430> past<00:00:17.699> I've

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
Minotaur character now in the past I've

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.790 
Minotaur character now in the past I've
created<00:00:18.240> some<00:00:18.630> let's<00:00:18.960> draw<00:00:19.260> videos<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:19.770> I

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
created some let's draw videos but I

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800 
created some let's draw videos but I
didn't<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.130> know<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> format<00:00:21.689> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
didn't really know what the format of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.830 
didn't really know what the format of
the<00:00:21.930> video<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.740> or<00:00:23.070> was<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.300> feel<00:00:24.779> like

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the video is or was and so I feel like

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.660 
the video is or was and so I feel like
I've<00:00:25.170> kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> discovered<00:00:26.250> what<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> think

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
I've kind of discovered what I think

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.640 
I've kind of discovered what I think
that<00:00:26.789> will<00:00:26.939> be<00:00:26.970> basically<00:00:27.660> I'm<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> draw

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
that will be basically I'm going to draw

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.669 
that will be basically I'm going to draw
something<00:00:29.519> from<00:00:29.760> start<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> finish<00:00:30.349> it<00:00:31.349> will

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
something from start to finish it will

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.280 
something from start to finish it will
be<00:00:31.800> sped<00:00:32.040> up<00:00:32.149> 1000%<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.300> opposed<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.899> two

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
be sped up 1000% as opposed to two

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.690 
be sped up 1000% as opposed to two
thousand<00:00:34.620> percent<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:35.010> my<00:00:35.130> speed<00:00:35.370> paintings

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
thousand percent in my speed paintings

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.340 
thousand percent in my speed paintings
and<00:00:35.790> I'm<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.660> talk<00:00:36.960> through<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and I'm just going to talk through the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.680 
and I'm just going to talk through the
process<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.430> it'll<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.850> something<00:00:39.420> halfway

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
process so it'll be something halfway

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.530 
process so it'll be something halfway
between<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.379> tutorial<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.670> usually<00:00:42.210> ranges

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
between a tutorial which usually ranges

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.770 
between a tutorial which usually ranges
between<00:00:42.690> 15<00:00:43.230> 20<00:00:43.710> minutes<00:00:43.980> sometimes<00:00:44.700> more<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
between 15 20 minutes sometimes more and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.540 
between 15 20 minutes sometimes more and
the<00:00:46.020> speed<00:00:46.230> painting<00:00:46.649> which<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:46.950> usually<00:00:47.430> just

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the speed painting which is usually just

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.910 
the speed painting which is usually just
a<00:00:47.700> couple<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.030> minutes<00:00:48.149> with<00:00:48.480> no<00:00:48.710> teaching<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
a couple of minutes with no teaching in

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.880 
a couple of minutes with no teaching in
it<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:51.030> it'll<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.420> kind<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.840> between<00:00:52.469> those<00:00:52.649> for

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it so it'll be kind of between those for

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
it so it'll be kind of between those for
people<00:00:53.160> who<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> huge<00:00:54.840> attention

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
people who don't have a huge attention

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.770 
people who don't have a huge attention
span<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.370> also<00:00:56.670> want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> know<00:00:57.210> what<00:00:57.629> goes

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
span but also want to know what goes

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.389 
span but also want to know what goes
through<00:00:57.840> my<00:00:58.079> head<00:00:58.109> when<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.530> create<00:00:59.100> these

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
through my head when I create these

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
through my head when I create these
images<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.239> jumping<00:01:00.600> straight<00:01:00.840> into<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.320> in

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
images so jumping straight into it in

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
images so jumping straight into it in
the<00:01:01.649> creation<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.370> Minotaur<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.660> begin

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the creation of this Minotaur we begin

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
the creation of this Minotaur we begin
up<00:01:04.110> by<00:01:04.260> doing<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> construction<00:01:05.010> lines<00:01:05.580> so

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
up by doing the construction lines so

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.460 
up by doing the construction lines so
the<00:01:06.299> construction<00:01:06.750> lines<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.200> case

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the construction lines in this case

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.649 
the construction lines in this case
we're<00:01:07.740> all<00:01:07.890> quite<00:01:08.159> heavy<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.030> wanted<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
we're all quite heavy I know I wanted a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.050 
we're all quite heavy I know I wanted a
very<00:01:09.869> top-heavy<00:01:10.500> character<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.460> big

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
very top-heavy character really big

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.590 
very top-heavy character really big
upper<00:01:12.390> torso<00:01:12.659> big<00:01:13.229> arms<00:01:13.830> big<00:01:13.950> body<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.939> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
upper torso big arms big body and so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
upper torso big arms big body and so
that<00:01:16.200> mean<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> case<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.740> very<00:01:17.070> heavy<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.549> I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that mean the case is very heavy so I

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.740 
that mean the case is very heavy so I
had<00:01:17.909> him<00:01:18.000> hulking<00:01:18.540> over<00:01:18.869> thick<00:01:19.560> forearms<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
had him hulking over thick forearms and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.710 
had him hulking over thick forearms and
thick<00:01:21.750> thighs<00:01:22.670> now<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.000> being<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> case<00:01:24.360> I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
thick thighs now that being the case I

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.020 
thick thighs now that being the case I
always<00:01:25.020> make<00:01:25.259> sure<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.030> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
always make sure that the the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.640 
always make sure that the the
construction<00:01:27.780> lines<00:01:27.990> even<00:01:28.259> though<00:01:28.409> they're

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
construction lines even though they're

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.469 
construction lines even though they're
rough<00:01:28.860> they<00:01:29.070> match<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.700> proportions<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
rough they match the proportions and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.660 
rough they match the proportions and
you'll<00:01:30.600> notice<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.049> moved<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> legs<00:01:31.680> forward<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
you'll notice I moved the legs forward a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
you'll notice I moved the legs forward a
bit<00:01:32.850> our<00:01:33.090> reason<00:01:33.509> being<00:01:33.689> he<00:01:33.810> seemed<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.650> he

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
bit our reason being he seemed like he

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.380 
bit our reason being he seemed like he
was<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.460> tip<00:01:35.610> over<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> wanted<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
was going to tip over so I wanted to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
was going to tip over so I wanted to
make<00:01:36.509> sure<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.810> center<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.200> mass<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:38.130> moved<00:01:38.430> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
make sure the center of mass was moved a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.719 
make sure the center of mass was moved a
bit<00:01:38.939> underneath<00:01:39.329> him<00:01:39.619> next<00:01:40.619> when<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> have

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
bit underneath him next when I have

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.219 
bit underneath him next when I have
finished<00:01:41.939> my<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.540> rough<00:01:42.810> construction

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
finished my really rough construction

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.810 
finished my really rough construction
lines<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.040> begin<00:01:44.460> by<00:01:45.140> moving<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.430> more

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
lines I begin by moving on to the more

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.210 
lines I begin by moving on to the more
refined<00:01:48.149> construction<00:01:48.869> lines<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.979> isn't

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
refined construction lines so this isn't

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.399 
refined construction lines so this isn't
yet<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> refined<00:01:51.119> final<00:01:51.600> line<00:01:51.780> work<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.140> looks

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
yet the refined final line work it looks

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.530 
yet the refined final line work it looks
very<00:01:52.829> similar<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> final<00:01:54.060> line<00:01:54.360> work

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
very similar to what the final line work

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.050 
very similar to what the final line work
will<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.890> also<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.640> bit<00:01:56.790> more

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
will be but it's also just a bit more

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
will be but it's also just a bit more
rushed<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.659> rough<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.500> worry<00:01:58.890> about

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
rushed and rough I don't worry about

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.580 
rushed and rough I don't worry about
line<00:02:00.000> weights<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.509> don't<00:02:00.719> worry<00:02:00.960> about<00:02:01.049> how<00:02:01.530> the

line weights I don't worry about how the

line weights I don't worry about how the
lines<00:02:01.950> connect<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:02.729> really<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
lines connect I'm really just going to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.039 
lines connect I'm really just going to
outline<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.280> features<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.540> first<00:02:06.750> stage

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
outline the features so the first stage

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.809 
outline the features so the first stage
of<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.530> construction<00:02:08.039> lines<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.550> really

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
of the construction lines the really

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.249 
of the construction lines the really
rough<00:02:09.000> one<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.479> more<00:02:09.690> about<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.989> shapes

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
rough one is more about the shapes

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.250 
rough one is more about the shapes
proportions

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.399

wait<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.790> second<00:02:13.120> stage<00:02:13.330> which<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.230> see

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
wait the second stage which you can see

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.550

me<00:02:14.560> working<00:02:14.739> on<00:02:14.920> now<00:02:15.129> is<00:02:15.970> when<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.269> work<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:17.019> in

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
me working on now is when I work on in

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.610 
me working on now is when I work on in
particular<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:19.180> actual<00:02:19.689> details<00:02:20.319> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
particular the the actual details the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.170 
particular the the actual details the
where<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:22.180> forms<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:22.989> lines<00:02:23.230> will<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.920> going

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
where the forms and lines will be going

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.000 
where the forms and lines will be going
and<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.450> I've<00:02:25.720> started<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.290> put<00:02:26.500> all<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.739> this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
and so I've started to put all of this

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.740 
and so I've started to put all of this
together<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.579> can<00:02:27.730> see<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.239> he's<00:02:28.510> quite

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
together you can see that he's quite

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.619 
together you can see that he's quite
hairy<00:02:29.079> I<00:02:29.319> put<00:02:30.010> hair<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.610> places<00:02:31.090> where<00:02:31.390> it

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
hairy I put hair in the places where it

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.500 
hairy I put hair in the places where it
kind<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.049> gathers<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:32.909> usually<00:02:33.909> where<00:02:34.239> it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
kind of gathers so usually where it

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.210 
kind of gathers so usually where it
hangs<00:02:34.870> over<00:02:35.230> things<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.769> shoulders<00:02:36.099> and

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
hangs over things like the shoulders and

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.729 
hangs over things like the shoulders and
forearms<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.700> now<00:02:37.269> I'm<00:02:37.420> moving<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.319> doing

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
forearms and now I'm moving on to doing

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.009 
forearms and now I'm moving on to doing
the<00:02:38.950> refined<00:02:39.370> line<00:02:39.670> work<00:02:39.909> now<00:02:40.540> when<00:02:40.659> doing<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
the refined line work now when doing the

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.660 
the refined line work now when doing the
refined<00:02:41.349> line<00:02:41.500> work<00:02:41.709> as<00:02:42.129> you<00:02:42.310> can<00:02:42.459> see<00:02:42.640> I

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
refined line work as you can see I

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.149 
refined line work as you can see I
zoomed<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.599> I<00:02:44.109> thickened<00:02:44.530> my<00:02:44.680> brush<00:02:44.950> size

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
zoomed in and I thickened my brush size

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.780 
zoomed in and I thickened my brush size
this<00:02:45.489> gives<00:02:45.730> me<00:02:45.909> more<00:02:46.150> put<00:02:46.540> oh<00:02:47.370> sorry<00:02:48.370> this

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
this gives me more put oh sorry this

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.910 
this gives me more put oh sorry this
gives<00:02:49.000> me<00:02:49.120> more<00:02:49.329> refined<00:02:50.109> control<00:02:50.500> over<00:02:50.829> the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
gives me more refined control over the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.089 
gives me more refined control over the
brushstrokes<00:02:51.459> themselves<00:02:52.389> and<00:02:52.569> allows<00:02:53.379> me<00:02:53.709> to

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
brushstrokes themselves and allows me to

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.069 
brushstrokes themselves and allows me to
really<00:02:54.639> have<00:02:54.819> control<00:02:54.970> over<00:02:55.209> how<00:02:55.720> they<00:02:55.900> turn

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
really have control over how they turn

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.080 
really have control over how they turn
out<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.980> alter<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.639> line<00:02:57.849> weight

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
out and alter the line weight

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.680 
out and alter the line weight
appropriately<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.379> when<00:02:59.799> I<00:02:59.829> say<00:03:00.069> line<00:03:00.370> weight

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
appropriately so when I say line weight

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.569 
appropriately so when I say line weight
in<00:03:01.690> some<00:03:01.989> areas<00:03:02.409> it'll<00:03:02.799> be<00:03:02.889> thicker<00:03:03.159> in<00:03:03.340> some

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
in some areas it'll be thicker in some

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.819 
in some areas it'll be thicker in some
thinner<00:03:03.849> as<00:03:04.599> you<00:03:04.659> can<00:03:04.840> see<00:03:04.989> when<00:03:05.139> I<00:03:05.170> drew<00:03:05.530> that

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
thinner as you can see when I drew that

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.160 
thinner as you can see when I drew that
torso<00:03:06.159> a<00:03:06.340> bit<00:03:06.489> there<00:03:06.730> i've<00:03:06.940> redrew<00:03:07.569> it<00:03:07.599> about

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
torso a bit there i've redrew it about

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.339 
torso a bit there i've redrew it about
ten<00:03:08.530> times<00:03:08.799> that's<00:03:09.430> very<00:03:10.090> normal<00:03:10.359> especially

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
ten times that's very normal especially

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.440 
ten times that's very normal especially
when<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:11.829> have<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> long<00:03:12.450> uninterrupted

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
when you have a long uninterrupted

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.199 
when you have a long uninterrupted
stroke<00:03:14.379> you<00:03:14.590> really<00:03:14.920> want<00:03:15.159> it<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.459> look<00:03:15.879> right

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
stroke you really want it to look right

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.349 
stroke you really want it to look right
so<00:03:16.540> it's<00:03:17.109> wise<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.819> do<00:03:18.819> it<00:03:18.940> again<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.299> again

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
so it's wise to do it again and again

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.809 
so it's wise to do it again and again
until<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.780> get<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.049> right<00:03:20.260> okay<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.280> going

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
until you get it right okay so going

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.199 
until you get it right okay so going
through<00:03:21.940> here<00:03:22.540> we've<00:03:22.930> got<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.889> lot<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.250> stuff

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
through here we've got a lot of stuff

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.789 
through here we've got a lot of stuff
that's<00:03:25.389> going<00:03:25.599> on<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:26.079> don't<00:03:26.199> have<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.470> keep<00:03:26.650> up

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
that's going on I don't have to keep up

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.199 
that's going on I don't have to keep up
to<00:03:26.829> do<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:27.190> video<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.489> guess<00:03:27.639> I<00:03:27.790> guess<00:03:28.090> I'll

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
to do this video I guess I guess I'll

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.720 
to do this video I guess I guess I'll
get<00:03:28.299> used<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:28.780> doing<00:03:28.930> them<00:03:29.519> adding<00:03:30.519> little

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
get used to doing them adding little

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.729 
get used to doing them adding little
details<00:03:31.239> like<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.660> cracks<00:03:31.959> in<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.470> hooves

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
details like the cracks in the hooves

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.479 
details like the cracks in the hooves
and<00:03:33.540> making<00:03:34.540> sure<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.290> fur<00:03:35.829> and<00:03:35.859> lines

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
and making sure that the fur and lines

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.990 
and making sure that the fur and lines
connecting<00:03:37.260> are<00:03:38.260> all<00:03:38.500> refined<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.639> well

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
connecting are all refined and well

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.379 
connecting are all refined and well
connected<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.859> now<00:03:42.459> we're<00:03:42.910> pretty<00:03:43.269> much

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
connected and now we're pretty much

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.300 
connected and now we're pretty much
ready<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.870> color<00:03:44.199> so<00:03:44.500> I've<00:03:44.709> deleted<00:03:44.980> my

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
ready to color so I've deleted my

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.670 
ready to color so I've deleted my
construction<00:03:46.000> lines<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:47.199> when<00:03:47.379> I<00:03:47.410> get<00:03:47.530> to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
construction lines and so when I get to

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.640 
construction lines and so when I get to
my<00:03:47.889> coloring<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.549> outline<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.389> areas<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.319> be

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
my coloring I outline the areas to be

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.610 
my coloring I outline the areas to be
shaded<00:03:51.220> first<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.209> kind<00:03:52.510> of<00:03:52.599> in<00:03:52.720> my<00:03:52.930> mind<00:03:53.260> set

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
shaded first so I kind of in my mind set

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.710 
shaded first so I kind of in my mind set
a<00:03:53.650> place<00:03:53.919> where<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.459> light<00:03:54.489> will<00:03:54.940> be<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.329> the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
a place where the light will be and the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.220 
a place where the light will be and the
first<00:03:55.989> thing<00:03:56.169> I<00:03:56.290> do<00:03:56.349> is<00:03:56.709> outline<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
first thing I do is outline the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.080 
first thing I do is outline the
specified<00:03:59.230> areas<00:03:59.620> as<00:03:59.889> to<00:04:00.129> where<00:04:00.849> the<00:04:00.940> light

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
specified areas as to where the light

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.939 
specified areas as to where the light
would<00:04:01.209> hit<00:04:01.389> where<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.199> shadow<00:04:02.470> would<00:04:02.769> gather

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
would hit where the shadow would gather

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.520 
would hit where the shadow would gather
and<00:04:03.310> that<00:04:03.370> usually<00:04:04.329> in<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.750> case<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.109> most<00:04:05.349> of

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
and that usually in the case of most of

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.289 
and that usually in the case of most of
this<00:04:05.620> images<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.639> left<00:04:06.879> side<00:04:07.060> of<00:04:07.209> the

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
this images on the left side of the

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.479 
this images on the left side of the
character<00:04:07.569> so<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.900> draw<00:04:08.139> the<00:04:08.199> shadows<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.829> then

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
character so I draw the shadows and then

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.570 
character so I draw the shadows and then
I

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
I

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.450 
I
in<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:11.060> light<00:04:11.270> I've<00:04:12.140> also<00:04:12.740> picked<00:04:13.310> a

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
in the light I've also picked a

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.950 
in the light I've also picked a
different<00:04:13.610> color<00:04:14.000> for<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.210> torso<00:04:14.510> because

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
different color for the torso because

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.440 
different color for the torso because
there<00:04:15.140> isn't<00:04:15.410> hair<00:04:16.040> on<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.400> torso<00:04:16.640> itself<00:04:17.209> on
