00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 most open television chain that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.750
 never social networks a video is 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.120
 causing a lot of expectation is a 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.800
 luminous object which would have a 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.809
 Size of approximately one kilometer 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.880
 long and appeared in the sky 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.730
 allegedly very close to the crater of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.400
 popocatépetl and these images are from 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.490
 past October 25 and of course they cause 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.590
 amazement and many questions between 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.199
 who have seen the speed of the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.660
 object is calculated that was similar to the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.469
 of an airplane imagine the size and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 speed of this artifact that could be 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.390
 captured by video cameras and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.370
 photograph of several people who 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.370
 they found in the vicinity 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.750
 and just to get rid of doubts 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.519
 I have doubts because surely you 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.019
 As I have several I have a line 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.879
 pink margarita phone is 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.129
 researcher of the institute of 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.500
 astronomy of the unam daisy many 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.930
 thank you for taking the call that we 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.390
 you can say of this sighting that of 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.420
 what is it about what fell in there 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.820
 the popocatepetl volcano crater many 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.620
 thank you daisies, good afternoon, yo 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.020
 I would say thank you very much for this one 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:22.010
 for the good call I want to say 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:26.800
 that in principle nothing else is a video is 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:30.210
 not that I know there are not many more 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.799
 and the other one is that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:39.300
 these sizes and everything that have been handled 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.619
 is assuming it was really a 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.619
 real object 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:52.330
 that was at the distance of thanks 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:56.110
 obviously that if it's an object it 's 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:00.700
 much closer to the camera than the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:04.120
 crater or it can be very small is now a 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.900
 little in reasoning is if it were a 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:12.580
 object so big at the distance of 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:16.690
 crater causes a lot of surprise that there is not 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.210
 an interaction of that giant object or 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.010
 with the environment 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.670
 we could then be before the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.730
 daisy possibility that it would be 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.510
 let's say from an image that either 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.550
 it could have been produced either simple 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.830
 and simply as we mentioned it 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.140
 it's an object that was much closer 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.090
 from the camera and much further away from 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:47.870
 popo crater exactly 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.959
 that is the reasoning that is not me 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.870
 in that video that is presented in this 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.620
 video that is presented there are several 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:01.280
 contradictions one is just is 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.970
 is this question of what 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.550
 that there is no interaction if it were a 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.700
 very large object there would be an interaction 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.640
 with the environment with the atmosphere 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.819
 etcetera that is not also noticeable 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.380
 supposedly falling into the center of 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:24.440
 crater does not notice any impact or 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.880
 be the video of the crater with its fumarole 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.880
 and everything keeps happening when this falls and 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:37.500
 on the other hand 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.640
 the same video shows this object 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.480
 superimposed 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.180
 on the other hand in the video then there 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.480
 evidence that it is night or when 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.690
 less at sunset and it shows 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.170
 the object fully illuminated and with 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.410
 a shadow from behind 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:03.400
 then all of that makes you think or that 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:08.200
 is a long photomontage the other 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:12.909
 and finally it can be something much more 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.989
 close that was that was in the 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:19.750
 path between the camera and the crater or 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.639
 something stuck to the camera lens by 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:29.139
 say something and that seems to give all the 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.380
 appearance that is further falling 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:35.500
 in the crater when not necessarily 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:39.330
 It could be like that, not pink daisy 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.470
 pink pink cardón investigator 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.180
 researcher in astronomy phenomena 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.919

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.110
 photographs that have been circulating 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.580
