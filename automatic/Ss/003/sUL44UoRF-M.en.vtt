00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:23.820
 apartment where the owner then 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.670
 We work here is specific 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.699
 to change all the attention of the existing 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.470
 apartment we already did it in the video 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.050
 before I showed you guys work 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.940
 in Syria is doing here I am 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.910
 showing in that moment we already exchanged 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.710
 all cars all circuits and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.690
 now the time has finally come 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.739
 We may be exchanging the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.510
 light picture 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.820
 all this structure will be removed 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.649
 now taking advantage of the hook here 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 showing the difficulties 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.559
 that we have when dealing with a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.320
 local landlord do all 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.719
 step-by-step replacement 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.330
 in the evening we also had to 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.780
 leave the client with energy 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:19.200
 All this reflection you're seeing here 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:21.830
 the answer is on the picture, I'm 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.509
 making a point of showing you 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.250
 whenever you pick up a customer who 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.479
 amateur you will have to have this 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.970
 alternative was to make the substitution 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:40.579
 of the old circuits and we went 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:43.470
 placing we reposition power 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.590
 It arrives here right only now that the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.350
 time for us to move in the frame 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.750
 Work will take a few more hours. 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.980
 We 'll be showing you there. 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.930
 following the service 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.270
 in this case unfortunately we do not 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.810
 we have the earth life in the input pattern 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 in general 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.350
 we are on the fifth floor but from 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.590
 of the moment of the apartment 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.760
