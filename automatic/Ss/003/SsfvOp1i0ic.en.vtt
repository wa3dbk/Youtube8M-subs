00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
to get a different consistency with raw

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.420 
to get a different consistency with raw
cashews<00:00:18.060> I'm<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.779> using<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:20.070> number

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
cashews I'm going to be using the number

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.560 
cashews I'm going to be using the number
four<00:00:21.119> grid<00:00:21.449> which<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.990> 1/16<00:00:22.890> inch<00:00:23.189> holes<00:00:23.570> I'll

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
four grid which is 1/16 inch holes I'll

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.460 
four grid which is 1/16 inch holes I'll
take<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> rest<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.350> my<00:00:25.529> raw<00:00:25.800> cashews<00:00:27.470> pour

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
them in here and it's very important to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.959 
them in here and it's very important to
keep<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.890> covered<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.489> don't<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.940> a

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
keep this covered so you don't have a

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.660 
keep this covered so you don't have a
blowback<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.410> want<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.040> weight<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
blowback and you want the weight of the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:01:17.880 
blowback and you want the weight of the
pusher<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.329> most<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.750> work

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.380 

that's<00:01:18.890> enough<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.520> demonstration<00:01:20.240> let

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
that's enough of the demonstration let

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.270 
that's enough of the demonstration let
me<00:01:20.540> get<00:01:20.660> a<00:01:20.690> spoon<00:01:20.870> and<00:01:21.230> we'll<00:01:21.380> taste<00:01:21.590> that

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.389 

let's<00:01:28.280> take<00:01:28.430> a<00:01:28.490> close-up

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.190

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.020 

delicious<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.479> only<00:01:37.689> problem<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
delicious the only problem is the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.630 
delicious the only problem is the
temperatures<00:01:40.600> up<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.900> almost<00:01:41.710> 50<00:01:42.280> degrees

temperatures up to almost 50 degrees
centigrade<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.780> pea<00:01:43.960> trip<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.470> too<00:01:44.799> hot

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
centigrade and the pea trip is too hot

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.260 
centigrade and the pea trip is too hot
to<00:01:45.310> even<00:01:45.460> touch<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.729> although<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.970> can<00:01:49.240> make

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
to even touch so although you can make

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.340
