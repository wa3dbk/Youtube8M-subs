00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
is but I get this feeling that they've

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.840 
is but I get this feeling that they've
been<00:02:36.990> height<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.920> they're<00:02:38.310> not<00:02:38.460> gonna<00:02:38.610> live

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
consistency pile of duality they can get

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.780 
consistency pile of duality they can get
to<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.260> necrovalley<00:02:46.530> really<00:02:47.070> fast<00:02:47.310> they

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
to that and necrovalley really fast they

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.850 
to that and necrovalley really fast they
can<00:02:47.970> reuse<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.570> necrovalley<00:02:48.900> cards<00:02:49.560> over

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
can reuse that necrovalley cards over

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.400 
can reuse that necrovalley cards over
and<00:02:49.980> over<00:02:50.280> again<00:02:50.370> they<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.240> recycling<00:02:52.110> power

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
and over again they have recycling power

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.740 
and over again they have recycling power
they<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.130> controlled<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.850> have<00:02:54.030> all<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.450> that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
they have controlled to have all of that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.140 
they have controlled to have all of that
but<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:56.010> still<00:02:56.340> seems<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.760> missing

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
but it still seems to be missing

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
it still still seems to be something

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.350 
it still still seems to be something
that's<00:02:59.820> wrong<00:03:00.410> there<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:02.940> course<00:03:02.970> you've
