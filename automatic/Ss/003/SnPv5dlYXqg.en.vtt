00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.560
 we were not enough 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.900
 sued is not navy 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.390
 supertalent week 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.399
 we worked in mid-March even a little left 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.399
 whatever it is m 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.960
 I think that la la la la la la 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 the key was this week this week we pushed a lot 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.899
 everyone was at the fight is very motivated and very focused on the 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.249
 job 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.499
 it's the first time I've been able to make sure we're working 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.890
 so as a work tool pays 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.890
 and here you have seen that day a team had a face 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 our people we did 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.440
 I hope to start from scratch 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 a room off with the project whatever its activities on more 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.580
 specific 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.390
 after listening to it works today but 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.490
 the team we have a lot of progress to do yet 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.150
 and we are aware that the troops 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
 to motivate the troops 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.090
 listen to me I always have recreation centers it's another style of play 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.890
 so work and I'm lucky to have 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.810
 djamel belmadi 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.460
 so she who follow me a lot 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.660
 at the level of the weight at the level 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.280
 I still work that 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.760
 I needed that 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.570
 and in europe 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.420
 shows people that the qatar phenomenon 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.490
 so we're not finished 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.560
 let it be me because it will die 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.660
 but percent the body still has in the airlock to make believe 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.800
 success is a gift 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.060
 according to the will that physically with their work to do 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.030
 I still have 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 something too much given no chance 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819
 pretty classically practically nothing killed 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.469
 we were in summer 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.469
 and there in fact the attempt 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:47.839
 haddad collective defense collective pata 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.839
 the two defenders not the attackers were the first to defend 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.829
 a rise above 3 the Corsican that made the difference and the team 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.069
 it is by this is a cohesion in the work of a political week 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.889
 this is not 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.789
 for Swiss football work properly professionally and 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:06.499
 looters 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.770
 this rise results in a port 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.529
 it is true that compared to the match of Tanzania and started shortly before 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.629
 and a little big progress peacefully 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.080
