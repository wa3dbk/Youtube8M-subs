00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.069
 it 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.600
 hello I am at zarqa professor of 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.850
 belly dance we will work 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.559
 the undulation of the belly for good 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.840
 understand the work of the belly and the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.680
 basin we're going to start doing 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.320
 a lengthened exercise I extend my back 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.160
 on the floor I lay my feet flat and 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.859
 I'm bending my legs 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.410
 we start by burying the back of the 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.900
 school play my lower back and tailbone 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.520
 stay on the ground in this position 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.520
 I climb the basin to the top 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.070
 my belly came out in this position 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.440
 I rock the basin and I tighten the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.170
 buttocks i'm going to rest my back on the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.240
 ground starting with the dorsal and in 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.550
 imagining that I pose each vertebrae 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.860
 one after another on the floor while 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:04.810
 gently until I reach 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:08.140
 at coccyx we go there camber rides rocker 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.360
 and down to the coccyx 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.320
 let's rework the same standing motion 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:18.710
 camber pushes the pelvis forward rocking 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.480
 and go down vertebra by vertebra 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:29.270
 up to coccyx camber thumbs toggle 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:31.360
 bring back now we're going to do the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.460
 same thing but with less amplitude 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.700
 and naturally leaving 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.740
 knees think about using the contraction 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.220
 abdominals 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:52.110
 these parts 1 and 2 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:53.580
 and 1 and 2 and 1 and 2 and that's it you know 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.260
 now make a ripple of the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.460
 belly find me in the video 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.460
 tremor
