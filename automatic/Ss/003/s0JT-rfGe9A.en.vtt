start to look at you what what do you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.619 
start to look at you what what do you
maybe<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> misconception<00:00:48.180> about

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
maybe think is the misconception about

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.240 
maybe think is the misconception about
you<00:00:48.750> what's<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.190> got

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
