00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.819
 if all the kids see this 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.649
 states and this here is minecraft today os 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.450
 I'm going to teach you to do silly things 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.430
 map that hears the truth that seen by 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.170
 there not seen a forum and I laughed like a 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.300
 so much in agreement and that's all this is 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.800
 I have to show it here there were already three 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.949
 buds because surely they will look like 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.630
 very very very horny to see part one is 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.279
 very important that you have a speaker 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.499
 powerful because if you 're not going to load the 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.999
 minecraft is going to graciÃ¡n or more 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.039
 floral that has a lot of 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.409
 agreement then well let's go to a 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.419
 player let's create world we can 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.890
 creative in more options 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.750
 We give by default and we will customize 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.609
 these are the criticisms that will come out 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.230
 it's always worth 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.810
 then in template we can add several 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.760
 agree like this 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.250
 I just added to where I use them 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.300
 template after and you give made of 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.300
 create world and point 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.340
 we have added randomly so a little 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.559
 from her this one came out of a flat world not 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.980
 obviously but the prairie roll does not 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.230
 with solar emit their forests bamboo landmarks 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.210
 in his four shits he goes from his cement 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.890
 around here your books your nonsense not 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.430
 and it's good then the height for 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.430
 down then 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 decent according as you are seeing 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.590
 we can bite a lot also yesterday there 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.730
 of anything goes is a world when in order to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.980
 bills 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.320
 and after we're in the shit it's worth 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.180
 and without mysteries you have learned it well 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.100
 it is easy to create a flat world there is no 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.470
 mystery up there well then nothing 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.720
 we create creative again more options 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.550
 default customize and then here in 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.200
 templates we are going to put this what what 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.930
 you have in the information of the video is worth 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.610
 Control we give vy rate of these and you 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.350
 these squares come out and we're going to 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.939
 delete vale 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.430
 to see we check that there is none left 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.930
 more than we're going to use template and has 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.590
 appeared from this pressure plate 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.380
 watermelon and piston we give to done and you 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.350
 we give to create world and automatically I 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.500
 appears from the world 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.750
 we come out in this world of agreement is a 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.700
 way we throw a thing and already 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.159
 they automatically start generating the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.039
 world starts to generate melons but 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.230
 green to bore I'm going to remove this 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.450
 ok but to bore you by making them your 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.829
 own roads but of course the ice lines 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.150
 they have jumped well around here and this is 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.650
 starts to move everything is going to start 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.079
 move and everything is going to start to break already 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.950
 generate the melons themselves according 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.480
 the lab is 100% assured someone 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.879
 I can move calmly but as 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.829
 that you see this already begins to be more the 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.230
 gaza is worth it because the cloud all over the world 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.569
 whole has been generated with pistons a 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.459
 melon and a pre its play picturesque x 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.340
 road of a melon out the 5 million 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.370
 that are distributed fall and generate more now 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.200
 same trim to a fps is worth no point 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.629
 move and it starts with the flagstone 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.730
 die agreement so if you want to create it 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.739
 this is the moment of agreement is cat are 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.909
 agree its fun is a 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.730
 foolishness but it's something I wanted 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:58.340
 show you and I have no idea how I'm going to 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.510
 put it title but good if you like
