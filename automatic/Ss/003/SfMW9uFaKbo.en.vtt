 1 company personal combat missions on 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.500
 Chinese light tank of the seventh level 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.850
 BB 131 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.050

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.000
 This video is made on request. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.539
 left in the comments to the video on 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.880
 tt 15 to complete the task 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.300
 need help allies put at least 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.399
 4000 damage transmitting intelligence 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.260
 beating caterpillars to perform this 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.690
 tasks with honors need to pass 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.610
 intelligence on the enemy's car or 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.789
 chase the caterpillars until it is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.360
 destroyed light tanks are not my very 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.610
 favourite 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.570
 technology therefore filling this task 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.190
 spent a lot of time and personal nerves 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.250
 combat missions appeared in our game 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.140
 just a month ago even less and therefore 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.539
 so many players try them 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.519
 perform and as a consequence of the sea of lungs 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.770
 tanks in battles in other words 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.110
 competitors are also important 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.060
 play and allies are also busy 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.170
 performance of their tasks is not going to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.869
 fulfill its role 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.479
 it often happened that you fly on what 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.799
 hill or stand in the bush thinking 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.990
 now on the candle 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.380
 but no allies where 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.119
 parted consider the boys in vain which you 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.119
 mountainous 1390 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.860
 tried on it also bought near 131 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.200
 in vain not to sit in the hangar 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.600
 wait until we x and fail come back 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.289
 at first on the pic and it turned out very even 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.720
 nothing 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.420
 but at some point a fracture occurred and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.000
 stat on it popova as in principle and on 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 my xi suspect the whole thing in this 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.299
 tasks and nerves that I spent on her 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.189
 performance 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.500
 but i'm learning getting better and better 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.959
 enough introduction now in this battle 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.970
 chose an aggressive way to beat down the pulse 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.470
 let's give our chance to the allies 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.060
 damage 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.869
 it is difficult to say that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.869
 life on the line 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.710
 e100 destroyed assign additional 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.430
 task completed left to perform 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.430
 main 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.239
 he is probably shocked himself but his torment is still 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.239
 just starts decide to go to him in 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.790
 board while he is recharging and starting 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.939
 shoot then in front then rear roller 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.329
 beating harp pluses occasionally slips 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.629
 damage and remember to move the art then something else 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.629
 alive 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.359
 and then an unexpected surprise so carried away 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:23.030
 rink miyagi that did not notice that the team 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:23.030
