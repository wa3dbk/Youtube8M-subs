this is Robert Bornstein from Roberts
tropical<00:00:03.750> paradise<00:00:04.200> garden<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.830> today<00:00:05.339> we're

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
tropical paradise garden and today we're

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.270 
tropical paradise garden and today we're
going<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.700> learn<00:00:05.819> how<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.680> make<00:00:07.680> cuttings<00:00:08.160> from

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
going to learn how to make cuttings from

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.490 
going to learn how to make cuttings from
this<00:00:08.519> Dracena<00:00:08.940> Warren<00:00:09.300> acai<00:00:09.599> now<00:00:10.260> if<00:00:10.320> your

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
this Dracena Warren acai now if your

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.080 
this Dracena Warren acai now if your
cedars<00:00:10.860> are<00:00:11.010> kind<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.280> unique<00:00:11.580> sometimes

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
cedars are kind of unique sometimes

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.270 
cedars are kind of unique sometimes
because<00:00:12.330> they<00:00:12.509> grow<00:00:12.780> all<00:00:13.130> different<00:00:14.130> ways

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
because they grow all different ways

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.310 
because they grow all different ways
this<00:00:14.580> was<00:00:14.790> growing<00:00:15.210> horizontally<00:00:16.020> towards

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
this was growing horizontally towards

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.760 
this was growing horizontally towards
the<00:00:16.590> ground<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.250> then<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:18.029> split<00:00:18.770> off

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the ground and then it just split off

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.599 
the ground and then it just split off
and<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.640> tremendous<00:00:22.130> so<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.369> we're<00:00:23.519> going

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and it's tremendous so what we're going

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.640 
and it's tremendous so what we're going
to<00:00:23.670> do<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.439> with<00:00:25.439> these<00:00:25.619> pruners<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:27.650> take

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to do here with these pruners is take

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.100 
to do here with these pruners is take
cuttings<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:29.490> put<00:00:29.699> them<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:29.939> these<00:00:30.090> pots

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.549 

and<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.739> we're<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> do<00:00:35.989> this<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.410> one

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
and so we're going to do this little one

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.970 
and so we're going to do this little one
we're<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.920> snip<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:39.980> we're

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
we're going to snip right here we're

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.700 
we're going to snip right here we're
going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> remove<00:00:41.370> some<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> lower<00:00:42.059> leaves

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
going to remove some of the lower leaves

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.229 
going to remove some of the lower leaves
because<00:00:43.710> without<00:00:44.219> any<00:00:44.550> roots<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.000> can't

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
because without any roots that can't

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.139 
because without any roots that can't
support<00:00:45.390> all<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.789> we're<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
support all that and then we're going to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.670 
support all that and then we're going to
stick<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:49.700> just<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
stick this in just like that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.310 
stick this in just like that
that's<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.700> have<00:00:53.880> to<00:00:54.060> do<00:00:54.240> now<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.200> we

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
that's all we have to do now when we

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.950 
that's all we have to do now when we
fertilize<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.490> use<00:00:56.960> liquid

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
fertilize it we can use liquid

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
fertilize it we can use liquid
fertilizer<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:59.040> a<00:00:59.070> Miracle<00:00:59.550> Grow<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.940> can

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
fertilizer like a Miracle Grow we can

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.920 
fertilizer like a Miracle Grow we can
use<00:01:00.450> some<00:01:00.810> benign<00:01:01.770> vitamins<00:01:02.430> which<00:01:02.670> helps<00:01:03.090> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
use some benign vitamins which helps it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.290 
use some benign vitamins which helps it
get<00:01:04.470> along<00:01:06.290> here<00:01:07.290> we're<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.060> take<00:01:09.060> these

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
get along here we're going to take these

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.870 
get along here we're going to take these
off<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:11.300> another<00:01:12.300> trick<00:01:12.660> is<00:01:13.010> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.220> trim

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
off and another trick is you can trim

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.530 
off and another trick is you can trim
the<00:01:15.030> leaves<00:01:15.620> like<00:01:16.620> this<00:01:17.300> because<00:01:18.300> these<00:01:18.480> are

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the leaves like this because these are

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.700 
the leaves like this because these are
very<00:01:18.690> very<00:01:19.260> large<00:01:19.590> leaves<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.560> because<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
very very large leaves and because the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.700 
very very large leaves and because the
leaves<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.340> large<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:24.810> might<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.410> wilt

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
leaves are so large it might just wilt

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.480 
leaves are so large it might just wilt
and<00:01:25.920> die

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and die

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.430 
and die
so<00:01:26.760> by<00:01:27.500> trimming<00:01:28.500> them<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.990> had<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> better

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
so by trimming them you had a better

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.230 
so by trimming them you had a better
chance<00:01:31.830> of<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.130> rooting<00:01:32.580> we're<00:01:32.910> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> put

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
chance of it rooting we're going to put

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.130 
chance of it rooting we're going to put
that<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.600> there<00:01:33.810> too<00:01:35.570> now<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.020> have

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
that in there too now for that we have

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.990 
that in there too now for that we have
the<00:01:37.290> larger<00:01:37.770> pots<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.460> larger

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the larger pots for these larger

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.140 
the larger pots for these larger
cuttings<00:01:43.580> here<00:01:44.580> again<00:01:44.850> we're<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.090> to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
cuttings here again we're going to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.920 
cuttings here again we're going to
remove<00:01:45.450> most<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:46.050> these<00:01:46.140> lower<00:01:46.950> leaves<00:01:47.930> too

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
remove most of these lower leaves too

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.820 
remove most of these lower leaves too
number<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.440> expose<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.660> stem<00:01:51.660> now<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.710> this

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
number one expose the stem now in this

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.650 
number one expose the stem now in this
case<00:01:53.100> we're<00:01:53.400> really<00:01:53.580> lucky<00:01:53.820> there's<00:01:54.420> already

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
case we're really lucky there's already

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.740 
case we're really lucky there's already
some<00:01:54.960> roots<00:01:55.200> forming<00:01:56.150> so<00:01:57.150> this<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.510> more

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
some roots forming so this is more

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.730 
some roots forming so this is more
likely<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.290> root<00:01:58.650> than<00:01:58.890> ones<00:01:59.100> without<00:01:59.370> those

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
likely to root than ones without those

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.310 
likely to root than ones without those
little<00:02:01.740> roots<00:02:02.360> we<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.600> stick<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.520> like<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
little roots we just stick it in like so

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.590 
little roots we just stick it in like so
instant<00:02:07.320> plant<00:02:07.910> now<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> don't<00:02:09.239> want<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> let

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
instant plant now you don't want to let

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.479 
instant plant now you don't want to let
these<00:02:09.750> dry<00:02:10.140> out<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.860> want<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:11.130> keep<00:02:11.310> these

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
these dry out you want to keep these

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.170 
these dry out you want to keep these
moist

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
moist

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.350 
moist
you<00:02:12.720> also<00:02:12.840> could<00:02:13.230> miss<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.709> leaves<00:02:14.180> every<00:02:15.180> day

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
you also could miss the leaves every day

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.260 
you also could miss the leaves every day
too<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:16.050> helps<00:02:16.850> because

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.720 

the<00:02:21.270> first<00:02:21.570> few<00:02:21.810> weeks<00:02:21.960> are<00:02:22.200> crucial<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the first few weeks are crucial in the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.450 
the first few weeks are crucial in the
plant<00:02:24.000> development<00:02:25.550> for<00:02:26.550> root<00:02:26.760> growth<00:02:27.170> as<00:02:28.460> you

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
plant development for root growth as you

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.750 
plant development for root growth as you
see<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:30.270> can<00:02:30.450> put<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> couple<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.110> each<00:02:31.170> pot<00:02:31.760> or

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
see we can put a couple in each pot or

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.089 
see we can put a couple in each pot or
do<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.380> one<00:02:34.380> for<00:02:34.710> each<00:02:34.800> pot

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099
