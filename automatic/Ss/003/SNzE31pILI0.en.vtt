00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello friends 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.180
 today we are going to prepare a new recipe 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.940
 today we are going to make a date pudding for 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.790
 this pudding we will need 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.220
 one liter of milk 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.130
 two jelly sachets in strawberry flavor 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.820
 400 grams of condensed milk or one 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.850
 small tin that has 397 grams that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.390
 comes to do the same and we're going to 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.040
 need 400 grams of strawberries 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.950
 Well, let's start 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.920
 The first thing we are going to do is put 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.060
 they will have the milk and we will take the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.060
 two envelopes of gelatin 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.460
 we are going to put it on a weak fire because 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.059
 all we want is not always 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.570
 we want it to boil well while giving 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.780
 time to our milk let's take the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.940
 400 grams of expres with can of 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.479
 condensed milk and we 're going to crush it 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.479
 all 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.270
 all right 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.240
 Well, since we already have warm milk 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.900
 that we are going to add the dams with 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.900
 condensed milk 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.060
 good once we have well mixed 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.380
 everything and we have and we check that the milk 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.380
 it has warmed up again 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.580
 without allowing it to boil 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.580
 let's remove from the fire 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.700
 well now what we are going to do is 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.930
 put it in our molds here I have 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.590
 two I will use these two same if 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.800
 you have a bigger one where 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.040
 You can throw everything because it also serves 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.349
 but I 'm going to use these two as 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.819
 you see is 1 round normal aluminum and 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:25.480
 I have this also is hilarious 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.480
 let's go putting 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.450
 here 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.710
 well once we have in our 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.400
 molds we'll let it cool and what 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.620
 We will have in the fridge 24 hours before 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.159

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:56.489
