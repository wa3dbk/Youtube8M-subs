I<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.550> it's<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:20.000> kind<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.900> part<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.410> DNA

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
I think it's a kind of part of the DNA

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.820 
I think it's a kind of part of the DNA
from<00:02:22.879> The<00:02:23.060> Liberator<00:02:23.330> times<00:02:23.989> where<00:02:24.379> four<00:02:24.650> wins

were<00:02:24.980> very<00:02:25.250> successful<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:26.510> will<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.019> I

think<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.739> really<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.980> nice<00:02:28.160> AG<00:02:28.700> product<00:02:29.090> and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
think it's really a nice AG product and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.670 
think it's really a nice AG product and
we're<00:02:31.130> ready<00:02:31.280> for<00:02:31.340> right
