00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
it supposed to serve a purpose I mean

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.120 
it supposed to serve a purpose I mean
I've<00:00:30.090> never<00:00:30.890> really<00:00:31.890> seen<00:00:32.640> any<00:00:32.850> signs<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
I've never really seen any signs of a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.959 
I've never really seen any signs of a
TST<00:00:35.130> being<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.469> chicken<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.739> mean<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:39.290> this

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
TST being a chicken I mean this as this

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.400 
TST being a chicken I mean this as this
yeah<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.180> think<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.600> unless<00:00:42.870> they're

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
yeah I don't think so unless they're

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.830 
yeah I don't think so unless they're
calling<00:00:43.800> them<00:00:43.920> chicken<00:00:44.520> walkers<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.270> into

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
calling them chicken walkers as into

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.110 
calling them chicken walkers as into
comparison<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.129> those<00:00:47.309> big<00:00:47.579> add<00:00:47.760> apps

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
comparison as one of those big add apps

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
comparison as one of those big add apps
so<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.020> case<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.649> are<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:49.950> small

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
so in that case they are a little small

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.119 
so in that case they are a little small
but<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.820> mean<00:00:51.719> really<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.739> looking<00:00:53.010> on

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
but I mean really I was looking on

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
but I mean really I was looking on
