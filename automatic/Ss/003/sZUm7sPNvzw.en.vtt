00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
seriously why is a redesigned remote

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.320 
seriously why is a redesigned remote
control<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> big<00:00:23.369> deal<00:00:23.550> if<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.300> fact

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
control a big deal if that is in fact

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.359 
control a big deal if that is in fact
what's<00:00:24.869> happening<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.830> will<00:00:25.949> make<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.220> so

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
what's happening what will make this so

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.910 
what's happening what will make this so
different<00:00:26.670> from<00:00:26.730> other<00:00:26.939> remote<00:00:27.269> controls<00:00:27.599> I

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
different from other remote controls I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.290 
different from other remote controls I
think<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> many<00:00:29.820> things<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.240> are

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
think that's one of many things that are

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.189 
think that's one of many things that are
going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> happen<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.869> probably<00:00:31.080> gonna

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
going to happen it's probably gonna

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.569 
going to happen it's probably gonna
happen<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.560> June<00:00:31.769> when<00:00:31.920> Apple<00:00:32.219> has<00:00:32.369> its

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
happen in June when Apple has its

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.370 
happen in June when Apple has its
worldwide<00:00:32.910> developers<00:00:33.090> conference<00:00:33.420> but

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
worldwide developers conference but

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.810 
worldwide developers conference but
think<00:00:34.590> about<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> apple<00:00:35.160> remote<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.700> it's

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
think about the apple remote is it it's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.520 
think about the apple remote is it it's
really<00:00:35.910> an<00:00:36.090> iconic<00:00:36.600> remote<00:00:36.899> control<00:00:37.350> they

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
really an iconic remote control they

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
really an iconic remote control they
took<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.920> device<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.550> everybody<00:00:39.270> who's

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
took this device that everybody who's

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.290 
took this device that everybody who's
familiar<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.399> historically<00:00:41.399> had<00:00:41.790> 45

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
familiar with it historically had 45

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.940 
familiar with it historically had 45
buttons<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.500> stripped<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> down

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
buttons on it and they stripped it down

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.950 
buttons on it and they stripped it down
to<00:00:44.280> its<00:00:44.430> basic<00:00:44.910> functions<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.660> really

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to its basic functions and it's really

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.389 
to its basic functions and it's really
it's<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> type<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> thing<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.890> Apple<00:00:47.250> tries

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
it's the type of thing that Apple tries

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.520 
it's the type of thing that Apple tries
to<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.850> all<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.270> its<00:00:48.420> products<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
to do with all of its products so the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.600 
to do with all of its products so the
fact<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.770> they're<00:00:49.950> now<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> go<00:00:50.430> back

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
fact that they're now going to go back

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.160 
fact that they're now going to go back
into<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.910> apple<00:00:51.270> remote<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.750> make<00:00:51.960> some

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
into the apple remote and make some

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
into the apple remote and make some
changes<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.890> sort<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> shows<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.969> they've

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
changes to it sort of shows that they've

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.549 
changes to it sort of shows that they've
got<00:00:54.270> some<00:00:54.510> greater<00:00:54.750> ambitions<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
got some greater ambitions for the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.319 
got some greater ambitions for the
device<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.520> course<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:57.210> also

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
device and of course I think we're also

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.270 
device and of course I think we're also
going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> new<00:00:57.989> Apple<00:00:58.350> TV<00:00:58.379> coming<00:00:59.129> up

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and it could both at that apple TV is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170 
and it could both at that apple TV is
going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.859> more<00:01:02.010> features<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.489> well<00:01:02.520> and

box what are you hearing about that so

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
box what are you hearing about that so
the<00:01:15.659> apple<00:01:15.990> TV<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.560> those<00:01:16.650> products

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the apple TV is one of those products

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
the apple TV is one of those products
it's<00:01:17.130> been<00:01:17.280> around<00:01:17.430> forever<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:18.150> pioneer

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it's been around forever really pioneer

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's been around forever really pioneer
the<00:01:18.900> streaming<00:01:19.409> space<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.549> never<00:01:20.700> been

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the streaming space but it's never been

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.300 
the streaming space but it's never been
a<00:01:20.909> huge<00:01:21.330> success<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.830> hasn't<00:01:23.009> got<00:01:23.220> an

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
a huge success you know it hasn't got an

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
a huge success you know it hasn't got an
update<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.759> significant<00:01:24.270> update<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:25.020> years

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
update a significant update in two years

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
update a significant update in two years
so<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.100> product<00:01:26.460> could<00:01:26.580> use<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.880> refresh

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
so the product could use a refresh

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.940 
so the product could use a refresh
there's<00:01:27.689> also<00:01:27.840> been<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.049> lot<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.350> new<00:01:28.590> products

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
there's also been a lot of new products
