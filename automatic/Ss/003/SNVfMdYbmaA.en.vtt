00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 welcome to start how do we do 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.990
 Today I make you see how 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.730
 made matches of simple small 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.769
 match with cheese 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.870
 go here we go, so buy from 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.060
 straw flick or do there you 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.340
 even lying down helped him all pdd tape to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.150
 winds from the look that you 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.980
 do not want to go beyond 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.109
 the big one in classic suede 1 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.969
 that is to say roughly between 10 and 15 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.000
 centimeters I did about 10 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.290
 cm wide and the length we do not care 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.210
 it's following the number you have 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.329
 need then the principle being the same 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.610
 for every single thing but of the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.719
 gilding on the top I was going to see that's 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.719
 really very very simple to do 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.760
 still gilding on the top 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 so I make you such as 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.430
 a few it's worthless of it's used to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.780
 just press the principle is the same 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.860
 so I'm going to do that 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.930
 after we take cheese from the east 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.460
 mountainous where all kinds of cheeses 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.479
 to the one you like after a cheese 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.340
 that they are doing relatively well 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.450
 and we just have sprinkled on it all 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.190
 simply and that's crazy is just about 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.420
 almost everywhere we took a little bit to 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.300
 that of course sticks on the yellow 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:48.030
 of egg to avoid that hillionnais 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.570
 everywhere to find finished and then using 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.899
 of a knife 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:58.550
 we come to make small bands then 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:03.090
 here I am going to look at the picture 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.070
 I came with a group rather it's going 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.530
 to be simpler and you make 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.860
 strips you cut strips had 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.860
 girlfriends but nearly half 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.540
 centimeter cm for more to miss this 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.970
 hot evening it will inflate to 6 of 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.200
 flossing gold diamonds if you want 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.820
 to make a little thicker you can 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 send the day a little thicker 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.780
 and here she is doing you like that for 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.930
 everything so I advise you to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.100
 cut out directly on a paper like 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.540
 it will already be it will already be a tree to 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:46.230
 take them one by one to put them 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:50.130
 on a small one on a mold 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:56.519
 why cook them so if they are already 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:59.239
 it's simpler that's what it gives 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.239
 closer 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.510
 Here there's more that's been a break 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.370
 by a put them in the oven during saturation 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.860
 hassi ben itah ten minutes 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.600
 way where you have to watch the cheese from 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.430
 ti fades and brown them you can 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.650
 go out then obviously we can also 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.170
 to make small tornadoes with arms he 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.480
 just east of the salt pond this 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.040
 way there and it will also be very good me 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.670
 I prefer foods like that it's 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.340
 better and that's your opinion m more 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.210
 ready to taste soon on how 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.210
 do we have a good appetite
