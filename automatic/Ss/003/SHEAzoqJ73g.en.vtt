00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.170
 pity that I sheep the 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.619
 Transform the pigs to devote 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.460
 zombies just so ingenious a pig 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.990
 two themes should be great as well 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.089
 Well in any case , I would say then 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.439
 we can already go to the next topic 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.480
 yes I have a lot of topics today 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.589
 luggage as he realizes and I run too 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.999
 more or less just around 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.369
 but as said the jobs already on the 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.619
 away from the sls play is not meant 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.180
 I now great what he rich 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.700
 but that I just theme 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.530
 appeal and I just want to say we 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.380
 now collect so much more wool 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.700
 because then we can I guess also 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.830
 relatively nice even after that carpets 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.240
 make or 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.790
 yes we can add a bit down-wool 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.280
 There are carpets in 16 but the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.380
 1.6 minecraft version but you can 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.690
 To decorate it relatively nice 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.420
 anyway and the leaves I take 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.070
 also just with it we can 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.450
 not as said make beautiful hedges 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.540
 so we might as well even 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.430
 at the beginning so next topic new 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.860
 luck however one formulates 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.000
 you definitely wanted to 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.000
 necessarily hear again a school story 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.100
 and i could stop laughing again though 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.140
 i only think about the school story resp 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.450
 if only I remember that I am here 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.640
 worth telling, I could already do that 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.780
 let go again 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.210
 maybe that is not for some 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.340
 so funny but it was a situation like that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.580
 funny i just know awesome 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.530
 Definitely something so we are in as well 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.520
 lessons were so 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.610
 social science is even this 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.049
 happened last school year and there 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.930
 it was just about us doing so 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.490
 Different things should look where 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.470
 young people in politics 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.040
 could somehow participate in something 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.810
 Say the greenpeace youth or one 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.880
 Citizens' meeting where you possibly also 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.170
 So there are different ways to participate 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.460
 I can not do that now 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.140
 Be sure to be more specific 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.040
 would like to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.560
 but there are many 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.000
 possibilities as I said and then has 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.080
 everyone deals with a thing 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.640
 I have somehow with such a 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.439
 civic assembly or not exactly me 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.739
 have dealt with petition with 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.730
 That was petition and then had one 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.760
 other group the greenpeace youth and 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.560
 then we should 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.909
 so exchange one of the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.890
 Greenpeace is with me 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.209
 one of the group of petition and 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.709
 then you put each other that 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.590
 concept before I think that knows 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.870
 everyone and yes, whether the teaching method as 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.340
 Of course, it is also considered good 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.769
 gauge the viewer 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.150
 but then we have every case on each 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.260
 exchanged case I have a petition 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.790
 presented then because I could already 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.299
 run right again then that was 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.739
 just so good because he like it 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.379
 greenpeace youth a and then became 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.780
 asked he says yes the gps youth is 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.829
 stop the youth of greenpeace and then 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.120
 It's not that much 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.859
 greenpeace youth received but 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.329
 The last ones just became yes 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.319
 of course, is one little bit and but 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.870
 then the story was taken from the 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.180
 Greenpeace Youth tells me 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.269
 I do not know why I laughed so much 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.239
 but there he is, it's the story 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.250
 the butterfinger i could not anymore 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.510
 Stop laughing as I already heard 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.450
 it is the story of the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.280
 butterfinger i just could not 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.970
 stop to laugh I can not 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.799
 why it was so funny 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.629
 really was very funny because I 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.819
 he can not laugh any laugh anymore 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.769
 It was definitely just 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.090
 really funny though not at all 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.829
 I was so funny that I totally 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.000
 funny it is in any case yes caught 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.150
 already good to the history of 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.819
 butterfinger yes and then became 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.840
 started telling yes and then was 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.220
 since his company has proven nestlé and that 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.019
 Such butterfinger also produces 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.859
 always emphasize this debugging instead 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:52.760
 that says yes or no bofinger says 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:56.870
 in this weird emphasis on everyone 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.909
 case we had already clarified 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.530
 the company nestlé has this batta 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.889
 Do not finger the mother's finger or 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.329
 like this 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:07.310
 the wallerfinger made and then 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.979
 had the green vision their heroes 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.799
 Rich did accomplished and got up 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:15.979
 made that ball affinger for the road 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.940
 always to banish and now if you 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.870
 thinks I thought up then 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.099
 There is history that works 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.349
 It really happened that relationship 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.669
 These butter fingers are taken off the market 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.169
 has definitely been there I do not know 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.639
 what exactly was with them I have too 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.900
 not listening properly when i'm honest 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.940
 that was just how it was 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.120
 funny was like 'bafin' once said 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.770
 was wondering why it was but 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.729
 just so funny in the situation and 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.020
 was then just told somehow 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.400
 I was told that I'm not sure 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.340
 that was just right 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.780
 funny and we took care of that 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.840
 that somehow these butterfinger 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.130
 have been destroyed or not 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.900
 because he was in the market someday 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.539
 with whom I was fine and then 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.240
 I do not know I just could not 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.470
 I just laughed 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.440
 as if there is no tomorrow if 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.350
 So I want to have it really easy 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.229
 just laughed at this banner 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.120
 finger did not know why this word 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.680
 I will never get out of my head again 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.639
 Whenever I hear that, I could 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.490
 laugh straight away 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:18.139
 just super funny BEEN situation 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.389
 and then I laughed so loud 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.740
 that the teacher said so was 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.570
 Now you want to class clown 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.310
 but I think I want me 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.259
 to make class clown but somehow 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.150
 I do not know somehow I had to over 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.229
 These butter fingers laugh somehow 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.880
 I could not do that too much 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.680
 also knows the feeling if you are so long 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.539
 have to stop and somehow not stop 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.720
 can not walk at all anymore 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.860
 you can just come on devil 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.710
 do not stop going out 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.880
 and that's exactly what happened to me 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.000
 Just funny could be easy 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.280
 no longer laughing or now that is 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.919
 but not so funny anymore because of these 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.620
 butterfinger and then that would be even so 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.030
 funny accents this Dafinger indeed the 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.820
 but were I not so I do not know 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.139
 when I'm so healthy or something and me 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.060
 I just laughed more and 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.199
 I know I'm going to be so right on 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.090
 Maybe that's what laughing binder is 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.590
 a bit exhausting and I know 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.099
 then somehow everyone started to 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.810
 laugh 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:14.210
 I think Jonas knows them too 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.949
 history maybe google where he uses 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.449
 then also google pays attention and again 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.430
 even said oh shit that is 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.349
 not even funny and I have 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.199
 just keep going over this 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:26.330
 palfinger thought and I have me 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:29.479
 just not just a dish I have 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.880
 I can not remember and then 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.349
 you should be the best then should 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.849
 we'll introduce what we're after 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:38.909
 partner said and 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:41.249
 I just have it 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:45.029
 laughed because then I should introduce 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:45.839
 what the zkb are i could easily 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.319
 no more 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:50.610
 Oh, I just did not want to be people anymore 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.959
 I just could not I have 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.009
 Just laughed it then 

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:54.059
 but got out somehow because I 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:56.369
 somehow tear me together 

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:58.169
 but could in the English word palfinger 

00:06:56.369 --> 00:07:01.379
 higher or if I just have something 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:05.309
 of it with war so people I have to go there 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:06.929
 In any case, always laugh well and me 

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:09.629
 I would say look what portal is 

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:11.849
 and then we'll see each other again like that 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:13.679
 there we are again in the esa I wanted 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:16.709
 actually address another topic 

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:19.050
 but it is so hot outside and I am 

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:21.809
 so broken from the whole bada finger 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.639
 history here and that's why I would 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:25.469
 just say at this point 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:28.709
 we'll see that the world only 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:30.539
 once again on boat and yes we then 

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:33.479
 the palins volumes and not 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.979
 it's always so nice around us 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:37.050
 heritage against that we can also soon 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:38.369
 refill in the next episode or 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.409
 in the next shot better said 

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:42.149
 well in any case could me too
