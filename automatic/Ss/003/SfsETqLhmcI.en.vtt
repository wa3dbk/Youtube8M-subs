it's gore-tex bonded to the leather
which<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.660> perforated<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.650> we're<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
which is perforated so we're going to

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.429 
which is perforated so we're going to
start<00:00:26.160> with<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> middle<00:00:26.640> drone<00:00:27.439> installation

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
start with a middle drone installation

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.590 
start with a middle drone installation
so<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.710> put<00:00:28.950> the<00:00:29.430> stock<00:00:29.700> inside<00:00:30.149> the<00:00:30.329> bag

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600

before<00:00:33.600> slip<00:00:34.050> forcefully<00:00:34.590> push<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.950> through

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
before slip forcefully push it through

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.889 
before slip forcefully push it through
the<00:00:35.280> grommet<00:00:37.760> use<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.789> hard<00:00:39.059> surface<00:00:39.270> table<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the grommet use a hard surface table to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.569 
the grommet use a hard surface table to

through couple it with your hands push
it<00:00:45.329> down<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.750> feel<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.110> kind<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.320> locking

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:17.960 

like<00:00:54.850> saw<00:00:56.370> I'll<00:00:57.370> go<00:00:57.550> to<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.760> outside<00:00:58.059> stock

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.779 

so<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.540> feel<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> lock-in

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.020 

now<00:01:24.789> for<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.090> base<00:01:25.210> dock<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.640> use<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:27.969> a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
now for the base dock you use this a

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.740 
now for the base dock you use this a
little<00:01:28.270> bit

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
little bit

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:50.460 
little bit
liquid<00:01:29.289> soap<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.820> grommet

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.419 

can<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.590> fill<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.920> lock<00:01:52.070> in<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.310> position

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:17.620 

next<00:01:58.429> to<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.789> pipe<00:01:59.000> stock

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.400 

and<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> last<00:02:18.930> stock<00:02:19.640> jam<00:02:20.640> stock<00:02:21.260> comes<00:02:22.260> with

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
and the last stock jam stock comes with

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:45.130 
and the last stock jam stock comes with
a<00:02:22.500> large<00:02:22.710> or<00:02:23.010> ring<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:29.670> goes<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.060> groove

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.559 

Stark's<00:02:45.890> in<00:02:46.010> position<00:02:46.640> we<00:02:47.030> use<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.390> hose

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
Stark's in position we use the hose

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.900 
Stark's in position we use the hose
clamp<00:02:47.960> provided<00:02:48.020> with<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.680> bag<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.640> line<00:02:49.880> it

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
clamp provided with the bag and line it

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.590 
clamp provided with the bag and line it
up<00:02:50.150> with<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.510> o-ring<00:02:51.400> underneath<00:02:52.690> bike<00:02:53.690> bag

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
up with the o-ring underneath bike bag

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.760 
up with the o-ring underneath bike bag
so<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.690> hose<00:02:56.810> clamp<00:02:57.170> will<00:02:57.380> tighten<00:02:57.709> up

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
so the hose clamp will tighten up

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:13.750 
so the hose clamp will tighten up
against<00:02:58.100> that<00:02:58.250> all<00:02:58.430> right

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.420 

okay<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.659> last<00:03:14.930> procedure<00:03:15.920> for

okay and the last procedure for

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.089 
okay and the last procedure for
installing<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.909> bag<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.799> applying<00:03:18.799> this

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
installing the bag is applying this

five strips of tape as a backing on it

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.509 
five strips of tape as a backing on it
the<00:03:24.049> easiest<00:03:24.349> way<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.709> get<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:24.980> backing<00:03:25.370> from

the easiest way to get the backing from

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.280 
the easiest way to get the backing from
the<00:03:25.610> tape<00:03:25.730> is<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.150> simply<00:03:26.599> stretched<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.080> take

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
the tape is to simply stretched to take

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.430 
the tape is to simply stretched to take
break<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.280> seal<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.930> pull<00:03:30.140> that<00:03:30.170> away

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
break the seal you just pull that away

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.860

crazy<00:03:31.120> once<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.239> tape<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:32.450> kind<00:03:32.780> of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
crazy once the tape is kind of

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.990 
crazy once the tape is kind of
self-adhesive<00:03:33.650> against<00:03:34.190> itself<00:03:34.489> so<00:03:34.790> we<00:03:34.879> want

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
self-adhesive against itself so we want

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.460 
self-adhesive against itself so we want
to<00:03:35.060> stretch<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.660> maybe<00:03:35.810> double<00:03:36.230> its<00:03:36.379> size

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
to stretch it to maybe double its size

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.339 
to stretch it to maybe double its size
that<00:03:36.680> begins<00:03:37.430> with<00:03:37.610> we<00:03:38.569> start<00:03:38.840> my<00:03:38.930> outside
