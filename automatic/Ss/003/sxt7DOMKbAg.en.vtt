00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 gta a franchise with great success 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.580
 started there in 1997 and revolutionized the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.139
 world of open-world games and is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:18.390
 Of course this game has many 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:20.010
 legal curiosities to tell the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 first game of the gta franchise was 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.260
 launched in October 1997 and perhaps 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 many do not remember or only those who 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.710
 they did not play they should know this but 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.590
 first and second game of the franchise 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.880
 they were in 2d with a view from above 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 two titles released for playstation 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.829
 a pc dreamcast and others that only with the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.570
 playstation 2 arrival gta had 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.059
 your 3d graphics 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.680
 The reason for gta to exist was because 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.450
 creators of this franchise were 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
 developing a game called recent 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 full and the idea of ​​this game is almost the same 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.469
 however it would be a game focused more on 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.539
 police persecution and soon afterwards 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.590
 drastically changed the name and became 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.180
 gt 1 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.219
 many say that the original idea 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.260
 Gta was for you to be a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.809
 and had to arrest bandits 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.720
 and other things but we know that today it is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.250
 totally the opposite of this when gta 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.770
 two were in development that were 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.260
 more or less at the end of March 1999 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.360
 shortly after the launch of London and 9 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.580
 which is an emission package for gta 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.590
 it was announced that gta be imported 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.600
 for nintendo 64 but it would not be a 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.340
 extension of the original version but 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.119
 A revamped version with graphics 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.460
 3d 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.680
 the additional free and more protagonists 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.720
 information about gta 64 was 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 making constants but suddenly not 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.020
 touched on the subject and we know that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.740
 today there is no loom 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.750
 promising 64 gta 3 was certainly the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.220
 great landmark of this series because it was 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.860
 that the player stopped having the vision of 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.810
 up and started playing as nowadays. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.820
 but for the game to be released many 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.590
 modifications had to be made 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.479
 the third set of the series to be played 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.460
 in a kind of fictional new york 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.710
 arrived in stores only a month later 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.509
 of the attacks of September 11 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.189
 this made the producers 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.200
 take some missions involving the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.670
 terrorism and also change without the cover of 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.530
 game that was meant to be 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.840
 but ended up being another that curiously 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.190
 became the standard of the series because it pleased 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.289
 very fans 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.959
 a lot of people complain and ask themselves 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.459
 gta 3 had no bikes and bikes to 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.200
 The answer is simpler than 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.700
 imagine the guys the fact is that the team 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.469
 developers of rockstar 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.540
 simply could not finish the 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:25.739
 time this part leaving the game without the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.720
 two wheels unfortunately plays 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.370
 main character of gta san andreas 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.769

 of life but his voice his voiceover 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.719
 were chosen by a stroke of fate 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.370
 one of the rockstar producers was in 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.590
 a studio choosing the songs for the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.659
 game when he heard the rapper go from 6 to 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.849
 a phone call without thinking twice 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.129
 Sometimes he hired despite the singer 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.709

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.209

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.549
 This is a tribute to Valentino Rossi 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:02.609
 one of the drivers who won the most moto gp 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.739

 fully insulated with a stand 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.150
 abandoned baby 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.729
 remembering that there are no children in any 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.439
 gta games for obvious reasons but the 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.239
 which is more sinister in this is that if you 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.030

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.709

 a funeral and the other is a network 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.110
 as if this was not enough. 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.330
 coincidence behind the funeral there 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.580
 four tests one of them open with 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.289

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.889
 prevented by normal means 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.780
 You have to put a tall vehicle. 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.190
 to get over the wall and the message 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.000
 what you find there is more or less 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.069
 that 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.080

 many other myths 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.560
 this had a great repercussion in the year 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.360
 2005 but lack of evidence or some 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.639
 differences in the game that ranked this 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.530
