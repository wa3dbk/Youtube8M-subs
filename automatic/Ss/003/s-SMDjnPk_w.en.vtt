they're just as toxic as the oil that
we're<00:00:37.230> trying<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.649> hide<00:00:38.149> it's<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.360> putting<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
we're trying to hide it's like putting a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.520 
we're trying to hide it's like putting a
paint<00:00:41.100> thinner<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.670> glob<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.180> wet<00:00:42.540> paint<00:00:42.899> it

paint thinner on a glob of wet paint it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.490 
paint thinner on a glob of wet paint it
just<00:00:44.280> sends<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.570> doesn't<00:00:45.899> get<00:00:46.200> rid<00:00:46.469> of

just sends it out it doesn't get rid of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.760 
just sends it out it doesn't get rid of
anything<00:00:47.090> we're<00:00:48.090> allowing<00:00:48.360> BP<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.530> hide

how<00:00:50.100> big<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> problem<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.180> by<00:00:51.930> turning<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
how big the problem is by turning it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.439 
how big the problem is by turning it
into<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.980> thin<00:00:53.309> sheen<00:00:53.670> there's<00:00:54.059> only<00:00:54.180> one

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
into a thin sheen there's only one

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.020 
into a thin sheen there's only one
solution<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.410> stop<00:00:55.860> total<00:00:56.399> disaster

and it's been proven several times on

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.369 
and it's been proven several times on
real<00:01:01.170> oil<00:01:01.500> spills<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.550> work<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:04.170> have
