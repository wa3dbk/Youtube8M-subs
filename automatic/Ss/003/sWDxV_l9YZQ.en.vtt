 Once a little mouse that lived happily in a 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.790
 jungle very far away the mouse loved it 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.460

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.079
 enough fruit to eat at the end of the 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:52.960
 one day the little mouse was playing 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.440
 the hidden ones when an immense lion 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.129
 with very sharp teeth jumped from 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.890
 some bushes and cornered him with one of 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:07.420
 its claws the lion stepped on the tail of 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:11.080
 mouse and blond who walks in my jungle the 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.330
 little mouse began to shake the lion raised 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.840
 scared a mouse by the tail 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.939
 carefully 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.189
 look at this a mouse said the lion 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.939
 He opened his mouth until and just when he 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:32.109
 I would eat the little mouse said please 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:36.490

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:39.459
 lion will be a delicious breakfast 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.439
 The whiskers of the mouse were stiff 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:46.719
 fear knew he had to say something 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.899
 quickly the little mouse breathed 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:53.020
 deeply and said friends 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:57.420
 little ones can sometimes be big 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.990
 friends if you let me go I'll never forget 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.130
 maybe one day I can return the favor 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.780
 the lion was speechless there was never 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.630
 seen such a brave mouse finally 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.140
 the lion fixed his mane and put 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.500
 little mouse on the ground I'll forgive you 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.319
 life this time the lion said but I did not 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.459
 can explain how a creature like you 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.700
 I could help myself king of the jungle 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.930
 then the lion roared and 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.470
 It was 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.670
 uff said the mouse lying on a branch 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.400
 that relieved the mouse forgot 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.600
 completely from the lion to a couple of 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.630
 days later he was hanging from his tail 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.660
 when he heard a roar that turned out 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.100
 Family hunters had caught 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.000
 to the lion in a huge network 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.780
 the lion full of rage writhed and 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.650
 howled inside the net let me out 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.920
 roared the lion the hunters did not 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.640
 they paid attention and the lion could not 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.420
 escape 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.420
 the hunters hung the network of the branch 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.630
 from a tree and they went in search of a 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.400
 cart where to transport the lion 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.940
 the lion needs my help thought the mouse 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.470
 Lord lion 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.530
 I will save them, the little mouse screamed 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.160
 the mouse jump from branch to branch 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.190
 as quickly as he could, he reached the network and 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.580
 I bit followed with his sharp teeth the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.100
 little mouse broke the leaves of the network of 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.680
 one at a time until he made a hole what 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.940
 big enough for that lion 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.250

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.500

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.460
 had done the little mouse had not been 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.540
 in vain when he was leaving he turned around and 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.690
 He said 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.290

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.799

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.439
