00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.040
 hello, can you introduce yourself 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.350
 please tell us what your role is at 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.349
 within a year khaimah hello offside but 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.720
 the madam is my role at ankama and the 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.070
 curate game manager so I actually framed 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.700
 lines and testers on the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.529
 ankama projects 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.029
 so it seems like a lot of 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.960
 idealized players craft a tester of 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.520
 video games that's what we see a little 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.779
 everywhere on the forums is what you 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.039
 can tell us what is the 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.949
 work of a tester who is in charge 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.269
 of the day especially dofus 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.280
 their main missions died of 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.720
 find bugs okay is to find 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.489
 how to reproduce them 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.960
 from there it will be necessary to see the 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.780
 developers show them how they 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.239
 have done check correction and cdm of 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.739
 tutti dia design gameplay shop 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.299
 of all what are the studies for 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.489
 to become testers he is at the origin in 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.949
 particular has no study for prat 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.379
 testers it just takes a solid 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.760
 video game culture is good French and 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.650
 do potentially have 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.420
 little notions of her it can help 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.290
 yes it can also victims but for 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.390
 try homes to dedicate 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.740
 developers on a problem on dofus 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.000
 the most common bugs is what 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.689
 these debates become and graphics 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.189
 nice shot of gameplay design file 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.710
 balancing class of monsters the 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.630
 beautiful knives of a small example of 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.340
 style a boost or that does not do it 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.240
 should do such currents for example 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.179
 or bumps compared the behavior 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.950
 wanted to play so every box you 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.450
 have whole docks that list of 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.939
 behaviors rather wish every 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.320
 situation and have found a clerk ok 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.060
 so when it happens the test of a 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.969
 extension before it goes online is a 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.049
 internal test before the beta today 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.719
 always before the version on his 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.460
 ground state art one is always on this 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.289
 version well before and we eliminate 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.340
 projects as it goes along is what 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.659
 precisely your work is influenced 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.979
 by the return of the players operate 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.270
 beta test is what you continue to 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.789
 parallel test players of course 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.899
 when players enter bugs that 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.249
 are we could not see 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.420
 because he did not see them 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.189
 always interesting to see others 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.659
 bugs contest the checks does it have 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.069
 testers who tests at the same time as 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.240
 the players on the beta or it's 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.520
 really all the time in local version 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.409
 a local often which is very 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.369
 rare that we have on the beta server is 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.539
 really we are a very very big 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.819
 problem that we could not see that the 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.979
 will play on the moment and we go but 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.200
 it's really very rare 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.610
 finally to finish is what you can we 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.110
 talk about the funniest bugue that your 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.799
 team met on dofus games 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.480
 the funniest funniest we had had 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.940
 a day a challenge from the developers who 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.370
 wanted me to tell him that the map 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.610
 of the world was no longer the watch and we have 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.870
 blocked in two seconds chrono it's up to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.010
 to say she was doing what the map is to 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.410
 to say that we can plant the game on 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.180
 took an object any of 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.030
 the inventory was moving on the map and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.319
 I was spitting what is a little embarrassing 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.599
 trophy that got rid did 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.099
 not in a little bit we will specify well 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.810
 sure carbon is never funny what that 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.480
 can always be embarrassing but listen 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.859
 thank you very much me doyon and see you soon 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.859
 probably on the forums all
