think<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> death<00:00:32.009> her<00:00:32.309> heart<00:00:32.579> defect<00:00:32.940> is

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
think of death her heart defect is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.880 
think of death her heart defect is
called<00:00:33.420> al<00:00:33.719> kaba<00:00:34.050> which<00:00:34.469> stands<00:00:34.770> for

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
called al kaba which stands for

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.340 
called al kaba which stands for
anomalous<00:00:35.610> left<00:00:36.000> coronary<00:00:36.630> artery<00:00:36.989> coming

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
anomalous left coronary artery coming

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350 
anomalous left coronary artery coming
off<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> pulmonary<00:00:38.280> artery<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.239> they

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
off the pulmonary artery so they

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.700 
off the pulmonary artery so they
basically<00:00:39.510> said<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> was<00:00:40.290> diagnosed

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
basically said that I was diagnosed

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.459 
basically said that I was diagnosed
without<00:00:40.980> kappa<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.610> my<00:00:41.879> left<00:00:42.600> artery<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.170> not

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
without kappa and my left artery was not

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.860 
without kappa and my left artery was not
attached<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:45.000> aorta<00:00:45.450> where<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> should

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
attached to my aorta where it should

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.240 
attached to my aorta where it should
have<00:00:45.989> been<00:00:46.140> when<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> coronary<00:00:46.890> arteries

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
have been when the coronary arteries

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
have been when the coronary arteries
developed<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.879> coming<00:00:48.300> off<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.809> pulmonary

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
developed it's coming off a pulmonary

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
developed it's coming off a pulmonary
artery<00:00:49.649> which<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> lower<00:00:50.250> pressure<00:00:50.719> system

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
artery which is a lower pressure system

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.100 
artery which is a lower pressure system
than<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.500> aorta<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.449> more<00:00:54.449> results<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
than the aorta and more results is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
than the aorta and more results is
abnormalities<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.070> coronary<00:00:56.430> blood<00:00:56.699> flow

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
abnormalities in coronary blood flow

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.729 
abnormalities in coronary blood flow
well<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.510> very<00:00:57.690> unusual<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:58.379> Emily's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
cases most kids with al kappa present

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.130 
cases most kids with al kappa present
sometime<00:01:01.710> infancy<00:01:02.550> i<00:01:03.030> honest<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.840> i<00:01:03.930> could

did great with her surgery

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
did great with her surgery
fortunately<00:01:36.299> gave<00:01:36.420> her<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> period<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.049> time<00:01:37.229> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
fortunately gave her a period of time to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.499 
fortunately gave her a period of time to
recover<00:01:37.680> from<00:01:37.770> her<00:01:38.100> arrest<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.360> her

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
recover from her arrest and so her

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.670 
recover from her arrest and so her
operation<00:01:40.049> was<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.439> quite
