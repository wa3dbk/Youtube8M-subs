00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:08.500
 in this early winter season, 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:10.510
 when the weather starts to cool 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.250
 many people have the habit of taking a 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.840
 hot chocolate is true 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.699
 hot chocolate that has the right 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.920
 properties that make people 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:26.529
 This does not feel better. 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:28.270
 besides being healthy and today he came across 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.720
 with this message that talks about 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:36.090
 wisdom of hot chocolate 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.750
 I wish you could hear where Jesus 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.600
 account that a group of young graduates 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.000
 well established in their careers 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.579
 they were talking about their 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.860
 lives in a meeting of Escolegis and 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.920
 decided to visit an old man 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:01.210
 college time professor now 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.860
 retired and who have always been a great 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 inspiration for everyone 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:18.189
 during the visit that chat is 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:24.099
 turned into a lot of complaint about the 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.779
 stress in their work on the 

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:31.779
 stress in their lives and their 

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:34.329
 relationships when you offered a 

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:36.909
 hot chocolate to your visitors 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.399
 the teacher was in the kitchen returned with 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.560
 a jar full of drink and with a 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.859
 large variety of canecos 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.619
 some of them were porcelain other than 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:53.799
 other glass or crystal in single 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.260
 others very expensive and beautiful and others well 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.330
 ugly 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:03.760
 so he invited everyone to use the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.910
 hot chocolate when everyone was already 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.890
 with hot chocolate in your hands 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.100
 The teacher then shared his 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.100
 thought 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.150
 he said 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.860
 realize that all tankards and carlos 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:25.890
 were the chosen ones and that the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.890
 simple and cheap were left on the table 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.800
 although you may find it normal to wish 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.620
 only the best for you is exactly 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:44.560
 there is the source of its problems in 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.960
 your office the box on which you are 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.870
 drinking adds nothing to the quality 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.060
 of drink 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.020
 most of the time it is just more 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.890
 cars 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.850
 sometimes he even hides what we are 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.300
 drinking what each of you wanted 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.910
 it was really hot chocolate you 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.770
 They did not want the jar but you 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.260
 have consciously chosen the best and 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.330
 So you started looking at each other. 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:22.230
 other people's 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:26.840
 now my friends please consider the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.210
 life is hot chocolate 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.230
 your job your money and your position 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.420
 in society are the canecos 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.140
 they are just tools that make 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.140
 part of life 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.330
 the holes you have in your hands will not 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.860
 define or change the quality of life 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.970
 that you sometimes live 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.500
 focus only on the 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.750
 we stopped enjoying the hot chocolate 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.750
 God has offered us 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.040
 always remember it provides the god 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.980
 chocolate 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.310
 He does not choose the pitcher. 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.340
 the happiest people are not the ones who 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:19.590
 have the best of everything but simply 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.510
 I think make the best of everything 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:27.050
 has 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:33.710
 live simply years generously 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:37.819
 take care if you immensely farm kindly and 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.030
 Let our good God the rich not 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.669
 they are the ones who have more but those who need 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:49.599
 of less 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.599
 so enjoy your hot chocolate 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.170
 This is what the Lord says to you this morning. 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.750
 I know you have thought about giving up. 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.510
 very often 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.940
 I know you have found it because I have to 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.960
 listen not only because I'm still in 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.240
 You've been silent and you 've 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.810
 Why? So much going wrong? 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.840
 you 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.840
 if you already delivered everything even good 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.320
 the truth is that my silence is only one 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.400
 request for patience 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.660
 the request for calm 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.660
 the request for trust 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:43.120
 hold it even when I am silent 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.570
 even when nothing is happening 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.080
 still your eyes can not yet come 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.180
 my son my daughter but your faith you 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.410
 lead to believe in what you are not yet 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.720
 The plant does not give up. Continue believing. 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:03.190
 that I'm working in your favor 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:07.139
 because I am and know that everything will 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.690
 Okay, yes, everything will work out for you. 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.900
 because I'm the one in control of 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.900
 all 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:24.960
 I'm using my servant now. 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:27.570
 this message to calm you what all 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.310
 What I least want now is that you 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.220
 Give up 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:37.050
 I want you to stay here in the 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:41.850
 end you can look and realize and 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:44.510
 say with his lips God gave 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.510
 just that
