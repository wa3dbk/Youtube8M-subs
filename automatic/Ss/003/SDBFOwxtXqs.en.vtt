but it's not scroll down go into
accessibility<00:00:54.289> scroll<00:00:55.289> down<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:55.469> more

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
accessibility scroll down a little more

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.920 
accessibility scroll down a little more
and<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.239> custom<00:00:57.719> vibrations

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and right here we see custom vibrations

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
and right here we see custom vibrations
I'm<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.800> gonna<00:00:58.890> actually<00:00:59.039> zoom<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.609> bit

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
I'm just gonna actually zoom in a bit

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.330 
I'm just gonna actually zoom in a bit
there<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.739> custom<00:01:01.739> vibrations<00:01:01.890> are

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
there for you custom vibrations are

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.990 
there for you custom vibrations are
right<00:01:02.460> there<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.690> will<00:01:03.899> enable<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
right there so this will enable you to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.539 
right there so this will enable you to
set<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.119> own<00:01:06.180> custom<00:01:06.540> vibrations<00:01:09.590> yeah<00:01:10.590> some

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
set your own custom vibrations yeah some

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.899 
set your own custom vibrations yeah some
vibration<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.299> we're<00:01:12.390> gonna<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.630> back

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
vibration is so then we're gonna go back

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.950 
vibration is so then we're gonna go back
one<00:01:14.909> more<00:01:14.970> time<00:01:15.259> it<00:01:16.259> sounds<00:01:17.750> we<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
one more time it sounds we have the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.390 
one more time it sounds we have the
vibrate<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:20.570> vibration<00:01:21.570> plot<00:01:21.930> patterns<00:01:22.590> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
vibrate on vibration plot patterns you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
vibrate on vibration plot patterns you
can<00:01:23.549> pick<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> could<00:01:24.450> go<00:01:24.570> create

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
can pick it and then you could go create

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.810 
can pick it and then you could go create
a<00:01:25.110> new<00:01:25.229> vibration<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.130> then<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
a new vibration and then you can you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.850 
a new vibration and then you can you
know<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.000> tap<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.229> tap<00:01:28.470> wherever<00:01:28.770> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
know just tap you just tap wherever you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
know just tap you just tap wherever you
want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.909> wouldn't<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
want to when you wouldn't you want it to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.440 
want to when you wouldn't you want it to
vibrate<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.409> hit<00:01:31.500> stop<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.240> play<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
vibrate and you hit stop you can play it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
vibrate and you hit stop you can play it
back<00:01:33.479> I'll<00:01:33.930> play<00:01:34.079> my<00:01:34.200> back<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:38.060> don't<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.119> if
