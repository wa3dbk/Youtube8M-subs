it's almost pitch black outside now I
just<00:01:24.330> want<00:01:24.480> to<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.720> over<00:01:24.900> with

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.340 

it's<00:01:28.980> it<00:01:29.430> looks<00:01:29.670> better<00:01:29.940> than<00:01:30.300> what<00:01:31.170> does

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it's it looks better than what does

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.550 
it's it looks better than what does
camera<00:01:31.980> showing<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:34.230> is<00:01:34.410> a<00:01:34.440> little

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
camera showing it it is a little

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
camera showing it it is a little
brighter<00:01:34.980> it's<00:01:37.460> like<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.550> said<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.910> see<00:01:39.120> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
brighter it's like I said you see the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
brighter it's like I said you see the
tach<00:01:39.510> is<00:01:39.720> actually<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:41.010> best

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
tach is actually the one that's the best

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.170 
tach is actually the one that's the best
to<00:01:41.400> lit<00:01:41.580> up<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:42.330> night<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:43.760> but<00:01:44.760> anyway<00:01:44.910> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
to lit up at night but but anyway I

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.630 
to lit up at night but but anyway I
don't<00:01:45.480> know<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.200> kind<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> waste<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.280> wasting

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
don't know but kind of waste up wasting

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.310 
don't know but kind of waste up wasting
my<00:01:47.850> time<00:01:48.090> or<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.510> screwing<00:01:48.900> around<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
my time or not screwing around with this

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.280 
my time or not screwing around with this
book<00:01:50.300> but<00:01:51.300> I<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.510> thought<00:01:51.660> take<00:01:51.870> a<00:01:51.900> video

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
book but I just thought take a video

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.560 
book but I just thought take a video
real<00:01:52.620> quick

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.350 

so<00:02:00.570> there<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.020> folks<00:02:01.290> blue<00:02:01.979> LEDs<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.090> just

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
so there it is folks blue LEDs so just

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.050 
so there it is folks blue LEDs so just
so<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:03.780> down<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.729> here's<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.790> here

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
so you can see down here here's a here

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.570 
so you can see down here here's a here
controls<00:02:09.410> kind<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.619> contrast<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
controls kind of a contrast with the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.680 
controls kind of a contrast with the
stereo<00:02:15.680> anyway
