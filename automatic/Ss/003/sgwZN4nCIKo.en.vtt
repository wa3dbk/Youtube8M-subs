as you can see mine is very well loved

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.330 
as you can see mine is very well loved
it's<00:04:57.479> a<00:04:57.630> cool<00:04:57.870> tone<00:04:58.110> red<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.890> it<00:04:59.039> makes<00:04:59.220> your

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
it's a cool tone red and it makes your

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.890 
it's a cool tone red and it makes your
teeth<00:04:59.550> look<00:04:59.610> super<00:05:00.180> white<00:05:00.330> which<00:05:00.570> is<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.720> bonus

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
teeth look super white which is a bonus

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.620 
teeth look super white which is a bonus
but<00:05:01.440> it<00:05:01.680> stays<00:05:02.220> in<00:05:02.430> place<00:05:02.700> all<00:05:02.970> day<00:05:03.000> which<00:05:03.390> is

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
but it stays in place all day which is

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.750 
but it stays in place all day which is
really<00:05:03.930> nice<00:05:04.169> since<00:05:04.590> this<00:05:04.770> is<00:05:04.950> a<00:05:04.979> retro<00:05:05.520> matte

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
really nice since this is a retro matte

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.700 
really nice since this is a retro matte
it's<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.450> lot<00:05:06.630> more<00:05:06.660> drawing<00:05:07.169> than<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.500> regular

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
it's a lot more drawing than the regular

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.159 
it's a lot more drawing than the regular
matte<00:05:08.130> formula<00:05:08.370> so<00:05:08.880> I<00:05:09.030> usually<00:05:09.479> like<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.720> apply

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
matte formula so I usually like to apply

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.529 
matte formula so I usually like to apply
a<00:05:10.200> lip<00:05:10.560> balm<00:05:10.740> before<00:05:10.950> putting<00:05:11.430> this<00:05:11.610> on<00:05:11.789> just

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
a lip balm before putting this on just

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.390 
a lip balm before putting this on just
to<00:05:12.660> help<00:05:12.840> so<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.229> doesn't<00:05:13.560> tug<00:05:13.860> at<00:05:14.070> your<00:05:14.100> lips

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
to help so it doesn't tug at your lips

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.070 
to help so it doesn't tug at your lips
and<00:05:14.640> it<00:05:14.760> also<00:05:14.940> helps<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.539> stay<00:05:15.840> longer

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
and it also helps it stay longer

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.779 
and it also helps it stay longer
throughout<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.590> day<00:05:16.740> because<00:05:17.310> your<00:05:17.580> lips

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
throughout the day because your lips

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.969 
throughout the day because your lips
don't<00:05:17.940> get<00:05:18.120> super<00:05:18.479> dry<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.200> just

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
don't get super dry and just

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.700 
don't get super dry and just
uncomfortable<00:05:20.520> feeling<00:05:21.240> this<00:05:21.870> color<00:05:22.229> can

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
uncomfortable feeling this color can

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.190 
uncomfortable feeling this color can
tend<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.280> feather<00:05:23.639> so<00:05:24.030> I<00:05:24.060> usually<00:05:24.539> use<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.930> liner

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
tend to feather so I usually use a liner

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.710 
tend to feather so I usually use a liner

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.610 
quick which is a mac prolongwear lip
liner<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.240> I<00:05:30.660> think<00:05:30.870> they<00:05:30.990> go<00:05:31.200> really<00:05:31.380> well

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620

liner and I think they go really well
together<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.400> helps<00:05:32.669> it<00:05:32.789> from<00:05:33.030> moving

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
together and it helps it from moving

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.450 
together and it helps it from moving
outside<00:05:33.510> of<00:05:33.810> your<00:05:33.930> lip<00:05:34.110> line

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
from the Lord collaboration with Mac I

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.960 
from the Lord collaboration with Mac I
really<00:06:29.990> like<00:06:30.199> this<00:06:30.380> color<00:06:30.650> I'm<00:06:31.340> not<00:06:31.639> a<00:06:31.669> huge

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
really like this color I'm not a huge

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.240 
really like this color I'm not a huge
fan<00:06:32.090> of<00:06:32.539> the<00:06:32.900> finish<00:06:33.259> which<00:06:33.500> is<00:06:33.530> a<00:06:33.650> satin<00:06:34.099> I

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
fan of the finish which is a satin I

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.460 
fan of the finish which is a satin I
think<00:06:34.940> it<00:06:35.060> can<00:06:35.210> apply<00:06:35.479> a<00:06:35.509> little<00:06:35.900> bit<00:06:36.050> patchy

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
think it can apply a little bit patchy

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.560 
think it can apply a little bit patchy
but<00:06:36.919> I<00:06:36.979> do<00:06:37.099> still<00:06:37.639> really<00:06:37.849> like<00:06:38.060> the<00:06:38.240> color
