00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.450
 to make with you a recipe for 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.639
 express buns you will see the 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.740
 delicious I do it almost every 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.240
 days right now to realize the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.000
 recipe you are going to need a 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.550
 cake mold 400 g flour 300 miles 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.150
 and warm milk 50 g melted butter 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.039
 a 9.4 sachet of vanilla sugar 1 sachet 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.109
 baker's yeast a spoon to 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.510
 coffee of salt and a teaspoon 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.189
 aromas banned before starting 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.940
 recipes I put my oven preheated to 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.500
 100 degrees then I paid well the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.180
 baker's yeast in eastern Chad 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.710
 the milk I simply do 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.130
 microwave heating about one 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.570
 minute 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.450
 be careful they do not have to be 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.370
 too hot or too cold I pour a 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.410
 little bit of sugar on top so that 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.110
 yeast take more quickly and I 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.520
 let it sit for ten minutes and 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.719
 meanwhile I poured all the 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.719
 remaining ingredients in a salad bowl 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:31.590
 and then I add the yeast and the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.590
 warm milk and mix it all 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.140
 once well mix the dough should 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.140
 really have a very sticky texture 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.970
 once my paw is ready i place 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.280
 parchment paper in my mold to 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.280
 cake and I just pour all the dough 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.250
 we will place the lathe in the oven 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.090
 for 20 minutes at 100 degrees for 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.090
 make the dough swell 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.530
 and then we will cook it for 30 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.530
 minutes at 180 Â° 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.410
 and yeah there the brioche and already finished 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.970
 so as you can see thanks to 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.860
 parchment paper brioche does not glue 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.120
 absolutely not I advise you 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.750
 to wait a little bit 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.370
 cool for cutting and if you 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.110
 prefer to eat the brioche nature I 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.940
 advise you to add two more 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.440
 packets of vanilla sugar and you can 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.970
 also added nuggets from 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.970
 chocolate or even sugar cubes 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.170
