alright<00:00:17.480> well<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:17.750> corsair<00:00:18.260> h50<00:00:18.770> has<00:00:19.310> been

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
alright well the corsair h50 has been

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.560 
alright well the corsair h50 has been
modded<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.840> tubing<00:00:21.290> has<00:00:22.280> been<00:00:22.310> changed<00:00:23.030> and<00:00:23.180> i

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
modded the tubing has been changed and i

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.980 
modded the tubing has been changed and i
have<00:00:23.750> my<00:00:24.400> ghetto<00:00:25.400> temporary<00:00:26.119> reservoir<00:00:26.690> set

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
have my ghetto temporary reservoir set

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.870 
have my ghetto temporary reservoir set
up<00:00:27.170> and<00:00:27.410> i<00:00:27.650> decided<00:00:28.040> instead<00:00:28.340> of<00:00:28.460> showing<00:00:28.670> you

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
up and i decided instead of showing you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.090 
up and i decided instead of showing you
guys<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.119> right<00:00:29.480> right<00:00:29.720> now<00:00:29.960> because<00:00:30.920> I

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
guys the right right now because I

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.499 
guys the right right now because I
haven't<00:00:31.340> really<00:00:31.490> fully<00:00:31.790> finalized

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
haven't really fully finalized

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.110 
haven't really fully finalized
everything<00:00:32.840> on<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:33.620> I<00:00:33.800> want<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.310> read<00:00:34.490> go

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
everything on it I want to read go

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.120 
everything on it I want to read go
through<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:35.780> redo<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.290> tubing<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:36.860> stuff

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
through and redo the tubing and stuff

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.340 
through and redo the tubing and stuff
cuz<00:00:38.090> i<00:00:38.120> actually<00:00:38.450> have<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:38.660> flow<00:00:38.870> reversed

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
cuz i actually have the flow reversed

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.340 
cuz i actually have the flow reversed
from<00:00:39.829> what<00:00:40.040> it<00:00:40.130> should<00:00:40.400> be<00:00:40.720> i'll<00:00:41.720> show<00:00:42.290> you

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
from what it should be i'll show you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.569 
from what it should be i'll show you
guys<00:00:42.470> that<00:00:42.530> later<00:00:42.950> if<00:00:43.130> you<00:00:43.190> don't<00:00:43.280> know<00:00:43.430> what<00:00:43.520> i

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
guys that later if you don't know what i

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.210 
guys that later if you don't know what i
mean<00:00:43.730> but<00:00:44.660> uh<00:00:44.720> basis<00:00:45.230> i<00:00:45.290> show<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:45.770> guys<00:00:45.980> some

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
mean but uh basis i show you guys some

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.550 
mean but uh basis i show you guys some
temperatures<00:00:46.730> here<00:00:47.200> not<00:00:48.200> going<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.410> worry

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
temperatures here not going to worry

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.810 
temperatures here not going to worry
about<00:00:48.620> idle<00:00:49.010> temperatures<00:00:49.460> because<00:00:49.700> that

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
about idle temperatures because that

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.130 
about idle temperatures because that
doesn't<00:00:50.000> mean<00:00:50.210> anything<00:00:50.540> especially<00:00:50.720> because

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
doesn't mean anything especially because

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.550 
doesn't mean anything especially because
i'm<00:00:51.230> using<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.500> webcam<00:00:51.710> i<00:00:52.750> met<00:00:53.750> my<00:00:55.030> baseline

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.109 
volts under load i think it is so we're

push-pull<00:01:16.040> no<00:01:16.490> shrouds<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:18.350> we're<00:01:18.740> going<00:01:18.860> to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
push-pull no shrouds and we're going to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.709 
push-pull no shrouds and we're going to
run<00:01:19.009> those<00:01:19.189> at<00:01:19.369> low<00:01:19.579> which<00:01:19.999> is<00:01:20.179> seven<00:01:20.390> volts

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
run those at low which is seven volts

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.830 
run those at low which is seven volts
and<00:01:21.109> then<00:01:21.259> full<00:01:21.890> which<00:01:22.189> is<00:01:22.340> 12<00:01:22.609> volts<00:01:22.939> symbols

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
and then full which is 12 volts symbols

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.950 
and then full which is 12 volts symbols
they're<00:01:24.170> probably<00:01:24.530> only<00:01:24.890> spinning<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.899> may<00:01:26.899> be

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
they're probably only spinning it may be

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.340 
they're probably only spinning it may be
a<00:01:27.079> thousand<00:01:27.829> 1200<00:01:28.460> RPM<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.600> full<00:01:29.869> speed<00:01:30.170> they

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
a thousand 1200 RPM and full speed they

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.700 
a thousand 1200 RPM and full speed they
spin<00:01:30.619> at<00:01:30.799> 2,000<00:01:31.490> RPM<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.780> we're<00:01:33.350> going<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:33.530> show

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
spin at 2,000 RPM so we're going to show

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.889 
spin at 2,000 RPM so we're going to show
you<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:34.310> temperature<00:01:34.880> difference<00:01:35.060> here<00:01:35.450> room

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
you the temperature difference here room

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.580 
you the temperature difference here room
temperature<00:01:36.439> is<00:01:36.729> 80<00:01:37.729> degrees<00:01:38.240> Fahrenheit<00:01:38.810> so

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.440 
temperature is 80 degrees Fahrenheit so
let's<00:01:39.890> start<00:01:40.399> this<00:01:40.579> up<00:01:40.789> for<00:01:40.969> a<00:01:40.999> minute<00:01:41.149> here

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
let's start this up for a minute here

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.789 
let's start this up for a minute here
and<00:01:41.479> we'll<00:01:41.780> check<00:01:42.079> what<00:01:42.229> our<00:01:42.319> temperatures

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
and we'll check what our temperatures

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:53.040 
and we'll check what our temperatures
are

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.960 

the<00:01:53.530> temperatures<00:01:54.040> really

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
the temperatures really

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.970 
the temperatures really
I<00:01:56.060> mean<00:01:56.570> as<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.750> can<00:01:56.900> see<00:01:57.140> probably<00:01:57.530> really

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
I mean as you can see probably really

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.010 
I mean as you can see probably really
can't<00:01:58.220> hear<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.030> computer<00:01:59.480> too<00:01:59.690> much

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.630 

because<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.409> fans<00:02:02.680> are<00:02:02.920> really<00:02:03.070> really<00:02:03.399> low

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
because the fans are really really low

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.810 
because the fans are really really low
but<00:02:04.420> once<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.689> turn<00:02:04.899> them<00:02:05.049> on<00:02:05.170> full<00:02:06.009> 12<00:02:06.429> volts

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
but once I turn them on full 12 volts

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.180 
but once I turn them on full 12 volts
I'll<00:02:07.750> get<00:02:07.869> a<00:02:07.929> lot<00:02:08.080> louder<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.709> here<00:02:08.830> we<00:02:08.920> go<00:02:08.950> guys

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
I'll get a lot louder so here we go guys

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.250 
I'll get a lot louder so here we go guys
well<00:02:09.519> we<00:02:09.759> had<00:02:09.910> 63<00:02:10.360> here<00:02:10.720> going<00:02:10.929> on<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.110> next

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
well we had 63 here going on the next

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.710 
well we had 63 here going on the next
test<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.099> we'll<00:02:12.400> call<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.790> will<00:02:12.970> call<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.269> 63

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
test so we'll call it will call it 63

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.830 
test so we'll call it will call it 63
here<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.440> run<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.040> for<00:02:15.190> about<00:02:15.310> two<00:02:15.550> minutes

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
here and run in for about two minutes

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.890 
here and run in for about two minutes
will<00:02:16.840> call<00:02:16.870> our<00:02:17.110> temperature<00:02:17.530> 63<00:02:18.599> will<00:02:19.599> stop

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
will call our temperature 63 will stop

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.289 
will call our temperature 63 will stop
this<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.560> then<00:02:21.160> i<00:02:21.190> will<00:02:21.370> put<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.790> fans<00:02:22.120> on

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
this and then i will put the fans on

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.559 
this and then i will put the fans on
full<00:02:22.540> speed

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.020 

okay<00:02:26.170> we<00:02:26.319> have<00:02:26.469> the<00:02:26.620> fans<00:02:27.129> hooked<00:02:27.459> up<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.760> 12

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
okay we have the fans hooked up to 12

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.369 
okay we have the fans hooked up to 12
volts<00:02:28.090> now<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.510> can<00:02:28.780> probably<00:02:28.959> hear<00:02:29.200> them<00:02:29.319> a

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
volts now you can probably hear them a

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.319 
volts now you can probably hear them a
little<00:02:29.469> bit<00:02:29.709> better<00:02:29.879> all<00:02:30.879> right<00:02:31.090> let's<00:02:31.239> start

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
little bit better all right let's start

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:41.260 
little bit better all right let's start
the<00:02:31.659> small<00:02:31.959> FFTs<00:02:32.560> starting<00:02:33.189> now

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.450 

62<00:02:41.720> times<00:02:42.200> don't<00:02:42.410> seem<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.830> much<00:02:43.040> different

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
62 times don't seem that much different

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.400 
62 times don't seem that much different
kind<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.090> surprise<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.930> seemed<00:02:46.110> like<00:02:46.140> they

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
kind of surprise it seemed like they

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.230 
kind of surprise it seemed like they
were<00:02:46.470> course<00:02:47.100> son<00:02:47.280> again<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.520> did<00:02:47.820> just<00:02:47.850> heat

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
were course son again I did just heat

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.260 
were course son again I did just heat
the<00:02:48.390> system<00:02:48.780> up

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
the system up

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.480 
the system up
on<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.900> last<00:02:51.080> run<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:51.950> might<00:02:52.130> make<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
on that last run so that might make the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.450 
on that last run so that might make the
difference<00:02:52.520> in<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.060> temperatures<00:02:53.630> maybe

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.809 

Sarah<00:03:01.180> toy<00:03:01.480> maybe<00:03:02.400> half<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.580> degree<00:03:03.700> difference

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.710 

maybe

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
maybe

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.340 
maybe
we're<00:03:09.200> still<00:03:09.440> pretty<00:03:09.740> steady<00:03:10.070> here<00:03:10.250> 61<00:03:10.850> 62<00:03:11.270> 60

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
we're still pretty steady here 61 62 60

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.020 
we're still pretty steady here 61 62 60
of<00:03:13.800> course<00:03:13.980> Dunnigan<00:03:14.400> I'm<00:03:14.490> only<00:03:14.640> letting<00:03:14.820> us

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
of course Dunnigan I'm only letting us

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.360 
of course Dunnigan I'm only letting us
run<00:03:15.240> for<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> minute<00:03:15.870> or<00:03:15.990> two<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:16.590> could<00:03:17.190> be<00:03:17.340> a

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
run for a minute or two so could be a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.730 
run for a minute or two so could be a
lot<00:03:17.550> different<00:03:17.870> variations<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.140> mean<00:03:19.650> I'm

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
lot different variations I mean I'm

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.800 
lot different variations I mean I'm
definitely<00:03:19.950> satisfied<00:03:20.700> considering<00:03:21.360> it's<00:03:21.510> 80

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
definitely satisfied considering it's 80

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.080 
definitely satisfied considering it's 80
degrees<00:03:21.930> in<00:03:22.530> here

degrees in here

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.470 
degrees in here
and<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.599> is<00:03:24.780> Oh

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
and this is Oh

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.410 
and this is Oh
one<00:03:27.110> hundred<00:03:27.409> percent<00:03:27.440> overclock

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.750 

and<00:03:32.540> it's<00:03:32.780> about<00:03:32.950> compared<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.040> my<00:03:34.160> true<00:03:34.520> this

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
and it's about compared to my true this

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.059 
and it's about compared to my true this
is<00:03:34.970> about<00:03:35.209> five<00:03:35.660> degrees<00:03:35.900> less

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
is about five degrees less

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.190 
is about five degrees less
and<00:03:38.249> like<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.760> said<00:03:38.819> this<00:03:39.120> isn't<00:03:39.329> even<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.989> way

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
and like I said this isn't even the way

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.179 
and like I said this isn't even the way
it's<00:03:40.349> going<00:03:40.499> to<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.709> I'm<00:03:40.859> going<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.040> get<00:03:41.159> a

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:41.189 
it's going to be I'm going to get a

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.690 
it's going to be I'm going to get a
swiftech<00:03:42.030> reservoir<00:03:42.689> I<00:03:42.989> believe<00:03:43.379> for<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.859> and

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
swiftech reservoir I believe for it and

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.220 
swiftech reservoir I believe for it and
i'll<00:03:44.819> put<00:03:44.969> some<00:03:45.030> quarter-inch<00:03:45.659> fittings<00:03:46.049> on

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
i'll put some quarter-inch fittings on

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.750 
i'll put some quarter-inch fittings on
there<00:03:46.409> i'll<00:03:46.560> get<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.799> tubing<00:03:47.189> cut<00:03:47.370> down<00:03:47.579> so

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
there i'll get the tubing cut down so

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.190 
there i'll get the tubing cut down so
it's<00:03:47.879> got<00:03:47.999> a<00:03:48.030> lot<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.269> tubing<00:03:48.749> on<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.019> right<00:03:49.170> now

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
it's got a lot of tubing on it right now

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.220 
it's got a lot of tubing on it right now
and<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:50.340> reservoir<00:03:50.879> size<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:53.010> about<00:03:53.280> probably

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
and the reservoir size is about probably

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.440 
and the reservoir size is about probably
a<00:03:55.319> little<00:03:56.069> bit<00:03:56.190> more<00:03:56.400> than<00:03:56.640> what<00:03:56.790> one<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:56.970> small

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
a little bit more than what one of small

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.199 
a little bit more than what one of small
swiftech<00:03:57.959> reservoirs<00:03:58.500> would<00:03:58.709> be<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.209> then

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
swiftech reservoirs would be and then

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.000 
swiftech reservoirs would be and then
I'm<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.540> running<00:04:00.750> distilled<00:04:01.379> water<00:04:01.680> with

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
I'm just running distilled water with

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.860 
I'm just running distilled water with
about<00:04:02.220> ten<00:04:02.549> percent<00:04:02.700> antifreeze<00:04:03.450> for<00:04:03.510> now<00:04:03.810> I'm

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
about ten percent antifreeze for now I'm

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.700 
about ten percent antifreeze for now I'm
gonna<00:04:04.019> get<00:04:04.200> some<00:04:04.349> PT<00:04:04.709> you

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
gonna get some PT you

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.090 
gonna get some PT you
and<00:04:06.070> I'm<00:04:06.130> gonna<00:04:06.250> get<00:04:06.340> some<00:04:06.490> red<00:04:06.670> dye

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
and I'm gonna get some red dye

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.560 
and I'm gonna get some red dye
and<00:04:08.400> I'm<00:04:08.520> gonna<00:04:08.610> switch<00:04:08.850> these<00:04:09.030> fans<00:04:09.330> out

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
and I'm gonna switch these fans out

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.010 
and I'm gonna switch these fans out
probably

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.360 

because<00:04:12.380> they're<00:04:12.560> good<00:04:12.770> but<00:04:13.070> they're<00:04:13.220> not

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
because they're good but they're not

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.600 
because they're good but they're not
really<00:04:13.640> good<00:04:13.940> for<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.210> radiator

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
really good for a radiator

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.550 
really good for a radiator
why<00:04:15.970> don't<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.209> get<00:04:16.329> some<00:04:16.480> real<00:04:16.690> good<00:04:16.720> thirty

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
why don't you get some real good thirty

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.680 
why don't you get some real good thirty
eight<00:04:17.769> millimeter<00:04:18.250> fans<00:04:18.579> get<00:04:19.209> some<00:04:19.359> shrouds

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
eight millimeter fans get some shrouds

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.879 
eight millimeter fans get some shrouds
on<00:04:19.959> it

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
on it

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.920 
on it
wish<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.519> see<00:04:21.699> another<00:04:21.849> degree<00:04:22.150> or<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.599> drop

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
wish to see another degree or to drop

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.580 
wish to see another degree or to drop
hopefully

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.200 

it's<00:04:27.100> not<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:27.400> much<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.580> big<00:04:27.850> drop<00:04:28.180> in

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
it's not so much a big drop in

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.060 
it's not so much a big drop in
temperature<00:04:28.900> I'm<00:04:28.990> looking<00:04:29.320> for

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
temperature I'm looking for

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.750 
temperature I'm looking for
more<00:04:30.700> of<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:31.170> sustained<00:04:32.170> temperature<00:04:32.860> of<00:04:33.070> when

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
more of a sustained temperature of when

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.460 
more of a sustained temperature of when
I<00:04:33.790> start<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.480> know<00:04:34.630> when<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:34.810> want<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.110> push<00:04:35.290> it

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
I start you know when I want to push it

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.650 
I start you know when I want to push it
even<00:04:35.560> harder<00:04:35.940> holding<00:04:36.940> that<00:04:37.090> temperature

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
even harder holding that temperature

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.250 
even harder holding that temperature
like<00:04:38.470> if<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.650> could<00:04:38.830> hold<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.760> 62<00:04:40.420> 63<00:04:40.840> or

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
like if I could hold this the 62 63 or

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.990 
like if I could hold this the 62 63 or
64<00:04:41.530> degrees<00:04:41.980> up<00:04:42.520> until<00:04:43.000> you<00:04:43.840> know<00:04:44.520> 1.4<00:04:45.520> vcore
