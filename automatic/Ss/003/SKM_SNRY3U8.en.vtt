and basically that's the one-shot macro
basically<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.319> throw<00:03:37.379> up<00:03:37.769> your<00:03:38.489> cooldowns

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
use breathless Indra goes that doesn't

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.860 
use breathless Indra goes that doesn't
cancel<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.730> uses<00:03:42.030> obliterate<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:42.720> you

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
cancel it and it uses obliterate for you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.740 
cancel it and it uses obliterate for you
so<00:03:43.379> basically<00:03:43.580> yeah<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.730> destroys<00:03:45.180> people<00:03:45.659> if

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
so basically yeah it destroys people if

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.020 
so basically yeah it destroys people if
you<00:03:45.840> use<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.110> correctly<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:47.340> only<00:03:47.370> time<00:03:47.849> this

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
you use it correctly the only time this

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.910 
you use it correctly the only time this
macro<00:03:48.450> will<00:03:48.629> have<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> chance<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.440> cancel

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920

itself<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.459> if<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:50.970> off<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.120> perfect

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
itself is if you get off a perfect

itself is if you get off a perfect
rotation<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:52.440> using<00:03:53.000> a7<00:03:54.000> or<00:03:54.150> plus<00:03:54.510> more

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
obliterates in here which at that point

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.660 
obliterates in here which at that point
you<00:03:57.269> may<00:03:57.450> want<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.840> switch<00:03:58.049> over<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.670> doing

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
you may want to switch over to doing

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.509 
you may want to switch over to doing
your<00:03:59.849> basic<00:04:00.360> rotation<00:04:01.310> which<00:04:02.310> you'll

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
your basic rotation which you'll

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.100 
your basic rotation which you'll
probably<00:04:02.549> forced<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.390> by<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.569> anyways

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
probably forced to by that anyways

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.569 
probably forced to by that anyways
they're<00:04:04.319> switched<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.680> using<00:04:04.739> chains<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.400> keep

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
they're switched to using chains to keep

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.449 
they're switched to using chains to keep
operating<00:04:06.090> power<00:04:06.209> for<00:04:06.480> more<00:04:06.690> Brett's<00:04:07.109> but<00:04:07.920> you

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
operating power for more Brett's but you

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.369 
operating power for more Brett's but you
said<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.760> fact<00:04:09.239> from<00:04:09.690> there<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.049> might<00:04:10.230> want

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
said that fact from there you might want

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.839 
said that fact from there you might want
to<00:04:10.410> switch<00:04:10.590> over<00:04:10.920> Bob<00:04:11.099> till<00:04:11.459> then<00:04:11.640> it's

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
to switch over Bob till then it's

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.610 
to switch over Bob till then it's
definitely<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.359> one<00:04:12.510> shot<00:04:12.720> macro<00:04:13.170> guys<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.590> I

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
definitely a one shot macro guys and I

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.970 
definitely a one shot macro guys and I
hope<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:13.950> enjoy<00:04:14.280> this<00:04:14.459> little<00:04:14.609> trick
