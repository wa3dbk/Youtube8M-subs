variables<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.670> using<00:02:08.759> post

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
variables but I'm going to be using post

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
variables but I'm going to be using post
you<00:02:09.660> need<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.050> add<00:02:10.170> them<00:02:10.349> afterwards<00:02:10.950> now

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you need to add them afterwards now

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
you need to add them afterwards now
we're<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:12.030> doing<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.330> inside<00:02:12.690> PHP

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
we're going to be doing this inside PHP

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.410 
we're going to be doing this inside PHP
you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
you

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.800 
you
in<00:02:13.510> curl<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:16.030> reason<00:02:16.240> we're<00:02:16.360> using<00:02:16.390> cuz

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
in curl and the reason we're using cuz

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.390 
in curl and the reason we're using cuz
it's<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.230> lot<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:17.530> secure<00:02:17.950> than<00:02:18.130> just

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
it's a lot more secure than just

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.550 
it's a lot more secure than just
submitting<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.300> form<00:02:19.540> with<00:02:19.840> these<00:02:19.930> variables

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
submitting a form with these variables

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.770 
submitting a form with these variables
in<00:02:20.800> which<00:02:21.310> we<00:02:21.459> could<00:02:21.610> well<00:02:21.910> do<00:02:22.120> but<00:02:22.420> obviously

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
in which we could well do but obviously

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.000 
in which we could well do but obviously
then<00:02:22.989> people<00:02:23.260> are<00:02:23.410> going<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.560> find<00:02:23.739> out<00:02:23.920> our

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
then people are going to find out our

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.400 
then people are going to find out our
password<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.760> use<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> name<00:02:25.989> things<00:02:26.230> like

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
password and use the name things like

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.150 
password and use the name things like
that<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.590> what<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.800> form<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.069> going

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
that so this is what the form is going

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.290 
that so this is what the form is going
to<00:02:30.280> look<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.459> in<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.850> first<00:02:31.000> part<00:02:31.270> the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
to look like in the first part the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.850 
to look like in the first part the
tutorial<00:02:31.840> we're<00:02:31.959> going<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.170> be<00:02:32.350> simply

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
tutorial we're going to be simply

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.229 
tutorial we're going to be simply
creating<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.459> form<00:02:33.730> we're<00:02:33.880> not<00:02:33.970> going<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.150> be

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
creating the form we're not going to be

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.990 
creating the form we're not going to be
doing<00:02:34.420> any<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.870> programming<00:02:35.620> behind<00:02:36.100> in

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
doing any of the programming behind in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.970 
doing any of the programming behind in
PHP<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:38.080> we're<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:38.350> going<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.530> create<00:02:38.800> in

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
PHP so we're just going to create in

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.470 
PHP so we're just going to create in
this<00:02:39.069> form<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.430> we<00:02:39.640> know<00:02:39.760> what<00:02:39.910> we're<00:02:40.060> doing<00:02:40.330> so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
this form so we know what we're doing so

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.930 
this form so we know what we're doing so
hopefully<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:41.440> far<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.769> understand<00:02:42.220> how<00:02:42.790> this

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
hopefully so far you understand how this

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.210 
hopefully so far you understand how this
is<00:02:43.000> going<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.300> work<00:02:43.950> obviously<00:02:44.950> if<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.099> don't

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
is going to work obviously if you don't

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.830 
is going to work obviously if you don't
just<00:02:45.489> keep<00:02:45.580> following<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.060> tutorial<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.720> you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
just keep following the tutorial and you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.809 
just keep following the tutorial and you
should<00:02:47.019> get<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.260> hang<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:48.310> if<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:48.670> go

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
should get the hang of it so if I go

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.120 
should get the hang of it so if I go
over<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.090> my<00:02:49.510> page<00:02:49.780> here<00:02:50.110> I've<00:02:50.319> just<00:02:50.590> created<00:02:51.069> a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
over to my page here I've just created a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.539 
over to my page here I've just created a
page<00:02:51.340> called<00:02:51.670> SMS<00:02:52.150> PHP<00:02:52.870> now<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.860> might<00:02:54.220> notice

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
page called SMS PHP now you might notice

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.150 
page called SMS PHP now you might notice
that<00:02:54.580> I'm<00:02:54.790> running<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.269> on<00:02:55.540> my<00:02:56.500> paid<00:02:56.830> web

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
that I'm running this on my paid web

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.009 
that I'm running this on my paid web
hosting<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.360> reason<00:02:58.600> I'm<00:02:58.690> doing<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.900> is

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
hosting the reason I'm doing this is

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.900 
hosting the reason I'm doing this is
because<00:02:59.230> curl<00:02:59.620> is<00:02:59.860> currently<00:03:00.340> installed

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
because curl is currently installed

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.059 
because curl is currently installed
I<00:03:01.000> don't<00:03:01.360> currently<00:03:01.569> have<00:03:01.750> curl<00:03:02.380> installed<00:03:02.920> on

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
I don't currently have curl installed on

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.250 
I don't currently have curl installed on
my<00:03:03.160> local<00:03:03.400> host<00:03:03.730> on<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.690> software<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.170> I'm

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
my local host on the software that I'm

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.420 
my local host on the software that I'm
running<00:03:05.470> on<00:03:05.739> my<00:03:06.640> computer<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.530> either

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
running on my computer so either

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.610 
running on my computer so either
download<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.910> package<00:03:10.330> such<00:03:10.690> as<00:03:10.870> xampp<00:03:11.440> there

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
download a package such as xampp there

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.729 
download a package such as xampp there
that<00:03:12.130> has<00:03:12.519> curl<00:03:12.819> with<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.209> or<00:03:13.569> run<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.650> from

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
that has curl with it or run it from

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.400 
that has curl with it or run it from
your<00:03:14.799> paid<00:03:15.130> hosting<00:03:15.810> but<00:03:16.810> that's<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.170> reason

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
your paid hosting but that's the reason

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.560 
your paid hosting but that's the reason
I'm<00:03:17.470> running<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.829> from<00:03:18.070> paid<00:03:18.280> hosting<00:03:18.730> now

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
I'm running it from paid hosting now

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.610 
I'm running it from paid hosting now
we're<00:03:19.810> obviously<00:03:19.900> going<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.230> need<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.500> create

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
we're obviously going to need to create

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.440 
we're obviously going to need to create
a<00:03:20.769> form<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.609> I'm<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.820> going<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.030> start<00:03:22.269> out

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
a form so I'm just going to start out

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.060 
a form so I'm just going to start out
I'm<00:03:22.900> not<00:03:23.140> going<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.320> worry<00:03:23.470> about<00:03:23.620> any<00:03:23.920> other

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
I'm not going to worry about any other

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.860 
I'm not going to worry about any other
types<00:03:24.370> or<00:03:24.549> anything<00:03:24.730> like<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.630> form

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
types or anything like that the form

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.420 
types or anything like that the form
action<00:03:26.049> is<00:03:26.350> going<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.650> be<00:03:26.739> itself<00:03:27.190> because

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
action is going to be itself because

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.160 
action is going to be itself because
we're<00:03:27.790> going<00:03:27.910> to<00:03:27.970> submit<00:03:28.329> back<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.570> this<00:03:28.840> form

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
we're going to submit back to this form

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.509 
we're going to submit back to this form
and<00:03:29.410> deal<00:03:30.100> with<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.370> results<00:03:31.180> in<00:03:31.420> PHP<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:32.519> we

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
and deal with the results in PHP so we

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.699 
and deal with the results in PHP so we
inside<00:03:33.760> our<00:03:33.880> PHP<00:03:34.060> tags<00:03:34.359> so<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.260> method<00:03:35.560> here

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
inside our PHP tags so the method here

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.390 
inside our PHP tags so the method here
is<00:03:35.890> going<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.070> be<00:03:36.190> post<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.980> first<00:03:39.190> thing

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
is going to be post and the first thing

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.890 
is going to be post and the first thing
we<00:03:39.489> want<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.850> say<00:03:40.060> let's<00:03:40.329> just<00:03:40.540> save<00:03:40.690> this

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
we want it to say let's just save this

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.400 
we want it to say let's just save this
quickly<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:42.030> back<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.180> there<00:03:43.359> and<00:03:43.900> let's

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
quickly and back to there and let's

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.030 
quickly and back to there and let's
refresh<00:03:44.769> this

as it falls in the guidelines of text
messages<00:06:29.169> I<00:06:29.380> think<00:06:30.190> there's<00:06:30.310> probably<00:06:30.430> a

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729 
messages I think there's probably a

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.550 
messages I think there's probably a
maximum<00:06:31.180> length<00:06:31.330> that<00:06:31.449> you<00:06:31.599> can<00:06:31.750> send<00:06:31.960> but

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
maximum length that you can send but

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.810 
maximum length that you can send but
obviously<00:06:33.009> you<00:06:33.220> can<00:06:33.370> put<00:06:33.490> the<00:06:33.580> form

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
obviously you can put the form

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.330 
obviously you can put the form
validation<00:06:34.090> in<00:06:34.690> afterwards<00:06:35.220> obviously<00:06:36.220> this

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
validation in afterwards obviously this

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.649 
validation in afterwards obviously this
is<00:06:36.520> a<00:06:36.610> text<00:06:36.940> field<00:06:37.060> but<00:06:37.240> you're<00:06:37.360> going<00:06:37.479> to<00:06:37.539> need
