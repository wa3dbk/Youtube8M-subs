introduction<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:43.590> story<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.629> personally

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
introduction for your story I personally

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.250 
introduction for your story I personally
recommend<00:00:45.780> having<00:00:46.590> very<00:00:47.190> little<00:00:47.789> dialogue

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
recommend having very little dialogue

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.959 
recommend having very little dialogue
dialogue<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.800> confuse<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.250> reader<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
dialogue can confuse a reader if you

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.910 
dialogue can confuse a reader if you
start<00:00:51.270> off<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> because<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:52.710> don't

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
start off with that because they don't

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.709 
start off with that because they don't
know<00:00:53.100> who's<00:00:53.340> talking<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.329> sound<00:00:54.600> like

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
know who's talking what they sound like

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.869 
know who's talking what they sound like
or<00:00:55.879> who<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:57.149> people<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.410> story<00:00:58.879> so

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
or who these people are in your story so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.959 
or who these people are in your story so
I<00:01:00.300> recommend<00:01:00.989> starting<00:01:01.829> off<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:02.460> an<00:01:02.640> event

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I recommend starting off with an event

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.120 
I recommend starting off with an event
an<00:01:03.470> event<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:05.309> happens<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.080> past<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:08.070> in

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
an event that happens in the past or in

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.200 
an event that happens in the past or in
the<00:01:08.460> future<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> flashback<00:01:10.590> or

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
the future and then have a flashback or

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.010 
the future and then have a flashback or
go<00:01:12.210> forward<00:01:12.710> back<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:14.250> story<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.810> way

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
go forward back to your story this way

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.700 
go forward back to your story this way

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
like they're there and then you can put

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.899 
like they're there and then you can put
in<00:01:24.479> dialogue<00:01:25.049> or<00:01:26.240> somebody's<00:01:27.240> name<00:01:27.840> etc
