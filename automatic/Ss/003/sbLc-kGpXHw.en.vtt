00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.330
 covered one finger covering code there 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.810
 there is the code 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.210
 well that's where the holes should go 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.980
 once the code has been entered 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.710
 I 'm going to tell you to make a 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.640

 the games really weigh little I have 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:24.590
 about six games that I 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.930
 I bought the item and can ask 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.070
 your friends who do not know about this trick 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:33.200
 for dear ones this one in this one your 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.370
 codes ask you not to 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.690
 they resent something for you 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.690
 and this is all powerful
