00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
have 76 to ammunition so that means a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.590 
have 76 to ammunition so that means a

lot of penetration power and a lot of

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900 
lot of penetration power and a lot of

damage also the rifle is very accurate
and<00:00:21.480> since<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.560> switch<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.830> single<00:00:23.490> fire

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
and since you can switch to single fire

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.609 
and since you can switch to single fire
mode<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> semi-automatic<00:00:25.260> sniper

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
mode you have a semi-automatic sniper

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.400

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.099 
rifle and you also have a good runs per
minute<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.890> means<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.670> go<00:00:29.849> on

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109

every<00:01:48.720> situation<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.890> guys<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> give

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
every situation also guys I want to give

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.139 
every situation also guys I want to give
you<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> tip<00:01:51.780> many<00:01:52.590> people<00:01:52.950> underestimate<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you a tip many people underestimate the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.190 
you a tip many people underestimate the
importance<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.590> fire<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:58.020> an

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
importance of if fire so you see an

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.080 
importance of if fire so you see an
enemy<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> distance<00:01:59.340> what<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.909> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
enemy on the distance what you do you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.780 
enemy on the distance what you do you
aim<00:02:00.360> down<00:02:00.420> sight<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.920> shoot<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.340> fast<00:02:02.610> as

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
aim down sight and you shoot as fast as

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.749 
aim down sight and you shoot as fast as
possible<00:02:03.299> because<00:02:03.590> right<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.219> enemy<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
possible because right now the enemy is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.540 
possible because right now the enemy is
visible<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> clear<00:02:07.290> shot<00:02:07.550> but

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
visible and you have a clear shot but

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.420 
visible and you have a clear shot but
how<00:02:09.000> many<00:02:09.060> times<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.810> missed<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.860> first

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
how many times you missed on that first

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.820 
how many times you missed on that first
shot<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> wonder<00:02:13.440> why

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
shot if you have a wonder why

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.300 
shot if you have a wonder why
well<00:02:14.790> when<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.330> nut<00:02:15.690> him<00:02:15.990> in<00:02:16.200> downside<00:02:16.950> you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
well when you nut him in downside you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.400 
well when you nut him in downside you
have<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> bigger<00:02:18.210> crosser<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.110> means

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
have a bigger crosser so you means

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.370 
have a bigger crosser so you means
you're<00:02:19.620> not<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.040> accurate<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:22.050> when<00:02:22.290> you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
you're not that accurate so when you

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.740 
you're not that accurate so when you
hang<00:02:22.620> downside<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.490> get<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.970> crosser<00:02:24.450> gets

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
hang downside it get the crosser gets

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.130 
hang downside it get the crosser gets
smaller<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:25.950> if<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.610> aim<00:02:26.910> down<00:02:27.540> sight<00:02:27.900> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
smaller but if you aim down sight and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.440 
smaller but if you aim down sight and
you<00:02:28.260> shoot<00:02:28.500> too<00:02:28.800> fast<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.760> don't<00:02:29.970> give<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you shoot too fast you don't give the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.740 
you shoot too fast you don't give the
crosser<00:02:30.960> enough<00:02:31.380> time<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:32.190> smaller<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.570> my

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
crosser enough time to get smaller so my

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.650 
crosser enough time to get smaller so my
advice<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.160> wait<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.400> little<00:02:35.940> bit<00:02:36.120> more<00:02:36.420> before

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
advice is wait a little bit more before

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.660 
advice is wait a little bit more before
shooting<00:02:37.080> not<00:02:37.440> too<00:02:37.650> much<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> little<00:02:38.370> bit

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
shooting not too much but a little bit

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.400 
shooting not too much but a little bit
more<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.360> Sh<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.720> your<00:02:39.900> shot<00:02:40.140> will<00:02:40.380> be

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
more and you Sh and your shot will be

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.280 
more and you Sh and your shot will be
accurate<00:02:41.270> so<00:02:42.270> that's<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.810> that's<00:02:42.960> why<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
accurate so that's it that's why the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.350 
accurate so that's it that's why the
close<00:02:43.740> range<00:02:44.010> weapons<00:02:44.640> are<00:02:44.790> better<00:02:45.090> at

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
close range weapons are better at

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.330 
close range weapons are better at
close-range<00:02:45.810> engagements<00:02:46.080> because<00:02:46.680> they<00:02:47.040> if

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
close-range engagements because they if

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.900 
close-range engagements because they if
fire<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.840> good<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.890> even<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.670> aim

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
fire is so good that you even if you aim

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.120 
fire is so good that you even if you aim
down<00:02:50.940> sight<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.600> shoot<00:02:51.840> at<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.080> same<00:02:52.260> moment

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
down sight and shoot at the same moment

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.970 
down sight and shoot at the same moment
as<00:02:53.660> as<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.870> see<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> enemy<00:02:55.380> while<00:02:55.740> hanging

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
as as you see the enemy while hanging

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.010 
as as you see the enemy while hanging
downside<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.790> don't<00:02:57.240> lose<00:02:57.390> any<00:02:57.630> accuracy

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
downside you don't lose any accuracy

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.040 
downside you don't lose any accuracy
because<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.620> hipfire<00:02:59.040> was<00:02:59.340> already<00:02:59.700> good<00:03:00.050> so

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
because the hipfire was already good so

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.810 
because the hipfire was already good so
