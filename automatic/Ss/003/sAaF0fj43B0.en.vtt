cranking compression wave form so we
don't<00:00:19.230> see<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.890> don't<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.220> much<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.609> in

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.930 

it's<00:00:39.190> getting<00:00:39.460> down<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:39.850> about<00:00:39.910> them

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it's getting down to about them

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.940 
it's getting down to about them
ten<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> half<00:00:42.750> inches<00:00:43.380> of<00:00:43.760> vacuum

ten and a half inches of vacuum
you<00:00:46.490> just<00:00:46.730> grabbed<00:00:47.120> 722<00:00:48.020> grace

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.649 

this<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> good<00:00:55.859> example<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.659> the

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
this is not a good example because the

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.930 
this is not a good example because the
engine<00:00:57.899> rpm<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.409> actually<00:00:58.679> changing<00:00:59.159> pretty

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
engine rpm is actually changing pretty

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.959 
engine rpm is actually changing pretty
rapidly<00:01:00.059> doing<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> crank<00:01:01.350> sir<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.789> see

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
rapidly doing the crank sir you can see

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.939 
rapidly doing the crank sir you can see
that<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.269> our<00:01:03.390> our<00:01:03.899> peak<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> peak<00:01:04.379> points

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that in our our peak to peak points

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.550 
that in our our peak to peak points
there<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.850> still<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> good<00:01:06.180> guide

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
there but this is still a good guide

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.889 
there but this is still a good guide
just<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> fit<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> bit<00:01:08.610> applied<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.780> we

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
just to fit for a bit applied so if we

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.670 
just to fit for a bit applied so if we
just<00:01:10.049> grab<00:01:10.229> there

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.070 

at<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.220> point<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:16.820> can<00:01:17.000> see<00:01:17.810> that<00:01:17.930> our

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
at a point that you can see that our

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.930 
at a point that you can see that our
ignition<00:01:18.530> event<00:01:19.010> happened<00:01:19.370> pretty<00:01:19.490> close<00:01:19.760> to

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
ignition event happened pretty close to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.160 
ignition event happened pretty close to
top<00:01:20.120> dead<00:01:20.330> center<00:01:20.690> so<00:01:21.250> ignition<00:01:22.250> timing<00:01:22.490> was

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
top dead center so ignition timing was

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.960 
top dead center so ignition timing was
was<00:01:24.170> not<00:01:24.350> upset<00:01:24.680> obviously<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.460> cam<00:01:25.670> timing

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
was not upset obviously the cam timing

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.750 
was not upset obviously the cam timing
was<00:01:26.240> what<00:01:26.420> was<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.630> out<00:01:26.750> sir<00:01:27.280> no<00:01:28.280> injection

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
was what was the out sir no injection

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.470 
was what was the out sir no injection
event<00:01:29.030> was<00:01:29.150> taking<00:01:29.300> place<00:01:29.540> at<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.020> wrong<00:01:30.140> time

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
event was taking place at the wrong time

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.580 
event was taking place at the wrong time
excuse<00:01:32.480> me<00:01:34.120> so<00:01:35.120> if<00:01:35.180> we<00:01:35.240> could<00:01:35.450> grab<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:36.320> image

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
excuse me so if we could grab that image

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.170 
excuse me so if we could grab that image
copy<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.640> did<00:01:37.760> clipboard<00:01:39.640> when<00:01:40.640> we<00:01:40.760> loaded<00:01:41.060> up

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
copy it did clipboard when we loaded up

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.070 
copy it did clipboard when we loaded up
in<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.360> confession<00:01:42.050> program<00:01:43.840> pull<00:01:44.840> up<00:01:44.930> our

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
in the confession program pull up our

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.200 
in the confession program pull up our
curses

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
curses

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:56.010 
curses
we<00:01:47.720> mark<00:01:47.960> out<00:01:48.160> 720<00:01:49.160> degrees

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.219 

and<00:01:56.530> see<00:01:56.830> if<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.400> wanted<00:01:57.820> to<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.750> see<00:01:59.020> their

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
and see if we wanted to you see their

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.850 
and see if we wanted to you see their
ignition<00:02:00.220> of<00:02:00.310> event<00:02:00.909> happens<00:02:01.409> well<00:02:02.440> pretty

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
ignition of event happens well pretty

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.420 
ignition of event happens well pretty
pretty<00:02:03.190> close<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.610> top<00:02:03.790> dead<00:02:03.940> center<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:05.430> not

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
pretty close to top dead center so not

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.980 
pretty close to top dead center so not
great<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:06.820> it's<00:02:07.000> it's<00:02:07.360> where<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.630> should<00:02:07.690> be

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
great but it's it's where it should be

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.139 
great but it's it's where it should be
roughly

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
roughly

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.580 
roughly
I've<00:02:10.659> got<00:02:10.959> here<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.319> some<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.480> ability<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.049> to

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
I've got here is some the ability to to

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.339 
I've got here is some the ability to to
mark<00:02:14.830> out<00:02:15.040> our<00:02:15.400> intake<00:02:15.819> valve<00:02:16.260> opening<00:02:17.260> or

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
mark out our intake valve opening or

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.630 
mark out our intake valve opening or
closing<00:02:17.379> our<00:02:17.860> exhaust<00:02:18.190> valve<00:02:18.489> opening

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
closing our exhaust valve opening

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.330 
closing our exhaust valve opening
opposing<00:02:19.330> events<00:02:21.330> we've<00:02:22.330> just<00:02:22.510> got<00:02:22.659> a<00:02:22.690> a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
opposing events we've just got a a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.699 
opposing events we've just got a a
default<00:02:24.340> setting<00:02:24.640> there<00:02:24.909> which<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:26.650> a

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
default setting there which is on a

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.729 
default setting there which is on a
standard<00:02:27.220> non<00:02:27.340> v<00:02:27.489> VT<00:02:27.670> system<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.739> usually

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
standard non v VT system that usually

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.160 
standard non v VT system that usually
comes<00:02:29.980> pretty<00:02:30.190> close<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.760> money<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.180> can

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
comes pretty close to the money you can

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.350 
comes pretty close to the money you can
put<00:02:32.379> any<00:02:32.620> values<00:02:33.069> into<00:02:33.519> these<00:02:33.670> boxes<00:02:33.879> you<00:02:34.090> like

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
put any values into these boxes you like

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.119 
put any values into these boxes you like
so<00:02:34.540> if<00:02:34.629> you<00:02:34.690> had<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> vehicle<00:02:35.260> specifications

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
so if you had the vehicle specifications

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.910 
so if you had the vehicle specifications
you<00:02:36.220> could<00:02:36.370> pump<00:02:36.579> them<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.530> then<00:02:38.650> we<00:02:38.739> pull

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
you could pump them in and then we pull

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.970 
you could pump them in and then we pull
up<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.040> marker<00:02:39.849> flags<00:02:40.409> the<00:02:41.409> exhaust<00:02:41.739> valve

open<00:02:42.430> event<00:02:42.730> should<00:02:43.390> have<00:02:43.510> taken<00:02:43.750> place

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
open event should have taken place

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.289 
open event should have taken place
roughly<00:02:44.470> here<00:02:44.769> that's<00:02:45.730> when<00:02:45.910> we<00:02:46.030> should<00:02:46.060> have

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
roughly here that's when we should have

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.009 
roughly here that's when we should have
started<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.690> see<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.959> climb<00:02:47.230> as<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.750> exhaust

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
started to see the climb as the exhaust

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.349 
started to see the climb as the exhaust
valve<00:02:50.200> opens<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.489> cylinder<00:02:51.849> pressure<00:02:52.060> comes

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359

back<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.690> atmospheric<00:02:53.079> pressure<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:54.099> you'll

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
back to atmospheric pressure so you'll

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.860 
back to atmospheric pressure so you'll
see<00:02:54.370> it's<00:02:54.489> happened<00:02:54.760> quite<00:02:54.940> late<00:02:55.180> here

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.330 

we<00:02:59.379> can

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.780 

this<00:03:02.910> for<00:03:03.209> argument's<00:03:04.080> sake<00:03:04.200> we<00:03:04.410> could

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
this for argument's sake we could

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.300 
this for argument's sake we could
pull<00:03:06.330> out<00:03:06.450> two<00:03:06.629> curses

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
pull out two curses

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.640 
pull out two curses
and<00:03:08.880> mark

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
and mark

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.089 
and mark
but<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.610> we<00:03:11.670> can<00:03:11.819> see<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.329> is<00:03:13.099> roughly

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
but it and we can see that it is roughly

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.970 
but it and we can see that it is roughly
40<00:03:14.489> degrees<00:03:14.760> late

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
40 degrees late

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.920 
40 degrees late
but<00:03:17.580> that's<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.970> bit<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.120> play<00:03:18.360> if<00:03:18.840> you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
but that's just a bit of play if you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.979 
but that's just a bit of play if you
want<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.140> get<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> bit<00:03:19.440> more<00:03:19.530> accurate<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.129> can

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
want to get a bit more accurate we can

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.150 
want to get a bit more accurate we can
get<00:03:21.989> rid<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.260> one

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
get rid of that one

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.840 
get rid of that one
this<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.490> young

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
this is a young

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.730 
this is a young
reference<00:03:27.660> waveform<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.350> was<00:03:28.470> able<00:03:28.590> to

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
reference waveform that I was able to

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.170 
reference waveform that I was able to
get<00:03:28.860> ahold<00:03:29.070> of<00:03:30.500> if<00:03:31.500> we<00:03:31.620> mark<00:03:31.830> out<00:03:32.010> 720<00:03:32.880> degrees

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
get ahold of if we mark out 720 degrees

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.860 
get ahold of if we mark out 720 degrees

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.680 

what<00:03:41.319> we're<00:03:41.410> gonna<00:03:41.500> do<00:03:41.709> is<00:03:42.150> drag<00:03:43.150> out<00:03:43.300> curses

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
what we're gonna do is drag out curses

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.020 
what we're gonna do is drag out curses
yet<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:45.430> marke<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.850> 720<00:03:47.760> we<00:03:48.760> take<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.150> value

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
yet and marke a 720 we take that value

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.380 
yet and marke a 720 we take that value
this<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.750> reference<00:03:52.080> waveform<00:03:52.620> side

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
this is a reference waveform side

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.930 
this is a reference waveform side
so<00:03:54.990> he<00:03:55.110> had<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.260> time<00:03:55.920> in<00:03:56.100> milliseconds<00:03:56.340> that

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
so he had a time in milliseconds that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.500 
so he had a time in milliseconds that
it's<00:03:57.270> taken<00:03:57.660> for<00:03:57.960> a<00:03:57.990> revolution<00:03:59.270> and<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.360> move

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
it's taken for a revolution and you move

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.270 
it's taken for a revolution and you move
this<00:04:00.690> cursor<00:04:00.930> over<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.440> our<00:04:01.560> campus<00:04:02.010> ition

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
this cursor over to our campus ition

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.310 
this cursor over to our campus ition
marker<00:04:02.670> we<00:04:02.910> go<00:04:03.030> for<00:04:03.180> our<00:04:03.270> signature<00:04:03.660> point<00:04:03.930> you

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
marker we go for our signature point you

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.350 
marker we go for our signature point you
can<00:04:04.440> pick<00:04:04.590> any<00:04:04.710> point<00:04:05.070> but<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.400> find<00:04:06.210> its

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
can pick any point but I find its

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.240 
can pick any point but I find its
easiest<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.750> go<00:04:06.930> off<00:04:07.080> our<00:04:07.290> signature<00:04:07.800> point

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
easiest to go off our signature point

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.040 
easiest to go off our signature point
there<00:04:09.530> so<00:04:10.530> we've<00:04:10.650> got<00:04:10.770> thirteen<00:04:11.070> point<00:04:11.310> six

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.860 

and<00:04:15.560> if<00:04:15.650> we<00:04:15.770> open<00:04:15.890> up<00:04:16.070> their<00:04:16.220> suspect<00:04:16.730> one<00:04:17.090> this

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
and if we open up their suspect one this

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.600 
and if we open up their suspect one this
is<00:04:17.989> cranking<00:04:18.410> one<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:18.770> that<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.130> times<00:04:19.370> are

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
is cranking one so that the times are

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.190 
is cranking one so that the times are
going<00:04:19.790> to<00:04:19.850> be<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.150> lot<00:04:20.480> larger<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:22.190> we<00:04:22.280> grab<00:04:22.460> here

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
going to be a lot larger so we grab here

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.350 
going to be a lot larger so we grab here
at<00:04:24.200> 7:20

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
millisecond the reference marker

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.529 
millisecond the reference marker
location<00:05:15.669> and<00:05:16.669> there's<00:05:16.879> a<00:05:17.919> 41<00:05:19.330> so<00:05:20.330> that's<00:05:20.479> how

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
location and there's a 41 so that's how

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.770

I<00:05:20.599> go<00:05:20.810> about<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:22.569> it's<00:05:23.569> um

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
I go about it it's um

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.660 
I go about it it's um
oh<00:05:25.840> it's<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.590> lot<00:05:26.710> easier<00:05:26.889> to<00:05:27.100> just<00:05:27.400> grab<00:05:27.580> the

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
oh it's a lot easier to just grab the

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
oh it's a lot easier to just grab the
transducer<00:05:28.270> first<00:05:28.540> and

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.980 

I<00:05:31.720> find<00:05:32.560> opening<00:05:33.280> up<00:05:33.370> in<00:05:33.550> my<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:34.180> compression

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
I find opening up in my the compression

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.110 
I find opening up in my the compression
waveform<00:05:35.410> viewer<00:05:35.680> marking<00:05:36.640> out<00:05:36.790> the<00:05:36.880> flag

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
waveform viewer marking out the flag

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.330 
waveform viewer marking out the flag
sometimes<00:05:37.630> helps<00:05:37.960> but<00:05:38.200> suppose<00:05:38.950> when<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.160> got

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
sometimes helps but suppose when you got

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.210 
sometimes helps but suppose when you got
to<00:05:39.430> get<00:05:39.720> accurate<00:05:40.720> results<00:05:41.350> you<00:05:41.470> need<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.650> need

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
to get accurate results you need to need

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.650 
to get accurate results you need to need
to<00:05:42.340> resort<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:42.700> something<00:05:42.970> so<00:05:43.360> I<00:05:43.390> think<00:05:43.540> a

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
to resort to something so I think a

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.570 
to resort to something so I think a
little<00:05:43.750> bit<00:05:43.900> more<00:05:44.230> precise<00:05:44.650> like<00:05:44.980> the<00:05:45.130> cam

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
little bit more precise like the cam

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.970 
little bit more precise like the cam
position<00:05:45.760> center<00:05:46.390> I<00:05:46.620> thought<00:05:47.620> I'd<00:05:47.710> just<00:05:47.830> share

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
position center I thought I'd just share

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.390 
position center I thought I'd just share
that<00:05:48.930> how<00:05:49.930> do<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.110> guys<00:05:50.230> do<00:05:50.440> it<00:05:51.270> so<00:05:52.270> yeah
