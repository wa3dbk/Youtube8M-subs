00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.190
 guys well see on three points today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.280
 let's see how to replace the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.160
 battery of the nexus 4 for the association 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.840
 necessary to remove the back cover 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.400
 first we must remove the two 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.190
 nets that are on the lower side 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.430
 in this case we have removed for 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 be faster in replacing e 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.260
 in the video 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.390
 now you have to go remove the slot that 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.880
 serves to house the sim 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.540
 in this way to perform 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.780
 a simpler dismantling operation 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.800
 we use a phone card one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.860
 phone card fine and incites the hooks 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.670
 valley unhooked in this way that is 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:56.070
 put the card from the outside that goes 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.109
 internal target of the advantage cover 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.730
 we have time can turn out a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.730
 little bit difficult 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.730
 ok 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:12.070
 ok we opened the cover immediately below 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.140
 we find the battery 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.910
 let's put this for a moment of anger and 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.110
 we are going to remove the screws already has 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:28.240
 we have remained one we can remove 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:32.230
 the second ok this perfect but up 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:37.959
 we use this accessory for 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.170
 unhook the battery cable e 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:46.060
 we can proceed to remove the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.250
 battery that is firmly glued to the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:03:00.910
 body can start quietly 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:02.590
 this side this way ok i did 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.970
 we removed the battery 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.140
 as you can see now just take 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.980
 a new battery and fit it in place 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:26.880
 of the other in this new I make you 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:26.880
 see also the ok replacement you have 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.230
 let's put the cover back in this way 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:12.650
 which must be inserted just enough 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:17.269
 insert it this way and press ho 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:25.610

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:29.470
 ok perfect grip check that not 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:33.430
 there are spaces and we can go to 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.430
 replace the screws 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:08.430
 which are insert our sim and the 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.190
