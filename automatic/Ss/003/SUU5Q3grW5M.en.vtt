00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.079
 Hmm 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.760
 like the mother of the supposed son 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.369
 ana maria rita states that it is the loft of 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.160
 pando this is it mother who did not want this 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.140
 soundtrack 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.800
 He sings axé, so that's what's there. 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.189
 bomb in the village of ourique oil is 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.890
 far and still do not know but that guy 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.250
 here is the ball said that they 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.080
 do not run autonomy is beautiful today 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.160
 works according to the natural flow 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.199
 well when it 's bad but they 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.600
 calculate time that goes well 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:58.969
 in June when it's flowing 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:02.360
 they use the pump to maximize the flow 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.100
 but now you see a natural resource and there 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.820
 I was a bit shocked not 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.149
 cry 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.100
 it is good that the wells are very good command 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.899
 I think it's going to take more than I 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.759
 I imagined that I had written a 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.770
 ally on the bed 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.729
 I thought it was good things. 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.729
 farther 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.350
 This is all here in Haiti 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.560
 such holiness to people but mother 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.750
 It's very big 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.310
 in fact is that if this field that has 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.159
 38 years of exploration 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.200
 was in the first places of the destination of 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.200
 field to be explored and take 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.380
 there in the end you're seeing the goal 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.380
 this is an invention 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.990
 ae 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.990
 very cool 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.740
 and ireland can not see the flash that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.320
 They are the ones who are actually bigger. 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.450
 This year they will stay for us to stay. 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.940
 greater greater flame now because I am 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.460
 with a problem in the compressor 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.400
 usually they pick up the gas that comes out 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:31.850
 here from the farm and injected of 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.550
 new is not it? 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.530
 only the problem is that it is with 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.230
 problem on a printer that a series 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:45.080
 a band usually happens to them 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:48.230
 have in the manual a lot of pressure 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.510
 High and the new raúl and ends up having a 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.510
 problem here to train
