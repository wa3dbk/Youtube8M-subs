00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.690
 the patient of the guys that you have 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.570
 then loans to acquire that not 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.330
 we know which one is which one because we have not 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.820
 labeled and we propose it before and now 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.280
 that we are not going to put on the clear patella 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.140
 of the patient because we have become confused 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.140
