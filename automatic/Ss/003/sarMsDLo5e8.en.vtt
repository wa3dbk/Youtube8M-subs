she's never met a dog who doesn't like
these<00:01:35.640> treats<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.920> they<00:01:37.920> had<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> sail<00:01:38.520> off

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
these treats so they had to sail off

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090 
these treats so they had to sail off
that's<00:01:38.850> where<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> decided<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.679> bag

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that's where I decided to get this bag

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.960 
that's where I decided to get this bag
which<00:01:41.399> is<00:01:41.429> 10<00:01:41.940> ounces<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.630> pretty<00:01:42.929> big

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
which is 10 ounces it's pretty big

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.320 
which is 10 ounces it's pretty big
probably<00:01:44.970> five<00:01:45.360> dollars<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:47.090> this<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
probably five dollars so this is the

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.810 
probably five dollars so this is the
last<00:01:48.600> Romeo<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.990> long<00:01:49.259> time<00:01:49.560> since<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
last Romeo a long time since you

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.660 
last Romeo a long time since you
so<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.150> figured<00:01:51.720> why<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:51.990> okay<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.160> is<00:01:53.490> his

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
so I figured why not okay this is his

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.640 
so I figured why not okay this is his
all-time<00:01:53.970> favorite<00:01:54.270> treats<00:01:55.230> in<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.440> world

much is that they really look like bacon

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.220

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.100 
yeah if you haven't tried these out you
really<00:02:36.510> should

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
really should

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.590 
really should
okay<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.830> will<00:02:38.100> last<00:02:38.250> by<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.610> treats<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.270> in

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
egg and cheese and I really thought this

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.449 
egg and cheese and I really thought this
acute<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.410> never<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:46.860> seen<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> dog

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
acute because I never really seen a dog

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.960 
acute because I never really seen a dog
breakfast<00:02:48.150> trees<00:02:48.450> before<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:50.250> really<00:02:50.790> like

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
breakfast trees before and I really like

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.420 
breakfast trees before and I really like
egg<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.360> cheese<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:52.020> he<00:02:52.260> likes<00:02:52.800> these<00:02:53.040> will

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
egg and cheese so if he likes these will

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.940 
egg and cheese so if he likes these will
be

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.500 

this<00:02:57.950> last<00:02:58.280> thing<00:02:58.520> is<00:02:58.670> not<00:02:58.940> something<00:02:59.300> you

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
this last thing is not something you

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.760 
this last thing is not something you
will<00:02:59.660> enjoy<00:02:59.780> but<00:03:00.230> it's<00:03:00.350> something<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.710> you

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
will enjoy but it's something that you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.890 
will enjoy but it's something that you
need<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.700> is<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.530> puppy<00:03:03.530> no<00:03:03.680> flipper

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
need and it is just a puppy no flipper

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.059 
need and it is just a puppy no flipper
small<00:03:05.900> breeding<00:03:06.290> type

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.949 

to<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.970> think<00:03:13.209> these<00:03:13.450> look<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.930> little

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
to it and I think these look a little

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.100 
to it and I think these look a little
bit<00:03:14.230> safer<00:03:14.650> for<00:03:14.830> him<00:03:14.950> than<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.670> other<00:03:16.110> types

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
bit safer for him than the other types
