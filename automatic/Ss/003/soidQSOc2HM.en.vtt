00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
here so like but the additional parts of

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.420 
here so like but the additional parts of
Kamen<00:02:20.230> Rider<00:02:20.380> Garden<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:20.860> course<00:02:21.099> are<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
Kamen Rider Garden of course are the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.830 
Kamen Rider Garden of course are the
wings<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:22.990> spread<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.319> evenly<00:02:23.740> like<00:02:24.459> so

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
wings we can spread it evenly like so

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.290 
wings we can spread it evenly like so
there<00:02:26.019> you<00:02:26.260> go<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.830> sometimes<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:28.090> will

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
there you go and sometimes it will

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.780 
there you go and sometimes it will
overlap<00:02:29.080> each<00:02:29.349> other<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.489> what<00:02:30.670> it

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
overlap each other so this is what it

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.670 
overlap each other so this is what it
looks<00:02:30.940> like<00:02:31.060> at<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.330> back<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.870> as<00:02:32.319> you<00:02:32.500> can<00:02:32.620> see

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
looks like at the back so as you can see

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.610 
looks like at the back so as you can see
I<00:02:32.860> did<00:02:33.519> overlap<00:02:34.090> some<00:02:34.420> some<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.140> parts<00:02:35.440> and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
I did overlap some some of the parts and

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.000 
I did overlap some some of the parts and
they<00:02:35.860> are<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.280> equal<00:02:36.720> sizes<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:38.200> think<00:02:38.830> it's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
they are of equal sizes I think it's

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.750 
they are of equal sizes I think it's
just<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:40.060> angles<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.870> are<00:02:41.530> different

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
just the angles that are different

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.960 
just the angles that are different
my<00:02:43.209> main<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.410> be<00:02:44.560> or<00:02:44.830> what<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.640> can

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
my main going to be or what I can

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.210 
my main going to be or what I can
foresee<00:02:46.450> on<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:46.870> figure<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.980> wings

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
foresee on this figure is that the wings

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.960 
foresee on this figure is that the wings
would<00:02:49.209> come<00:02:49.780> out<00:02:49.930> loose<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.310> long<00:02:51.700> run

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
would come out loose in the long run

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.509 
would come out loose in the long run
because<00:02:52.209> as<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.780> can<00:02:53.019> see<00:02:53.590> right<00:02:53.769> here<00:02:53.830> even

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
because as you can see right here even

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.420 
because as you can see right here even
if<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.849> try<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:55.629> force<00:02:55.989> I'm<00:02:56.410> not<00:02:56.620> really<00:02:56.860> forcing

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
if I try to force I'm not really forcing

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.910 
if I try to force I'm not really forcing
it<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.790> go<00:02:57.910> down<00:02:57.940> but<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.870> does<00:02:59.140> go<00:02:59.319> down<00:02:59.560> on<00:02:59.739> its

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
it to go down but it does go down on its

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.970 
it to go down but it does go down on its
own<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.670> be<00:03:01.000> careful<00:03:01.480> when<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.810> try<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.170> work

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
own so be careful when you try to work

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.640 
own so be careful when you try to work
around<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.940> wings<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.660> camera<00:03:05.140> writer<00:03:05.349> Jack

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
around the wings of camera writer Jack

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.479 
around the wings of camera writer Jack
form<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:07.599> will<00:03:07.840> come<00:03:08.260> out<00:03:08.290> loose<00:03:08.680> oh<00:03:08.980> I

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
form and it will come out loose oh I

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.580 
form and it will come out loose oh I
have<00:03:09.819> no<00:03:10.000> tips<00:03:10.329> whatsoever<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.260> make<00:03:11.290> it

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
have no tips whatsoever to make it

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.280 
have no tips whatsoever to make it
sturdier<00:03:12.310> at<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.730> moment<00:03:13.090> but<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:13.750> have<00:03:14.019> I

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
sturdier at the moment but you have I

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.650 
sturdier at the moment but you have I
guess<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:14.950> have<00:03:15.129> more<00:03:15.549> experience<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.239> doing

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
guess you have more experience in doing

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.050 
guess you have more experience in doing
modifications<00:03:17.470> on<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.769> figure<00:03:18.190> than<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.519> do<00:03:18.730> so

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
modifications on the figure than I do so

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.850 
modifications on the figure than I do so
those<00:03:19.660> are<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.019> things<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.709> need<00:03:20.829> to

slightly<00:03:40.209> loose<00:03:40.480> wings<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.349> will<00:03:41.620> become<00:03:41.769> a

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
slightly loose wings that will become a

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.800 
slightly loose wings that will become a
nuisance<00:03:42.370> if<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:42.819> figure<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.239> played<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> lot

in<00:03:44.019> fact<00:03:44.410> after<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.980> review<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.579> was<00:03:45.790> able<00:03:45.970> to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
in fact after the review I was able to

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.390 
in fact after the review I was able to
detach<00:03:46.510> these<00:03:46.870> without<00:03:47.170> any<00:03:47.530> effort<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.069> that

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
detach these without any effort and that

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.339 
detach these without any effort and that
is<00:03:48.609> my<00:03:48.849> review<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.299> SH<00:03:49.720> figures<00:03:50.109> come
