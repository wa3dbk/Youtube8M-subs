00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 I beg 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.390
 and after all we broke the last sail we 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.390
 forget 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.020
 I'm scared 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.230
 started to make music 1 group 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.210
 nirvana I did not give listen guys 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.750
 older and i decide i need to study 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.750
 to play guitar 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.990
 I think that I came to this world from 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 another world a little bit here at the moment 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.710
 conception as far as knitted there about 10 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.390
 million sperm i came first 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.880
 I mean, this is somewhere in my genes 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.180
 come first so it is necessary to 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.190
 I need to be in a good place 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.720
 be the first in this life because i 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.820
 was already the first I know what it would be 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.730
 first you want to be the best 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.290
 normal for a man is actionism is 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.000
 but we are looking for perfection in everything that is 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.280
 we are perfect by the way not in nature 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.470
 it's not like a carrot eraser 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 that is, we pursue it but on the facts 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.620
 this will never be achieved but 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.840
 it is necessary to pursue again because 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.670
 life this movement must move because 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.180
 that if nothing is done and can be 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.180
 die of boredom 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.659
 also 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.600
 my tattoos stressed what they are doing 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.230
 wasteland silk on here all rose 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.050
 winds 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.360
 by the song of the same name and here is the symbol 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.960
 orienteering here I am guided by 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.180
 wind rose scary lonely lookin on 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.240
 her and understand that theatricality here 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.180
 Indian symbol is the sun 10 and the role 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.580
 Spoken here are two characters to not 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.900
 travelers go astray here 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:12.250
 here travelers are these aspirations 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:16.240
 their pirate is assisted by a cowboy pirates 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.830
 But in general, all the opposition is very 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.840
 I read a lot of books Stevenston in 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.020
 childhood here and there is a lot of island 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.360

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.200

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.590
 Tomahawk teach 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.360
 war touch is generally initially 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.610
 I wanted to sell this microphone to 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.140
 do the entire first tattoo from the microphone i 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.140
 never sold this toy did 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.470
 most respond normally 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.810
 most understand that this is not a zone there 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.300
 what is it I did not serve no not swim that no 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.980
 I went to understand that I probably 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.500
 musician just when the hospital skin 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.920

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.930
 want to form a fire boat fire 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.450
 there to the bank all the banking and here to me 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.670
 you see immediately that the rocker is in 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.420
 onoroke dude doing something 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.420

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.510
 on me after often asking to 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.640
 do there after 20 30 with your own 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.799
 by tattoos I say it will be 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.430
 the smallest of my problems given 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.739

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.609
 Tattoo let let it 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.349
 it does not listen at all to do what you 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.760
 like to go for it no one at all 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.769
 listened because people are not objective 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.930
 if you take a lot of points 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.970
 view you just get confused you 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.519
 need to take one highlight and understand 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.110

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.670
 go through life with that there which 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.789
 you will be helped throughout the planets 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.470

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.930
