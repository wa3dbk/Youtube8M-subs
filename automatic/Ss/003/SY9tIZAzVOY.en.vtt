now<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.650> pop<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.949> actually<00:00:29.189> based<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
now this pop is actually based on the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.609 
now this pop is actually based on the
original<00:00:30.090> canary<00:00:30.660> outfit<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.349> there's<00:00:31.500> no

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
original canary outfit so there's no

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.780 
original canary outfit so there's no
confusion<00:00:31.830> there<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> who<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
confusion there as to who this is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.100 
confusion there as to who this is
supposed<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.149> which<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> why<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:33.989> it's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
supposed to be which is why I think it's

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.080 
supposed to be which is why I think it's
weird<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.950> packaging<00:00:35.370> says<00:00:35.610> Black

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
weird that the packaging says Black

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.110 
weird that the packaging says Black
Canary<00:00:36.559> because<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.680> should<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.160> say<00:00:38.309> canary

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
Canary because it should just say canary

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880 
Canary because it should just say canary
I<00:00:39.329> know<00:00:39.480> I'm<00:00:39.690> being<00:00:39.899> annoyingly<00:00:40.320> nitpicky<00:00:40.860> but

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
I know I'm being annoyingly nitpicky but

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.290 
I know I'm being annoyingly nitpicky but
it's<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:41.700> went<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.059> took<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
it's not like they went and took the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
it's not like they went and took the
arrow<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.020> change<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.890> green<00:00:43.920> arrow<00:00:44.340> in

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
arrow and change it to green arrow in

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.830 
arrow and change it to green arrow in
this<00:00:44.550> package<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:44.969> I'm<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.300> sure<00:00:45.420> why<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.629> says

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
this package so I'm not sure why it says

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.139 
this package so I'm not sure why it says
Black<00:00:46.079> Canary<00:00:46.230> semantics<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.370> know<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.030> can

speaking<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> actual<00:00:52.860> pop<00:00:53.100> itself<00:00:53.550> but

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
speaking of the actual pop itself but

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.910 
speaking of the actual pop itself but
we're<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.480> review<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.410> quality

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
we're here to like review the quality

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
we're here to like review the quality
that<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.190> did<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.670> her<00:00:56.879> little<00:00:57.090> her<00:00:57.629> little

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that they did on her little her little

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080 
that they did on her little her little
torso<00:00:58.260> body<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.340> really<00:00:59.550> strong

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
torso body is just really really strong

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.000 
torso body is just really really strong
I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> way<00:01:01.050> they<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.379> sculpted<00:01:01.800> all

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
I think the way they like sculpted all

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
I think the way they like sculpted all
these<00:01:02.190> little<00:01:02.430> details<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:03.000> down<00:01:03.239> her<00:01:03.449> legs

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
these little details going down her legs

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.170 
these little details going down her legs
like<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:04.799> little<00:01:05.369> buckles<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.030> her

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
like the little little buckles on her

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.969 
like the little little buckles on her
boots

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
boots

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.609 
boots
the<00:01:07.979> texture<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.729> her<00:01:08.790> her<00:01:09.570> torso<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.380> know

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the texture on her her torso and I know

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.630 
the texture on her her torso and I know
it's<00:01:10.770> brie<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> say<00:01:11.040> texture<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:11.549> all

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it's brie to say texture because all

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.920 
it's brie to say texture because all
just<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> plasticy<00:01:12.270> vinyl<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> does

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
just like a plasticy vinyl but it does

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
strong the little tiny like rivet on the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.450 
strong the little tiny like rivet on the
little<00:01:22.290> snap<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> her<00:01:22.860> gloves<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.250> there's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
little snap of her gloves like there's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219 
little snap of her gloves like there's
some<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.700> salt<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.420> tiny<00:01:24.600> paint<00:01:24.930> on

her<00:01:25.920> belt<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.810> did<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
her belt but I just think that did a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
her belt but I just think that did a
great<00:01:28.140> job<00:01:28.610> sculpting<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.700> figure<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
great job sculpting this figure and the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
great job sculpting this figure and the
way<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.799> her<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.070> jacket

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
way the the back of her little jacket

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.969 
way the the back of her little jacket
laces<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.970> back<00:01:33.119> there

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
laces up in the back there

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.929 
laces up in the back there
also<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.130> they<00:01:35.220> didn't<00:01:35.520> give<00:01:35.640> her<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
