UCLA for a reason and the reason i told

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.079 
UCLA for a reason and the reason i told
my<00:00:13.440> house<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.400> actually<00:00:14.700> talking

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
my house that I was actually talking

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.630 
my house that I was actually talking
about<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.809> little<00:00:16.800> bit<00:00:16.920> before<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
about that a little bit before this and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.099 
about that a little bit before this and
I<00:00:17.699> thought<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:18.029> gender<00:00:18.330> from<00:00:18.420> UCLA<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:18.900> this

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
I thought my gender from UCLA for this

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.410 
I thought my gender from UCLA for this
specific<00:00:19.260> reason<00:00:19.859> not<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.220> just<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:21.180> something

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
specific reason not to just do something

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.540 
specific reason not to just do something
for<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> program<00:00:21.960> but<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.470> help<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.189> me

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
for the program but to help not just me

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.279 
for the program but to help not just me
personally<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.180> team<00:00:24.449> build<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.990> bring

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
personally but this team build and bring

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.740 
personally but this team build and bring
UCLA<00:00:25.740> back<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> national<00:00:26.580> prominence<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
UCLA back to the national prominence and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.419 
UCLA back to the national prominence and
I<00:00:27.900> think<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.949> sort<00:00:29.400> of

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
I think that was one thing that sort of

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.160 
I think that was one thing that sort of
stuck<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.760> my<00:00:29.849> head<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.330> talking<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.810> family

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
stuck in my head and talking to family

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.069 
stuck in my head and talking to family
and<00:00:31.199> talking<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> people<00:00:32.009> around<00:00:32.099> him<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
and talking to people around him and

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.120 
and talking to people around him and
understanding<00:00:34.079> why<00:00:34.230> exactly<00:00:34.500> i<00:00:34.710> came<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.040> i

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
understanding why exactly i came and i

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.380 
understanding why exactly i came and i
talked<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> Jonathan<00:00:35.790> Franklin<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.300> he

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
talked to Jonathan Franklin and he

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.049 
talked to Jonathan Franklin and he
helped<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.660> out<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> lot<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:38.059> another

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
helped me out a lot and I think another

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.979 
helped me out a lot and I think another
reason<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.570> also<00:00:39.750> getting<00:00:39.930> my<00:00:40.079> degree<00:00:41.989> not

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989

reason was also getting my degree not

pretty much I think we built a platform
at<00:02:14.950> UCLA<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.520> we've<00:02:15.970> developed<00:02:16.270> this<00:02:16.510> program

at UCLA and we've developed this program

into you know us from seven to six ago

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.890 
into you know us from seven to six ago
in<00:02:19.720> 1995<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:21.400> now<00:02:21.550> ten<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:21.940> three<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.390> being

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
in 1995 to now ten and three and being

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.720 
in 1995 to now ten and three and being
you<00:02:23.110> know<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.380> team<00:02:23.680> that's<00:02:23.980> recognized<00:02:24.489> but

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
you know a team that's recognized but

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.240 
you know a team that's recognized but
not<00:02:24.910> really<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:26.050> prominent<00:02:26.860> spot<00:02:27.010> light

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
not really in the prominent spot light

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.880 
not really in the prominent spot light
yet<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.150> think<00:02:28.239> with<00:02:29.019> what<00:02:29.319> we<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.650> coming

in and what we have already as far as
the<00:02:31.780> players<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.530> lot<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.400> them<00:02:33.459> a<00:02:33.760> lot<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.269> our

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
the players a lot of them a lot of our

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.729

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
team's defense coming back a lot of

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.070 
team's defense coming back a lot of
offense<00:02:36.190> coming<00:02:36.430> back<00:02:36.550> row<00:02:36.700> line<00:02:37.080> everybody's

first it was sort of scattered

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.880 
first it was sort of scattered
everywhere<00:03:13.299> but<00:03:14.140> at<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.500> end<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.769> day

there's a lot of things that you take
into<00:03:17.079> account<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.280> said<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.489> think<00:03:18.700> one

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
into account and like I said I think one

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.370 
into account and like I said I think one
of<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.000> things<00:03:19.030> which<00:03:19.450> was<00:03:19.930> being<00:03:20.170> able<00:03:20.320> to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
of the things which was being able to

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.850 
of the things which was being able to
come<00:03:20.530> back<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.859> something
