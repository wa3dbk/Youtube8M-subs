axle<00:00:29.290> so<00:00:30.759> first<00:00:31.759> thing<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.419> know<00:00:32.570> we<00:00:32.810> couldn't

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
axle so first thing to know we couldn't

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.310 
axle so first thing to know we couldn't
have<00:00:33.320> their<00:00:33.590> enough<00:00:33.980> they<00:00:34.790> are<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.329> six<00:00:36.050> bolt

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
have their enough they are the six bolt

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.750 
have their enough they are the six bolt
miss<00:00:37.010> come<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:39.190> pull<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.510> adapters<00:00:41.510> pouch<00:00:42.879> is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
miss come and pull the adapters pouch is

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.560 
miss come and pull the adapters pouch is
21<00:00:46.760> years<00:00:46.969> in<00:00:47.539> diameter<00:00:48.940> so<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:49.969> can<00:00:50.179> tell<00:00:50.420> if

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
21 years in diameter so you can tell if

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.970 
21 years in diameter so you can tell if
you<00:00:50.660> have<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.960> right<00:00:51.140> hub<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.679> get<00:00:51.859> the

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
you have the right hub you get the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.660 
you have the right hub you get the
adapter<00:00:52.190> out<00:00:52.519> it<00:00:53.390> will<00:00:53.660> be<00:00:53.899> about<00:00:54.670> 28

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
adapter out it will be about 28

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.079 
adapter out it will be about 28
millimeters<00:00:56.390> in<00:00:56.660> diameter<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:58.089> about<00:00:59.800> 16

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
millimeters in diameter and about 16

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.020 
millimeters in diameter and about 16
millimeters<00:01:02.089> thick

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.350 

so<00:01:05.630> first<00:01:06.080> thing<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:06.380> do<00:01:06.730> pull<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:07.880> adapters

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
so first thing you do pull the adapters

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.850 
so first thing you do pull the adapters
over<00:01:08.540> either<00:01:08.750> side

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.880 

and<00:01:15.400> they<00:01:15.520> are<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.850> same<00:01:16.150> on<00:01:17.020> both<00:01:17.200> sides<00:01:17.260> of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
and they are the same on both sides of

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.230 
and they are the same on both sides of
this<00:01:18.070> hub<00:01:19.320> left<00:01:20.320> with<00:01:20.560> maximum<00:01:21.550> variance<00:01:21.940> in

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
this hub left with maximum variance in

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.070 
this hub left with maximum variance in
there<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.400> we're<00:01:24.550> going<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.730> remove<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
there so we're going to remove the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.650 
there so we're going to remove the
bearings<00:01:26.830> that<00:01:26.980> axle<00:01:27.340> from<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.730> hub<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.480> I'm

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
bearings that axle from the hub and I'm

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.660 
bearings that axle from the hub and I'm
going<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.840> do<00:01:28.990> this<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:29.440> with<00:01:29.560> some<00:01:29.830> common

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
going to do this just with some common

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.850 
going to do this just with some common
tools<00:01:30.910> here<00:01:31.300> some<00:01:32.080> sock<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.710> right

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
tools here some sock it to the right

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.760 
tools here some sock it to the right
size<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.550> go<00:01:34.000> over<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:34.930> sit<00:01:35.200> on<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.560> disk

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
size and go over and sit on the disk

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.020 
size and go over and sit on the disk
metal<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.290> another<00:01:38.740> socket<00:01:39.130> that's<00:01:39.550> going<00:01:39.670> to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
metal and another socket that's going to

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.340 
metal and another socket that's going to
fit<00:01:40.480> onto<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.900> axle<00:01:42.690> I'm<00:01:43.690> going<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:43.990> tap<00:01:44.320> that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
fit onto the axle I'm going to tap that

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:55.710 
fit onto the axle I'm going to tap that
very<00:01:44.950> note<00:01:51.150> just<00:01:52.150> like<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:55.060> factory

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
very note just like that is the factory

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.149 
very note just like that is the factory
axle<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:58.270> barre

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.039 

I'm<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.090> out<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.479> second<00:02:03.869> berry

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
I'm going to take out the second berry

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.309 
I'm going to take out the second berry
flip<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> wheel<00:02:04.890> over<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.719> they've<00:02:06.929> got<00:02:07.109> it<00:02:07.229> on

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
flip the wheel over so they've got it on

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:21.920 
flip the wheel over so they've got it on
the<00:02:07.499> socket<00:02:09.890> axle<00:02:10.890> back<00:02:11.069> inside

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.900 

just<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.370> Western<00:02:27.640> Melton

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
just like so so the Western Melton

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.559 
just like so so the Western Melton
sports<00:02:28.150> kit<00:02:28.980> provides<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.190> new<00:02:30.400> larger<00:02:31.239> axle

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
sports kit provides a new larger axle

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.800 
sports kit provides a new larger axle
for<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.870> 15<00:02:32.200> millimeter<00:02:32.470> thru-axle<00:02:33.810> along

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
for the 15 millimeter thru-axle along

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.699 
for the 15 millimeter thru-axle along
with<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.849> new<00:02:36.849> enduro<00:02:37.860> ceramic<00:02:38.860> bearings<00:02:39.069> and

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
with the new enduro ceramic bearings and

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.080 
with the new enduro ceramic bearings and
new<00:02:41.709> pen<00:02:42.580> caps<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.630> replace<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.319> small

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
new pen caps to replace the small

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.400 
new pen caps to replace the small
quick-release<00:02:46.090> pen<00:02:46.599> caps<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.630> installation

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
quick-release pen caps so installation

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.440 
quick-release pen caps so installation
on<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.560> new<00:02:50.680> kit<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.130> basically<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.700> reverse<00:02:52.269> of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
on the new kit is basically a reverse of

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.830 
on the new kit is basically a reverse of
the<00:02:52.569> disassembly<00:02:53.019> we've<00:02:53.920> got<00:02:54.220> one<00:02:55.090> very<00:02:55.330> kept

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
the disassembly we've got one very kept

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.470 
the disassembly we've got one very kept
in<00:02:56.019> there<00:02:56.260> already

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
in there already

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.059 
in there already
then<00:02:58.480> we<00:02:58.750> take<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.650> new<00:02:59.980> through<00:03:00.580> axle<00:03:02.069> push

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
then we take the new through axle push

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.050 
then we take the new through axle push
that<00:03:03.450> into<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.720> bearing<00:03:06.540> slide<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.780> Newbery

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
that into the bearing slide the Newbery

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.190 
that into the bearing slide the Newbery
place<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:12.730> this<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:13.510> use<00:03:13.780> your<00:03:14.019> regular

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
place in this can use your regular
