00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
 hello there is a novel with you and in this video 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.670
 we'll figure out the songs of the movie group 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.160
 when your girlfriend is sick 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.000
 Iâ€™ll go first and type a bit later 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.000
 show you how she plays 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.850
 and so on trying something new then I mean 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.680
 chose again for her simple 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.510
 chord to not particularly bother then 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.950
 there is this video and this analysis is very 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.840
 very suitable for beginners especially 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.040
 let's go means i start the chord same 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.900
 first tell you how I course we 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.449
 we put with the left hand then what fight 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.449
 Play is restarted so where are 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.410
 then love and 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:05.030
 then the shop and then yes and yet it fits 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.810
 about the fight, that is, the group 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:25.119
 I like the film group and Viktor Tsoi 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:30.930
 play my sins how it is played goes 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:33.729
 down down close two times up straight 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.369
 when my hand just covers and 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:43.990
 from here immediately two times we call up 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:47.050
 1 out of 2 times the measures closed down closed two 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.350
 times up shut down shut the yard 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.800
 probably were closed down she probably and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.800
 to go 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.350
 end of each battle you can use 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.610
 to connect them a little more 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.909
 additional package 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.539
 from bottom to top it turns down to shut down two 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.960
 times up 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:16.600
 closed the model is not closed two times up 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:18.489
 all the cinema group songs have risen here 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.440
 win completely different battles with you 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.440
 so simple this can be played 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.959
 pick up more that fight that you 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.790
 like and you can probably finally 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.290
 you can say that there is such 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.079
 a little bit to beat this tune when you 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.780
 play a chord d at the end of an ace if you 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:49.940
 it will need to win it you little finger 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.180
 You can additionally clamp on the last 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.019
 strike down the first string on 3 fret and 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.019
 it turns out such a thing 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.260
 but 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.170
 For beauty you can not use 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.630
 use to watch the summit in their own way 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.730
 the principle of discretion probably for 35 she 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.380
 pretty simple 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.360

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.510
 useful you liked it then put 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.980
 Like share it with who you are 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.950
 think she can be him 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.110
 useful and if you still do not 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.690
 it turns out free to play this song 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.220
 all fail or fast 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.070
 rearrange chords or play like this 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.600

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.560
 okay with your base with your base 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.830
