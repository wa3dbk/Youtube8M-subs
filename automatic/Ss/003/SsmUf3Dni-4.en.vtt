00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.979 
people misconstrued the shape some
people<00:02:38.730> actually<00:02:39.730> try<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.300> define<00:02:40.690> them<00:02:40.959> by

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
people actually try to define them by

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.820 
people actually try to define them by
size<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.920> which<00:02:42.430> case<00:02:42.850> is<00:02:43.150> also<00:02:43.780> true<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:44.560> I

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
size in which case is also true but I

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.430 
size in which case is also true but I
would<00:02:45.580> say<00:02:45.790> not<00:02:46.000> really<00:02:46.060> since<00:02:46.810> all<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.110> them

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
would say not really since all of them

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.400 
would say not really since all of them
actually<00:02:48.280> have<00:02:49.320> medium-sized<00:02:50.910> sickly<00:02:51.910> or

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
actually have medium-sized sickly or

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.910 
actually have medium-sized sickly or
medium<00:02:53.410> sized<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:55.600> buna<00:02:55.989> hacks<00:02:56.230> or<00:02:56.470> peacocks

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
medium sized in buna hacks or peacocks

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.590 
medium sized in buna hacks or peacocks
they'll<00:02:57.190> actually<00:02:57.400> belong<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.030> each<00:02:58.330> group

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
they'll actually belong to each group

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.470 
they'll actually belong to each group
okay<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.590> that<00:03:00.040> makes<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.550> automatically<00:03:01.209> not

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
okay so that makes it automatically not

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.590 
okay so that makes it automatically not
true<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:03.310> second<00:03:03.670> reason<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.360> I've

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
true so the second reason that I've

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.030 
true so the second reason that I've
heard<00:03:05.080> was<00:03:05.819> coloration<00:03:06.819> okay<00:03:07.720> for<00:03:07.989> some<00:03:08.290> for

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
heard was coloration okay for some for

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.910 
heard was coloration okay for some for
some<00:03:09.340> types<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:10.030> cichlids<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.290> could<00:03:11.650> hold

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
some types of cichlids that could hold

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.240 
some types of cichlids that could hold
true<00:03:12.370> but<00:03:13.239> not<00:03:13.810> necessarily<00:03:14.440> because<00:03:15.010> some<00:03:15.220> of

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
true but not necessarily because some of

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.550 
true but not necessarily because some of
these<00:03:15.519> fishes<00:03:16.060> actually<00:03:16.900> have<00:03:17.049> vibrant

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
these fishes actually have vibrant

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.190 
these fishes actually have vibrant
colors<00:03:17.950> even<00:03:18.280> if<00:03:18.430> they're<00:03:18.640> female<00:03:19.150> okay<00:03:19.630> so

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
colors even if they're female okay so

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.069 
colors even if they're female okay so
that<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.709> also<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.310> misconception<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.660> telling

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
that is also a misconception in telling

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.479 
that is also a misconception in telling
if<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:24.420> cichlid<00:03:25.420> is<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.630> male<00:03:25.989> or<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.320> female<00:03:26.530> okay

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
if a cichlid is a male or a female okay

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.930 
if a cichlid is a male or a female okay
or<00:03:27.870> trying<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.200> say<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.340> know<00:03:30.459> these

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
or trying to say that you know these

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.680 
or trying to say that you know these
types<00:03:31.299> are<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.690> gunas<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:32.470> these<00:03:32.650> types<00:03:32.950> are

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
types are in gunas and these types are

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.550 
types are in gunas and these types are
perhaps<00:03:34.690> or<00:03:35.500> D<00:03:35.709> starts<00:03:36.130> or<00:03:36.280> peacock<00:03:36.730> shaped<00:03:37.690> I

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
perhaps or D starts or peacock shaped I

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.780 
perhaps or D starts or peacock shaped I
might<00:03:39.430> say<00:03:39.760> yes<00:03:40.359> also<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:41.530> not<00:03:42.340> really

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
might say yes also but not really

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.340 
might say yes also but not really
because<00:03:44.430> two<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.609> this<00:03:45.850> two<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.690> these<00:03:46.959> types

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
because two of this two of these types

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.940 
because two of this two of these types
actually<00:03:48.100> have<00:03:48.250> very<00:03:48.459> similar<00:03:49.500> they<00:03:50.500> actually

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
actually have very similar they actually

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.550 
actually have very similar they actually
have<00:03:51.100> very<00:03:51.280> similar<00:03:51.609> shapes<00:03:52.150> okay<00:03:52.690> except<00:03:53.260> one

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
have very similar shapes okay except one
