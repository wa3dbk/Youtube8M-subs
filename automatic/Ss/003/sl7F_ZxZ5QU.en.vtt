 key investors and key transistors 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.060
 to ensure access in the Czech Republic often

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.600
 the disadvantage of such a solution is five

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.620
 dynamic memory consumption

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.420
 as a result, kilobytes are fast 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.690

 static RAM 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.980
 much higher but much density 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.710
 lower and the price is quite high with lower 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.950

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.790
 static memory small size 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.320
 although their information 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.390
 capacity is much less than thousand 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.420
 greater number of transistors and let 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.670
 backup placements not only increase 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.530
 dimensions of sram memory chips but let's get started 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.520
 increase the cost of technology 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.880
 process keep magical 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.970

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.790
 dynamic memory 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.550
 For example, a capacity model game may 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.040
 equal 4 4 megabytes or more 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.870
 while the capacity of the model is static 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.630
 memory is about the same size 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.600
 be about two years ago 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.570
 and the cost will be the same 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.830
 thus the dimensions of the static 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.050
 average guy is 3 to 5 times the size 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.180
 dynamic ram then 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.979
 the same can be said about value 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.949
 all this does not allow the use of memory 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.629
 sent quality RAM 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.349
 personal computers despite 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.409
 on this, the developers still apply

 packard efficiency 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.809
 to maintain significant 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.489
 the cost increases only 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.329
 small volume of inflow into red 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.489
