00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
that up one more time your horse

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.790 
that up one more time your horse
shouldn't<00:03:57.060> have<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.450> like<00:03:57.600> try<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.140> keep<00:03:58.620> the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
shouldn't have to like try to keep the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.560 
shouldn't have to like try to keep the
bit<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.070> its<00:03:59.250> mouth<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.910> horse<00:04:00.239> shouldn't

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
have wrinkles on its lips because then

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.630 
have wrinkles on its lips because then
you're<00:04:03.870> putting<00:04:04.170> pressure<00:04:04.320> on<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.130> when

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
you're putting pressure on it and when

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.790 
you're putting pressure on it and when
you<00:04:05.760> want<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.090> go<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.630> don't<00:04:06.780> want<00:04:07.080> pressure

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
you want to go you don't want pressure

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.890 
you want to go you don't want pressure
on<00:04:08.070> pressure<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.850> makes<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.480> doesn't<00:04:09.840> make

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
on pressure that makes that doesn't make

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.030 
on pressure that makes that doesn't make
any<00:04:10.050> sense<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.590> they're<00:04:10.709> going<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.920> be<00:04:11.010> a

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
any sense like they're going to be a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.530 
any sense like they're going to be a
little<00:04:11.280> confused<00:04:11.790> or<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.900> lot<00:04:13.170> confused

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
little confused or a lot confused

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.190 
little confused or a lot confused
so<00:04:15.540> that's<00:04:15.840> basically<00:04:15.989> all<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.799> do<00:04:16.950> for<00:04:17.250> that

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
so that's basically all I do for that

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.810 
so that's basically all I do for that
untie<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.260> rope<00:04:19.530> halter

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
untie the rope halter

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.350 
untie the rope halter
put<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.870> away<00:04:23.660> in<00:04:24.660> my<00:04:24.720> case<00:04:25.230> I<00:04:25.440> just<00:04:25.470> toss<00:04:25.860> it

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
put it away in my case I just toss it

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.920 
put it away in my case I just toss it
because<00:04:28.370> mess<00:04:29.370> in<00:04:29.550> there<00:04:29.730> anyway<00:04:30.090> who<00:04:30.360> cares

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
because mess in there anyway who cares

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.240 
because mess in there anyway who cares
so<00:04:31.830> yeah<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.870> extent<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.440> video

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250
