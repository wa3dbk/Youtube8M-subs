bowl<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.970> thing<00:04:00.210> is<00:04:00.270> I<00:04:00.660> mean<00:04:00.810> it's

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
bowl and this thing is I mean it's

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.570 
bowl and this thing is I mean it's
filling<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.740> only<00:04:01.860> used<00:04:02.100> a<00:04:02.220> little<00:04:02.400> bit<00:04:02.490> of

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
filling and I only used a little bit of

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.820 
filling and I only used a little bit of
Chi<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.000> flocks<00:04:03.300> but<00:04:03.960> because<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.380> expands

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
Chi and flocks but because it expands

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.130

when<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.640> had<00:04:05.760> liquid<00:04:05.940> it's<00:04:06.750> going<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.960> be

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140

really<00:04:07.320> filling<00:04:07.710> so<00:04:07.830> you<00:04:07.920> could<00:04:08.040> actually

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
really filling so you could actually

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.400 
really filling so you could actually
probably<00:04:08.400> split<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:08.970> with<00:04:09.030> someone<00:04:09.840> this

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410
