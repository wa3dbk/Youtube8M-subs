00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.570
 hello youtube friends how are you waiting 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.849
 that are of the best x because today we are going 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.310
 to make the ice farm hahaha let's go 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.050
 to do once and for all good for 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.970
 make the ice farm what there is that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.130
 to do is to choose an area where this 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.960
 snowy I do it here next to the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.779
 farm of es line which is an area of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.460
 snow xd you have to make a square of 14 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.460
 x 14 x from miren 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.769
 so he has to stay hehehe now 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.769
 let's chop two blocks deep 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.700
 so they have to do it hehe now where 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.830
 we put the blocks we are going to put the 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.830
 pistons has to be the normal x baby 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.159
 let's put the pistons there 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.140
 more x now let's make a circuit of 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.500
 reston so that the pistons platform 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.350
 perfectly x 3 let's put a 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.450
 lever and we're going to turn it on like this when 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.570
 We put the rest will tell us how far 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.940
 achieves 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.310
 now this corner have to take out the 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.380
 piston and we're going to cover it with stone and 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.140
 so with the other corner 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.450
 here where it does not have the piston we are going to 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.259
 put a recover so you have more 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.259
 reach x 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.080
 to car we put another one repeats 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.080
 ya ha ha now let's clean everything 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.200
 this area of ​​the square x 3 well well 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.630
 we have to leave fixed 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.880
 now let's lower the pistons to 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.190
 can make a hole to put water xd 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 look 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.530
 we just have to chop a hole beyond 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.739
 so you have to stay now let's 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.840
 activate the pistons to put the 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.209
 water we only have to have two 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.409
 cubes of water and we already fill all 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.409
 xdddd corners 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.960
 look what they have to do xd 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.180
 well now to accelerate the process 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.460
 freezing the heavens we're going to 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.680
 do this there are we going to put three 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.160
 blocks looking at the center hahaha 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.160
 look like this 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.010
 already done so let's break two blocks 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.010
 down as I am doing 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.080
 I exist explained the sand blocks 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.330
 was to measure the center of the four 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.700
 holes I'm doing hahaha now 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.909
 let's put the sticky piston in the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.909
 holes 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.320
 now we need four blocks of 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.420
 snow to make you have to have ball 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.070
 of snow and put in the inventory as 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.620
 If you were going to make a table 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.720
 storeroom but snow as I am 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.720
 doing me x baby is very easy 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.190
 I have already made the block of snow we are going to 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.540
 put where are the pistons that 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.540
 we have to take it out hehe 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.860
 is already finished here up x now 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.319
 let's make a circuit for the 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.250
 sticky pistons that is work of the 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.250
 farm x 3 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.320
 I'm going to clean this up a bit to make the 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.870
 good x circuit so they have to 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.720
 clean to make the circuit x now 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.250
 we put 4 blocks next to the piston so 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.250
 how am I doing haha 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.530
 I have already put the blocks we are going to put 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.900
 Reston torch down the piston for 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.700
 that lights up now we're going to need 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.370
 reston and we put like I'm 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.620
 doing I explained x has to go 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.840
 towards the block that we put like this when 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.890
 the energy passes the torch goes out and 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.890
 the piston will be lowered 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.930
 xd here there will be a clock but not 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.320
 come on, let's put a refrigerator 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.840
 of this the torch ha ha 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.690
 so it has to stay now is already 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.760
 finished the farm xd xd should like 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.250
 can see now the piston is off 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.720
 so you have to raise the four 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.380
 blocks of snow when they hit the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.990
 lever x must 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.540
 to make the water infinite or water 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.850
 without current the sticky pistons of 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.560
 means must be turned off thus 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.560
 will make infinite water look at you 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.570
 now we turn it on and the other 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.230
 lever are deactivated so that 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:07.200
 Sticky pistons come up like that 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.040
 can see it's already made full I'm going to put 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.040
 in big camera 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.710
 and 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.440
 I was looking at the circuit and with a 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.930
 lever we can activate and deactivate the 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.170
 pistons that is the sticky and the normal 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.940
 xd to do this you have to put a 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.280
 block anyone and a torch of 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.720
 reston as well as I have and there will take 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.630
 the pistons below 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.430
 that's all xt is very easy as you can 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.590
 see now the snow block is down 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.330
 and when I give the lever the pistons 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.990
 Normal turns on and the snow block 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:54.610
 already it made up and all ice x 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.610
 apply has been said hahaha 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.930
 as you can see this farm gives you a 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.120
 stack and 42 ice is very effective x's 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.190
 you can do another farm to 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.830
 so that they have more to be 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.610
 already full with just one lever already 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.610
 the two jobs 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.220
 already started to make ice jaca carita 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.980
 happy xd good youtube friends like this 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.320
 ends part 27 of survival 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.970
 x for forgive me I do not upload very video 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.370
 often I do not have much time 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.950
 hahaha good they told me to send 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.800
 greetings x greeting for nelson ortiz 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.230
 jonathan navarro and manuel núñez pablo 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.780
 ruz go with valencia thanks for the 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.400
 support that they give me xd as you already know like 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.800
 and share the video and if they want 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.020
 subscribe for more video x must be 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.020
