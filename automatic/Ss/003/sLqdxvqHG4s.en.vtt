00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.920
 manufacturer motorola is rather a friend 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.750
 and 5th class with launch moto x 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.580
 it remains of course for a while none 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.350
 Phones released again from none 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.690
 important phones released and so 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.010
 previously purchased by google marinade 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.900
 for a moment and tell you not because they 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.640
 made such good phones and proud of it 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.010
 one day the moto x interesting device 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.720
 taunts designing with once is a 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.770
 number of interesting software 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.600
 features 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.610
 but unfortunately never in the Netherlands 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.110
 appeared maybe just nice 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.210
 then the belt is my moto x is download 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.579
 angry motivates you even cheaper 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.199
 engine x and it really shouldn't be there 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.699
 It is surprising that the pillow is also in it 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.589
 the netherlands launched musician device 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.440
 buy for around 200 euros 8 gigabytes 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.879
 their belgium and of course you have it here 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.370
 no in no he has a flag or scripts 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.780
 not a nexus 5 it's not the lg toe 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.249
 but it is very solid indeed 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.170
 device tomorrow jean has a snapdragon 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.120
 400 processor from qualcomm four and a half 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.679
 once a 720 p screens are 1 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.089
 gigabyte of memory 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.920
 then it is not specifications listed in it 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.479
 so someone in the blow away no high and 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.399
 flagship but they are whole 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.650
 good specifications form device slightly 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.900
 more means 200 euros and that I am 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.790
 very impressed 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.170
 we see that more and more lately 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.060
 people go from SIM only subscription 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.010
 people are also not subsidized or expensive 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.840
 set again but note the wallet 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.250
 and go for cheaper but for the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.040
 lower monthly charges instead of one 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.660
 more expensive phone and if you take the mri tram 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 can watch and can the motor unit was whole 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.710
 battles made in the Netherlands 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.750
 of course really phones fans of it 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.460
 things like full hd you with good big ones 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.080
 camera a lot of working memory voting process throughout 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.880
 very important but i think it's for 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.230
 a whole lot of people who keep getting that feature 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.700
 be more interesting I think one 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.530
 400 snapdragon processes for a whole 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.520
 hope people soon enough she is my goal 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.810
 a lot of people want of course 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.100
 really just a little bit 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.960
 whatsapp and facebook a bit 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.090
 tweeting maybe want to instagram there and 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.200
 before that people in his 400 snapping 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.790
 process there really enough 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.870
 I can now give him device a few days 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.860
 tests and all those social networks everything 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.360
 what really only text and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.520
 pictures goes like a train to it 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.200
 screen I should not turn on to 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.390
 heavy 3d games to play original 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.470
 training does is that we are not there the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.240
 phone for 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.050
 but for other purposes it appears 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.880
 the engine gee in the first impressions 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.170
 very good contender to just be 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.330
 one of the best device in segments 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.860
 his net is the computing power are also the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.390
 megapixels of the camera and not large 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.020
 enough not high enough to put someone on 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.050
 work blown 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.000
 5 megapixels is of course a time true 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.280
 most flag flagships 16 or 20 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.900
 megapixels 41 megapixels accidents 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.000
 having is of course not very bad 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.410
 impressive but i think most 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.090
 people use their smartphone camera especially 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.770
 use it off when photo instagram 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.880
 or to send via or for whatsapp 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.170
 to share facebook 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.420
 and for those people and certainly for people 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.910
 and 17p screen is the difference that the 5 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.620
 megapixel camera 16 magic winx room 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.910
 suffer noticeable that details see 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.750
 you just don't have a small smartphone 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.430
 screens 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.110
 if you don't get the photos go to later 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.180
 edit on your computer or printed 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.950
 then 5 megapixels it is not much 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.330
 but it is for most daily 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.190
 application it is actually enough 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.080
 and if it applies to your specification 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.550
 also applies to construction of the device 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.190
 it's a bit of a thick column 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.930
 device does not feel very modern 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.670
 futuristic but it is enough 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.450
 it feels solid to be all 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.040
 things that are on none on any front 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.780
 is the motor China excel 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.160
 but for 200 euros it's just on it 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.720
 first in him it was very solid 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.410
 device with reasonable specification 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.120
 daily use 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.470
 we are now going to come time expanded 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.730
 Testing also come full back 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.230
 there are a lot of software 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.870
 features that you have not tested such as 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.130
 for example motorola 16 your phone 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.480
 automatically silent during 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.709
 meetings or when you sleep and 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.660
 that you all need extensive 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.520
 tested where the first impressions appear 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.830
 that in this price segment let him out and see 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.970
 really going to hit really hard and me 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.590
 would not surprise me one of the 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.800
 popular phones for the coming time 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.800
 is becoming
