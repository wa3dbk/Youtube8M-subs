00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 ayew everyone his rockets 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.299
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.340
 new video presentation of a 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.630
 little system in the atom that I have that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.190
 I discovered by accident 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.610
 on youtube there is a small 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.710
 week 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.350
 so it's a cowboy stone generator 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.600
 fully automated that was 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.529
 made by two youtuber anglo saxons 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.849
 so this is panda 4994 and jl 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.930
 2579 so these two names rather complicated 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.599
 but in fact really a job is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.309
 quite exceptional so I invite you to 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.570
 pass in front of their chains I will put 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.030
 all the links in the description that this 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 be the north link chain of the video of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.350
 presentation of their projects 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.710
 as well as the download link of 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 the map 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.969
 so they made a throw of a time 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.399
 totally automated cowboy stone 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.800
 which will have the effect of breaking the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.079
 blocks in addition to milk 2 generated via the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 cauvel generators here present for 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.530
 do this they used a property 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.149
 of the whizzer that is that when this 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.160
 last receives suffocation damage 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.109
 he laughs breaking all the blocks around 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 him in an area of three by three by 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.489
 three that is here represented by 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.409
 these blocks there ni green 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.979
 we will be able to immediately activate our 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.180
 our machine so we press on ron 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.830
 so a little lever for 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.500
 enable / disable 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.750
 our machine is also a button on 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.760
 going to see a concert everything is after and there 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.420
 see that the balance sheet cage in itself 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.070
 fill in very little time with cold 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.160
 stone what will do damage 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.620
 of suffocation at the sight that goes as one 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.060
 saw him destroy all the blocks in a 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.740
 mist of three by three by three which 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.430
 are the google generation zone 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.200
 so how are we doing to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.830
 general to coben well it's very 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.840
 simple on ad and many in all eight 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.780
 generators of our vertical columns of 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.120
 3.2 authors who will push the acropolis 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.650
 Stone in the lead lap 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.090
 see issue to bear it 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.530
 quite complex in civ 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.969
 there is a little more explanation 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.859
 do not hesitate to ask me in 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.659
 comments but I'm not going to this 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.259
 dance is a bit too long served 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.200
 of presentation here we can also 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.150
 with with suffocation damage shooting 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.920
 and louise hours would just 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.700
 tracks on the buttons this will activate the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.690
 kill mode kill the wiz mode to support 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.549
 up normally sell at a time and that 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.650
 should be created little by little 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.720
 louisa because in fact I'm going to fuck 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.560
 the scorer is a piece of furniture that generates 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.030
 automatically 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.980
 and there we leather the button 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 damage they will slip suffer in 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.760
 more important than 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.439
 this general or little by little 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.560
 will create it so it takes a lot of 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.049
 time but it's going to kill him so also 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.489
 give yourself a time to caubel serve him 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.840
 of two modes celerra to visa so here we go 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.349
 that's about all I had 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.120
 tell you 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.140
 do not hesitate to ask me anyway 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.970
 if you have a little bit more 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.140
 details about the system I will make you 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.010
 a video if there are any requests is 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.510
 also I remind you that you 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.700
 can always find all the links 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.290
 in the description and I tell you to 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.310
 very well why the ones in the world 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.310
 it was fuel
