he has his bicycle there and a bicycle
there<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.530> this<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:11.890> basically<00:01:12.070> where<00:01:12.280> the

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
there and this is basically where the

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.520 
there and this is basically where the
one<00:01:12.520> white<00:01:12.700> back<00:01:12.910> is<00:01:13.119> this<00:01:13.660> little<00:01:13.960> pip<00:01:14.200> in<00:01:14.380> the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
one white back is this little pip in the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.800 
one white back is this little pip in the
center<00:01:14.890> there<00:01:15.130> as<00:01:15.550> you<00:01:15.759> can<00:01:15.789> see<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.390> isn't

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
center there as you can see it isn't

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.870 
center there as you can see it isn't
there's<00:01:17.080> not<00:01:17.200> one<00:01:17.350> directly<00:01:17.890> underneath<00:01:18.220> so

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
there's not one directly underneath so

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.400 
there's not one directly underneath so
it<00:01:19.090> kind<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.330> point<00:01:19.509> up<00:01:19.630> different<00:01:19.960> directions

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
it kind of point up different directions

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.230 
it kind of point up different directions
so<00:01:20.590> when<00:01:20.770> you<00:01:21.280> fan<00:01:21.520> them<00:01:21.700> at<00:01:21.790> different<00:01:21.909> whites

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
so when you fan them at different whites

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.120 
so when you fan them at different whites
or<00:01:22.420> when<00:01:22.540> you<00:01:22.659> riffle<00:01:23.470> shuffle<00:01:23.500> on<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.920> set

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
or when you riffle shuffle on the set

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.890 
or when you riffle shuffle on the set
and<00:01:24.280> while<00:01:24.400> shuffle<00:01:24.880> them<00:01:25.030> you<00:01:25.479> can<00:01:25.630> see<00:01:25.869> that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
and while shuffle them you can see that

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.929 
and while shuffle them you can see that
kind<00:01:26.470> of<00:01:26.560> moves<00:01:26.799> a<00:01:26.979> little<00:01:27.189> bit<00:01:27.340> but<00:01:27.759> it's<00:01:27.880> not

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
kind of moves a little bit but it's not

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.670 
kind of moves a little bit but it's not
really<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.240> big<00:01:28.420> deal<00:01:28.479> for<00:01:28.689> me<00:01:28.990> but<00:01:29.200> some<00:01:29.409> people

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
really a big deal for me but some people

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.260 
really a big deal for me but some people
maybe<00:01:29.860> it's<00:01:30.610> kind<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:30.850> got<00:01:30.939> this<00:01:31.000> really

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
maybe it's kind of got this really

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.940 
maybe it's kind of got this really
really<00:01:31.479> cool<00:01:31.780> interesting<00:01:32.200> back<00:01:32.500> design<00:01:32.799> with

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:29.219 
it's a simpler deck because the

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:30.920 
it's a simpler deck because the
spectator<00:03:29.700> won't<00:03:30.000> believe<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.329> you're<00:03:30.719> kind

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
of doing with a trick deck so it's just

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.610 
of doing with a trick deck so it's just
quite<00:03:33.060> plain<00:03:33.450> deck<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:33.989> like<00:03:34.200> it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
quite plain deck and I like it

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.770

so<00:03:35.099> for<00:03:35.250> dribbling<00:03:35.579> why<00:03:35.729> this<00:03:36.060> bicycle<00:03:36.479> stock

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
so for dribbling why this bicycle stock

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.909 
so for dribbling why this bicycle stock
air<00:03:37.019> cushion<00:03:37.409> finish

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
air cushion finish

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.649 
air cushion finish
so<00:03:38.220> for<00:03:38.400> dribbling<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.849> handling<00:03:39.329> it<00:03:39.479> should

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
so for dribbling and handling it should

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:40.490 
so for dribbling and handling it should
just<00:03:39.840> pass<00:03:40.019> through<00:03:40.169> this<00:03:40.260> with<00:03:40.470> flying

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
just pass through this with flying

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.229 
just pass through this with flying
colors<00:03:41.129> but<00:03:41.519> then<00:03:41.639> after<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> while<00:03:42.060> it

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
colors but then after a while it

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.930 
colors but then after a while it
obviously<00:03:42.690> will<00:03:42.959> get<00:03:43.260> old<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:44.099> it's<00:03:44.220> lump<00:03:44.699> up

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
obviously will get old and it's lump up

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.229 
obviously will get old and it's lump up
but<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.659> was<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.019> softer<00:03:46.470> act<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:47.400> playing

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239
