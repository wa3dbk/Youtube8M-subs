hi I'm Amy Allen with craftsy.com

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.360 
hi I'm Amy Allen with craftsy.com
and<00:00:06.470> today<00:00:06.740> I'm<00:00:06.830> going<00:00:06.950> to<00:00:07.010> show<00:00:07.190> you<00:00:07.250> the

and today I'm going to show you the
proper<00:00:07.760> way<00:00:07.880> to<00:00:07.910> sew<00:00:08.270> a<00:00:08.300> to<00:00:08.720> thread<00:00:09.080> flatlock

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
proper way to sew a to thread flatlock

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.790 
proper way to sew a to thread flatlock
so<00:00:10.700> this<00:00:11.000> is<00:00:11.330> a<00:00:11.390> two<00:00:11.690> thread<00:00:11.930> flatlock<00:00:12.110> that

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
so this is a two thread flatlock that

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.490 
so this is a two thread flatlock that
I've<00:00:12.890> done<00:00:13.099> on<00:00:13.220> fleece<00:00:13.550> and<00:00:14.139> right<00:00:15.139> here<00:00:15.380> you

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
I've done on fleece and right here you

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.310 
I've done on fleece and right here you
can<00:00:15.530> see<00:00:15.740> these<00:00:16.339> are<00:00:16.640> all<00:00:16.699> called<00:00:17.089> ladders<00:00:17.659> so

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
can see these are all called ladders so

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.249 
can see these are all called ladders so
here<00:00:18.800> we<00:00:18.890> go<00:00:19.039> we<00:00:19.339> have<00:00:19.609> the<00:00:19.999> ladders<00:00:20.659> on<00:00:20.900> one

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
here we go we have the ladders on one

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.290 
here we go we have the ladders on one
side<00:00:21.529> of<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.800> stitch<00:00:22.070> you<00:00:22.669> can<00:00:22.699> see<00:00:22.970> these<00:00:23.119> in

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
side of the stitch you can see these in

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.309 
side of the stitch you can see these in
gold<00:00:23.569> and<00:00:23.869> these<00:00:24.380> are<00:00:24.679> my<00:00:25.039> needle<00:00:25.339> thread<00:00:25.640> I

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:26.319 
gold and these are my needle thread I

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.139 
gold and these are my needle thread I
turn<00:00:27.319> this<00:00:27.470> over<00:00:27.679> this<00:00:28.099> red<00:00:28.369> color<00:00:28.640> right<00:00:28.880> here

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
turn this over this red color right here

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.749 
turn this over this red color right here
this<00:00:29.329> is<00:00:29.390> my<00:00:29.599> lower<00:00:30.079> looper<00:00:30.619> thread<00:00:30.649> so<00:00:31.579> if<00:00:31.669> we

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
this is my lower looper thread so if we

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.700 
this is my lower looper thread so if we
look<00:00:31.939> inside<00:00:32.359> the<00:00:32.539> machine<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:33.320> way<00:00:33.469> that<00:00:33.620> you

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
look inside the machine the way that you

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.529 
look inside the machine the way that you
should<00:00:33.739> have<00:00:34.039> your<00:00:34.280> set<00:00:34.609> up<00:00:34.730> if<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.090> remove<00:00:35.390> this

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
should have your set up if I remove this

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.400 
should have your set up if I remove this
waste<00:00:35.840> collector<00:00:36.519> open<00:00:37.519> up<00:00:37.609> my<00:00:37.730> looper<00:00:38.059> cover

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
waste collector open up my looper cover

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.110 
waste collector open up my looper cover
you<00:00:39.410> can<00:00:39.530> see<00:00:39.739> in<00:00:39.829> here<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:40.070> have<00:00:40.399> my<00:00:40.640> lower

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
you can see in here I have my lower

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.479 
you can see in here I have my lower
looper<00:00:41.600> threaded<00:00:42.260> in<00:00:42.410> red<00:00:42.620> because<00:00:43.370> it

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
looper threaded in red because it

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.340 
looper threaded in red because it
matches<00:00:43.940> my<00:00:44.210> threading<00:00:44.600> colors<00:00:44.960> right<00:00:45.199> in

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
matches my threading colors right in

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.829 
matches my threading colors right in
here<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:45.800> then<00:00:46.519> I<00:00:46.609> have<00:00:46.820> my<00:00:47.059> needle<00:00:47.300> threaded

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
here and then I have my needle threaded

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.360 
here and then I have my needle threaded
in<00:00:47.929> gold<00:00:48.199> because<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.949> matches<00:00:49.339> my

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
in gold because that matches my

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.970 
in gold because that matches my
threading<00:00:49.789> diagram<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.510> back<00:00:51.170> here<00:00:51.530> on<00:00:51.710> my

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
threading diagram and back here on my

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.470 
threading diagram and back here on my
upper<00:00:52.280> looper<00:00:52.579> I<00:00:52.609> have<00:00:52.850> what's<00:00:53.089> called<00:00:53.300> a

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
upper looper I have what's called a

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.569 
upper looper I have what's called a
spreader<00:00:53.899> if<00:00:54.469> you<00:00:54.649> don't<00:00:54.890> have<00:00:55.100> one<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.429> these

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
spreader if you don't have one of these

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.189 
spreader if you don't have one of these
you<00:00:55.640> can<00:00:55.999> still<00:00:56.269> do<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.420> flat<00:00:56.690> lock<00:00:56.899> but<00:00:57.140> it

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
you can still do a flat lock but it

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.509 
you can still do a flat lock but it
would<00:00:57.289> be<00:00:57.379> a<00:00:57.410> three<00:00:57.710> thread<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.280> that's<00:00:58.399> a

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
would be a three thread and that's a

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.200 
would be a three thread and that's a
little<00:00:58.670> different

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
little different

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.200 
little different
did<00:00:59.629> they<00:00:59.719> were<00:00:59.780> just<00:01:00.109> doing<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.499> two<00:01:00.649> thread

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
did they were just doing the two thread

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.700 
did they were just doing the two thread
but<00:01:02.210> that<00:01:02.390> would<00:01:02.539> be<00:01:02.570> on<00:01:02.870> your<00:01:03.109> upper<00:01:03.379> looper

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
but that would be on your upper looper

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.920 
but that would be on your upper looper
ready<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.070> go<00:01:04.190> so<00:01:04.910> your<00:01:05.060> tension<00:01:05.570> should<00:01:05.810> all

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
ready to go so your tension should all

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.230 
ready to go so your tension should all
be<00:01:06.080> adjusted<00:01:06.620> and<00:01:06.770> everything<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:07.520> your

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
be adjusted and everything and your

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.320 
be adjusted and everything and your
stitch<00:01:08.450> finger<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:08.930> engaged<00:01:09.970> because<00:01:10.970> I'm

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
stitch finger is engaged because I'm

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.110 
stitch finger is engaged because I'm
sewing<00:01:11.660> with<00:01:11.810> fleece<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.470> have<00:01:13.010> my<00:01:13.880> foot

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
sewing with fleece I have my foot

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.640 
sewing with fleece I have my foot
tension<00:01:14.570> turned<00:01:14.840> up<00:01:14.990> too<00:01:15.170> high

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
tension turned up too high

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.190 
tension turned up too high
and<00:01:16.180> also<00:01:17.180> I'm<00:01:17.570> going<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.870> take<00:01:18.050> my

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
and also I'm going to take my

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.380 
and also I'm going to take my
differential<00:01:18.620> feed<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.310> I'm<00:01:19.910> going<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.240> turn

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
differential feed and I'm going to turn

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.150 
differential feed and I'm going to turn
it<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:20.660> that<00:01:20.750> it<00:01:20.840> gather<00:01:21.080> slightly<00:01:21.680> just<00:01:21.860> that

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
it so that it gather slightly just that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.730 
it so that it gather slightly just that
my<00:01:22.700> fabric<00:01:23.420> doesn't<00:01:23.630> get<00:01:23.840> stretched<00:01:24.200> out<00:01:24.410> as<00:01:24.620> I

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
my fabric doesn't get stretched out as I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.460 
my fabric doesn't get stretched out as I
sew<00:01:25.040> I'm<00:01:25.340> also<00:01:25.940> going<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.420> take<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.140> stitch

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
sew I'm also going to take the stitch

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.530 
sew I'm also going to take the stitch
length<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.520> I'm<00:01:28.610> going<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:28.820> turn<00:01:28.940> up<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.240> four

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
length and I'm going to turn up to four

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.970 
length and I'm going to turn up to four
so<00:01:29.810> it's<00:01:29.960> really<00:01:30.680> wide<00:01:32.290> we<00:01:33.290> have<00:01:33.320> our<00:01:33.680> two

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
so it's really wide we have our two

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.280 
so it's really wide we have our two
pieces<00:01:34.640> of<00:01:34.670> fleece<00:01:34.970> right<00:01:35.240> here<00:01:35.510> we're<00:01:36.140> going

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
pieces of fleece right here we're going

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.280 
pieces of fleece right here we're going
to<00:01:36.500> line<00:01:36.800> up<00:01:36.830> these<00:01:37.190> edges<00:01:37.430> very<00:01:37.970> nicely<00:01:38.290> so

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
to line up these edges very nicely so

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.020 
to line up these edges very nicely so
you'll<00:01:39.620> see<00:01:39.830> right<00:01:39.950> here<00:01:40.010> that<00:01:40.430> I<00:01:40.490> have<00:01:40.520> my

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
you'll see right here that I have my

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.660 
you'll see right here that I have my
upper<00:01:41.450> blade<00:01:41.690> is<00:01:42.020> disengaged<00:01:42.680> because<00:01:43.490> when

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
upper blade is disengaged because when

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.460 
upper blade is disengaged because when
I'm<00:01:43.790> sewing<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.870> don't<00:01:45.020> actually<00:01:45.170> want

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
I'm sewing this you don't actually want

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.680 
I'm sewing this you don't actually want
to<00:01:45.500> cut<00:01:45.710> off<00:01:45.830> any<00:01:46.010> of<00:01:46.220> your<00:01:46.400> fabric<00:01:46.820> what<00:01:47.540> we're

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.500 
to cut off any of your fabric what we're
doing<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.440> we<00:01:49.280> are<00:01:49.310> putting<00:01:49.820> this<00:01:50.030> under<00:01:50.420> the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.750 
doing is we are putting this under the
foot<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.160> we're<00:01:52.160> not<00:01:52.280> actually<00:01:52.610> getting

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
close to the blade so even if you can't

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.710 
close to the blade so even if you can't
disengage<00:01:55.160> your<00:01:55.190> blade<00:01:55.550> you're<00:01:56.180> still<00:01:56.420> ok

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720

another<00:02:10.160> one<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.369> shows<00:02:10.759> where<00:02:11.120> my<00:02:11.240> cutting

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
another one that shows where my cutting

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.339 
another one that shows where my cutting
width<00:02:11.720> is

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
width is

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.349 
width is
so<00:02:12.650> I'm<00:02:12.859> going<00:02:13.159> to<00:02:13.189> line<00:02:13.430> up<00:02:13.459> my<00:02:13.579> fabric<00:02:13.969> in

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:14.359 
so I'm going to line up my fabric in

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.959 
so I'm going to line up my fabric in
between<00:02:15.109> the<00:02:15.499> right<00:02:15.859> needle<00:02:16.099> notch<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:16.969 
between the right needle notch and the

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.970 
between the right needle notch and the
little<00:02:17.180> cutting<00:02:17.420> notch<00:02:17.629> on<00:02:17.840> my<00:02:17.900> foot<00:02:18.260> because

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
little cutting notch on my foot because

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.280 
little cutting notch on my foot because
when<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.400> sew<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> flat<00:02:20.030> lock<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:20.780> actually

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
when you sew a flat lock you actually

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.229 
when you sew a flat lock you actually
are<00:02:21.439> letting<00:02:21.829> the<00:02:21.920> stitches<00:02:22.370> hang<00:02:22.730> over<00:02:23.209> the

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
are letting the stitches hang over the

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.599 
are letting the stitches hang over the
edge<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.079> fabric<00:02:24.409> they're<00:02:25.280> not<00:02:25.430> going<00:02:25.579> to

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
edge of the fabric they're not going to

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.729 
edge of the fabric they're not going to
be<00:02:25.730> up<00:02:25.909> tight<00:02:26.269> against<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.989> like<00:02:27.200> they<00:02:27.709> are

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
be up tight against it like they are

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.429 
be up tight against it like they are
with<00:02:28.040> most<00:02:28.340> stitches<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:29.689> back<00:02:29.840> here<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:30.109> have<00:02:30.409> a

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
with most stitches so back here I have a

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.699 
with most stitches so back here I have a
little<00:02:30.650> thread<00:02:31.010> tail<00:02:31.280> that's<00:02:31.819> ready<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.209> go

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
little thread tail that's ready to go

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.449 
little thread tail that's ready to go
and<00:02:33.969> we<00:02:34.969> can<00:02:35.000> still<00:02:38.859> just<00:02:39.859> keep<00:02:40.099> your<00:02:40.280> fabric

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
and we can still just keep your fabric

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:49.119 
and we can still just keep your fabric
nice<00:02:40.909> and<00:02:41.269> lined<00:02:42.200> up<00:02:47.439> if<00:02:48.439> you<00:02:48.530> look<00:02:48.680> back<00:02:48.859> here

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
nice and lined up if you look back here

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.979 
nice and lined up if you look back here
at<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> back<00:02:49.549> of<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.819> fabric<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.689> can<00:02:50.840> see

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
at the back of the fabric you can see

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.199 
at the back of the fabric you can see
that<00:02:51.139> these<00:02:51.260> loops<00:02:51.590> are<00:02:51.829> very<00:02:51.859> loose

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
that these loops are very loose

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.809 
that these loops are very loose
that's<00:02:53.629> good<00:02:53.959> that's<00:02:54.199> what<00:02:54.379> we<00:02:54.409> want<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:55.010> I'll

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
that's good that's what we want so I'll

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.720 
that's good that's what we want so I'll
just<00:02:55.909> continue<00:02:56.120> feeding<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.810> through

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.720 

all<00:03:04.730> right<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.720> here<00:03:05.959> we<00:03:06.080> have<00:03:06.489> our<00:03:07.489> finished

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
all right so here we have our finished

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.910 
all right so here we have our finished
stitch<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.420> all<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.989> these<00:03:09.140> loops<00:03:09.380> are<00:03:09.590> very

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
stitch and all of these loops are very

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.290 
stitch and all of these loops are very
loose<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.489> that's<00:03:10.610> good<00:03:10.849> because<00:03:11.000> when<00:03:11.209> we

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
loose and that's good because when we

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.559 
loose and that's good because when we
open<00:03:11.599> this<00:03:11.720> up<00:03:15.730> going<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.819> lay<00:03:16.970> very<00:03:17.269> nicely

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
open this up going to lay very nicely

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.640 
open this up going to lay very nicely
and<00:03:18.080> so<00:03:18.980> we<00:03:19.130> have<00:03:19.280> our<00:03:19.430> ladders<00:03:19.790> on<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.120> side

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
and so we have our ladders on this side

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.860 
and so we have our ladders on this side
we<00:03:21.650> have<00:03:21.800> our<00:03:21.830> loops<00:03:22.130> on<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.489> side<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.030> our

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
we have our loops on this side and our

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.380 
we have our loops on this side and our
fabric<00:03:24.410> should<00:03:24.800> just<00:03:25.190> butt<00:03:25.730> up<00:03:25.880> against<00:03:26.269> each

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
fabric should just butt up against each

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.970 
fabric should just butt up against each
other<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:26.870> they're<00:03:27.019> not<00:03:27.170> laying<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.680> top<00:03:27.709> of

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
other so they're not laying on top of

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.860 
other so they're not laying on top of
each<00:03:28.250> other<00:03:28.430> they're<00:03:29.030> just<00:03:29.390> hitting<00:03:29.630> each

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
each other they're just hitting each

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.500 
each other they're just hitting each
other<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.349> that<00:03:31.099> is<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.430> correct<00:03:31.819> to<00:03:32.209> thread

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
other and that is a correct to thread
