 No sooner does Brazil talk or outburst 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 of a doctor he spent six 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.160
 hours trying to save a patient 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.099
 inside an ambulance until you can 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.470
 is that she will have to pay 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.750
 saved the life of a patient in 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.270
 Brasilia only after traveling three 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.330
 hospitals he got care 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.760
 it was hours of much anguish we 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.920
 We've been holding her for six hours now. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.720

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.579
 hours here at the base hospital door 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.890
 and hospital base at least 30 minutes 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.920
 and look no one came that nothing to us 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.829
 went inside and received a negative from the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.790
 of neurology physicians and if I jump 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.100
 and I quote here today 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.559
 ended her life called the center 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.250
 capture of goiÃ¢nia and here unfortunately 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.500
 did not get any vacancy that supports and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.329
 investigate these very strong suspicions of 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.120
 brain death on how many hospitals 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.829
 I went through three hospitals are the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.379
 complicated situation here we stay 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.229
 also very nervous and moved by the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.119
 situation or that there is a suspicion of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.200
 one of brain death the show is 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.700
 keeping all the games her organs 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.470
 waiting for the help of some 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.409
 colleague that within the confirmation of a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.630
 colleague, including the Secretaries of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.759
 status of the entire health organization 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.729
 to have a reference and against 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.100
 reference, and it is not just her case that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.650
 It's six o'clock . 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.119
 lady be patient and 30 minutes and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.070
 thirty minutes aquino in front of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.259
 base hospital no one helps how much 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.869
 time but predicts that it can only maintain 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.299
 while her while we have strength 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.329
 here for both to make this move 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.130
 What are you looking at, just looking at yourself? 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.690
 I agree with the author windows crying 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.870
 same 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.890
 is six hours with this patient six 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.720
 hours trying or better until today 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.690
 the situation of this in proving a 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.680
 professional health care as it deals with 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.840
 lives 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.470
 one day to day at this time the tears 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.470
 falls 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.320
 you got excited about the 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.950
 sir about six hours working there 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:19.990
 a conscious way 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.370
 the building where even because I am 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.480
 come from this poor class 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.250
 Happily I have a hard time seeing 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.910
 medicine in this way is a form of 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.940
 bad 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.240
 the cob lay but I would call the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.390
 attention of the secretaries of the 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.940
 authorities to improve not only health 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.220
 of the df but also around the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.860
 people in general I get excited 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.080
 because yesterday was a child tomorrow 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.209
 Shot I'll meet a lot of people. 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.640
 criticisms and what we need 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.640
 counter-reference run height 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.450
 is an example of a doctor and the secretary 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.390
 federal health assistant 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.480
 elias miziara confirmed that the patient 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.190
 had brainbending and the vital signs 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.860
 are kept with devices in the hospital 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.330
 of Brasilia's base, the secretary said 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.330
 also that will determine what happened
