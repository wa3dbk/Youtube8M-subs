00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.420
 let's analyze this pencil finish effect 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.979
 before we start let's think a little bit about what we need 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:18.399
 On the one hand we need a white background and a black profile to give that 

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:19.839
 sensation 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:20.720
 finish 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.380
 in peace 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.640
 my original focus 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.050
 It has nothing to do with it 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 a color photo with the two characters 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.869
 we have to 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:32.990
 get 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.990
 that pencil finish effect 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.340
 to get it we have to see the method in which we are going to get the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.860
 white as the predominant color 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.930
 been a peak that layer background 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.040
 and of all the merging modes in this case I put you split 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.400
 we already have that black as the base color 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.700
 from now on 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.730
 if I can start to draw the lines the profiles are already on their way 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.850
 to get the pencil effect they are looking for 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.220
 The first thing I'm going to do more is to convert my stage to objects 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.720
 smart 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.430
 and in this way I will work without loss 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.910
 that leaked we know that you will be able to blur ovalle and I will make this area to 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.910
 let go through it what is in the bottom 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.970
 there is the filter 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.070
 that approach 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.530
 let's go inside that focus 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.940
 and in the end it must be as we are seeing, we are going to be able to 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.760
 get 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.110
 with that white 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.340
 background that part of the colors is moving and in this way we are going to 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.960
 to be able to reach that line or that profile that we are looking for 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.100
 The first thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.940
 lower the radius 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.540
 from that approach to find a ray small enough for me to 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.030
 give those pinilla is that I'm looking 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.030
 let's say here or that 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.250
 and as we can see we have already started 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.350
 to get those lines 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.400
 what I wanted 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 can re-enter let's go down a little bit even more 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.070
 lightning 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.079
 and I want for those lines 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:14.339
 we already have profiled on white background my composition om and looked for pencil 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:18.709
 what I have to do now on the one hand is adjust the levels to give it more 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.720
 contrast 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.959
 at the bottom 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.899
 the black background dark background 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.699
 with the white 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.819
 there we are getting 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.819
 a darker shade darker black 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.189
 let's see approximately here 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.929
 here we are going to leave 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.129
 we have 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.329
 those lines 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.609
 what happens is that 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.389
 it still has color 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.599
 to remove the color directly I will generate 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.209
 a layer of tony saturation where I'm going to eliminate saturation 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.150
 for this rain rain take away that little noise 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.729
 by lugo aida that has my composition 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.389
 The first thing I'm going to do is copy all the information I have 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.689
 visible at this time in a new layer pressed the upper case control and 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.089
 the letter in 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.599
 and abounded chopped of what I'm living in the visible area 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:21.439
 in this case here we have that duplicate and now on that layer that contains the 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.059
 almost finished effect 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.929
 let's tell him we want 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.739
 a noise reduction filter 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.010
 let's reduce the noise precisely to eliminate 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.759
 all that grain in the background 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.459
 paqui would not be involved in any way but 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:45.909
 let's remove the grain to the maximum to leave the surface as white if I 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.449
 I keep detail it is clear that it will be lomba to come back out in this case the 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.639
 color reduction I have a grayscale layer no color 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.039
 i the approach 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.289
 of details and that I will be able to work it a bit in half 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:04.409
 for his side mind about 45 50 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.989
 to recover some texture but 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.159
 remember that it is different to conservation 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.229
 of the detail 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.499
 this approach to detail that I'm already island o and I'm already having 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.100
 once the effect is applied we already see that the pencil feeling increased 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.580
 considerably 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.490
 with respect to the initial image that we had 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.300
 I will also be able to recover part of the information below 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.550
 play with the opacity of this layer that I have 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.199
 for example on a 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.289
 80 percent 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.770
 and in this way so let or allow me to see part of what is below 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.919
 she 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.259
 but eliminating a lot that roughness that I had in the beginning 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.159
 generate this pencil effect 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.830
 It is very fast and very simple 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.590
 we just have to start thinking 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.750
 how to get that white background for later in this case crossing the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.240
 defocus ocean power fulfilled my zarco draw lines the size that 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.730
 I want
