00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
not only do you become very

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.250 
not only do you become very
unpredictable<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.690> direction<00:03:01.959> that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
unpredictable in the direction that

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.140 
unpredictable in the direction that
you're<00:03:02.410> going<00:03:02.440> which<00:03:03.370> can<00:03:03.670> make<00:03:03.790> your<00:03:03.970> dog

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150

much<00:03:04.750> more<00:03:05.049> attentive<00:03:05.319> but<00:03:06.099> your<00:03:06.849> dog<00:03:07.060> no

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
much more attentive but your dog no

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.270 
much more attentive but your dog no
longer<00:03:07.660> knows<00:03:07.930> which<00:03:08.290> way<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.709> forwards

pull ahead the great thing about this

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.000 
pull ahead the great thing about this
