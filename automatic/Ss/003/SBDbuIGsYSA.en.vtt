00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.820
 we will use the new app on the edge of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.980
 steel 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.220
 the forest of the opening for having the rustic 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.800
 be read in order to have a great deal of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 small pvc folder we go 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.340
 do some work on the machine that 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.680
 you you can not develop you can 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.990
 doing the third would be just like the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.730
 people are going to do this is a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.540
 you have an idea of ​​how to work with 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 the wall 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.309
 So we'll stretch first. 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 frame by bp then comes working 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.010
 it covers the edge of the support so that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.719
 Can you understand the handle? 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.789
 your opening 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.160
 the device will apply and stretch the entire 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.750
 the wall 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.460
 we remind you next time you do not 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.730
 have much experience the ideal is that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.590
 always make small pieces and already 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.140
 prepares one meter and two meters in one 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.659
 pop wall whistle we did here the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.110
 all the way up and down the side has been 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.450
 the tape in search of such a daughter only 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.810
 in the vertical direction 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 to not be branded tape and then 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.119
 The amendment is easy so choose a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.540
 two meter method on the wall goes 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.189
 passing the mass is two people is 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.890
 Good, one goes and another comes 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.549
 working investigates every brand in the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.640
 wall once the mark stretched 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.500
 just come giving finishing snakes 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.310
 The appliance will do, so it's 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.250
 make the Africa drawing almost worth the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.430
 china applied the steel play 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.079
 left the whole wall with the mass 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.690
 You can see finishing can lose you. 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.200
 get pvt 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.950
 by the church first make a move 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:13.250
 vertical in the same analysis of dinha 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:14.900
 They even speak a lot of vertical afi already. 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.610
 country would look nice right now 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.610
 but the finish is not 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.610
 the Mexican from top to bottom 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.390
 left the union ready uniformized the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.240
 wall

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.560
 Look there, it's going to make small investments. 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.060
 with the sieve 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.780

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.720
 do as you please take me to the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.730
