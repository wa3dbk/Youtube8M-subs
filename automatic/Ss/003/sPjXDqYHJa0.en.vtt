00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.770
 appeared in 1936 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.360
 Doctor sausage immediately won 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.270
 buyers love 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.100
 she was considered a dietary product and 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.590
 even intended as 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.470
 health food for people weakened 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.340
 from hunger the developed recipe was 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.110
 All-Union Research 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.570
 meat industry institute like 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.910
 called in her mb in them was beef 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:55.339
 top grade pork bold milk 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:58.010
 egg and spices only nutmeg 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.860
 or karma cardamom these spices are considered 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.870
 noble doctoral still 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.650
 It is considered perhaps the most useful 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.960
 sausage 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.530
 in a modern way, the composition is almost not 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.080
 changed rather improved 25 percent 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.510
 semi fatty pork was replaced by lean 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.060
 in the right product to the best of salt and 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.770
 no pepper cut doctor 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.280
 the sausage should have a nice pink 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.830
 color without gray spots and voids 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.270
 Do current manufacturers stick 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.590
 traditional recipes or taste 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.870
 Doctorate today is probably not the same 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.240
 now by quality 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.400
 Chinsky, I, as before, did nâ€™t 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.720
 like now somehow here corresponds 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.870
 even written that corresponds to the guests 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.090
 I mix the taste first before she does 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.840
 in whom the site and even the cats ate an hour even 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.160
 cats bliss 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.920
 there was no taste and smell forgive smith no 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.780
 the taste of real meat used to be somehow 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.180
 natural sausage is not there now 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.340
 more than physical to appreciate 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.680
 taste modern doctoral 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.600
 sausages we purchased 4 samples of local 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:11.420
 production encrypted them under the numbers 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.050
 number one meat row number two dig and 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.860
 world number you hope 95 and number four 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.470
 trading house big our tasters 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.740
 students future commodity 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.320
 and staff of expert laboratories 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.410
 our samples have to go tough 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.420
 compliance assessment 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.360
 state standard and so ask 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.600
 The first sample tasters rated 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.060
 appearance color on cut smell taste and 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.510
 consistency and juiciness of all samples 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.070
 the least points were numbers 3 and 4 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:53.620
 95 evic doctor sausage 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:56.060
 claims for sample number three on 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.090
 she looks very nice 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.480
 when you try and feel it that is 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.489
 it seems to be missing 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.860
 Some naturalness I have 3 4 not 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.870
 on a par like bad 4 peasant even 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.700
 worse because the fight is salt 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.220
 honestly not tasty enough 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.670
 there is a taste is not pronounced to be honest here 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.320
 feeling meat 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.519
 if in number 3 for example it is slightly 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.620
 covered with spices 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.690
 then at number four there is not even this 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.170
 look the worst sample number three yes 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.750
 why is the only good thing about this 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.630
 sausage is the appearance of having tried 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.200
 sausages he immediately 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.370
 this is the first and the rigidity 2 is she very 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.740
 dry and roughly speaking no taste 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:47.440
 but the first 2 samples pleased 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:52.860
 and the quality and appearance is very nice 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.690
 taste in it is felt meat besides 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.980
 spices better myself was this 2 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.650
 he had everything like a standard 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.010
 if you look at the composition of sausage meat row 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.650
 and ratimir mostly and in addition 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.430
 phosphate monosodium glutamate stabilizers 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.070
 dangerous dyes 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.170
 list in a few lines but in 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.110
 losers third fourth samples 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.600
 All according to the guest turns out more chemistry 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.420
 the tastier according to experts 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.000
 there is nothing surprising 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.060
 today the quality of meat has changed radically 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.180
 from this is the basis and besides today 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.940
 we do not produce mass products 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.010
 cluttered up meat does not produce in 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.880
 animal feed farms in order 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:44.470
 so that the animals quickly scored slaughter 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.960
 weight and including muscle mass but 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.509
 of course 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.669
 accelerated power somewhere simulators have 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.500
 I use 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.729
 higher meats can replace those 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.800
 something cheaper 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.050
 thanks to modern technology 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.080
 grinding to taste and eye it 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.210
 it is impossible to determine how much it is 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.240
 You are on the cut sausage giving and 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.539
 pink color everything happens that 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.599
 man poured fly sodium and was distracted and 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.639
 thinks on the link poured if I pour the whole 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.590
 I poured sausage sausage will be gray 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.389
 tomorrow all laughed it if I poured 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.150
 the second time no one will notice and 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.910
 it happens I tell you I worked in 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.800
 the production of many years goes taste of meat 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.530
 provide barrier additives 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.410
 technology special shells without them 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.660
 and meat is not called meat and yes 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.150
 This sausage is stored for more than three days 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.990
 as before, but depending on the content 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.060
 even 2 months this year should 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.819
 take effect new technical regulations 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.740
 for meat and meat products and producers 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.960
 most likely have to go to 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.780
 chilled with raw materials but so far 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.400
 there is simply no industry 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.210
 manufacturers work on new 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.699
 requirements 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.490
 how it will affect the quality and price 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:02.900
 sausage or doctorate will disappear with 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.900
 counters show time
