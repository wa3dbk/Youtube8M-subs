of course professor the radar scanner

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.280 
of course professor the radar scanner
which<00:03:47.610> cost<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.000> hundred<00:03:48.209> million<00:03:48.780> dollars<00:03:49.110> to

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
which cost a hundred million dollars to

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.110 
which cost a hundred million dollars to
build<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.680> wrong<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.190> your<00:03:50.550> 10<00:03:50.880> dollar

build is wrong and your 10 dollar

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.020 
build is wrong and your 10 dollar
telescope<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.959> right<00:03:52.170> very<00:03:52.850> funny

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
telescope is right very funny

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.940 
telescope is right very funny

anything<00:04:56.930> sir<00:04:57.169> there's<00:04:57.500> no<00:04:57.680> planet<00:04:58.129> eclipsing

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
anything sir there's no planet eclipsing

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.760 
anything sir there's no planet eclipsing
the<00:04:58.639> Sun<00:04:58.759> but<00:04:59.479> I've<00:04:59.659> just<00:04:59.690> looked<00:05:00.319> out<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.620> the

the Sun but I've just looked out of the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.029 
the Sun but I've just looked out of the
window<00:05:01.159> I<00:05:01.370> can<00:05:01.639> see<00:05:01.879> it<00:05:04.780> no<00:05:05.780> did<00:05:06.169> it<00:05:06.199> that<00:05:06.680> thing

window I can see it no did it that thing
blocking<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.669> Sun<00:05:07.940> must<00:05:08.240> be<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.599> planet

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
blocking the Sun must be the planet

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:18.809 
blocking the Sun must be the planet
Marik<00:05:12.520> new<00:05:13.520> search<00:05:14.090> planet<00:05:14.719> Earth<00:05:14.960> oh<00:05:17.409> well

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
Marik new search planet Earth oh well

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.260 
Marik new search planet Earth oh well
what<00:05:19.819> do<00:05:19.940> you<00:05:20.030> see<00:05:20.330> now<00:05:20.770> commander<00:05:21.770> okay<00:05:22.699> okay

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
so there is a new planet but we can't

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.209 
so there is a new planet but we can't
pick<00:05:26.629> it<00:05:26.750> up<00:05:26.840> on<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.139> instruments<00:05:27.770> professor

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219 
pick it up on the instruments professor

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.520 
pick it up on the instruments professor
I<00:05:28.400> just<00:05:29.030> don't<00:05:29.930> get<00:05:30.259> it

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530
