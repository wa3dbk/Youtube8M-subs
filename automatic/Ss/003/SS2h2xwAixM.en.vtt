00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.150 
3000 in date and it's only about a week
since<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.300> looked<00:00:30.539> at<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> 2880<00:00:31.529> isn't<00:00:31.890> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
since I looked at the 2880 isn't it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.520 
since I looked at the 2880 isn't it
so<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.969> replacing<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.020> my<00:00:34.170> review

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
so is this replacing that is my review

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.350 
so is this replacing that is my review
now<00:00:34.559> old<00:00:34.920> perhaps<00:00:35.100> no<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.820> all<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
now old perhaps no not at all this is in

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.060 
now old perhaps no not at all this is in
addition<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.780> our<00:00:36.840> range<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.320> another<00:00:37.559> a3<00:00:37.950> plus

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
addition to our range so another a3 plus

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.459 
addition to our range so another a3 plus
printer<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> range<00:00:39.140> where<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.290> does

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
printer in the range where it does

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290 
printer in the range where it does
relate<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> 2880<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.850> we've<00:00:42.059> had

relate to the 2880 is we've had
designers<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.379> their<00:00:43.469> engineers<00:00:43.860> come<00:00:44.100> over

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
designers and their engineers come over

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.600 
designers and their engineers come over
to<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> UK<00:00:44.640> visit<00:00:45.480> owners<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.200> 28<00:00:46.530> 80s<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.190> see

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
to the UK visit owners of 28 80s and see

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.100 
to the UK visit owners of 28 80s and see
them<00:00:47.789> how<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.270> use<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> home<00:00:48.960> so

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
them how they use them in the home so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.450 
them how they use them in the home so
where<00:00:49.289> they're<00:00:49.469> positioned<00:00:49.590> how<00:00:50.250> they're

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
where they're positioned how they're

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
where they're positioned how they're
using<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> workflow<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.350> result

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
using what the workflow is as a result

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.740 
using what the workflow is as a result
of<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> feedback<00:00:53.640> from<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.270> lot

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
of that and the feedback from that a lot

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.819 
of that and the feedback from that a lot
of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> features<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.710> this

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
of the features that are now in this

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
of the features that are now in this
printer<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.760> come<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.180> research

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
printer have come from that research

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.200 
printer have come from that research
sounds<00:00:58.199> good<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:58.859> first<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.059> let's

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
sounds good so what first of all let's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.580 
sounds good so what first of all let's
just<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> quick<00:01:00.960> look<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> printer

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
just have a quick look at the printer

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.460 
just have a quick look at the printer
here<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.609> what<00:01:03.300> did<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:04.350> did

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
here it is so what did the what did

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.870 
here it is so what did the what did
these<00:01:04.589> engineers<00:01:05.010> discover<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.820> were

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
these engineers discover when they were

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.280 
these engineers discover when they were
to<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.180> people<00:01:06.570> were<00:01:06.600> using<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.110> think

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
to see what people were using I think

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.840 
to see what people were using I think
one<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> first<00:01:07.710> things<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.250> people

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
one of the first things was people

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.770 
one of the first things was people
talked<00:01:09.030> about<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> size<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> ink

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
talked about the size of the ink

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.060 
talked about the size of the ink
cartridges<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.470> what<00:01:10.590> we've<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:10.799> done

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
cartridges so what we've actually done

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.320 
cartridges so what we've actually done
with<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.119> increased<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:14.330> think

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
with this one is increased I think

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880 
with this one is increased I think
that's<00:01:15.570> huge<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.229> mean<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.680> massive

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that's huge I mean that's a massive

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.570 
that's huge I mean that's a massive
change<00:01:17.340> here's<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.979> because<00:01:19.979> they<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.369> did

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
change here's one because they it did

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.399 
change here's one because they it did
seem<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.240> were<00:01:21.360> forever<00:01:21.630> changing<00:01:22.229> one

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
seem like you were forever changing one

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.590 
seem like you were forever changing one
these<00:01:23.220> are<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.790> twenty<00:01:24.150> five<00:01:24.299> point<00:01:24.570> nine

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
these are now twenty five point nine

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
these are now twenty five point nine
milliliters<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.439> about<00:01:25.799> 2.3<00:01:26.430> times<00:01:26.670> bigger

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
milliliters so about 2.3 times bigger

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
milliliters so about 2.3 times bigger
than<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> ones<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> 2880<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.530> obviously

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
than the ones in the 2880 so obviously

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.240 
than the ones in the 2880 so obviously
ink<00:01:29.220> changed<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.729> far<00:01:29.909> less<00:01:30.060> frequent

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
ink changed to be far less frequent

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.510 
ink changed to be far less frequent
notice<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.670> nine<00:01:33.659> inks<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.229> board

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
notice that all nine inks are on board

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.249 
notice that all nine inks are on board
so<00:01:35.520> we've<00:01:35.670> got<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:40.250> switch<00:01:41.250> between<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.759> two

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
so we've got the switch between the two

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
so we've got the switch between the two
does<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.439> mean<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> things

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
does that mean because one of the things

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.149 
does that mean because one of the things
I<00:01:44.880> had<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> problem<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.920> change

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
I had a problem with is when you change

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.609 
I had a problem with is when you change
the<00:01:47.340> black<00:01:47.610> from<00:01:48.540> matte<00:01:48.960> black<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.320> photo

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the black from matte black to photo

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.139 
the black from matte black to photo
black<00:01:49.829> whatever<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.579> seemed<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:50.970> there<00:01:51.090> was

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
black whatever it seemed like there was

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.090 
black whatever it seemed like there was
a<00:01:51.210> little<00:01:51.360> delay<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> driver

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
a little delay but with the driver

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.700 
a little delay but with the driver
figuring<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.180> that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.399 

that<00:01:57.710> problem<00:01:58.009> on<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:59.390> paper<00:01:59.600> type<00:01:59.840> you<00:02:00.229> won't

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
that problem on the paper type you won't

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.200 
that problem on the paper type you won't
be<00:02:00.590> able<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:00.770> use<00:02:00.920> certain<00:02:01.100> paper<00:02:01.369> types<00:02:01.670> with

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
be able to use certain paper types with

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.490 
be able to use certain paper types with
certainly<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:02.899> what<00:02:03.079> will<00:02:03.170> actually<00:02:03.289> happen

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
certainly so what will actually happen

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.020 
certainly so what will actually happen
is<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:03.950> choose<00:02:04.159> your<00:02:04.340> paper<00:02:04.520> type<00:02:04.759> in<00:02:04.939> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
is you choose your paper type in the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.940 
is you choose your paper type in the
type<00:02:05.390> in<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.630> printer<00:02:05.899> driver<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.679> you<00:02:06.710> choose

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
type in the printer driver so you choose

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.740 
type in the printer driver so you choose
the<00:02:07.009> glossy<00:02:07.280> media<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.209> it<00:02:08.330> will<00:02:08.420> switch<00:02:08.599> to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
the glossy media and it will switch to

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.690 
the glossy media and it will switch to
photo<00:02:08.869> black<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.739> choose<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> map<00:02:10.129> media<00:02:10.489> it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
photo black and choose a map media it

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.490 
photo black and choose a map media it
will<00:02:10.849> go<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:10.970> matte<00:02:11.180> black<00:02:11.390> okay<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.349> that

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
will go to matte black okay so that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500 
will go to matte black okay so that
problem<00:02:13.069> is<00:02:13.160> no<00:02:13.340> longer<00:02:13.370> there<00:02:13.819> so<00:02:14.030> ensure

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
problem is no longer there so ensure

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.670 
problem is no longer there so ensure
that<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.810> get<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.080> writing<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.799> right<00:02:15.950> media

brilliant brilliant and I think all the
way<00:02:20.209> through<00:02:20.450> one<00:02:20.569> of<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.690> things<00:02:20.840> has<00:02:20.989> been

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
way through one of the things has been

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.289 
way through one of the things has been
about<00:02:21.319> usability<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.610> now<00:02:22.849> see<00:02:23.030> we've<00:02:23.150> got<00:02:23.269> a

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
about usability so now see we've got a

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.240 
about usability so now see we've got a
two<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.599> half<00:02:23.780> inch<00:02:23.989> screen<00:02:24.349> on<00:02:25.099> the

where<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.910> position<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.780> can<00:03:26.900> see<00:03:27.019> the

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
where to position it you can see the

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.349 
where to position it you can see the
arrow<00:03:27.290> on<00:03:27.500> here<00:03:27.769> isn't<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.700> mark<00:03:28.910> on<00:03:29.060> there<00:03:29.239> as

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
arrow on here isn't the mark on there as

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.490 
arrow on here isn't the mark on there as
well<00:03:29.389> so<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.630> know<00:03:29.780> exactly<00:03:30.049> where<00:03:30.319> to<00:03:30.349> position

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
well so I know exactly where to position

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.990 
well so I know exactly where to position
it<00:03:30.889> and<00:03:31.220> then<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.489> talks<00:03:31.609> me<00:03:31.819> all<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:31.940> way

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
it and then it talks me all the way

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.789 
it and then it talks me all the way
through<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.329> print<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.599> CD<00:03:32.900> put<00:03:33.319> in<00:03:33.440> so

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
through to print the CD put in so

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.710 
through to print the CD put in so
there's<00:03:34.010> now<00:03:34.220> none<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.489> this<00:03:34.730> having<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.569> get

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
there's now none of this having to get

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.319 
there's now none of this having to get

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
I mean watch clearance of the back for

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.880 
I mean watch clearance of the back for
that

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890

prints indeed I mean she got a black and
white<00:04:43.610> print<00:04:43.910> here<00:04:44.060> if<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.240> could<00:04:44.390> just<00:04:44.540> lean

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
white print here if I could just lean

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.030 
white print here if I could just lean
across<00:04:45.790> that<00:04:46.790> is<00:04:46.970> beautiful<00:04:47.740> prints<00:04:48.740> has<00:04:48.860> got

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
across that is beautiful prints has got

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.590 
across that is beautiful prints has got
what<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.340> would<00:04:49.460> expect<00:04:49.669> so<00:04:49.850> it<00:04:49.970> since<00:04:50.210> micro

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
what you would expect so it since micro

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.630 
what you would expect so it since micro
piezo<00:04:50.960> printhead<00:04:51.440> technology<00:04:52.100> we've

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
piezo printhead technology we've

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.970 
piezo printhead technology we've
actually<00:04:52.790> now<00:04:53.120> reduced<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.630> droplet<00:04:54.050> size<00:04:54.080> to

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
actually now reduced the droplet size to

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.740 
actually now reduced the droplet size to
to<00:04:55.160> pickle<00:04:55.490> eaters<00:04:55.790> so<00:04:55.940> you're<00:04:56.090> getting<00:04:56.419> even

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
to pickle eaters so you're getting even

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.659 
to pickle eaters so you're getting even
finer<00:04:57.080> detail<00:04:57.950> in<00:04:58.100> your<00:04:58.130> prints

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
finer detail in your prints

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.240 
finer detail in your prints
so<00:04:58.820> even<00:04:59.330> smaller<00:04:59.720> drops<00:05:00.050> right<00:05:00.830> does<00:05:01.190> that

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
so even smaller drops right does that

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.800 
so even smaller drops right does that
mean<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.550> resolutions<00:05:02.090> gone<00:05:02.270> up<00:05:02.390> or<00:05:02.570> is<00:05:02.660> that

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
mean the resolutions gone up or is that

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.630 
mean the resolutions gone up or is that
just<00:05:03.020> mean<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.320> printers<00:05:03.650> got<00:05:03.830> more<00:05:04.070> fine

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
just mean the printers got more fine

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.180 
just mean the printers got more fine
control<00:05:04.880> its<00:05:05.450> finer<00:05:05.960> control<00:05:06.260> right<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:06.979> say

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
control its finer control right I say

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:14.140 
control its finer control right I say
