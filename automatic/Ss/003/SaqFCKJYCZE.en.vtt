00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.780
 The trainer likes to work with Mondays in this example, provide light and light 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.550
 Shadow against a gray background is that final assembly realistic 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.550
 acts 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.130
 the photo will be missing here 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 like that the perfect basis for a montage 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.509
 in all my pictures Bush a different background inserts 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.980
 or some other protein, make the original photo into something like this 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.710
 image 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.510
 which you are currently watching I pay attention to a few important things 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.060
 For one thing, the shadows in the picture are those shadows that appear here on the picture 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.300
 See ground 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.360
 if later taken into the assembly and that's the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.370
 Final image of the Compo are realistic because I'm five 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.610
 Dead work how will photography become 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.380
 cuddly background on it but later more in another case 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.020
 another important point is expression of the model or posing 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.460
 already at the shooting experimental animal to explain models like the finished picture 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.060
 To look later has the model can move into it 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.420
 and can choose the right process or the right expression 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.440
 dull 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.860
 but it does not always have to be an assembly as you will see this picture too 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070
 without you another 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
 or in the reason brings into play 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.150
 who knows my pictures will surely have noticed 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.750
 that is also sometimes an assembly and create these montages the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.280
 do not create submerged condition 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.960
 revealed under this light 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.450
 On the one hand, it is important that we have one 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.299
 use gray background as we have it here 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.230
 we have a main light 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.920
 of which there has fallen on the model 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.850
 and we have an effect light a grazing light 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.410
 topless 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.350
 Here's another culture generation to separate the model from the background 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.030
 furthermore we have in this on the box 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.590
 another one at use 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.470
 with it the background 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.730
 get less light that means we have not set up here 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.859
 the side 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.469
 and we also had one in my day 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:20.569
 reflectors 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.189
 these reflectors 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.809
 Incidentally, the old one is set more strongly about every half stop 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.439
 b the main course 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.189
 the exact setting the barrier of course you can not say for sure 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.540
 since it has to be in half an aperture more 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.670
 because it depends on what my hair color has the model 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.179
 What kind of outfit does the model have? 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:45.800
 how big and how far is the distance from this blade to the model 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.339
 that varies 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.800
 is important in my illumination and for this photo-montage yet 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.769
 that managed to emerge in the picture 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.120
 because these states are later incorporated into the assembly 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.539
 and this creates the realistic one 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.980
 furthermore, I still pay attention to it 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.149
 that the model does not look into the camera 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:10.069
 Corinna looks very briefly into this camera and when he arrives at the 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.940
 consider 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.049
 a person looks into the camera 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.740
 Dorner SCD put out the post very quickly 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.179
 and for me personally is important 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.459
 that look the model in a different direction 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.090
 and just to pray a scenario 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.720
 and how much money they put into action 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.939
 that she does not look put 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.189
 on the golf course Mettmann the greens do not go to look this 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.749
 that also gets the face of the city 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:43.060
 and found great ago then you can be flexible too 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.980
 it should not be asked if a shadow falls a bit unfavorable 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.699
 then that is not bad 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.109
 the lawyer so was the lighting situation on site 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.529
 let's leave here in the distance is probably light has come 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.529
 and that can not be changed by originals 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.359
 Corinna at the light 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.299
 Trying to move like that Little enough but definitely not amazed 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.869
 my camera so this is a scenario and there is very important that you 

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:20.120
 not in the camera Reinsch looks outside the solar process we want to eat it 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.749
 Keep neutral so light can be on this head even in animals 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.930
 dpa 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.030
 1 has 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:37.719
 So far is now I want there even if the Countryman at Bremer with 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:39.620
 in the marriage also the box 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.620
 a little bit on the background 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.879
 b 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.279
 Ing if I go back but Corinna DuMont Schauberg so loud wish list 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.820
 rotates 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.830
 Run down the slope 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.309
 We have repented the stock markets 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.590
 that's how it is 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.590
 that stays like that 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.039
 Krupp sums up percent and just drop by 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.090
 now is in the camera and allowed
