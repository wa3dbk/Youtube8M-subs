00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:04.290
 daytime running lights both are a natural way to increase 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.329
 visibility of your car and improve the safety of 

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:09.839
 drivers like pedestrians 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.449
 from february 2011 the face of systems dr she will be rendered 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
 mandatory on new models by a European directive 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.460
 pioneering systems help and cranberries for philippe cars 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.899
 now offers approved lighting solutions in compliance with standards 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.390
 European it is suitable for most European models 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.479
 these lights are installed only an hour and a half on average 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.859
 we took for this demonstration a European model 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:35.859
 popular with the audi a3 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.170
 the lamp type contains a user manual and two modules dr 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.390
 lmp 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.960
 two fixing brackets 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.170
 an electronic control box the gameplay and a pressure connector 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.770
 as well as mounting accessories 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.880
 you have to first decide you want you to place the lamps 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.260
 start measuring the car to verify that the mounting position 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.630
 obey the European regulations 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.700
 you will find a diagram containing these details in the manual 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.700
 of instruction be especially two days point fr 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.470
 for some cars it may be necessary to remove the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.050
 lower grille to mount the calipers 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.170
 To do this you may need cereals body panels 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.270
 remove the grille mark the position of the caliper and use a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.960
 drill and a jigsaw to drill a hole so that they can 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.400
 be well secured 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.070
 then put the grille back on the car while finding the angle 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.620
 optimal for sorting them which must be at 10 degrees maximum from the direction 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.320
 facing the car 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.320
 again removed the grille so that the sorting is properly fixed 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.990
 for some cars like the Alfa Romeo 159 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.380
 just fix the moors directly on the panel of 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.229
 body 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.979
 Once you are assured that the English lamp is at 10 degrees 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.799
 maximum of the direction facing the car 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.369
 mark the holes on the stirrup 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.369
 and loses its software so that they are in place 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.699
 to connect the unit choose a place to place the housing of 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:27.569
 fixed control 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.930
 find a stable location near the battery but not too close to a 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.549
 heat source 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.039
 to fix it right away 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.639
 then lift the battery cover 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.819
 it is strongly advised to remove the negative cable from the battery before 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.339
 start with girls 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.879
 start with paul been the red thread at the positive pole in ten years solidly 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.319
 connect the black film to the negative pole in the same way 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.260
 to finish connecting the nets 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.419
 done is first passed by the stirrups on the calenders 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.419
 placed around the body on both sides of the vehicle 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.919
 to keep them and avoid the surfaces features 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.169
 the deaf heat and the moving parts 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.739
 put the grille on the front of the car but did not fix the modules 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.749
 drl on stirrups 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.749
 this will be the last step 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.179
 find the location of the position light circuit by disbursing 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:33.419
 of the assembly of the front lights 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.539
 then identify the right wire using a tester 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.539
 automatic 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.659
 you can also use the fixed control box that 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.659
 will indicate the right thread through a bright bible light 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:50.539
 do not forget to turn off the position lights 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.909
 attached the pressure connector over the position light and make sure 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.909
 that it is securely fixed 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.419
 be sure to secure the fixed control box 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.569
 to replace the battery cover 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.569
 and connect the two drl modules 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.849
 you can now test the lamps by starting the engine 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.940
 after making sure everything is working well you can set the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.490
 drl modules 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.889
 to finish tie the remaining wires with provided cords and tighten the 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.889
 body panels loosen if necessary 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.550
 your new lamps are now installed 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.249
 you can now drive with visibility and increased safety 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.099
 you can admire the new look of your car 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.279
