00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
started to happen right and so they're

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.940 
started to happen right and so they're
going<00:02:18.150> oh<00:02:18.390> man<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:18.990> we're<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.620> glad<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
going oh man that is we're so glad the

rain<00:02:20.040> happen<00:02:20.430> they<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.170> rain

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
rain happen they know that the rain

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.670 
rain happen they know that the rain
dance<00:02:22.620> had<00:02:22.830> nothing<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.400> do<00:02:23.550> with<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.300> ring

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
dance had nothing to do with the ring

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.640 
dance had nothing to do with the ring
right<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.160> that's<00:02:26.460> what<00:02:26.610> they<00:02:27.060> thought<00:02:27.650> they

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
right but that's what they thought they

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.460 
right but that's what they thought they
thought<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.160> they<00:02:29.340> do<00:02:29.580> some<00:02:29.790> engineering<00:02:30.470> that

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
thought if they do some engineering that

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.200 
thought if they do some engineering that
you<00:02:31.980> know<00:02:32.070> eventually<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:32.850> ring<00:02:33.060> that's

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
you know eventually if this ring that's

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.480 
you know eventually if this ring that's
in<00:02:33.360> work<00:02:33.570> get<00:02:33.780> another<00:02:34.020> stick<00:02:34.320> it's<00:02:35.220> going<00:02:35.430> to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
in work get another stick it's going to

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.220 
in work get another stick it's going to
work<00:02:35.610> better<00:02:35.790> if<00:02:36.240> you<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.420> knew<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> physics

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
work better if you just knew the physics

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.680 
work better if you just knew the physics
behind<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:38.000> they<00:02:39.000> don't<00:02:39.180> really<00:02:39.420> need<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.600> do

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
behind it they don't really need to do

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.030 
behind it they don't really need to do
the<00:02:39.810> rain<00:02:39.930> dance<00:02:40.140> anymore<00:02:40.380> they<00:02:40.650> didn't<00:02:40.890> have

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
to do it a special way does that make

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.960 
to do it a special way does that make
sense<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:42.960> far<00:02:43.520> okay<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:44.580> what<00:02:44.760> does<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:44.940> have

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
sense so far okay so what does it have

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.970 
sense so far okay so what does it have
to<00:02:45.060> do<00:02:45.180> with<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.360> guys<00:02:45.540> cuz<00:02:46.500> none<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.770> you<00:02:46.860> guys

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
thing thinking that it's going to change

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.210 
thing thinking that it's going to change
the<00:03:08.430> events<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.180> outside<00:03:09.540> world<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:11.010> just

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
the events on the outside world it just

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.800 
the events on the outside world it just
doesn't<00:03:11.340> work<00:03:11.520> that<00:03:11.580> way<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.630> funny

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
doesn't work that way and the funny

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.440 
doesn't work that way and the funny
thing<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.050> like<00:03:13.730> they<00:03:14.730> do<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.060> over<00:03:15.300> there

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
thing is like they do that over there

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.500 
thing is like they do that over there
and<00:03:15.750> we<00:03:16.530> look<00:03:16.710> at<00:03:16.830> them<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.070> laugh<00:03:17.100> but<00:03:17.510> when

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
bit differently because now you guys are

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.560 
bit differently because now you guys are
going<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.640> start<00:03:23.820> seeing<00:03:24.030> people's<00:03:24.360> rain

you this stuff i can tell you all here

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.790 
you this stuff i can tell you all here
are<00:03:32.130> six<00:03:32.460> simple<00:03:32.700> steps<00:03:32.850> three<00:03:33.840> steps<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.290> how

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
are six simple steps three steps to how

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.530 
are six simple steps three steps to how
to<00:03:34.860> have<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.130> more<00:03:35.370> successful<00:03:35.640> but<00:03:36.030> i<00:03:36.180> can<00:03:36.330> give

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
to have a more successful but i can give

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.380 
to have a more successful but i can give
you<00:03:36.570> more<00:03:36.720> engineering<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:38.490> problem<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.150> if

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
you more engineering the problem is if

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.940 
you more engineering the problem is if
you're<00:03:39.540> thinking<00:03:39.780> about<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.410> engineering

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
you're thinking about that engineering

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.980 
you're thinking about that engineering
is<00:03:41.130> off<00:03:41.310> its<00:03:42.030> going<00:03:42.240> to<00:03:42.330> screw<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> whole

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
is off its going to screw the whole

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.100 
is off its going to screw the whole
thing<00:03:43.050> up<00:03:43.260> anyway<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.790> again<00:03:45.270> this<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.660> not<00:03:45.690> a

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
thing up anyway so again this is not a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.740 
thing up anyway so again this is not a
knowledge<00:03:46.770> base<00:03:47.010> thing<00:03:47.390> not<00:03:48.390> trying<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.660> give

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
knowledge base thing not trying to give

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.730 
knowledge base thing not trying to give
you<00:03:48.780> guys<00:03:48.960> knowledge<00:03:49.260> i'm<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.530> giving<00:03:49.680> you

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
you guys knowledge i'm just giving you

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.950 
you guys knowledge i'm just giving you
guys<00:03:49.830> some<00:03:49.860> insights<00:03:50.640> that's<00:03:51.630> going<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.870> make

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
guys some insights that's going to make

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.140 
guys some insights that's going to make
you<00:03:52.110> knowledge<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.620> lot<00:03:52.830> better<00:03:53.160> that's<00:03:54.030> going

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
you knowledge a lot better that's going

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.310 
you knowledge a lot better that's going
to<00:03:54.240> give<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.420> guys<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.660> understanding<00:03:55.260> of

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
to give you guys the understanding of

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.800 
to give you guys the understanding of
whatever<00:03:55.710> you<00:03:55.950> guys<00:03:56.070> decide<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.550> do<00:03:56.820> whatever

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
whatever you guys decide to do whatever

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.180 
whatever you guys decide to do whatever
business<00:03:58.140> you're<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.560> whatever<00:03:58.800> relationship

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
business you're in whatever relationship

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.460 
business you're in whatever relationship
you're<00:03:59.700> in<00:03:59.810> it's<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:01.020> going<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.170> make<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.410> a

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
you're in it's just going to make it a

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.220 
you're in it's just going to make it a
little<00:04:01.680> bit<00:04:01.860> easier<00:04:02.720> when<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.810> guys<00:04:03.900> don't<00:04:04.080> do

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
little bit easier when you guys don't do

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.650 
little bit easier when you guys don't do
the<00:04:04.320> rain<00:04:04.440> dance
