Twitter goes I want to try to get
150,000<00:01:30.160> followers<00:01:30.280> I<00:01:30.670> think<00:01:30.910> but<00:01:31.690> that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
150,000 followers I think but that

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.770 
150,000 followers I think but that
should<00:01:32.110> be<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.229> reasonable<00:01:32.530> goal<00:01:32.800> and<00:01:33.790> I<00:01:34.570> mean

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
should be a reasonable goal and I mean

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.330 
should be a reasonable goal and I mean
of<00:01:35.050> course<00:01:35.320> not<00:01:35.560> get<00:01:35.770> kicked<00:01:35.950> from<00:01:36.070> faze

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
of course not get kicked from faze

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.889 
of course not get kicked from faze
that's<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:37.000> given

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
that's a given

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.950 
that's a given
I<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:39.729> you<00:01:39.910> really<00:01:40.210> don't<00:01:40.450> know<00:01:40.570> what<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.750> do

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
I also you really don't know what to do

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.630 
I also you really don't know what to do
with<00:01:41.200> these<00:01:41.320> calm<00:01:41.770> things<00:01:42.040> because<00:01:42.430> I<00:01:42.460> either

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
with these calm things because I either

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.630 
with these calm things because I either
make<00:01:42.880> them<00:01:43.090> really<00:01:43.630> awful<00:01:44.110> or<00:01:44.470> really<00:01:44.979> long<00:01:45.190> or

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
make them really awful or really long or

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.940 
make them really awful or really long or
really<00:01:46.149> long<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.540> really<00:01:46.570> awful<00:01:47.020> so<00:01:47.259> that's

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
really long and really awful so that's

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.130 
really long and really awful so that's
another<00:01:48.190> goal<00:01:48.430> I<00:01:48.460> kind<00:01:48.789> of<00:01:48.910> have<00:01:49.060> for<00:01:49.390> the

another goal I kind of have for the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.740 
another goal I kind of have for the
short<00:01:50.470> time<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.950> come<00:01:51.160> is<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.479> kind<00:01:52.630> of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
short time to come is just to kind of

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.570 
short time to come is just to kind of
get<00:01:52.840> better<00:01:53.080> at<00:01:53.289> uploads<00:01:53.860> in<00:01:54.010> general<00:01:54.369> because

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
get better at uploads in general because

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.430 
get better at uploads in general because
I<00:01:54.820> mean<00:01:55.150> I'm<00:01:55.240> gonna<00:01:55.420> making<00:01:55.630> date<00:01:55.900> odds<00:01:56.140> and

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.870 
I mean I'm gonna making date odds and
stuff<00:01:56.650> but<00:01:56.830> I<00:01:56.890> know<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.280> can't<00:01:57.520> make<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.700> day

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
stuff but I know that I can't make a day

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.100 
stuff but I know that I can't make a day
Tod<00:01:58.119> every<00:01:58.450> day<00:01:58.600> because<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.930> would<00:01:59.049> have

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
Tod every day because I would have

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.930 
Tod every day because I would have
revealed<00:01:59.290> all<00:01:59.500> my<00:01:59.650> clips<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.159> I<00:02:00.310> couldn't<00:02:00.640> do

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
revealed all my clips and I couldn't do

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.300 
revealed all my clips and I couldn't do
it<00:02:01.090> every<00:02:01.270> day<00:02:01.299> like<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.320> only<00:02:02.500> make<00:02:02.710> day<00:02:02.860> Taj's

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
it every day like I only make day Taj's

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.080 
it every day like I only make day Taj's
when<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.520> hit<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.790> lot<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.060> clips<00:02:04.390> in<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.200> day<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.770> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
when I hit a lot of clips in a day so I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.219 
when I hit a lot of clips in a day so I
have<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.180> get<00:02:07.330> better<00:02:07.450> at<00:02:07.570> doing<00:02:07.689> stuff<00:02:08.140> like

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
have to get better at doing stuff like

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.169 
have to get better at doing stuff like
this<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.830> I'll<00:02:09.040> probably<00:02:09.250> not<00:02:09.519> do<00:02:09.729> cut<00:02:09.940> coms

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.449 
this and I'll probably not do cut coms
all<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> times<00:02:10.690> I'll<00:02:10.989> probably<00:02:11.230> still<00:02:11.530> do<00:02:12.430> a

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
all the times I'll probably still do a

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.130 
all the times I'll probably still do a
lot<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.760> commentaries<00:02:13.480> whenever<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.840> get<00:02:14.110> a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
lot of commentaries whenever I get a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.250 
lot of commentaries whenever I get a
game<00:02:14.350> play<00:02:14.620> or<00:02:14.650> whatever<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.150> yeah<00:02:16.570> like<00:02:17.170> I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
game play or whatever so yeah like I

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.449 
game play or whatever so yeah like I
don't<00:02:17.320> really<00:02:17.590> think<00:02:17.650> cut<00:02:18.010> comms<00:02:18.220> are<00:02:18.370> gonna

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
entertaining cut comms are when they

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.780 
entertaining cut comms are when they
have<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> bunch<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.200> like<00:02:23.380> clips<00:02:23.709> in<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.430> you
