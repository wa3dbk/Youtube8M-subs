00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.440 
particular it's difficult for me to be
okay<00:03:36.600> with<00:03:36.870> because<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.950> reinforces<00:03:38.579> so<00:03:39.060> many

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
okay with because it reinforces so many

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.170 
okay with because it reinforces so many
things

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
things

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.099 
things
I<00:03:40.409> think<00:03:41.409> are<00:03:41.500> actually<00:03:41.829> kind<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.640> scary<00:03:43.180> of

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
I think are actually kind of scary of

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.449 
I think are actually kind of scary of
course<00:03:44.200> I'm<00:03:44.500> not<00:03:44.620> trying<00:03:44.859> to<00:03:44.950> say<00:03:45.099> that<00:03:45.129> girls

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
course I'm not trying to say that girls

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.339 
course I'm not trying to say that girls
like<00:03:45.760> bad<00:03:46.030> boys<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.480> their<00:03:46.629> life<00:03:46.780> because<00:03:47.140> of

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
like bad boys in their life because of

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.550 
like bad boys in their life because of
literature<00:03:47.859> it's<00:03:48.219> all<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.760> books<00:03:49.030> oh<00:03:49.439> but<00:03:50.439> if

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
literature it's all the books oh but if

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.289 
literature it's all the books oh but if
we're<00:03:50.709> constantly<00:03:50.980> having<00:03:51.459> these<00:03:51.909> types<00:03:52.150> of

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
we're constantly having these types of

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.390 
we're constantly having these types of
people<00:03:52.629> presented<00:03:53.469> to<00:03:53.650> us<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:54.099> we're

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
people presented to us and we're

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.280 
people presented to us and we're
expected<00:03:54.819> to<00:03:54.939> like<00:03:55.120> them<00:03:55.329> it's<00:03:55.810> kind<00:03:56.019> of<00:03:56.049> hard

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
expected to like them it's kind of hard

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.339 
expected to like them it's kind of hard
not<00:03:56.439> to<00:03:56.650> actually<00:03:57.219> like<00:03:58.030> them<00:03:58.450> even<00:03:59.109> though<00:03:59.200> we

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
not to actually like them even though we

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.990 
not to actually like them even though we
shouldn't<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.980> knowing<00:04:00.430> we<00:04:00.549> shouldn't<00:04:00.849> is

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
shouldn't and knowing we shouldn't is

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.420 
shouldn't and knowing we shouldn't is
not<00:04:01.480> usually<00:04:02.230> enough<00:04:02.590> incentive<00:04:03.069> to<00:04:03.250> actually

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
not usually enough incentive to actually

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.490 
not usually enough incentive to actually
stop<00:04:03.879> doing<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.359> I<00:04:04.540> know<00:04:04.719> this<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.319> also

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
stop doing it I know this is also

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.979 
stop doing it I know this is also
reversible<00:04:05.829> so<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:06.790> know<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.329> know<00:04:07.599> plenty<00:04:07.900> of

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
reversible so you know I know plenty of

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.110 
reversible so you know I know plenty of
weird<00:04:08.290> girls<00:04:08.590> too<00:04:08.920> but<00:04:09.219> in<00:04:09.370> literature<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.819> find

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
weird girls too but in literature I find

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.849 
weird girls too but in literature I find
it's<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.299> lot<00:04:10.420> more<00:04:10.569> common<00:04:10.840> with<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.379> guy

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
it's a lot more common with the guy

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.610 
it's a lot more common with the guy
whether<00:04:12.730> or<00:04:12.909> not<00:04:13.030> you<00:04:13.299> like<00:04:13.599> the<00:04:13.930> rude<00:04:14.139> guy<00:04:14.379> in

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
whether or not you like the rude guy in

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.020 
whether or not you like the rude guy in
literature<00:04:15.069> or<00:04:15.099> whether<00:04:15.489> you<00:04:15.669> think<00:04:15.849> it's

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
literature or whether you think it's

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.339 
literature or whether you think it's
dangerous<00:04:16.269> or<00:04:16.660> whether<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.959> just<00:04:17.109> think<00:04:17.289> I'm

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
dangerous or whether you just think I'm

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.050 
dangerous or whether you just think I'm
overthinking<00:04:17.709> this<00:04:18.130> everybody<00:04:18.759> has<00:04:18.880> their

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
overthinking this everybody has their

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.699 
overthinking this everybody has their
own<00:04:19.090> opinions<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:19.570> would<00:04:19.780> love<00:04:20.019> to<00:04:20.229> be<00:04:20.349> bored

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
own opinions I would love to be bored

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.110 
own opinions I would love to be bored
I<00:04:20.829> think<00:04:21.130> discussions<00:04:21.549> are<00:04:21.669> probably<00:04:22.000> the

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
I think discussions are probably the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.400 
I think discussions are probably the
best<00:04:22.300> thing<00:04:22.449> in<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.630> world<00:04:22.690> if<00:04:23.229> you<00:04:23.289> don't

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
best thing in the world if you don't

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.170 
best thing in the world if you don't
discuss<00:04:23.830> things<00:04:24.039> you<00:04:24.220> never<00:04:24.340> aware<00:04:24.789> of<00:04:24.940> things

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
discuss things you never aware of things

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.450 
discuss things you never aware of things
maybe<00:04:25.630> you've<00:04:25.870> read<00:04:26.139> so<00:04:26.500> many<00:04:26.650> books<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.280> I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
maybe you've read so many books and I

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.860 
maybe you've read so many books and I
have<00:04:27.490> group<00:04:27.820> guys<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.300> you've<00:04:28.389> never<00:04:28.599> really

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
have group guys and you've never really

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.100 
have group guys and you've never really
thought<00:04:29.050> about<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.370> maybe<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.729> have<00:04:31.240> made<00:04:31.930> you

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
thought about that maybe I have made you

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.650 
thought about that maybe I have made you
aware<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:32.800> something<00:04:35.699> or<00:04:36.699> maybe<00:04:36.849> you<00:04:37.419> feel

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
aware of something or maybe you feel

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.659 
aware of something or maybe you feel
exactly<00:04:37.990> like<00:04:38.199> I<00:04:38.440> do<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:39.009> have<00:04:39.550> spent

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
exactly like I do and you have spent

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.790 
exactly like I do and you have spent
years<00:04:40.090> thinking<00:04:40.570> this<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.139> listening<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.650> me

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
years thinking this and listening to me

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.710 
years thinking this and listening to me
talk<00:04:41.830> about<00:04:42.009> this<00:04:42.430> has<00:04:42.789> reinforced<00:04:43.599> that

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
talk about this has reinforced that

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.659 
talk about this has reinforced that
confirming<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.650> when<00:04:45.099> you<00:04:45.220> thought<00:04:45.490> maybe

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
confirming you it when you thought maybe

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.730 
confirming you it when you thought maybe
you<00:04:45.849> got<00:04:45.940> your<00:04:46.090> crazy<00:04:46.419> singing<00:04:46.990> now<00:04:47.440> you<00:04:47.500> know

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
you're not actually probably more likely
