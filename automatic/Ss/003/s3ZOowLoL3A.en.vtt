they're pretty small now there i'm
thinking<00:00:30.510> i<00:00:30.599> think<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> 12<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:33.620> when<00:00:34.620> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
thinking i think this is a 12 and when I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.979 
thinking i think this is a 12 and when I
took<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:34.920> tears<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> my<00:00:35.790> plugs<00:00:36.210> out<00:00:36.390> they

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
took my tears it my plugs out they

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.229 
took my tears it my plugs out they
closed<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.700> didn't<00:00:38.879> close<00:00:39.000> up

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.850 
closed up but they didn't close up
completely<00:00:39.660> or<00:00:39.930> euan<00:00:40.170> kerr<00:00:40.320> regular<00:00:40.680> area

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
completely or euan kerr regular area

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.240 
completely or euan kerr regular area
size<00:00:41.300> based<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.870> i'm<00:00:43.200> guessing<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> 14

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
size based in i'm guessing like a 14

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.619 
size based in i'm guessing like a 14
because<00:00:44.700> when<00:00:45.030> i<00:00:45.059> put<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> tapers<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.930> 212

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
because when i put the tapers in 212

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.010 
because when i put the tapers in 212
they<00:00:48.629> hurt<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> little<00:00:50.160> sore<00:00:50.870> but<00:00:51.870> they
