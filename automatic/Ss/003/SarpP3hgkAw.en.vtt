00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
hear in videos I suspect that a lot of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.330 
hear in videos I suspect that a lot of
guys<00:00:46.170> don't<00:00:46.200> even<00:00:46.500> watch<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.980> full<00:00:47.160> video

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340

some<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.329> guys<00:00:48.480> probably<00:00:49.170> listen<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.680> you

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
some of you guys probably listen to you

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.100 
some of you guys probably listen to you
know<00:00:50.039> maybe<00:00:50.730> five<00:00:51.000> minutes<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.449> video<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
know maybe five minutes of video and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.270 
know maybe five minutes of video and
then<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> cut<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.559> off<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.010> sidetracked

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
then you cut it off you get sidetracked

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580 
then you cut it off you get sidetracked
doing<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.850> things<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> listen<00:00:55.410> to

right the I believe that Canelo Alvarez
has<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> chance<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.530> Floyd<00:01:13.950> Mayweather<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.670> do

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
has a chance to be Floyd Mayweather I do

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.050

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
believe that he has a chance ok he has a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.710 
believe that he has a chance ok he has a
puncher's<00:01:18.509> chance<00:01:20.240> when<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.360> take<00:01:21.570> into

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
puncher's chance when you take into

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.249 
puncher's chance when you take into
consideration<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:23.180> Floyd<00:01:24.180> Mayweather<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.840> is

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
consideration that Floyd Mayweather a is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.109 
consideration that Floyd Mayweather a is
36<00:01:25.830> years<00:01:26.040> old<00:01:26.750> be<00:01:28.220> he<00:01:29.220> does<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.670> look<00:01:29.909> like

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
the same fighter when he fights at 154

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.710 
the same fighter when he fights at 154
ok<00:01:35.689> whenever<00:01:36.689> he<00:01:36.780> finds<00:01:37.140> /<00:01:37.650> 147<00:01:38.490> pounds<00:01:38.759> he

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
don't know if that's because the add a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539

few pounds slow him down I don't know if

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.580 
few pounds slow him down I don't know if
it's<00:01:47.729> because<00:01:47.850> his<00:01:48.630> opponents<00:01:49.200> hit<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> little

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it's because his opponents hit a little

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.609 
it's because his opponents hit a little
harder<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.159> don't<00:01:50.700> know<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.970> exactly<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
harder I don't know what exactly it is

believe<00:02:03.030> Cano<00:02:03.390> has<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> chance<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.790> next

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
believe Cano has a chance the next

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.830 
believe Cano has a chance the next
reason<00:02:06.390> why<00:02:07.280> Canelo's<00:02:08.280> young<00:02:08.599> ok<00:02:09.599> he's

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
reason why Canelo's young ok he's

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.830 
reason why Canelo's young ok he's
inexperienced<00:02:10.520> but<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.849> believe

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
inexperienced but I believe

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.930 
inexperienced but I believe
the<00:02:12.989> Canelo<00:02:13.349> thinks<00:02:13.800> he<00:02:13.920> can<00:02:14.099> be<00:02:14.250> fluid<00:02:14.670> I

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
the Canelo thinks he can be fluid I

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.150 
the Canelo thinks he can be fluid I
think<00:02:15.540> it's<00:02:15.690> really<00:02:15.900> confident<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.980> he<00:02:17.069> can

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
think it's really confident that he can

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.280 
think it's really confident that he can
bleep<00:02:17.340> beat<00:02:17.610> Floyd<00:02:17.879> Mayweather<00:02:18.379> all<00:02:19.379> right<00:02:19.760> I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
bleep beat Floyd Mayweather all right I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.540 
bleep beat Floyd Mayweather all right I
contrary<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.319> popular<00:02:22.410> belief<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:23.190> believe

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
contrary to popular belief I believe

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.059 
contrary to popular belief I believe
full<00:02:23.790> uh<00:02:23.819> Canelo<00:02:24.780> actually<00:02:25.200> does<00:02:25.410> hit<00:02:25.650> hard<00:02:25.890> I

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
full uh Canelo actually does hit hard I

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.790 
full uh Canelo actually does hit hard I
think<00:02:26.340> he<00:02:26.430> does<00:02:26.580> hit<00:02:26.790> hard<00:02:27.050> okay<00:02:28.050> he

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
think he does hit hard okay he

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.259 
think he does hit hard okay he
definitely<00:02:29.010> hits<00:02:29.400> harder<00:02:29.730> than<00:02:29.760> Robert

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
definitely hits harder than Robert

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.140 
definitely hits harder than Robert
Guerrero<00:02:31.069> okay<00:02:32.069> he<00:02:32.340> definitely<00:02:32.519> hit<00:02:32.849> harder

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
Guerrero okay he definitely hit harder

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.509 
Guerrero okay he definitely hit harder
than<00:02:33.180> Floyd<00:02:33.480> Mayweather<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.629> that

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
than Floyd Mayweather so I think that

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.039 
than Floyd Mayweather so I think that
Canelo<00:02:38.519> does<00:02:38.819> have<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> puncher's<00:02:39.450> chance<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
Canelo does have a puncher's chance to

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.380 
Canelo does have a puncher's chance to
be<00:02:40.200> fluid<00:02:40.580> also<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.879> a<00:02:41.910> kid<00:02:42.180> that's
