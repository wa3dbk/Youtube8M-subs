that<00:03:59.290> the<00:04:00.120> source<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.390> very<00:04:01.510> hot<00:04:02.310> because<00:04:03.310> it's

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
that the source is very hot because it's

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.100 
that the source is very hot because it's
going<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.030> take<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.239> while<00:04:04.480> for<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.750> heat<00:04:04.959> to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
going to take a while for the heat to

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.640 
going to take a while for the heat to
get<00:04:05.230> through<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.890> penetrate<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.610> lid<00:04:06.820> but<00:04:07.660> at

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
get through to penetrate the lid but at

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.280 
get through to penetrate the lid but at
the<00:04:08.890> moment<00:04:09.070> it's<00:04:09.340> looking<00:04:09.840> pretty<00:04:10.840> handsome

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
the moment it's looking pretty handsome

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.810 
the moment it's looking pretty handsome
so<00:04:11.769> we'll<00:04:12.730> just<00:04:12.910> put<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.239> lid<00:04:13.360> on<00:04:13.390> top<00:04:13.780> and

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
so we'll just put the lid on top and

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.130 
so we'll just put the lid on top and
we're<00:04:15.820> gonna<00:04:15.970> place<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.720> oven<00:04:16.989> the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
we're gonna place it in the oven the

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.830 
we're gonna place it in the oven the
ovens<00:04:17.410> at<00:04:17.530> around<00:04:17.739> 170<00:04:18.580> degrees<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.510> that's

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
ovens at around 170 degrees and that's

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.479 
ovens at around 170 degrees and that's
going<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.019> take<00:04:20.230> at<00:04:20.410> least<00:04:20.590> 20<00:04:21.040> minutes<00:04:21.070> it

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
going to take at least 20 minutes it

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.400 
going to take at least 20 minutes it
might<00:04:21.669> take<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:21.940> little<00:04:22.150> longer<00:04:22.390> now<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.080> think

might take a little longer now I think

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.060 
might take a little longer now I think
it's<00:04:23.530> time<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.800> take<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.310> tagine<00:04:24.760> ow
