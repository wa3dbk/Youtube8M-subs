00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and whoa came out real fast that's

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.560 
and whoa came out real fast that's
really<00:03:10.200> quick<00:03:10.680> setup<00:03:10.920> here's<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.820> flash<00:03:12.150> it's

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
really quick setup here's the flash it's

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.600 
really quick setup here's the flash it's
on<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.810> side<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> lens

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
on the side and you have the lens

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.880 
on the side and you have the lens
obviously<00:03:15.330> then<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:15.890> different

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
obviously then you have different

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.650 
obviously then you have different
different<00:03:17.100> things<00:03:17.310> over<00:03:17.400> here<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.540> an

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
different things over here so this is an

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.509 
different things over here so this is an
interface<00:03:19.019> that's<00:03:19.830> what<00:03:19.980> we<00:03:20.070> take<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> really

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
interface that's what we take a really

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.100 
interface that's what we take a really
quick<00:03:20.640> look<00:03:20.850> at<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.000> interfaces<00:03:21.390> go<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.989> take

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
quick look at the interfaces go and take

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.290 
quick look at the interfaces go and take
a<00:03:22.140> quick<00:03:22.470> look<00:03:22.650> at<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.860> port<00:03:23.340> go<00:03:23.880> locate<00:03:24.150> at

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
a quick look at the port go locate at

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.110 
a quick look at the port go locate at
the<00:03:24.450> side<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.140> here's<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.130> AC<00:03:26.280> my<00:03:26.610> poor<00:03:26.880> and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
the side and here's the AC my poor and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.509 
the side and here's the AC my poor and
then<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.660> USB<00:03:28.230> port<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.739> then

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
then this is the USB port and then

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.640 
then this is the USB port and then
pretty<00:03:29.730> much<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.300> is<00:03:30.360> all<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.170> camera

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
pretty much this is all of the camera

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.009 
pretty much this is all of the camera
really<00:03:32.250> small<00:03:32.519> package<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.239> i<00:03:33.690> guess<00:03:33.870> i'll

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
really small package and i guess i'll

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.420 
really small package and i guess i'll
come<00:03:34.170> back<00:03:34.320> with<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> review<00:03:34.890> really<00:03:35.190> really
