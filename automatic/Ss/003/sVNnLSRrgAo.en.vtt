so<00:00:00.299> the<00:00:00.390> breast<00:00:00.599> lift<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:00.930> defined<00:00:01.429> surgically

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so the breast lift is defined surgically

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.610 
so the breast lift is defined surgically
by<00:00:02.700> lifting<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.899> breast<00:00:04.080> into<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> higher

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
by lifting the breast into a higher

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.110 
by lifting the breast into a higher
position<00:00:04.890> putting<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.640> nipple<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
position putting the nipple in the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.360 
position putting the nipple in the
higher<00:00:06.270> position<00:00:06.839> trying<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.350> recreate<00:00:07.950> some

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
higher position trying to recreate some

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.970 
higher position trying to recreate some
of<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.990> full<00:00:09.990> look<00:00:10.349> where<00:00:10.590> there's<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.830> little

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
of that full look where there's a little

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.610 
of that full look where there's a little
bit<00:00:11.070> more<00:00:11.309> fullness<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.849> top<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.480> having<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
bit more fullness on top and having the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.959 
bit more fullness on top and having the
skin<00:00:13.889> envelope<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.370> bit<00:00:14.549> tighter<00:00:14.730> that's

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
skin envelope a bit tighter that's

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.120 
skin envelope a bit tighter that's
that's<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.420> breast<00:00:15.690> lift<00:00:15.960> although<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.890> can

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
that's the breast lift although you can

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.439 
that's the breast lift although you can
get<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.400> breast<00:00:17.699> lift<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.029> an<00:00:18.119> implants

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
get it breast lift with an implants

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.370 
get it breast lift with an implants
that's<00:00:18.690> not<00:00:18.840> what<00:00:18.960> we're<00:00:19.080> talking<00:00:19.320> about

higher<00:00:26.390> in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.570> past<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.140> unfortunately

higher in the past and unfortunately

still<00:00:29.310> today<00:00:29.699> many<00:00:30.060> surgeons<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> breast

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
still today many surgeons do a breast

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.400 
still today many surgeons do a breast
lift<00:00:31.740> by<00:00:31.949> excising<00:00:32.279> skin<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.230> tightening<00:00:34.230> the

the<00:00:37.290> breast<00:00:37.800> tissue<00:00:37.920> underneath<00:00:38.309> we'll<00:00:38.640> be

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the breast tissue underneath we'll be

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.670 
the breast tissue underneath we'll be
meaning<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> skin<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> vehicle

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
meaning that the skin is the vehicle

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.910 
meaning that the skin is the vehicle
that<00:00:41.160> lifts<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> breast<00:00:42.379> that's<00:00:43.379> fine<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
that lifts the breast that's fine and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.200 
that lifts the breast that's fine and
that's<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.219> way<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.399> was<00:00:44.520> done<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.059> not

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that's the way it was done but it's not

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.790 
that's the way it was done but it's not
a<00:00:45.239> great<00:00:45.629> operation<00:00:46.050> why<00:00:46.350> isn't<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> great

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
a great operation why isn't a great

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.410 
a great operation why isn't a great
operation<00:00:47.309> number<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> skin<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
operation number one the skin is not a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
operation number one the skin is not a
good<00:00:48.750> vehicle<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.379> supporting<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> breast

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
good vehicle for supporting the breast

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.380 
good vehicle for supporting the breast
first<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.809> stretches<00:00:53.000> number<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.180> so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
first of all it stretches number one so

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.729 
first of all it stretches number one so
you're<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.809> bottoming<00:00:55.260> out<00:00:55.440> that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you're going to get bottoming out that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.290 
you're going to get bottoming out that
lift<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.219> gonna<00:00:56.340> last<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.789> too<00:00:56.879> long<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
lift is not gonna last for too long and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
lift is not gonna last for too long and
secondly<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.379> attention<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
secondly if all your attention is on the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.180 
secondly if all your attention is on the
skin<00:00:59.550> we<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> scars<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.710> bad<00:01:01.949> when

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
skin we know that the scars are bad when

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.529 
skin we know that the scars are bad when
there's<00:01:02.370> tension<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> scars

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
there's tension on the scars

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.149 
there's tension on the scars
that's<00:01:03.719> why<00:01:03.899> face<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> scars<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:04.920> good

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
that's why face the scars are so good

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.859 
that's why face the scars are so good
because<00:01:05.580> we're<00:01:05.970> meticulous<00:01:06.479> about<00:01:06.720> not

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
because we're meticulous about not

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.350 
because we're meticulous about not
putting<00:01:07.200> any<00:01:07.380> tension<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:08.090> facelift<00:01:09.090> scars

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
putting any tension on facelift scars

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.840 
putting any tension on facelift scars
and<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.630> why<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:10.020> hardly<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.530> them

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
and that's why you can hardly see them

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.880 
and that's why you can hardly see them
so<00:01:11.850> why<00:01:12.000> put<00:01:12.240> all<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> tension<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.650> breast

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so why put all the tension on the breast

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.560 
so why put all the tension on the breast
skin<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.640> that's<00:01:14.820> why<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.180> those<00:01:15.360> bad

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
skin and that's why you get those bad

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.200 
skin and that's why you get those bad
horrible<00:01:15.900> scars<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.970> vertical

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
horrible scars the you know the vertical

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.130 
horrible scars the you know the vertical
one<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.869> long<00:01:19.110> horizontal<00:01:19.970> rather<00:01:21.140> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
one and that long horizontal rather the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.570 
one and that long horizontal rather the
way<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> good<00:01:22.830> breast<00:01:23.009> lift<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.549> my

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
way to do a good breast lift in my

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
way to do a good breast lift in my
opinion<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.509> almost<00:01:24.840> no<00:01:25.170> tension<00:01:25.770> on

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
opinion is to put almost no tension on

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
opinion is to put almost no tension on
the<00:01:26.009> breast<00:01:26.369> skin<00:01:26.580> itself<00:01:26.850> rather<00:01:27.119> mold<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the breast skin itself rather mold the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
the breast skin itself rather mold the
breast<00:01:28.500> pauran<00:01:28.860> coma<00:01:29.130> which<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> tissue

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
breast pauran coma which is the tissue

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.749 
breast pauran coma which is the tissue
inside<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.049> skin<00:01:31.350> into<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> higher<00:01:32.490> position

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
inside the skin into a higher position

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.990 
inside the skin into a higher position
and<00:01:33.210> let<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.740> skin<00:01:35.040> follow<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.790> will

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and let the skin follow and it will

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.700 
and let the skin follow and it will
follow<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.140> when<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.530> liposuction

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
follow just like when you do liposuction

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.499 
follow just like when you do liposuction
you've<00:01:38.310> got<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.579> convexity<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.240> take<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
you've got this convexity you take the
