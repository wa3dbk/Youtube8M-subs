and<00:00:50.489> compass<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> hill<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.629> but

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
and compass out on the hill with you but

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.310 
and compass out on the hill with you but
it's<00:00:52.199> bewilder<00:00:53.039> injustice<00:00:53.989> either<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.110> pack

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it's bewilder injustice either can pack

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.099 
it's bewilder injustice either can pack
into<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.620> box<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.190> size<00:00:56.430> these<00:00:56.789> days<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.079> it's

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
into a box this size these days so it's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.810 
into a box this size these days so it's
getting<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> point<00:00:58.739> where<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.640> be

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
getting to the point where you be

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.240 
getting to the point where you be
foolish<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.930> investigate<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:02.100> what's

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
foolish not to investigate just what's

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
foolish not to investigate just what's
going<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> Garmin<00:01:03.989> are

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
going on in here and Garmin are

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
going on in here and Garmin are
definitely<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> market<00:01:05.729> leaders<00:01:05.760> in

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
definitely one of the market leaders in

definitely one of the market leaders in
GPS<00:01:07.049> technology<00:01:08.119> now<00:01:09.320> what<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> particularly

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
GPS technology now what I particularly

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
GPS technology now what I particularly
like<00:01:10.860> about<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.280> Colorado<00:01:11.640> 300<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> it's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
like about the Colorado 300 is it's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590 
like about the Colorado 300 is it's
fantastic<00:01:13.920> usability<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> hill

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
fantastic usability out on the hill

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
fantastic usability out on the hill
it<00:01:15.659> feels<00:01:15.990> very<00:01:16.080> intuitive<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.250> comes<00:01:17.520> with

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it feels very intuitive it comes with

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.600 
it feels very intuitive it comes with
this<00:01:17.850> rock-and-roller<00:01:18.780> dial<00:01:19.619> wheel<00:01:19.950> if

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
this rock-and-roller dial wheel if

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.039 
this rock-and-roller dial wheel if
you've<00:01:20.759> got<00:01:20.880> an<00:01:20.970> iPod<00:01:21.060> you'll<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.659> really

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
you've got an iPod you'll be really

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.130 
you've got an iPod you'll be really
familiar<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.680> already<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:24.140> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
familiar with this already and you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.740 
familiar with this already and you
select<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> function<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.610> want<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.570> also

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
select the function you want it's also

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990

got<00:01:27.960> two<00:01:28.200> soft<00:01:28.710> keys<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.880> basically

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
got two soft keys here so basically

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.240 
got two soft keys here so basically
there's<00:01:30.450> there's<00:01:30.689> four<00:01:30.950> four<00:01:31.950> ways<00:01:32.100> of

really<00:01:59.460> made<00:01:59.759> for<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.119> hill

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.240 

and<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.720> rollerball<00:02:05.110> isn't<00:02:05.500> just<00:02:05.620> a<00:02:05.740> neat

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
and the rollerball isn't just a neat

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.699 
and the rollerball isn't just a neat
little<00:02:06.400> isn't<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.210> like<00:02:07.360> an<00:02:07.540> iPod<00:02:07.930> device<00:02:08.289> what

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
little isn't it like an iPod device what

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.800 
little isn't it like an iPod device what
makes<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.039> really<00:02:09.369> exciting<00:02:09.819> is<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.569> fact

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
makes it really exciting is the fact

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.600 
makes it really exciting is the fact
that<00:02:11.110> as<00:02:11.470> you're<00:02:11.590> looking<00:02:11.620> at<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.920> maps<00:02:12.130> it's

what I loved about this was the breadth
of<00:04:14.720> function<00:04:15.290> it's<00:04:15.530> got<00:04:15.770> beyond<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.970> getting

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
of function it's got beyond just getting

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.600

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
reckon a lot of people are going to be
