initial d

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.350 
initial d
the<00:02:13.390> initial<00:02:14.459> pictures<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.610> this<00:02:15.730> warthog<00:02:16.120> I

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
the initial pictures of this warthog I

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.150 
the initial pictures of this warthog I
thought<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.990> Gauss<00:02:17.140> cannon<00:02:17.410> look<00:02:17.709> too<00:02:17.890> bulky

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
thought the Gauss cannon look too bulky

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.650 
thought the Gauss cannon look too bulky
and<00:02:18.370> stuff<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.000> thought<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.270> was<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.480> like

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
and stuff and I thought it was just like

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.260 
and stuff and I thought it was just like
a<00:02:19.690> one-piece<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:21.430> there's<00:02:21.610> actually<00:02:21.760> quite<00:02:22.000> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
a one-piece but there's actually quite a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.440 
a one-piece but there's actually quite a
lot<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:24.459> use<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.850> lot<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.090> new<00:02:25.209> pieces

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
lot to it the use of a lot of new pieces

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.680 
lot to it the use of a lot of new pieces
like<00:02:25.810> there<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.170> one<00:02:26.470> big<00:02:27.459> piece<00:02:28.030> here<00:02:28.420> but

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
like there is one big piece here but

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.910 
like there is one big piece here but
there's<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.930> lot<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.110> pieces<00:02:29.319> that's<00:02:29.650> attached

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
there's a lot of pieces that's attached

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.240 
there's a lot of pieces that's attached
to<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.310> like<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.900> part<00:02:32.200> actually<00:02:32.500> spins<00:02:32.890> in

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
to it like that part actually spins in

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.040 
to it like that part actually spins in
the<00:02:33.340> barrel<00:02:33.670> several<00:02:33.940> different<00:02:34.390> pieces<00:02:34.600> and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
the barrel several different pieces and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.240 
the barrel several different pieces and
the<00:02:35.140> whole<00:02:36.000> assembly<00:02:37.000> for<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.270> gun<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.950> quite

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the whole assembly for the gun is quite

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.020 
the whole assembly for the gun is quite
a<00:02:39.280> few<00:02:39.459> pieces<00:02:39.640> as<00:02:39.910> well<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.590> very

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
a few pieces as well and it's a very

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.590 
a few pieces as well and it's a very
articulated<00:02:43.030> k<00:02:43.780> turret<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.040> it's<00:02:45.600> definitely

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
articulated k turret and it's definitely

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.220 
articulated k turret and it's definitely
the<00:02:46.870> coolest<00:02:47.050> ones<00:02:47.380> we've<00:02:47.560> seen<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.870> for<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
the coolest ones we've seen now for the

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.199 
the coolest ones we've seen now for the
hog<00:02:51.150> other<00:02:52.150> than<00:02:53.370> light<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.519> sound<00:02:54.640> module<00:02:55.090> in

hog other than light and sound module in
the<00:02:55.300> front<00:02:55.570> I<00:02:55.750> didn't<00:02:56.530> notice<00:02:56.769> any

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
the front I didn't notice any

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.430 
the front I didn't notice any
differences<00:02:57.519> between<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.989> initial

and suspension seats two figures got one
gunner<00:03:14.670> but<00:03:15.670> now<00:03:16.390> for<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.660> fun<00:03:16.810> part<00:03:17.640> there<00:03:18.640> is

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
gunner but now for the fun part there is

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.750 
gunner but now for the fun part there is
a<00:03:18.850> sensor<00:03:19.329> plate<00:03:20.070> right<00:03:21.070> above<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.459> silver

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.170 
blocks there which are a part of light
sound<00:03:24.670> module<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.560> when<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.489> push<00:03:27.700> down<00:03:27.730> in

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
sound module and when you push down in

the<00:03:28.269> hog<00:03:29.940> once<00:03:30.940> if<00:03:31.299> it's<00:03:31.510> been<00:03:31.660> idle<00:03:31.930> for<00:03:31.959> a

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
the hog once if it's been idle for a

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.080 
the hog once if it's been idle for a
while<00:03:32.290> it'll<00:03:32.890> always<00:03:33.100> start<00:03:33.850> with<00:03:33.910> the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
while it'll always start with the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.640 
while it'll always start with the
Warthog<00:03:35.049> turning<00:03:35.380> on<00:03:37.079> which<00:03:38.079> is<00:03:38.200> pretty<00:03:38.380> neat

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
Warthog turning on which is pretty neat

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.650 
Warthog turning on which is pretty neat
so<00:03:39.579> you're<00:03:39.790> not<00:03:39.850> just<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.239> get<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.390> random

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
so you're not just going to get a random

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.289 
so you're not just going to get a random
sound<00:03:41.170> when<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:42.130> push<00:03:42.310> down<00:03:42.340> on<00:03:42.579> it<00:03:42.760> but<00:03:43.120> once

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
sound when you push down on it but once

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:51.740 
sound when you push down on it but once
you<00:03:43.390> do<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:45.040> has<00:03:45.510> goths<00:03:46.510> firing<00:03:47.049> sounds

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.839 

or<00:03:52.750> hot<00:03:52.959> driving<00:03:53.440> sound

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.949 

an<00:03:56.849> impact<00:03:57.269> shot<00:03:57.659> and<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:59.340> last<00:03:59.579> sound<00:04:00.150> it

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
an impact shot and the last sound it

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.479 
an impact shot and the last sound it
actually<00:04:01.140> sounds<00:04:01.470> like<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.890> poor<00:04:02.069> warthogs

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
actually sounds like the poor warthogs

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.339 
actually sounds like the poor warthogs
getting<00:04:02.849> blown<00:04:03.090> up<00:04:03.120> or<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:06.750> running<00:04:07.079> into<00:04:07.319> a

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
getting blown up or you running into a

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.270 
getting blown up or you running into a
wall<00:04:09.319> but<00:04:10.319> it's<00:04:10.530> definitely<00:04:11.720> pretty<00:04:12.720> neat

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
wall but it's definitely pretty neat

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.670 
wall but it's definitely pretty neat
it's<00:04:14.280> not<00:04:14.430> just<00:04:14.489> lights<00:04:15.139> you<00:04:16.139> get<00:04:16.289> some<00:04:16.470> cool

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
it's not just lights you get some cool

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.010 
it's not just lights you get some cool
sounds<00:04:19.160> quickly<00:04:20.160> put<00:04:20.340> some<00:04:20.519> figures<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.090> here

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.080 

because<00:04:25.130> let's<00:04:26.130> point<00:04:26.340> out<00:04:26.460> having<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.699> warthog

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
because let's point out having a warthog

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:41.330 
because let's point out having a warthog
if<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.389> don't<00:04:27.570> have<00:04:27.750> someone<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.110> drive<00:04:28.380> it

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:50.950 

so<00:04:41.940> I<00:04:42.000> can<00:04:42.210> get<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.750> sparking<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:43.500> there<00:04:43.980> we<00:04:44.130> go

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.070 

so<00:04:51.960> now<00:04:51.990> this<00:04:52.380> bad<00:04:52.620> boy<00:04:52.820> hooked<00:04:53.820> up<00:04:54.090> troops<00:04:54.540> and

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
so now this bad boy hooked up troops and

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.340 
so now this bad boy hooked up troops and
it's<00:04:56.040> ready<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.370> take<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.790> that<00:04:57.060> Promethean

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.530 

and<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:02.400> would<00:05:02.610> want<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.880> Gauss<00:05:03.060> cannon<00:05:03.300> to

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
and you would want to Gauss cannon to

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:12.200 
and you would want to Gauss cannon to
shoot<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:03.960> shoot<00:05:04.139> that<00:05:04.350> guy<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:11.180> it<00:05:12.180> is

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
shoot to shoot that guy so it is

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.890 
shoot to shoot that guy so it is
definitely<00:05:12.630> worth<00:05:13.169> well<00:05:14.040> set<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.750> was<00:05:15.750> the

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
definitely worth well set it was the

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.490 
definitely worth well set it was the
