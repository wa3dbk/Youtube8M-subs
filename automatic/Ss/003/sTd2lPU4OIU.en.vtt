two two-and-a-half years we've really

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:36.410 
two two-and-a-half years we've really
it's<00:00:35.309> something<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.670> we've<00:00:35.789> chosen<00:00:36.149> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it's something that we've chosen to

focus on and we have dedicated a large
amount<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.510> behind-the-scenes<00:00:40.500> space

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
holding space so that we can actually

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.029 
holding space so that we can actually

grow grow out the coral that we have and
you<00:00:47.430> know<00:00:47.460> increase<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> size<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you know increase the size and the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
you know increase the size and the
diversity<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.289> our<00:00:49.440> coral<00:00:49.710> collection<00:00:50.100> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
diversity of our coral collection so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.599 
diversity of our coral collection so
with<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.699> coral<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:52.429> when<00:00:53.429> it<00:00:53.519> was

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
with this coral here when it was

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.160 
with this coral here when it was
originally<00:00:53.730> glued<00:00:54.269> onto<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.600> rock<00:00:54.809> several

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
originally glued onto this rock several

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.020 
originally glued onto this rock several
months<00:00:55.350> ago<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.399> central<00:00:56.760> stock

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
months ago it was just the central stock

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.880 
months ago it was just the central stock
it's<00:00:57.719> got<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.050> three<00:00:58.320> branches<00:00:58.679> up<00:00:58.800> at

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it's got the little three branches up at

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.189 
it's got the little three branches up at
the<00:00:58.980> top<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.940> since<00:01:00.269> then<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.750> grown<00:01:01.050> out

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the top and since then it's grown out

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.070 
the top and since then it's grown out
horizontally<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.730> also<00:01:02.989> added<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
horizontally and it's also added this

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.590 
horizontally and it's also added this
new<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:05.340> new<00:01:05.550> little<00:01:05.670> stock<00:01:05.970> coming<00:01:06.330> off<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
new this new little stock coming off the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.230 
new this new little stock coming off the
side<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.490> while<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
side here so you can see on while the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.900 
side here so you can see on while the
growth<00:01:09.660> is<00:01:09.870> fairly<00:01:10.350> slow<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.520> said<00:01:11.730> this<00:01:11.850> is

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
growth is fairly slow as I said this is

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.180 
growth is fairly slow as I said this is
this<00:01:12.720> has<00:01:12.870> been<00:01:13.050> glued<00:01:13.440> on<00:01:13.590> here<00:01:13.800> for<00:01:13.950> several

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
this has been glued on here for several

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.730 
this has been glued on here for several
months<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.510> starting<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.870> grow<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
months it is starting to grow out and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.270 
months it is starting to grow out and
it's<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.310> already<00:01:17.610> overgrown<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.680> all<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it's it's already overgrown the all the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.740 
it's it's already overgrown the all the
super<00:01:20.550> glue<00:01:20.730> that<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:20.940> use<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> attach<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.660> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
super glue that we use to attach to the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.400 
super glue that we use to attach to the
rock<00:01:22.130> eventually<00:01:23.510> these<00:01:24.510> two<00:01:24.840> fragments

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
rock eventually these two fragments

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.780 
rock eventually these two fragments
which<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.100> rock<00:01:26.280> will<00:01:26.670> grow

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
which are on this rock will grow

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.200 
which are on this rock will grow
together<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.300> you'll<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:28.340> 11<00:01:29.340> large<00:01:29.700> coral

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
together and you'll have 11 large coral

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.140 
together and you'll have 11 large coral
colony<00:01:30.800> what<00:01:31.800> we<00:01:31.920> were<00:01:32.040> looking<00:01:32.370> to<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.640> was<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
colony what we were looking to do was to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.450 
colony what we were looking to do was to
to<00:01:33.540> create<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.020> large<00:01:34.200> tank<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.830> would<00:01:34.980> that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to create one large tank that would that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580 
to create one large tank that would that
would<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.760> kind<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.270> coral<00:01:37.200> reef<00:01:37.410> itself

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
would be kind of that coral reef itself

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
would be kind of that coral reef itself
you<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:38.820> vision<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.330> head

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you have to have a vision in your head

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.600 
you have to have a vision in your head
of<00:01:39.660> what<00:01:39.690> your<00:01:39.960> you're<00:01:40.290> trying<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.680> create<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.880 
of what your you're trying to create you
have<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.330> little<00:01:42.450> bit<00:01:42.630> about<00:01:42.840> how<00:01:43.740> big

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
have to think a little bit about how big

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
have to think a little bit about how big
the<00:01:44.040> corals<00:01:44.310> grow<00:01:44.520> what<00:01:45.120> their<00:01:45.350> particular

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the corals grow what their particular

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.400 
the corals grow what their particular
needs<00:01:46.590> are<00:01:47.100> some<00:01:47.700> corals<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.900> much<00:01:49.050> better<00:01:49.200> in

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
needs are some corals do much better in

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.050 
needs are some corals do much better in
a<00:01:49.500> very<00:01:49.740> very<00:01:49.980> high<00:01:50.160> light<00:01:50.400> environment<00:01:50.940> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
a very very high light environment and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.940 
a very very high light environment and
others<00:01:51.600> don't<00:01:51.870> need<00:01:52.290> quite<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.560> much<00:01:52.680> light

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
others don't need quite as much light

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.590 
others don't need quite as much light
and<00:01:53.130> won't<00:01:53.580> thrive<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.120> very<00:01:54.270> high<00:01:54.420> light

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and won't thrive in a very high light

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.950 
and won't thrive in a very high light
environment<00:01:55.080> or<00:01:55.250> some<00:01:56.250> corals<00:01:56.550> need

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
environment or some corals need

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
environment or some corals need
extremely<00:01:57.960> high<00:01:58.080> water<00:01:58.320> flow<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> some<00:01:59.100> are

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
extremely high water flow and some are

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.160 
extremely high water flow and some are
are<00:01:59.700> better<00:02:00.180> off<00:02:00.360> with<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.840> moderate

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
are better off with just a moderate

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.890 
are better off with just a moderate
water<00:02:01.350> flow<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:03.150> real<00:02:03.300> difficult<00:02:03.720> thing

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
water flow the the real difficult thing

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.390 
water flow the the real difficult thing
now<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.230> you've<00:02:04.530> got<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.830> go<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.950> look<00:02:05.220> at<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
now is you've got to go you look at the

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.190 
now is you've got to go you look at the
tank<00:02:05.580> every<00:02:05.760> single<00:02:06.150> day<00:02:06.300> and<00:02:06.630> say<00:02:06.840> okay<00:02:07.050> well

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
tank every single day and say okay well

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.690 
tank every single day and say okay well
that<00:02:07.320> coral<00:02:07.590> over<00:02:07.800> there<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.250> colors<00:02:08.519> have

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
that coral over there the colors have

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
that coral over there the colors have
changed<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.119> little<00:02:09.239> bit<00:02:09.420> maybe<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.200> not

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
changed a little bit maybe it's not

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.750 
changed a little bit maybe it's not
doing<00:02:10.799> quite<00:02:10.979> as<00:02:11.129> well<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.579> particular

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
doing quite as well in that particular

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.059 
doing quite as well in that particular
location<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.629> might<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.230> let's<00:02:13.409> let's<00:02:13.680> move

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
location as it might so let's let's move

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.039 
location as it might so let's let's move
and<00:02:14.189> we'll<00:02:14.849> move<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.359> know<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> foot<00:02:15.810> lower

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
and we'll move it you know a foot lower

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.569 
and we'll move it you know a foot lower
in<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.290> water<00:02:16.379> column<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:17.010> will<00:02:17.040> get<00:02:17.280> slightly

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
in the water column it will get slightly

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.819 
in the water column it will get slightly
less<00:02:17.879> light<00:02:18.120> there<00:02:18.409> so<00:02:19.409> it's<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
less light there so it's just the

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.349 
less light there so it's just the
fine-tuning<00:02:20.129> yeah<00:02:20.670> you're<00:02:20.849> always<00:02:21.120> kind<00:02:21.239> of

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
fine-tuning yeah you're always kind of

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.940 
fine-tuning yeah you're always kind of
on<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.510> tiptoes<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:22.079> there<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.379> it's<00:02:22.650> it's

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
on your tiptoes in there it's it's it's

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.750 
on your tiptoes in there it's it's it's
a<00:02:23.040> balancing<00:02:23.370> act<00:02:23.519> as<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:24.480> group<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.760> related

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
a balancing act as a group of related

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.179 
a balancing act as a group of related
species<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.389> coral<00:02:27.709> grows<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:29.010> will

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
species of coral grows that will

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.520 
species of coral grows that will
eventually<00:02:29.790> kind<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.299> grow<00:02:30.450> into<00:02:30.689> one<00:02:30.870> one

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
eventually kind of grow into one one

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.289 
eventually kind of grow into one one
large<00:02:31.859> colony<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:32.549> have<00:02:32.670> several<00:02:32.939> smaller

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
large colony we have several smaller

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.670 
large colony we have several smaller
fragments<00:02:33.810> right<00:02:33.959> now<00:02:34.109> that<00:02:34.290> are<00:02:34.319> taking<00:02:34.590> up

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
fragments right now that are taking up

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.619 
fragments right now that are taking up
space<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.099> tank<00:02:35.340> with<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.939> idea<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.239> as

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
space in a tank with the idea that as

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.619 
space in a tank with the idea that as
they<00:02:37.139> grow<00:02:37.549> those<00:02:38.549> fragments<00:02:39.299> will

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
they grow those fragments will

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.949 
they grow those fragments will
essentially<00:02:39.900> combine<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.620> form<00:02:40.650> one<00:02:41.609> large

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
essentially combine to form one large

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.390 
essentially combine to form one large
kind<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.019> one<00:02:43.109> large<00:02:43.260> planting<00:02:43.799> if<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.219> will

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
kind of one large planting if you will

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.000 
kind of one large planting if you will
it's<00:02:45.389> a<00:02:45.480> work<00:02:45.629> in<00:02:45.659> progress<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.290> they're<00:02:46.590> you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
it's a work in progress and they're you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.830 
it's a work in progress and they're you
know<00:02:47.040> six<00:02:47.969> months<00:02:48.209> from<00:02:48.299> now<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:48.510> tank<00:02:48.719> is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
know six months from now the tank is

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.030 
know six months from now the tank is
going<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.019> look<00:02:49.139> considerably<00:02:49.799> different

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
going to look considerably different

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.229 
going to look considerably different
than<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.430> does<00:02:50.549> today<00:02:50.609> because<00:02:51.030> you're<00:02:51.150> going

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
than it does today because you're going

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.509 
than it does today because you're going
to<00:02:51.329> have<00:02:51.419> all<00:02:51.659> that<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.980> gaps<00:02:53.159> in<00:02:53.430> the

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
to have all that all the gaps in the

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.000 
to have all that all the gaps in the
holes<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:54.000> are<00:02:54.049> visible<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.620> tank<00:02:55.829> right

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
holes that are visible in the tank right

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.170 
holes that are visible in the tank right
now<00:02:56.129> where<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.519> look<00:02:56.699> through<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.939> coral

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
now where you can look through the coral

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.670 
now where you can look through the coral
and<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.329> can<00:02:57.449> see<00:02:57.629> rock<00:02:57.840> are<00:02:58.139> going<00:02:58.469> to<00:02:58.530> start

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and you can see rock are going to start

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.209 
and you can see rock are going to start
to<00:02:58.769> fill<00:02:58.949> in<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.310> a<00:03:00.000> couple<00:03:00.120> years<00:03:00.389> after<00:03:00.629> that

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.219 
to fill in and a couple years after that

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.589 
to fill in and a couple years after that
those<00:03:02.219> coral<00:03:02.579> fragments<00:03:02.790> are<00:03:03.060> going<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.239> have

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
those coral fragments are going to have

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.530 
those coral fragments are going to have
grown<00:03:03.930> into<00:03:04.290> one<00:03:04.439> another<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:06.180> will

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
grown into one another and and will

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.959 
grown into one another and and will
truly<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.169> a<00:03:07.230> mature<00:03:08.629> coral<00:03:09.629> reef<00:03:09.810> exhibit
