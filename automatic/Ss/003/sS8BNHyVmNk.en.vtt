brilliant idea I think that'll be a
great<00:03:44.900> innovation<00:03:45.500> I<00:03:45.680> came<00:03:46.130> here<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.520> Israel

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
great innovation I came here in Israel

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.400 
great innovation I came here in Israel
at<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.180> turn<00:03:47.360> on<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.720> study<00:03:48.020> civil

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
at the turn on to study civil

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.140 
at the turn on to study civil

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
engineering and the environmental

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.690 
engineering and the environmental
engineering<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.050> this<00:03:51.260> is<00:03:51.440> our<00:03:51.590> place<00:03:51.830> we<00:03:52.490> came

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
engineering so this is our place we came

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.850 
engineering so this is our place we came
here<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:53.090> study<00:03:53.510> these<00:03:53.780> kind<00:03:54.080> of<00:03:54.170> things<00:03:54.230> how

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
here to study these kind of things how

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.900 
here to study these kind of things how
to<00:03:55.120> get<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.360> world<00:03:56.570> a<00:03:56.750> better<00:03:56.900> place<00:03:57.910> better

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
to get the world a better place better

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.460 
to get the world a better place better
place<00:03:59.180> is<00:03:59.360> making<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.750> first<00:03:59.900> significant

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
step but the ultimate goal actually is

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.860 
step but the ultimate goal actually is
to<00:04:03.260> complete<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.370> process<00:04:04.550> so<00:04:05.240> that<00:04:05.270> all<00:04:05.690> of

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
to complete the process so that all of

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.900 
to complete the process so that all of
