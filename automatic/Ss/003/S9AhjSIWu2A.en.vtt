 good hello how about youtube friends in 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.240
 this video would like you to support me because 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.269
 I have a big problem with this beginning 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.999
 November I used to follow in windows 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.589
 xp was a bit the then that 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.129
 they had to format it and now I have 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.129
 the windows 7 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.770
 one problem is that I can not play a 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.430
 game mood example with slide and you had 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.430
 success and play it 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.620
 and as you will see it closes alone 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.110
 same as other games like minecraft 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.440
 they always close alone that this 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.440
 I close 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.230
 and downloaded is downloaded several 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.780
 programs 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.010
 how do you need to play games 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.410
 as a direct x 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.410
 player 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.430
 it just does not give me've seen a video 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.550
 that has something to do with the drivers 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.620
 of video card or something like that end 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.620
 another example with this and you need to 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.270
 there is a beach in Miami 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 that I must have direct x 9 unionist the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.420
 law 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.119
 and also this law 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.909
 something has to do with video card 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.920
 although install it as I told you of a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.070
 video that I have to 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.210
 climb this 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.210
 I put run 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.520
 then I was loading 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.130
 but but I get something 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.770
 well I get the assistant for the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.960
 installation of drivers in 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 devices devices but not 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.399
 updated any software for 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.960
 hardware devices because its 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.870
 quality is not superior to software 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.540
 currently installed 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.180

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.940

 I know but before, the whole game worked 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.400
