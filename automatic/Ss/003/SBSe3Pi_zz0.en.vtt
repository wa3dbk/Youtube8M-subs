00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.100
 No 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.999
 beh 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.999
 10 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.630
 haag and all that can be now but that the minister can make the room come true 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.790
 of an attack 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.790
 8 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.480
 welcome to the living room of keeper jan two days 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.220
 far away from all the glamor of the football world 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.189
 these are views 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.480
 when the working day is over, the analysts from rkc go home 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.600
 and for winning think every footballer with his porsche after a villa 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.820
 this is time for the bay window c'est until there is a suitable apartment 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.940
 found living in a riding school 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.840
 yes it is very far combination but if we could not grab nadal but if you 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.379
 then 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.710
 as the rebellion against the regime that it is not all plans 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.930
 With his departure from Nuon the rooms had nicely kept signs 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.610
 super thin no problem is that new product it seems quite 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.450
 how nice I regret it continues to fall 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.540
 can give all the attention 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.590
 this time the turn 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.270
 the boys are 14 years old 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.030
 a little later a notary sometimes comes over 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.010
 the French defender played with Joe Ventures last season and he has to 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.310
 I also thought so 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.899
 meanwhile watch the silent czech race jansen da this scene 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.730
 from his living room 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.360
 in his best english the keeper tries to explain that it is not for a human 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.720
 the laundry also came after which get a move 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.380
 the check is meanwhile a child there we will give this and give us the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.120
 tour 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.920
 And that is why we must talk again to the Frenchman of the Foreign Legion 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 he expects to take a nap 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.500
 cuijk 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.999
 also people who nun for us because the cry for help you see it at home 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.100
 according to a spokeswoman for the bunch 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.430
 if you hear that it matters to those involved but if you hear it 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.830
 tap into an example of the market 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.560
 the president of the ecb 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.589
 as before it was surprisingly too strong 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:15.089
 what seems to me to be clear with a beaming shape so I can do the most 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.909
 strong smart for paying 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.290
 That's just not what it's important that we draw three children together 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.569
 Mecca won the coming summer 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.489
 yes then i won't be either 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.339
 the condition that he is ok again 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:31.029
 we also spoke with a few short ones and that is very tasty 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.289
 clear we are back after cadets about the competition 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.509
 so is the group of football players the accident action enormously to the liking between the 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:38.180
 horses 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.349
 moreover a place where your children can come again 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.290
 Probably Jonas Ivens meanwhile and if you round he estimated you eat quickly 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.309
 leave 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.279
 after some detective harbor suddenly 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.209
 I'm going to Boston 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.609
 but that of course the attacker of the exam can come the children come 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.769
 from the ww the shorter poleman becomes the stables unclear 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.459
 jansen da has indicated to be just as happy in the riding school that 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.459
 seems here he did this season wants to live 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.419
 the 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:14.679
