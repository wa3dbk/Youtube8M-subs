scene first thing we had to look to was

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.590 
scene first thing we had to look to was
our<00:00:33.070> super<00:00:33.370> fit<00:00:33.520> engineering<00:00:34.060> which<00:00:34.330> is<00:00:34.360> an

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
our super fit engineering which is an

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.660 
our super fit engineering which is an
exhaustive<00:00:35.410> study<00:00:35.710> over<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.040> decades<00:00:36.490> we've

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
exhaustive study over the decades we've

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.980 
exhaustive study over the decades we've
been<00:00:36.760> building<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.060> helmets<00:00:37.390> on<00:00:37.660> a

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
been building the helmets on a

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.410 
been building the helmets on a
three-dimensional<00:00:38.470> platform<00:00:39.340> so<00:00:39.550> arguably<00:00:40.120> a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
three-dimensional platform so arguably a

MIT's<00:00:41.050> ever<00:00:41.200> slip<00:00:41.500> it<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.740> their<00:00:41.860> dome<00:00:42.010> would

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
MIT's ever slip it on their dome would

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.400 
MIT's ever slip it on their dome would
say<00:00:42.580> it's<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.850> best<00:00:43.120> fitting<00:00:43.810> helmet<00:00:44.080> we've

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
say it's the best fitting helmet we've

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.620 
say it's the best fitting helmet we've
ever<00:00:44.590> had<00:00:44.830> we<00:00:45.580> actually<00:00:45.730> incorporated<00:00:46.060> an<00:00:46.450> X

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
ever had we actually incorporated an X

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.900 
ever had we actually incorporated an X
static<00:00:46.930> beanie<00:00:47.410> inside<00:00:47.890> their<00:00:48.100> setting<00:00:48.400> so

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
static beanie inside their setting so

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.550 
static beanie inside their setting so
it's<00:00:49.030> antimicrobial<00:00:49.390> stays<00:00:50.050> nice<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.290> fresh

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
it's antimicrobial stays nice and fresh

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.750 
it's antimicrobial stays nice and fresh
but<00:00:50.830> also<00:00:50.980> gives<00:00:51.190> you<00:00:51.280> really<00:00:51.610> it's<00:00:51.730> like

yeah<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:57.040> molds<00:00:57.400> pretty<00:00:57.760> tricky<00:00:58.030> you<00:00:58.960> know

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
yeah it molds pretty tricky you know

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
yeah it molds pretty tricky you know
there's<00:00:59.260> a<00:00:59.320> couple<00:00:59.380> different<00:00:59.740> ways<00:00:59.770> to<00:00:59.980> build

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
there's a couple different ways to build

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.340 
there's a couple different ways to build

helmet in mold creates the lightest

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.950 
helmet in mold creates the lightest
helmet<00:01:02.680> with<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:02.920> best<00:01:03.370> ability<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.180> control

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
helmet with the best ability to control

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.330 
helmet with the best ability to control
the<00:01:05.140> environment<00:01:05.259> within<00:01:05.770> in<00:01:06.070> terms<00:01:06.219> of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
the environment within in terms of

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.219 
the environment within in terms of
venting<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:06.850> such<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.630> it's<00:01:07.810> tough<00:01:08.020> because

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
venting and such and it's tough because

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.810 
venting and such and it's tough because
you<00:01:08.439> literally<00:01:08.740> have<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.009> fuse<00:01:09.460> that

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
you literally have to fuse that

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.840 
you literally have to fuse that
EPS<00:01:10.509> liner<00:01:10.590> did<00:01:11.590> that<00:01:11.710> outer<00:01:11.950> polycarbonate

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
EPS liner did that outer polycarbonate

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.520 
EPS liner did that outer polycarbonate
and<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.509> was<00:01:13.659> kind<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.869> looking<00:01:13.990> at<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.289> like<00:01:14.380> the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
and I was kind of looking at it like the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.109 
and I was kind of looking at it like the
outer<00:01:14.649> polycarbonate<00:01:15.429> somewhat<00:01:15.759> like<00:01:15.909> the

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
outer polycarbonate somewhat like the

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.270 
outer polycarbonate somewhat like the
bump<00:01:16.359> or<00:01:16.539> the<00:01:16.630> first<00:01:16.869> layer<00:01:17.049> of<00:01:17.079> events<00:01:17.649> some

great<00:01:18.789> control<00:01:19.359> great<00:01:19.810> support<00:01:20.289> they're<00:01:20.560> just

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
great control great support they're just

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.340 
great control great support they're just
the<00:01:21.609> right<00:01:21.759> density<00:01:22.030> of<00:01:22.359> that<00:01:22.450> EPS<00:01:23.020> to

the right density of that EPS to

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.989 
the right density of that EPS to
somewhat<00:01:23.829> act<00:01:23.979> like<00:01:24.159> an<00:01:24.280> airbag<00:01:24.579> sort<00:01:24.909> of

somewhat act like an airbag sort of

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:26.730 
somewhat act like an airbag sort of

controls the impact should you have to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.770 
controls the impact should you have to
use<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.100> for<00:01:27.280> sure<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:27.999> then<00:01:28.329> we've<00:01:28.450> got<00:01:28.600> the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
use it for sure and then we've got the

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.419 
use it for sure and then we've got the
informed<00:01:29.380> fit<00:01:29.560> system<00:01:29.920> here<00:01:30.100> which<00:01:30.249> is<00:01:30.399> I

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
informed fit system here which is I

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.219 
informed fit system here which is I
think<00:01:30.789> one<00:01:31.179> of<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.390> most<00:01:31.869> sophisticated

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
think one of the most sophisticated

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.059 
think one of the most sophisticated
things<00:01:32.950> in<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.630> barn<00:01:34.630> on<00:01:34.979> everybody<00:01:35.979> you've

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
things in the barn on everybody you've

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:37.770 
things in the barn on everybody you've
ever<00:01:36.159> talked<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.640> this<00:01:36.819> little<00:01:37.119> helmet<00:01:37.569> on

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
ever talked to this little helmet on

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.239 
ever talked to this little helmet on
whether<00:01:38.020> it's<00:01:38.200> snow<00:01:38.439> or<00:01:38.560> bike<00:01:38.740> will<00:01:38.979> tell<00:01:39.189> you

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
whether it's snow or bike will tell you

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:40.640 
whether it's snow or bike will tell you
that<00:01:39.369> our<00:01:39.460> fit<00:01:39.700> systems<00:01:40.119> are

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that our fit systems are

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.350 
that our fit systems are
second<00:01:40.950> tonight<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.790> part<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.150> because

like you said you know if that you get

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.730 
like you said you know if that you get
that<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.420> balance<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:12.990> it's<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.410> just

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
that right balance so it's it's just

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.290 
that right balance so it's it's just
right<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.340> matches<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.940> goggles

you lock it down you've got just the
right<00:02:45.690> environment<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.950> way<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.250> it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
right environment of the way that it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.790 
right environment of the way that it
draws<00:02:47.550> air<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.630> away<00:02:48.900> from<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.410> head<00:02:49.590> is

draws air in and away from the head is
absolutely<00:02:50.489> perfect<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.239> kind<00:02:51.510> of

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
absolutely perfect and that kind of

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.240 
absolutely perfect and that kind of
coincides<00:02:52.050> with<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.230> stack<00:02:52.560> lens<00:02:52.830> right<00:02:53.010> a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
coincides with a stack lens right a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.340 
coincides with a stack lens right a
little<00:02:53.400> bit<00:02:53.550> yeah<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.030> know<00:02:54.120> stack<00:02:54.840> vent<00:02:55.110> kind

dropping a lid on a pot that things in

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.920 
dropping a lid on a pot that things in
still<00:02:59.010> gonna<00:02:59.160> steam<00:02:59.489> up<00:02:59.700> well<00:03:00.450> as<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.660> put<00:03:00.900> a

it's a lot like the lid on a pot and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.210 
it's a lot like the lid on a pot and
your<00:03:05.400> lens<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.120> gonna<00:03:06.300> fog<00:03:06.570> up<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> Giro<00:03:08.040> did

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
your lens is gonna fog up so a Giro did
