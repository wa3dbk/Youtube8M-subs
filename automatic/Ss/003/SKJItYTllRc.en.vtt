00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.310
 You'll do it and that 's the way it is 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.910
 there is only a little bit of mass of each 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.460
 time because you are losing or like you 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.650
 did it here in the corner 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:57.680
 It's very simple, you have it here. 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:57.680
 it serves in space here and is 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.260

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:13.760
 Do you have this flower? 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.200

 show would do with you 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.370
 have to be a bit careful to 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.400
 to advance to the stage because I said 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.180
 hand and several molds work 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.570
 You can do it a little ball too. 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:44.700
 or you do so you make a kitchen 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:48.660
 you have a lot of faith in a ball to 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.570
 boring a little on that foot on the fork 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.790

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.680
 she only ask for a normal car and 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.739
 to do so will stay the moment I think 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.980
 should not sell almost a single 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:11.130
 Paint it and the first time I did it 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.880

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.550
 20 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:54.389
 did not identify that percentage with 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.449
 here and even more simple teams more 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.870
 thin because you can not get better shape in the 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.629

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.409
