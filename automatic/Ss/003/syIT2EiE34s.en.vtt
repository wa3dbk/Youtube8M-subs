00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
or pranked old ok she would have the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.670 
or pranked old ok she would have the
best<00:01:59.280> reaction<00:02:00.090> because<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.170> she<00:02:01.439> not

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
best reaction because I think she not
