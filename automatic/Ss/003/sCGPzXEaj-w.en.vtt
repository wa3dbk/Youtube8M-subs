00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.730 

you<00:01:26.690> see<00:01:26.870> here<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:27.140> have<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.470> have<00:01:27.620> that

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
you see here I have to have that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.730 
you see here I have to have that
positive<00:01:28.250> offset<00:01:28.430> rim<00:01:29.260> because<00:01:30.260> of<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.500> ball

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
positive offset rim because of this ball

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.580 
positive offset rim because of this ball
here<00:01:31.040> that<00:01:31.190> comes<00:01:31.430> out<00:01:31.700> if<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:32.840> put<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.200> put<00:01:33.560> a

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
here that comes out if you put the put a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.760 
here that comes out if you put the put a
bigger<00:01:33.860> tire<00:01:34.130> on<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.520> stock<00:01:34.790> rim<00:01:35.440> that<00:01:36.440> of

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
bigger tire on the stock rim that of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.410 
bigger tire on the stock rim that of
that<00:01:36.980> boat<00:01:37.220> right<00:01:37.460> there<00:01:37.490> smashed<00:01:38.150> right<00:01:38.360> into

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
that boat right there smashed right into

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.210 
that boat right there smashed right into
your<00:01:38.750> tire<00:01:38.960> every<00:01:39.470> time<00:01:39.650> you<00:01:39.800> hit<00:01:39.920> something

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
your tire every time you hit something

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.910 
your tire every time you hit something
so<00:01:41.120> you<00:01:41.180> get<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.540> positive<00:01:42.020> offset<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:48.800> can

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
so you get that positive offset you can

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.130 
so you get that positive offset you can
also<00:01:49.070> see<00:01:49.370> on<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.550> front<00:01:49.750> but<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:50.900> three<00:01:51.050> and
