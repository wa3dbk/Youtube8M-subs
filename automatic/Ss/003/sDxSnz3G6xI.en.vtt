00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.419
 Hulbee com for the second part 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.859
 the Transformer in the middle - 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.219
 over 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.130
 Creator and now threaten 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.769
 and their combination 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.300
 12 degrees 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.159
 and welcome to the combination 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.029
 okay it is really 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.070
 just like the transformation from CAD to red just like they really are 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.720
 just as easy 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
 in fact 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.700
 easy 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.700
 the first appearance so a bit 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 the padding backwards can be way out 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.810
 also a part attacked 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.500
 So I'll say yes 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.110
 Open pancraz 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.110
 and a quick ass of mind 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.320
 flexible 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.790
 make that turn 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.450
 that was all 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.020
 from today 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 you can open this 4 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.000
 and search here 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.140
 what fold out what exactly I like the same 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.119
 then his head adorns a folded 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.740
 the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.740
 it remains so that he will not resign 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 and you can see you already have a facial part 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.120
 what is Richie or complaining turned over 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.930
 there are these little black plastic parts 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.900
 you have to watch Costanzo fits 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.700
 Riekofen has to push people so far you can really shoot with it 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 and covered Adecco 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.199
 and becomes a foot 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.189
 in no time at all 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.199
 that's why 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:19.959
 positive trend 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.859
 and implied 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.859
 for these at least there are still people squatting 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.809
 that can happen 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.809
 Position Cindy 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.359
 Tyler as well 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.249
 that perceives that 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.489
 behind so as a share 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.299
 Arno Walter what he has 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.369
 that's the same thing 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.369
 Armani replacing that in the back 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.889
 fold down 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.889
 Half out again 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:12.259
 yes in there or 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.459
 that's how it works 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.459
 then that would be it 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
 turn the part again 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:29.739
 potentially be allowed to move in 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.739
 then the train because the earliest one must have either son 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.459
 make it is not bad 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.649
 So turn it carefully again 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:48.649
 it is better 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.179
 Head still up 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.179
 the unique position 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.499
 that break into the heart 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.499
 simply because that's long 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.109
 Head still nothing 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.449
 hereunder bodies are slam dead 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.539
 the contradictions 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.809
 come here is also normal behavior turn 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.939
 that you have the title too 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.680
 as already indicated so Matt and can not 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.680
 formative the house to what looks like 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.529
 such a thing is called force 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.789
 that was right 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.139
 the TuS Hattingen kes 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.630
 Hesse to split how split it optics remind me a bit 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.479
 referred to 2 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.479
 from Batman so 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.939
 Mertens that way 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:29.169
 very chic 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.169
 Zacher cites 2 for is similar 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.610
 the combination of both is that's my new combination option 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:40.709
 because otherwise we were actually there before we had it next to us 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.160
 the 1 InsO the whole time and how tame stuck Ofisi had put all 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.659
 Sticks together 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.370
 at 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.249
 since when «The worst crisis - the times were actually percent 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:56.110
 one on the ground 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.199
 Optimus Prime and so Großaitingen 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.360
 completely everything was disassembled 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.740
 and these and combination that's both sides had themselves 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:07.979
 the time is up 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.199
 are actually stuck 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.460
 new in my opinion 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.460
 and only very nice combination 

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:25.469
 Clearly, there are a few things out of the boat that are out there in a Bob Modi 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.199
 So I would not have hidden either 

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:37.610
 still a pretty good thing 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.839
 I think 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.169
 almost Nottuln 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.169
 Ruffle defies Alem 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.270
 2 - give 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.759
 never for a few things 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.289
 It's actually a little bit disturbing 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.339
 rather simple symbol of transformation from everything quite simple 

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:08.059
 who do not look bad No, for God's sake Stewart are Holocaust 

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:11.059
 also the commission is great but somehow 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.979
 it is summer 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:16.199
 careful 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.199
 quite simple in a sense anyway value 

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:23.219
 So a second one is 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.870
 This super app mode love you personally "I say 'do not come 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.169
 do not bend Disney now 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:32.970
 large 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.050
 the Bernese, then 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.710
 Her second combination is really Bern 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.710
 for years 

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:46.270
 I hope you will know this game 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.150
 Schües until then
