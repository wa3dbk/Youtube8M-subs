00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.000
 hi Guys 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.429
 Today I want you different 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.730
 way we show the monitoring 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.439
 switch off your smartphone 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.539
 this video shows three different ones 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.980
 ways 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.230
 if you do not have an open book for the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.109
 secret services and government want to be 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.439
 then it is necessary this 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.850
 to look at the manual 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.750
 In our example, we use one 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.340
 htc but the safest way should be with 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.739
 all smartphones in the world 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.210
 work since prison are the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.289
 worried people around the world 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.690
 that they are monitored and tracked 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.940
 The story is not new, but now 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 she reaches the public spirit 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.350
 please take a look at how yours 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.780
 Safety can protect the first and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.809
 the most unsafe way is it features like 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.650
 gps mobile internet video and so on 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.650
 to disable 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 on 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.000
 turn off google location tracking 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 Switch off gps 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.520
 the second and a little safer way is 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.360
 it's hardware from gps and video and such 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.360
 continue to expand 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:03:04.180
 You can not take off 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.180
 off the video proof 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.960
 gps module 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:35.550
 the last victory is very efficient and 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.200
 100 percent sure they look at him 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.330
 and meet your own 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.810
 decision 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.340
 if they choose the safe way 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.200
 Buy a mobile like this 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.810
 here 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.370
 It brings everything you need 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.230
 Features you can call you can 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.420
 Of course, sms will be sent as well 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.940
 recorded but it is just 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.970
 much less than the smartphone 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:04.250
 as before usetec the security wales 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.250
 important take that 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.750
 becomes 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.730
 exactly 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:06.820
 we needed the last one second sight 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.500
 and tools 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.340
 that was 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.000
 wissmann 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.000
 Mr. frank 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.639
 there 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.440
 nsa is out 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.860

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.990
