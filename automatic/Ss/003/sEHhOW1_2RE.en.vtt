00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.820 

demonic<00:01:21.450> expertise<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.350> they're<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
demonic expertise so they're not the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.560 
demonic expertise so they're not the
same<00:01:22.860> source<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.580> don't<00:01:23.880> think<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
same source so don't think I it's a
