the<00:01:17.409> stupidity<00:01:18.409> on<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.649> 51<00:01:19.009> because<00:01:19.759> I<00:01:20.030> think

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
the stupidity on the 51 because I think

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.740 
the stupidity on the 51 because I think
it's<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.570> disaster<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:23.240> think<00:01:23.450> what<00:01:23.630> they

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
it's a disaster and I think what they

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.960 
it's a disaster and I think what they
will<00:01:23.869> do<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.920> end<00:01:25.039> is<00:01:25.250> they<00:01:25.460> will<00:01:25.610> turn

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
will do in the end is they will turn

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.770 
will do in the end is they will turn
riders<00:01:26.720> away<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:28.159> riders<00:01:28.549> will<00:01:28.729> just<00:01:29.000> give<00:01:29.570> up

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
riders away the riders will just give up

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.399 
riders away the riders will just give up
and<00:01:30.759> that<00:01:31.759> just<00:01:32.000> makes<00:01:32.180> them<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.570> weaker<00:01:32.960> system

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
and that just makes them a weaker system

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.889 
and that just makes them a weaker system
so<00:01:34.399> there's<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.700> lot<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:34.880> sympathy<00:01:35.360> for<00:01:35.539> AC

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
so there's a lot of sympathy for AC

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.859 
so there's a lot of sympathy for AC
Transit<00:01:36.759> but<00:01:37.759> at<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.940> same<00:01:38.149> time<00:01:38.420> there's

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
Transit but at the same time there's

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.760 
Transit but at the same time there's
also<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.170> lot<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.409> concern<00:01:40.869> is<00:01:41.869> this<00:01:42.319> the<00:01:42.619> best

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
also a lot of concern is this the best

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.230 
also a lot of concern is this the best
way<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.670> manage<00:01:43.940> this<00:01:44.509> difficult<00:01:45.110> situation

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
way to manage this difficult situation

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.899 
way to manage this difficult situation
some<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.390> them<00:01:47.479> are<00:01:47.659> actually<00:01:48.429> okay<00:01:49.429> some<00:01:49.880> of

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
some of them are actually okay some of

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.749 
some of them are actually okay some of
them<00:01:50.440> brilliant<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:51.830> couple<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.490> them<00:01:52.640> I

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
them brilliant and a couple of them I

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.850 
them brilliant and a couple of them I
think<00:01:52.789> are<00:01:53.149> disastrous<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.500> one<00:01:54.679> that's

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
think are disastrous and the one that's

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.249 
think are disastrous and the one that's
probably<00:01:55.159> most<00:01:55.490> disastrous<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.479> screwing<00:01:56.990> up

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
probably most disastrous is screwing up

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.210 
probably most disastrous is screwing up
