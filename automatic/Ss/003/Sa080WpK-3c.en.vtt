00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920 
changer just having but statics a little
bit<00:00:56.610> better<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> paralyze

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
bit better because if you get a paralyze

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.069 
bit better because if you get a paralyze
off<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.890> good<00:00:59.100> so<00:01:00.090> pretty<00:01:00.600> much<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.930> you

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
off that's good so pretty much what you

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.009 
off that's good so pretty much what you
do<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> move<00:01:02.730> set

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
extrasensory I just put that there

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.330 
extrasensory I just put that there
because<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.920> didn't<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.280> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
because I didn't really know what I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.999 
because I didn't really know what I
wanted<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> run<00:01:26.880> last<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.900> might<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.799> would

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
wanted to run last but I might I would

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.590 
wanted to run last but I might I would
actually<00:01:29.159> run<00:01:29.369> toxic<00:01:29.820> because<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.420> makes

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
actually run toxic because that makes

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.100 
actually run toxic because that makes

SAP dosa

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.420 
SAP dosa
but<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.350> gives<00:01:34.650> him<00:01:34.799> an<00:01:34.950> extra<00:01:35.070> edge

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
but it just gives him an extra edge

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.850 
but it just gives him an extra edge
that's<00:01:36.150> how<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> would<00:01:36.420> put<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.710> anyways<00:01:37.710> this

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that's how I would put it anyways this
