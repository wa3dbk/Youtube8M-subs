so<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.770> thing<00:00:01.949> about<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.250> head<00:00:02.600> did<00:00:03.600> you<00:00:03.720> have

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
so the thing about the head did you have

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.329 
so the thing about the head did you have
to<00:00:03.959> learn<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.440> that<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> head<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.069> really

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
to learn is that the head is really

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.230 
to learn is that the head is really
crane<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.519> all<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.700> muscles<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.150> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
crane and that all the muscles of the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.959 
crane and that all the muscles of the
neck<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.900> think<00:00:10.290> are<00:00:10.940> extracted<00:00:11.940> from

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
neck that you think are extracted from

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.480 
neck that you think are extracted from
your<00:00:12.330> throat<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.679> muscle<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.219> books

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
your throat to the muscle to the books

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.760 
your throat to the muscle to the books
of<00:00:14.639> your<00:00:14.759> neck<00:00:14.910> doesn't<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.509> them<00:00:15.770> instead

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
of your neck doesn't do them instead

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.099 
of your neck doesn't do them instead
they're<00:00:17.340> suspended<00:00:18.029> between<00:00:18.630> your<00:00:18.810> head<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
they're suspended between your head and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.490 
they're suspended between your head and
your<00:00:20.039> chest<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.330> they<00:00:21.449> hold<00:00:21.720> up<00:00:21.930> your

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
your chest so that they hold up your

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.480 
your chest so that they hold up your
trachea<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.840> your<00:00:24.840> esophagus<00:00:25.650> between<00:00:26.310> them

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
trachea and your esophagus between them

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.800 
trachea and your esophagus between them
because<00:00:26.849> what<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.090> need<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> need<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> be

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
because what you need is you need to be

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.349 
because what you need is you need to be
able<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.109> eat<00:00:28.859> popcorn<00:00:29.130> way<00:00:29.609> over<00:00:29.910> here<00:00:30.150> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
able to eat popcorn way over here and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.640 
able to eat popcorn way over here and
then<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.570> able<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.720> swing<00:00:30.929> your<00:00:31.019> head<00:00:31.109> way<00:00:31.320> over

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
then be able to swing your head way over

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.709 
then be able to swing your head way over
here<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.130> drink<00:00:32.430> some<00:00:32.640> fluid<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.540> able<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
here and drink some fluid and be able to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.780 
here and drink some fluid and be able to
talk<00:00:33.989> all<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> way<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.620> between<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.579> your

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
talk all the way in between so your

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
talk all the way in between so your
throat<00:00:36.090> actually<00:00:36.360> has<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.780> stay<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.200> your

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
throat actually has to stay with your

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.260 
throat actually has to stay with your
head<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> turn<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:38.700> head<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
head when you turn your head it's got a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.940 
head when you turn your head it's got a
slider<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.079> side<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> turn

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
slider out to one side and then you turn

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.020 
slider out to one side and then you turn
your<00:00:41.100> head<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> other<00:00:41.399> way<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:41.700> got<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> be

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
your head the other way that's got to be

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.130 
your head the other way that's got to be
able<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.210> slide<00:00:42.420> over<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> remain

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
able to slide over there and remain

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.990 
able to slide over there and remain
functional<00:00:43.440> if<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.370> attached<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.640> every

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
functional if it attached to every

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.369 
functional if it attached to every
single<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.390> your<00:00:45.600> vertebrae<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
single one of your vertebrae that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.340 
single one of your vertebrae that
wouldn't<00:00:46.680> happen<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.989> here's<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.200> it's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
wouldn't happen so here's the way it's

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.240 
wouldn't happen so here's the way it's
actually<00:00:49.469> set<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
actually set up this is just a way to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.069 
actually set up this is just a way to
memorize<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.760> they<00:00:53.879> do

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:14.590 

hmm

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.790 

so<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:16.130> is<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.430> mastoid<00:01:17.180> process<00:01:17.800> styloid

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
so this is the mastoid process styloid

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.570 
so this is the mastoid process styloid
process<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.880> maxilla<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:21.140> mandible<00:01:21.770> craig

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
process the maxilla the mandible craig

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.450 
process the maxilla the mandible craig
boyd<00:01:22.780> thyroid<00:01:24.010> that's<00:01:25.010> right

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
boyd thyroid that's right

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.240 
boyd thyroid that's right
hi<00:01:25.910> omega<00:01:26.120> thyroid<00:01:26.990> cartilage<00:01:27.590> frankly

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
hi omega thyroid cartilage frankly

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.060 
hi omega thyroid cartilage frankly
cartilage<00:01:28.700> in<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.300> sternum<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:30.070> this

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
cartilage in the sternum and this

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.070 
cartilage in the sternum and this
shoulder<00:01:31.850> blade<00:01:32.090> remember<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:32.750> place<00:01:32.930> in

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
shoulder blade remember that place in

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.230 
shoulder blade remember that place in
the<00:01:33.140> shoulder<00:01:33.410> blade<00:01:33.590> where<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.310> nerve<00:01:34.970> went

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
the shoulder blade where the nerve went

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.760 
the shoulder blade where the nerve went
underneath<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:35.990> heart<00:01:36.140> we<00:01:36.320> went<00:01:36.500> over

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
underneath and the heart we went over

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.070 
underneath and the heart we went over
that<00:01:36.950> spot<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.790> shoulder<00:01:38.090> blade<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.509> so

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
that spot and the shoulder blade and so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.350 
that spot and the shoulder blade and so
the<00:01:39.350> muscles<00:01:39.710> all<00:01:39.950> arise<00:01:40.880> from<00:01:41.180> these

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
the muscles all arise from these

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.210 
the muscles all arise from these
structures<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:42.140> order<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.680> hold<00:01:42.860> on<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
structures in order to hold on to the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.330 
structures in order to hold on to the
highwayman<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.240> hyoid<00:01:44.450> bone<00:01:44.900> is<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:46.040> center

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
highwayman the hyoid bone is the center

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.080 
highwayman the hyoid bone is the center
of<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.550> universe<00:01:46.759> here<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.860> held<00:01:49.100> up<00:01:49.310> by<00:01:50.060> a

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
of the universe here it's held up by a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.120 
of the universe here it's held up by a
muscle<00:01:50.479> called<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.720> bag<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:51.110> surrogates<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
muscle called the bag a surrogates the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.740 
muscle called the bag a surrogates the
digastric<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.789> goes<00:01:53.000> from<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.360> mastoid

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
digastric is goes from the mastoid

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.060 
digastric is goes from the mastoid
process<00:01:54.229> goes<00:01:54.440> all<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.619> way<00:01:54.680> down<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.979> the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
process goes all the way down to the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.380 
process goes all the way down to the
highway<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.490> then<00:01:55.610> bounces<00:01:56.030> up<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.300> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
highway and then bounces up to the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.389 
highway and then bounces up to the
inside<00:01:56.750> of<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.899> jaw<00:01:57.259> right<00:01:58.009> around<00:01:58.250> the

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
inside of the jaw right around the

inside of the jaw right around the
genome<00:01:58.670> process<00:01:59.300> so<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.170> holds<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.920> on

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
genome process so it holds on to it on

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.460 
genome process so it holds on to it on
either<00:02:01.250> side<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.600> holds<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:02.990> structure<00:02:03.380> up

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
either side and holds a structure up

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.109 
either side and holds a structure up
because<00:02:03.800> I'm<00:02:03.920> not<00:02:04.039> talking<00:02:04.280> about<00:02:04.430> any<00:02:04.820> of<00:02:05.030> the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
because I'm not talking about any of the

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.090 
because I'm not talking about any of the
muscles<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.869> turn<00:02:06.110> your<00:02:06.289> head<00:02:06.500> open<00:02:06.800> your

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
muscles that turn your head open your

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.710 
muscles that turn your head open your
mouths<00:02:07.550> close<00:02:07.789> your<00:02:07.970> mouth<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.330> only<00:02:08.570> talk

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
mouths close your mouth and only talk

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.600 
mouths close your mouth and only talk
about<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.050> muscles<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:10.100> throat<00:02:10.280> and

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
about the muscles of the throat and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.460 
about the muscles of the throat and
there<00:02:10.700> seems<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:11.090> there's<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.390> bunch<00:02:11.600> of<00:02:11.780> so

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
there seems like there's a bunch of so

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.280 
there seems like there's a bunch of so
this<00:02:13.040> one<00:02:13.310> digastric<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.390> holds<00:02:15.050> everything

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
this one digastric is holds everything

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.080 
this one digastric is holds everything
up<00:02:15.560> then<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.040> have<00:02:16.070> another<00:02:16.459> one<00:02:16.550> coming<00:02:16.940> down

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
up then you have another one coming down

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.000 
up then you have another one coming down
from<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.420> styloid<00:02:17.780> process<00:02:17.840> hold<00:02:18.530> network

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
from the styloid process hold network

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.479 
from the styloid process hold network
that's<00:02:20.140> stylohyoid<00:02:21.519> then<00:02:22.519> bring<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.000> sternum

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
that's stylohyoid then bring the sternum

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.410 
that's stylohyoid then bring the sternum
sternum<00:02:25.489> pilot<00:02:26.030> right<00:02:27.019> now<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:28.700> also<00:02:28.880> needs<00:02:29.299> to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
sternum pilot right now it also needs to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.210 
sternum pilot right now it also needs to
stay<00:02:29.750> with<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.410> thyroid<00:02:30.620> cartilage<00:02:31.130> because

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
stay with the thyroid cartilage because

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.930 
stay with the thyroid cartilage because
they<00:02:31.400> move<00:02:31.579> as<00:02:31.730> one<00:02:31.850> piece<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:33.010> sterno<00:02:34.010> thyroid

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
they move as one piece so sterno thyroid

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.430 
they move as one piece so sterno thyroid
and<00:02:35.799> thyroid<00:02:36.799> pile<00:02:37.510> all<00:02:38.510> right<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.320> they

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
and thyroid pile all right so that they

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.770 
and thyroid pile all right so that they
live<00:02:39.620> together<00:02:39.769> then<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.640> want<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.329> cricoid

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
live together then you want the cricoid

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.280 
live together then you want the cricoid
to<00:02:41.959> stay<00:02:42.140> with<00:02:42.380> them<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.190> have<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.820> little

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
to stay with them so you have the little

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.620 
to stay with them so you have the little
cricothyroid<00:02:45.290> muscle<00:02:45.560> attached<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.400> them<00:02:46.630> you

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
cricothyroid muscle attached to them you

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.009 
cricothyroid muscle attached to them you
then<00:02:47.870> have<00:02:48.549> another<00:02:49.549> muscle<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.570> goes<00:02:50.840> along

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
then have another muscle that goes along

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.259 
then have another muscle that goes along
the<00:02:51.200> whole<00:02:51.560> wedge<00:02:51.980> side<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.910> inside<00:02:53.239> of

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
the whole wedge side of the inside of

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.970 
the whole wedge side of the inside of
the<00:02:53.390> jaw<00:02:53.690> which<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.049> called<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.320> myeloid<00:02:54.650> line

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
the jaw which is called the myeloid line

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.630 
the jaw which is called the myeloid line
and<00:02:55.310> goes<00:02:55.850> down<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.299> attaches<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:58.459> hyoid

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
and goes down and attaches to the hyoid

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.259 
and goes down and attaches to the hyoid
bone<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.329> that's<00:02:59.660> the<00:03:00.140> Milo<00:03:00.500> pipe<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.400> that's

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
bone so that's the Milo pipe and that's

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.060 
bone so that's the Milo pipe and that's
just<00:03:02.630> all<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.900> muscles<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.440> help<00:03:03.590> you

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
just all the muscles that help you

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.430 
just all the muscles that help you
swallow<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.760> move<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.150> apparatus<00:03:05.780> they

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
swallow and move this apparatus they

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.860 
swallow and move this apparatus they
don't<00:03:06.590> necessarily<00:03:06.920> make<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.450> talk<00:03:08.450> but<00:03:08.780> they

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
don't necessarily make you talk but they

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.840 
don't necessarily make you talk but they
do<00:03:08.930> hold<00:03:09.320> everything<00:03:09.680> up<00:03:09.920> for<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.640> make

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
do hold everything up for you and make

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.240 
do hold everything up for you and make
sure<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.269> stays<00:03:11.570> with<00:03:12.410> your<00:03:12.799> head

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
sure that it stays with your head

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.220 
sure that it stays with your head
and<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.460> turn<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.690> next<00:03:14.930> thing<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:16.040> time

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
and you turn the next thing is the time

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.930 
and you turn the next thing is the time
so<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.290> tongue<00:03:18.500> sits<00:03:18.740> in<00:03:18.890> here<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.520> needs<00:03:19.760> to

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
so the tongue sits in here and needs to

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.400 
so the tongue sits in here and needs to
be<00:03:20.120> able<00:03:20.210> to<00:03:20.300> move<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.750> all<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.020> those<00:03:21.140> st.

cardinal directions so to pull your

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.870 
cardinal directions so to pull your
tongue<00:03:23.510> out<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:25.220> goes<00:03:25.400> through<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.670> genome

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
tongue out it goes through the genome

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.730 
tongue out it goes through the genome
process<00:03:26.420> on<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.660> inside<00:03:26.990> of<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:27.170> jaw

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
process on the inside of the jaw

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.110

here from the hard palate coming down on

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.320 
here from the hard palate coming down on
either<00:03:50.600> side<00:03:50.959> is<00:03:51.500> Polito<00:03:52.090> blossoms<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.240> be

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
either side is Polito blossoms to be

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.940 
either side is Polito blossoms to be
able<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.600> shove<00:03:54.080> your<00:03:54.260> tongue<00:03:54.410> up<00:03:54.590> against<00:03:54.830> the

able to shove your tongue up against the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.680 
able to shove your tongue up against the
roof<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.220> your<00:03:55.250> mouth<00:03:55.400> does<00:03:56.390> that<00:03:56.510> make<00:03:56.660> sense

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
roof of your mouth does that make sense

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.190 
roof of your mouth does that make sense
so<00:03:56.900> far

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
so far

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.970 
so far
yeah<00:03:57.500> then<00:03:58.630> everything<00:03:59.630> that<00:04:00.020> doesn't<00:04:00.920> go

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
yeah then everything that doesn't go

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.620 
yeah then everything that doesn't go
down<00:04:01.130> your<00:04:01.280> windpipe<00:04:01.459> is<00:04:02.120> supposed<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.480> go

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
down your windpipe is supposed to go

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.840 
down your windpipe is supposed to go
down<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:03.020> garbage<00:04:03.230> chute<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.770> your<00:04:04.280> esophagus

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.650 
down the garbage chute of your esophagus
okay<00:04:05.750> now<00:04:06.350> that<00:04:06.470> esophagus<00:04:07.420> everything<00:04:08.420> has

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
okay now that esophagus everything has

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.120 
okay now that esophagus everything has
to<00:04:08.690> tumble<00:04:09.200> into<00:04:09.320> that<00:04:09.560> now<00:04:09.860> there's<00:04:10.040> no

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
to tumble into that now there's no

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.800 
to tumble into that now there's no
protector<00:04:10.640> for<00:04:10.850> your<00:04:10.970> height<00:04:11.209> for<00:04:11.660> your

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
protector for your height for your

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.990 
protector for your height for your
windpipe<00:04:12.380> so<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.830> doesn't<00:04:13.130> go<00:04:13.190> in<00:04:13.310> there<00:04:13.520> so

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
windpipe so it doesn't go in there so

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.190 
windpipe so it doesn't go in there so
it's<00:04:14.150> all<00:04:14.240> just<00:04:14.300> supposed<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.750> tumble<00:04:14.930> down

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
it's all just supposed to tumble down

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.680 
it's all just supposed to tumble down
and<00:04:15.410> go<00:04:15.500> down<00:04:15.530> your<00:04:15.860> throat<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:17.120> is<00:04:17.330> attached

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
and go down your throat it is attached

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.920 
and go down your throat it is attached
to<00:04:17.919> this<00:04:18.919> at<00:04:19.580> the<00:04:19.730> top<00:04:19.940> top<00:04:20.330> to<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.540> top<00:04:20.690> of<00:04:20.840> the

ferrying<00:04:25.100> jeez

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
ferrying jeez

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.550 
ferrying jeez
okay<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.310> also<00:04:28.310> has<00:04:28.880> an<00:04:29.120> upper<00:04:29.419> middle<00:04:30.380> and

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
okay and also has an upper middle and

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.700 
okay and also has an upper middle and
lower<00:04:31.090> esophageal<00:04:32.090> constrictor<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.560> it

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
lower esophageal constrictor so that it

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.430 
lower esophageal constrictor so that it
moves<00:04:33.950> where<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.850> trachea<00:04:35.240> moves<00:04:35.450> does<00:04:36.290> that

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
moves where the trachea moves does that

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.909 
moves where the trachea moves does that
make<00:04:36.590> sense

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
make sense

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.909 
make sense
then<00:04:37.790> one<00:04:38.300> more<00:04:38.479> muscle<00:04:40.000> stylopharyngeus<00:04:41.919> now

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
then one more muscle stylopharyngeus now

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.400 
then one more muscle stylopharyngeus now
this<00:04:43.760> now<00:04:44.390> makes<00:04:44.690> no<00:04:44.960> sense

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
this now makes no sense

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.010 
this now makes no sense
right<00:04:45.850> it's<00:04:46.850> just<00:04:46.910> some<00:04:47.240> value<00:04:47.540> good<00:04:47.750> but<00:04:47.930> what

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
right it's just some value good but what

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.120 
right it's just some value good but what
I<00:04:48.050> want<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.410> see<00:04:48.590> is<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:48.740> there's<00:04:49.040> three

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
I want you to see is that there's three

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.550 
I want you to see is that there's three
parts<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.700> it<00:04:49.880> there<00:04:50.390> are<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:51.110> muscles<00:04:51.500> that

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
parts to it there are the muscles that

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.710 
parts to it there are the muscles that
move<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.830> highway<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:53.120> muscles<00:04:53.479> that<00:04:53.570> move

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
move the highway the muscles that move

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.570 
move the highway the muscles that move
the<00:04:53.780> tongue<00:04:54.140> and<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.979> muscles<00:04:55.310> that<00:04:55.340> move<00:04:55.460> the

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
the tongue and the muscles that move the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.730 
the tongue and the muscles that move the
esophagus

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
esophagus

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.020 
esophagus
they're<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:58.070> integrated<00:04:58.610> with<00:04:58.729> each<00:04:58.850> other

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
they're so integrated with each other

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.219 
they're so integrated with each other
that<00:04:59.210> it<00:04:59.330> just<00:04:59.540> seems<00:04:59.690> like<00:04:59.870> a<00:04:59.900> bunch<00:05:00.080> of

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
that it just seems like a bunch of

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.170 
that it just seems like a bunch of
muscles<00:05:00.560> but<00:05:01.010> it<00:05:01.130> really<00:05:01.310> is<00:05:01.520> three<00:05:01.820> separate

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
muscles but it really is three separate

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.020 
muscles but it really is three separate
parts<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.630> they're<00:05:03.350> so<00:05:03.729> agreed<00:05:04.729> with<00:05:04.910> each

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
parts and they're so agreed with each

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.580 
parts and they're so agreed with each
other<00:05:05.240> that<00:05:05.419> people<00:05:05.780> do<00:05:05.930> and<00:05:06.140> in<00:05:06.350> block

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
other that people do and in block

dissection<00:05:07.250> for<00:05:08.080> pathologists<00:05:09.080> they<00:05:09.320> can

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
dissection for pathologists they can

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.320 
dissection for pathologists they can
actually<00:05:09.740> go<00:05:09.890> up<00:05:10.040> here<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.340> cut<00:05:10.640> along

will fall back into your chest cavity

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.240 
will fall back into your chest cavity
right<00:05:32.150> though<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.289> whole<00:05:33.530> structure<00:05:34.129> is

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250

plumping up your lungs your trachea of
almost<00:05:36.139> nuts<00:05:36.409> and<00:05:36.680> that's<00:05:37.550> an<00:05:37.729> easy<00:05:38.000> way<00:05:38.300> to

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
almost nuts and that's an easy way to
