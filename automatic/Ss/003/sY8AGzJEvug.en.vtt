I guess what I want to know from you as
we<00:03:28.239> are<00:03:28.269> watching<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.350> live<00:03:29.620> via<00:03:30.010> Kusa<00:03:30.489> is

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
we are watching this live via Kusa is

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.509 
we are watching this live via Kusa is
how<00:03:32.680> much<00:03:32.829> longer<00:03:33.420> does<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:35.010> helium<00:03:36.010> balloon

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
how much longer does this helium balloon

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.090 
how much longer does this helium balloon
have<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.959> be<00:03:38.109> airborne<00:03:38.320> because<00:03:38.799> as<00:03:38.920> we've

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
have to be airborne because as we've

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.490 
have to be airborne because as we've
been<00:03:39.250> watching<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.760> live<00:03:40.000> we<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:40.870> see<00:03:41.140> that<00:03:41.320> it

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
been watching it live we can see that it

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.810 
been watching it live we can see that it
is<00:03:41.650> getting<00:03:42.269> smaller<00:03:43.269> on<00:03:43.630> one<00:03:43.660> side<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:45.430> the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
is getting smaller on one side of the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.390 
is getting smaller on one side of the
balloon<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.510> we<00:03:47.079> keep<00:03:47.620> cutting<00:03:48.070> in<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.310> out
