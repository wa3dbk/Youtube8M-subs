00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.780
 good 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.560
 although I think 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.820
 it's image 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.170
 of Bosnia in Georgia 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:59.010
 we have also wanted the neighborhoods 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:59.010
 the first person 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.810
 morning 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.810
 but later 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:30.380
 this week 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.920
 but let's go that by action 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.030
 with the fifth of South America 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.030
 absolutely exaggerated 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:52.820
 at 40 seconds 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.350
 but not 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.700
 why 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.910
 I have to be with the perfect one 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.240
 Canada 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.870
 do not 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.870
 now 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.810
 now they have to be able to develop 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.220
 after the presentation 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.450
 when it was held in madrid 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.480
 for its part 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.160
 but there is more 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.519
 the cpto or the third party flag allows 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.390
 but why but is this art really 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.650
 the abyss 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.780
 says goodbye to a lesson 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.180
 when I noticed what I'm saying 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.680
 I regret that one of the three later 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.680
 so I have to do it 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.980
 yes 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.600
 m 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.100
 d 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.199
