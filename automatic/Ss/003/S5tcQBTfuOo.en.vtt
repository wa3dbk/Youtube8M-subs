00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.770
 Watches are made 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.220
 as seen as dangerous 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.810
 as a wheel mounted not even like that 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.810
 many then there was the play 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.170
 maybe even as a motor of the lid 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:31.300
 on it and in the moment what is driving in these 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.830
 engine to these things Chinese is there 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.239
 of course as electronic in there 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.850
 a chip a computer chip rausgepickt 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.910
 from such a silicon disk on the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.500
 Thousands of them are up 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.070
 this whole computer is just going to be that way 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.059
 big as a fly but bring them 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.489
 can count well 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.649
 these bands their squares first 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.070
 get her golden legs the 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.410
 connections turned and that's what they are 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.119
 then connected with a quad this 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.119
 silvery little tube here 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.230
 a cross now can honey with something 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.580
 and generate very fast pulses 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.420
 tens of thousands per second and the computer 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.100
 child in the clock 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.160
 that's they represented him recently 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.540
 calculates on the seconds on it one 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.370
 pulse per second 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.120
 then drives a motor on the 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.540
 in turn, the pointer in there what then 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:38.240
 turn it is the quasi cool 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.240
 again exactly exactly quartz exactly 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.080
 what do you want to do now? 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.380
 do you want that peter who explains how 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.990
 you read the clock or do you want to 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.229
 Know how to build a sundial 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.939
 or do you want to go back to the cuckoo clock? 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.039
 or would you like to continue the car ? 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.390
 explore 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.239
 By the way, what Peter did not say 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.170
 is that a quad and that's why it's so good 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.150
 works because the quartz in one 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.180
 the same number of seconds 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.750
 are pulses that is, you just have to 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.849
 only count the number of pulses and 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.530
 then knows how many seconds have passed 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.150
 are 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.540
 you can even think about what 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.170
 clock you know and try with 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.870
 to measure these timers one minute 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.099
 features by contacts which the tactician measures 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.900
 for example, you could do one 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.910
 Dripping tap as a clock 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:53.620
 use or your heartbeat or one 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.030
 metronome ticking a clock 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.120
 but not all of these are clocks 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.090
 really good timers also tried 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.790
 a little bit on which clock 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.510
 are really good timers around the time 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.549
 to eat 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.940
 but now you should really continue 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.940
 click
