Logan Hamilton and davonne a record I
when<00:00:28.180> I<00:00:28.270> start<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.630> artwork<00:00:29.020> I<00:00:29.320> initially

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
when I start the artwork I initially

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.420 
when I start the artwork I initially
think<00:00:30.220> about<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.550> image<00:00:30.820> and<00:00:31.090> that<00:00:32.100> to<00:00:33.100> me<00:00:33.250> is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
think about the image and that to me is

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.719 
think about the image and that to me is
the<00:00:33.460> most<00:00:33.879> important<00:00:34.390> thing<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.550> if<00:00:36.640> that's

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:36.729 
the most important thing so if that's

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:37.889 
the most important thing so if that's
not<00:00:36.940> there<00:00:37.149> I<00:00:37.210> mean<00:00:37.420> I<00:00:37.479> could<00:00:37.659> put<00:00:37.780> those

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
not there I mean I could put those

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.739 
not there I mean I could put those
pieces<00:00:38.170> perfectly<00:00:38.769> on<00:00:39.460> there<00:00:39.850> have<00:00:40.629> the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.749 
pieces perfectly on there have the

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.189 
pieces perfectly on there have the
dopest<00:00:41.280> record<00:00:42.280> you<00:00:42.489> could<00:00:42.879> find<00:00:43.120> but<00:00:43.389> if<00:00:44.019> it

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
dopest record you could find but if it

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.319 
dopest record you could find but if it
doesn't<00:00:44.469> really<00:00:44.559> have<00:00:44.829> a<00:00:45.309> good<00:00:45.940> look<00:00:46.120> to<00:00:46.300> it

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
doesn't really have a good look to it

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.939
