00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello to all so today I am 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.550
 pleased to meet you to make you 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.530
 a video about the worst and the best of 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.240
 this time I'm going to attack if we 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.710
 can tell the maybelline brand that is 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.000
 a brand that I like a lot 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.439
 it is a brand still very 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.180
 affordable that we find in large 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.349
 surface or in pharmacy for quebec 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.910
 except that I still managed to 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.050
 find some very average products 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.359
 at home and I'm going right away 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.460
 started so with this mascara ci which is 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.510
 the mega rain is a mask to whom 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.740
 is still pretty popular because 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.390
 that at one point I saw a lot of 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.860
 pubs on youtube for the latter 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.059
 except that in fact it's a real 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.980
 disaster is that you have a 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.720
 handle that is not rigid but who 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.159
 contains as a kind of springs this 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.379
 which makes you see that's all 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.729
 flexible then like that I told myself that 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.870
 it is really nice and you 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.519
 actually it could give 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.320
 maybe an aspect a little bit 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.610
 innovative mascara make me you will not have 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.620
 not at all but then not really 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.449
 all that is to say that when you 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.979
 try putting the bore of voc 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.869
 take support and well no you have 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.059
 something that constantly moves you 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.500
 you put everywhere you put the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.330
 pink in the eye so it's really not 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.190
 practice to be frank I put it 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.990
 a few times and then froze completely 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.159
 dropped the room must do 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.659
 maybe six months so now he 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.460
 has become dry but it's really a 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.780
 mascara I did not like because the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.520
 brush is really not practical so I 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.869
 use them and also a little bit with 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.280
 a spare brush but still 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.049
 should you have a big spare 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.950
 but in any case this technology of 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.090
 bronze what moves 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.649
 I do not know what she is supposed to 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.479
 fit but in any case not your eyes 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.039
 then in the same category but 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.899
 this time a product that I love it 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.090
 is going to be rocket volume mascara that 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.500
 I find it really exceptional so I 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.509
 compares it much to that of home 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.369
 beneficial the zero nothing because everything 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.530
 simply the brushes are not 100% 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.520
 identical but in terms of the result on 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.380
 the eye I find it still enough 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.659
 similar then it's a little brush 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.280
 with pimples personally I 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.990
 prefers pico because I find that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.240
 it better defines the eyelashes and 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.069
 especially bring them a little side 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.359
 little more neat after it's really 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.740
 according to your eyelashes and according to what you 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.780
 prefer a weight I would like to add 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.060
 to that for mascara did not listen to me 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.369
 a listening and people that is to say that 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.020
 I can find a great mascara and 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.549
 you can hate it and vice 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.130
 versa it's really something 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.719
 very personal that will match the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.549
 how you apply mascara and 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.869
 especially to your lashes mascara if I have them 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.460
 love but I saw a lot of girls who 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.450
 hated him so do not take it all 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.710
 what I say for granted for in 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.810
 back to mascara what I like 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.980
 really with this one is that the fact 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.870
 that there are other picks 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.310
 it really comes to define them and especially 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.000
 to bring them volume but without 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.739
 do too much 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.209
 it's a mascara that can be applied 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.650
 in one go and you're not going 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.010
 to have diapers and especially plenty of 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.659
 lumps 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.280
 the only small drawback and it's for 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.260
 that at the beginning I hate them is that 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.730
 the pimples are extremely thin and 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.830
 when you tend to really 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.540
 glued the brush of your mascara to the 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.340
 root of your eyelashes that a little bit 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.660
 tickle you see irritate you 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.400
 watch out I do not say that at all 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.420
 horribly bad but it's true 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.650
 that the first few times I 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.360
 use and I found that a little bit 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.010
 a little embarrassing because really 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.150
 it tickles me is what he did in 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.500
 so that I tended a little bit 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.209
 to close my eyelid and soul to put 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.739
 everywhere but it's just a helping hand 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.569
 to take and it's really for me a 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.069
 the best mascara ironing on the flop 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.019
 and then associate what is it 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.359
 it is a foundation so seduced muse 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.980
 but I know that there is the dream 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.569
 satin that is really pretty similar 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.849
 I also tested them and he is 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.930
 just as much hated just i think that 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.670
 I threw because I is 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.049
 more and it's a foundation that has me 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.329
 much tempted by what he presents himself 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.519
 with a little pump and it's really 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.079
 that's how you'll see a moss 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.660
 and me it's something that I find 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.700
 nice enough and I thought it's ok 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.680
 surely bring a very velvety look 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.910
 very soft skin concretely that 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.280
 looks a little bit like whipped cream and 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.870
 I may have been greedy hopefuls that 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.940
 I'm it was going a little bit to be 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.169
 revolutionary is awesome actually no 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.579
 not at all you do not feel 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.349
 to apply two whipped cream 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.819
 I think it's a foundation that 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.440
 has very little coverage and who 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.579
 oxidizes very quickly so that's a 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.660
 characteristic that can be found 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.319
 in the small foundation little bit of 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.959
 bad quality 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.669
 in my opinion because when you go 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.709
 actually apply it's going to be at 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.760
 pretty much to the color of your skin so 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.180
 of course you choose the right one 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.160
 color 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.079
 but over the hours you will see 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.519
 that it's going a little bit this fund is 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.290
 become orange is so it's really 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.760
 what I do not like especially that there is no 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.290
 of coverage I do not think he has big 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.239
 interest does not come to camouflage your 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.739
 imperfections your skin is not 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.060
 necessarily more beautiful is the contrary 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.500
 the more hours pass and the more you 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.450
 tend to become a little bit 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.010
 orange what is for me not really 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.239
 the effect I'm looking for the most 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.169
 natural world so it's not 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.590
 really foundation I you 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.910
 recommended 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.590
 and in this regard I have never seen on 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.940
 youtube a girl was talking about this product 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.889
 so tell me if you know any 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.389
 youtube buzz who did a review or 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.650
 who have already mentioned this product because 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.880
 that for my part I think it's a 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.229
 little bit the foundation of which we did not 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.270
 never really heard about it we're going 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.670
 return to favorites and this red to 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.290
 lips 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.030
 so this is the vivid range and it's 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.370
 really a range that I you 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.110
 100% recommend because they are 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.370
 super good lipstick then they 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.480
 are a little bit scented it takes 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.980
 appreciate but the smell is not no 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.430
 more very strong and it does not stay on 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.110
 the lips 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.550
 but what I like is that they are 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.830
 created but just right 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.450
 that is, they will be easy 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.590
 Matte lipsticks in application 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.900
 general tend not to be a small 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.070
 little dry there is not this problem but 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.960
 however, you still have a 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.150
 long-lasting and especially a very color 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.680
 vibrating ultra really seeing some 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.450
 very pigmented thing so if you 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.370
 looking for lipstick mud that are 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.720
 with very summery colors really 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.520
 I recommend it to you at 1000% 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.990
 some colors I need a little bit 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.820
 think about what can be found at mac 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.200
 in the fault amp range but really 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.340
 the price is not the same so that I 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.810
 you recommend it to a thousand sounds of a 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.940
 other favorite I have from maybelline 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.130
 seller powder and matt that I find 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.510
 really very very good if you have a 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.610
 skin that tends a little bit to 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.260
 regret c but still time you 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.060
 do not want to apply a powder 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.400
 who is going to see that is to say that this one 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.200
 and I find it really visible when 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.550
 you put it on your skin it does not 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.050
 not add a coverage 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.820
 extra is really not getting 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.530
 not perceive but for all that and you 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.150
 ensures a matte complexion for all 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.440
 the day you can apply it either 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.540
 with a puff for a little bit 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.950
 more coverage or brushing and in 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.750
 this case there you will really have a 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.460
 very natural result that does not go 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.050
 everything to see especially it is well worth 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.670
 the powders much more expensive than one 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.870
 can find in perfumery and then the 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.880
 last positive point is that she 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.020
 contains a mirror and a place for 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.340
 put the puff and that I find that 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.660
 very practical since I'm the kind 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.560
 of powder that I take when I go 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.340
 in progress and that I need to do 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.780
 some retouching 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.340
 she's solid so it's really a 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.810
 tip-top powder to slip into your bag 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.310
 to avoid brive is the last 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.900
 favorite that I had to speak to you 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.460
 in the brand gemey maybelline and I 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.620
 am sure you all know 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.110
 this occurs are obviously the 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.520
 color tattoo for me with the vivid this 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.890
 are really both products a little 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.930
 little emblematic that I find can 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.340
 quite competing with 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.990
 very very expensive products and I find them 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.960
 even better this is waves a 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.280
 little modulable so a texture that 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.930
 come up a little bit of deschanel 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.150
 although this one i would tell you are a 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.590
 little bit drier but they are 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.900
 eye shadows very convenient for 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.700
 you make a pretty simple look 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.380
 finally worked enough at the same time 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.670
 something that is not going to take you 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.569
 hours most of their colors 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.069
 are iridescent 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.809
 that's very practical since when you 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.279
 put it on your mobile eyelid that 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:36.569
 be it with your finger or brush 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.979
 really happen with something 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.389
 full of reflections and especially some 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.309
 thing that is enough is not at all 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.869
 basic need to heaven I find 

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:44.999
 wonderfully well not at all 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.949
 tendency to cook so if you seek 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:48.569
 mono shadows that you do not have 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.189
 necessarily want to invest in the map 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.879
 where that kind of mark that can be a 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:52.469
 little bit more expensive 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.909
 really the theater glitters where I you 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.919
 recommend it because they are simple 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:57.360
 of use it does not cost very much 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.279
 you have a very choice of colors 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.599
 showy like blue or glass but 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:01.619
 also a very neutral color choice 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:03.719
 and for me these are shadows to 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:05.249
 Perfect eyelids of my video is finished 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:06.839
 I really hope she pleased you and 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:07.709
 and then before you leave because I 

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:09.839
 do not say it often 

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:11.399
 if you ever have queries for 

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:12.809
 have special videos where you have 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.069
 simply ideas to suggest me 

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:15.539
 was not to join him on the 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.459
 social networks be it on twitter 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:18.809
 or on facebook because it makes me 

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:20.669
 very pleasure sometimes to receive 

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.839
 some of your ideas so on this 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.110
 I make you all very very big 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:24.110
 kisses
