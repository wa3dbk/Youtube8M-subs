00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.260
 welcome to a new gameplay of 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:09.670
 dragon ball 0 time and peak does not stop 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.860
 chase mail does not let me do the 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.050
 presentation of the video at pleasure stop 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.940
 chase me itch or in the video of the day 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.230
 today we will see good in view of that 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.019
 It does not leave me alone and I'm going to 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.699
 teach let's see the technique that is the 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.159
 final attack of jeans and it's called 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.320
 crushing volcano is the technique that 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:29.079
 I want to show today and what an itch 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.239
 or it does not let me show you it's called a volcano 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.789
 crushed and consists of throwing many 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.760
 balls and in the end throw a ball 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.289
 bigger than all the others but the 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.690
 technique is not too powerful and 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.910
 see, I'm going to apply it to goku and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.059
 watch to see if I can kill him 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.620
 completely there, stay still and I'm going to 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.160
 try to apply the whole technique 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.920
 complete pum pum pum pum pum and set 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.750
 did not die well because the technique in 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.969
 reality is not too powerful but 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.670
 you asked me and I with all the 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.180
 taste of the world because I upload the technique and 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.560
 I tell them what they do to get the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.450
 technique you get the mission 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.270
 secondary number 18 that yes 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.189
 the return of force genius and is in 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.590
 quite easy reality to get the 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.630
 technique because they give it to you from the beginning 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.899
 that is, your first objective in the mission 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.210
 is to defeat the bulge and defeat chalk if 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.560
 you stick a beating to chubby 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.920
 fat, he's going to attack you 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.630
 special that is with which he stops a 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.549
 attack with which he can stop the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.740
 time or paralyzes the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.600
 enemies and if you give him a good beating 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.819
 there if it gives you its final attack that 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.380
 It's a crushing volcano, so I 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.110
 when I started the mission 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.399
 ignore goal is not to say I turned around 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.659
 because I had already obtained the technique of 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.229
 him so I turned him around and I went 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.149
 about the little gray-haired rojito de gis y 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.750
 he got him a savage beating and 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.819
 defeat him when good by defeating him if 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.530
 I did not get the tag you got 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.539
 skill because what he was doing was 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.429
 restart the mission is to say mate there 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.259
 you did not show me you got skill 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.239
 I restart the mission and come back again 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.159
 from the beginning I will kill again 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.890
 there and if it did not appear again I return 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.500
 to repeat as to the three attempts of 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.740
 kill there is to say I did not take nor 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.270
 even a minute or 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.090
 minute in getting the technique because 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.950
 between the material I started the mission and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.020
 the third time when I killed him I already 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.430
 appeared you got skill and once 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.050
 they gave it to me so I do not worry anymore 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.780
 why simply defeat there and 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.460
 Defeat acutely and defeat all 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.130
 other enemies that appeared without 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.900
 matter if the objective appeared 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.790
 secondary or not that if it appeared but 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.260
 in reality that was not important anymore 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.420
 because I had already obtained the technique 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.460
 the only thing you have to do in that 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.840
 moment is to end suffering 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.240
 of each and every one of those involved 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.370
 or of the members of the forces 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.250
 guineos and at the end of the mission you will 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.670
 appear the legend that you dominate you a 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.290
 new definitive attack and it's the volcano 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.910
 crusher while the technique is not 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.800
 too powerful because then in 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.840
 reality already for those of us who are level 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.700
 higher we will realize that the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.670
 technique actually lowers a cochinada 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.100
 of blood but if you just started the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.020
 game the technique is within the 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.300
 standard of what the attacks have 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.090
 Definitive of the beginning are few 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.560
 definitive attacks 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.060
 is to get to the beginning that fall 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.430
 a lot of blood for example of the most 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.110
 strong is the ultra bombing fight and the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.260
 Blue hurricane depends if you have super 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.660
 hits or you have super burst ski but 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.510
 this technique of the crushing volcano 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.310
 is within the standard of techniques 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.010
 what can you get if you've 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.930
 got if you've just started with 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.910
 the game if it has been playing for a while and 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.400
 you are of a higher level because it suits you 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.019
 better get another kind of skills 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.849
 that you can get into the channel in 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.400
 tutorials or the guides that I have uploaded from 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.040
 how to get certain skills and there are 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.810
 techniques that are pretty good and so 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.280
 So, nothing here, I'm going to leave the 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.959
 today's video I hope that you 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.390
 I know you liked some time ago not 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.829
 they went up to the dragon bolseo bears because they did not 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.299
 I could have recorded it as a 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.549
 apology very big because there was no 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.319
 could record dragon ball 0 times but 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.860
 we are going to be back with this 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.629
 nice game that I like and I sent 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.190
 a call for facebook and for 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.889
 twitter so they left me there their 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.690
 voting that you would like matches 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.479
 see either of secondary missions or of 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.669
 one-on-one or team matches 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.170

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.580
 I 'll leave it here 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.380
