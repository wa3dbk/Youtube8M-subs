00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
there'll be a whole chapter based just

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.970 
there'll be a whole chapter based just
on<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.270> cut<00:02:15.570> there's<00:02:16.440> nothing<00:02:16.860> like

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
on that one cut there's nothing like

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.730 
on that one cut there's nothing like
that<00:02:17.160> there's<00:02:17.370> no<00:02:17.430> education<00:02:18.240> because<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
that there's no education because the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.000 
that there's no education because the
less<00:02:20.150> education<00:02:21.150> we<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.410> less<00:02:22.680> ability

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
less education we have the less ability

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.650 
less education we have the less ability
we<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.610> get<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.000> product<00:02:24.420> because

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
we have to get the product because

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.180 
we have to get the product because
nobody<00:02:25.020> goes<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.380> store<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.620> asks<00:02:25.980> court

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
nobody goes to the store and asks court

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.360 
nobody goes to the store and asks court
so<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.600> less<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:28.020> sold<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.710> easier<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.190> for

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
so the less it's sold the easier is for

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.100 
so the less it's sold the easier is for
the<00:02:29.460> USDA<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.940> say<00:02:30.120> fuck<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.480> were<00:02:30.720> taking<00:02:30.990> it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
the USDA to say fuck you were taking it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.360 
the USDA to say fuck you were taking it
out<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.350> system<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.010> then<00:02:32.190> we're<00:02:32.280> going

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
out of the system and then we're going

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.940 
out of the system and then we're going
to<00:02:32.430> sell<00:02:32.640> them<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:34.440> project<00:02:34.710> has
