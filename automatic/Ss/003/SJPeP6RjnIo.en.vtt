00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.019 
see to DC from a lower voltage to a high
voltage<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.550> I<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.940> three<00:00:22.640> double-a<00:00:23.640> cells

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
voltage and I have three double-a cells

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.870 
voltage and I have three double-a cells
here<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.890> connected<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.010> series<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.670> it's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
here and connected in series so it's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.210 
here and connected in series so it's
about<00:00:27.320> three<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.619> four<00:00:28.880> popes<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:31.220> the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
about three to four popes and the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.020 
about three to four popes and the
minimum<00:00:32.870> voltage<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.250> one

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
minimum voltage that you have on one

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.770 
minimum voltage that you have on one
side<00:00:36.330> for<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.930> step<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:37.860> converter<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.780> 3.5

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
side for this step up converter is 3.5

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.500 
side for this step up converter is 3.5
volt<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:41.540> I<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:43.890> four<00:00:44.610> LEDs<00:00:45.239> can

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
volt so I have these four LEDs can

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.960 
volt so I have these four LEDs can
connect<00:00:46.199> it<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.500> series<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.640> come<00:00:47.790> to

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
connect it in series so they come to

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.720 
connect it in series so they come to
about<00:00:48.180> 12<00:00:48.570> volts<00:00:49.040> 12-point<00:00:50.390> actually<00:00:52.730> 3.3

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
about 12 volts 12-point actually 3.3

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.330 
about 12 volts 12-point actually 3.3
volts<00:00:54.120> each<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.540> should<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:55.760> 13.2<00:00:56.760> voc's<00:00:57.170> so

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
volts each it should be 13.2 voc's so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.209 
volts each it should be 13.2 voc's so
with<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.520> converter<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.360> was<00:01:00.960> able<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.620> boost

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
with this converter I was able to boost

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.430 
with this converter I was able to boost
the<00:01:02.430> voltage<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.180> increase<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> voltage<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
the voltage or increase the voltage to

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.719 
the voltage or increase the voltage to
13<00:01:04.890> volts<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.750> that<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.200> other<00:01:07.320> video

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
13 volts and that was in my other video

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
13 volts and that was in my other video
my<00:01:08.729> concern<00:01:09.240> was<00:01:09.539> I<00:01:09.869> wasn't<00:01:10.289> sure<00:01:10.440> exactly<00:01:10.560> how

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
my concern was I wasn't sure exactly how

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.630 
my concern was I wasn't sure exactly how
much<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.729> drawing<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:15.500> LEDs<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:17.160> it<00:01:17.399> would

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
much it was drawing the LEDs if it would

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.639 
much it was drawing the LEDs if it would
be<00:01:18.630> regulated<00:01:19.410> by<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.860> voltage<00:01:21.649> converter

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
be regulated by this voltage converter

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.410 
be regulated by this voltage converter
so<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:24.259> got<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.470> watt<00:01:26.160> meter<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.729> other<00:01:26.880> day<00:01:27.119> I

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
so I got this watt meter the other day I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.990 
so I got this watt meter the other day I
just<00:01:27.899> got<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> actually<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:31.039> so<00:01:32.039> I<00:01:32.069> got<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
just got it actually and so I got a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.230 
just got it actually and so I got a
chance<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> measure<00:01:33.959> the<00:01:34.289> actual<00:01:34.849> draw<00:01:35.849> of<00:01:36.209> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
chance to measure the actual draw of the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.410 
chance to measure the actual draw of the
LED<00:01:36.959> so<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.640> at<00:01:38.849> about<00:01:39.470> 12.5<00:01:40.470> bolt

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
LED so you see here at about 12.5 bolt

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.900 
LED so you see here at about 12.5 bolt
it's<00:01:42.420> drawing<00:01:43.640> about<00:01:44.840> 10<00:01:45.840> milliamps<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:48.410> this

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
it's drawing about 10 milliamps and this

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.059 
it's drawing about 10 milliamps and this
step<00:01:50.910> up<00:01:50.940> converter<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.380> adjust<00:01:52.679> the

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
step up converter you can adjust the

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.859 
step up converter you can adjust the
voltage<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:54.330> can<00:01:54.360> increase<00:01:54.840> from<00:01:55.849> 42<00:01:56.849> over<00:01:57.420> 15

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
voltage you can increase from 42 over 15

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.580 
voltage you can increase from 42 over 15
volts<00:01:58.319> I<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:58.739> I<00:01:58.950> mentioned<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.880> my<00:01:59.910> other<00:02:00.239> video

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
volts I as I mentioned in my other video

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.290 
volts I as I mentioned in my other video
so<00:02:01.590> I'm<00:02:01.739> just<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.250> increase<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
so I'm just going to increase the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.580 
so I'm just going to increase the
voltage<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:05.580> see<00:02:05.789> what<00:02:06.060> kind<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.450> draw<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
voltage and to see what kind of draw it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.890 
voltage and to see what kind of draw it
would<00:02:07.920> get<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> increase<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.989> voltage<00:02:11.900> so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
would get when I increase the voltage so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.760 
would get when I increase the voltage so
I<00:02:12.959> turn<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.650> pot<00:02:14.270> counterclockwise<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:16.590> can

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
I turn this pot counterclockwise you can

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:26.259 
I turn this pot counterclockwise you can
see<00:02:17.010> 12<00:02:17.400> a-12<00:02:18.260> 913<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:22.219> at<00:02:23.219> about<00:02:24.019> 13<00:02:25.019> point<00:02:25.709> 16

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
see 12 a-12 913 so at about 13 point 16

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.520 
see 12 a-12 913 so at about 13 point 16
volt

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
volt

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.550 
volt
it<00:02:28.459> draws<00:02:28.700> about<00:02:29.150> 20<00:02:30.080> milliamps<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:32.560> that's

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
it draws about 20 milliamps and that's

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.220 
it draws about 20 milliamps and that's
about<00:02:33.880> point2<00:02:34.880> wats<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.300> can<00:02:38.660> lower<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.080> down

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
about point2 wats so I can lower it down

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.360 
about point2 wats so I can lower it down
just<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.340> tad<00:02:44.410> because<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.590> rating<00:02:45.980> for<00:02:46.190> these

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
just a tad because the rating for these

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.470 
just a tad because the rating for these
LEDs<00:02:47.239> are<00:02:47.569> 20<00:02:48.319> milliamps<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.270> that's<00:02:50.270> what

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
LEDs are 20 milliamps and that's what

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.720 
LEDs are 20 milliamps and that's what
that's<00:02:51.170> what<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.380> want<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.800> don't<00:02:51.860> want<00:02:52.040> too<00:02:52.550> much

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
that's what I want I don't want too much

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.479 
that's what I want I don't want too much
power<00:02:53.180> going<00:02:53.540> into<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:54.260> or<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.620> could<00:02:55.010> burn<00:02:55.280> up

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
power going into it or I could burn up

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.210 
power going into it or I could burn up
the<00:02:55.520> LEDs<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:57.140> wanted<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.500> make<00:02:57.709> sure<00:02:57.770> that

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
the LEDs and I wanted to make sure that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.810 
the LEDs and I wanted to make sure that
this<00:02:59.090> converter<00:02:59.690> can<00:03:00.380> indeed<00:03:00.830> regulate<00:03:01.610> the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
this converter can indeed regulate the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.370 
this converter can indeed regulate the
voltage<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.830> can<00:03:03.860> see<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:05.510> LEDs<00:03:05.959> are<00:03:06.170> very

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
voltage you can see the LEDs are very

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.840 
voltage you can see the LEDs are very
bright<00:03:06.830> at<00:03:07.640> this<00:03:07.940> voltage<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.130> just<00:03:10.430> low<00:03:10.670> it

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
bright at this voltage so I just low it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.170 
bright at this voltage so I just low it
a<00:03:10.970> little<00:03:11.390> bit<00:03:11.870> maybe<00:03:12.680> about<00:03:12.980> 13<00:03:13.519> books<00:03:13.850> it

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
a little bit maybe about 13 books it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.330 
a little bit maybe about 13 books it
would<00:03:14.330> roll<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:16.660> 20<00:03:17.660> milliamps<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.040> that's

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
would roll just 20 milliamps and that's

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.190 
would roll just 20 milliamps and that's
about<00:03:19.610> what<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:19.850> want<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.819> important<00:03:23.420> if<00:03:23.660> I

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
about what I want this is important if I

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.559 
about what I want this is important if I
want<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.590> use<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:25.010> as<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:28.030> power<00:03:29.030> supply<00:03:29.269> or

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
want to use this as a power supply or

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.630 
want to use this as a power supply or
regulated<00:03:30.560> power<00:03:30.739> supply<00:03:33.220> for<00:03:34.220> something

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
regulated power supply for something

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.920 
regulated power supply for something
that<00:03:35.360> has<00:03:35.570> these<00:03:35.900> smaller<00:03:37.299> need<00:03:38.299> like<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.600> five

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
that has these smaller need like a five

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.170 
that has these smaller need like a five
bolt<00:03:39.260> by<00:03:39.890> bolt<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:40.370> want<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.640> make<00:03:40.760> sure<00:03:40.790> it

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
bolt by bolt I want to make sure it

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.380 
bolt by bolt I want to make sure it
doesn't<00:03:41.560> draw<00:03:42.560> more<00:03:43.190> than<00:03:43.340> like<00:03:43.519> half<00:03:44.000> an<00:03:44.180> amp

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
doesn't draw more than like half an amp

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.610 
doesn't draw more than like half an amp
and<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.900> forth<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.290> so<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.840> wasn't

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
and so forth and so on you I just wasn't

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.670 
and so forth and so on you I just wasn't
sure<00:03:51.829> if<00:03:52.760> this<00:03:53.000> thing<00:03:53.299> is<00:03:53.930> giving<00:03:54.290> me<00:03:54.470> the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
sure if this thing is giving me the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.530 
sure if this thing is giving me the
correct<00:03:55.459> role<00:03:55.910> in<00:03:56.180> terms<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:57.880> in<00:03:58.880> terms<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.390> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
correct role in terms of in terms of the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.849 
correct role in terms of in terms of the
amperage<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:01.329> this<00:04:02.329> Ward<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:03.320> what<00:04:03.590> meter

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
amperage and this Ward this what meter

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.920 
amperage and this Ward this what meter
that<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:04.160> just<00:04:04.430> got<00:04:04.700> would<00:04:05.030> give<00:04:05.480> me<00:04:05.630> all<00:04:05.780> the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
that I just got would give me all the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.120 
that I just got would give me all the
information<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.650> need<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:09.290> voltage<00:04:09.680> as<00:04:09.890> well

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
information I need the voltage as well

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.440 
information I need the voltage as well
as<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.519> amperage<00:04:10.989> so<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.940> should<00:04:13.940> be<00:04:13.970> able<00:04:14.150> to

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
as the amperage so I should be able to

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.569 
as the amperage so I should be able to
use<00:04:14.630> this<00:04:14.780> with<00:04:15.019> my<00:04:15.230> would<00:04:15.470> wind<00:04:15.829> turbine<00:04:16.310> too

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
use this with my would wind turbine too

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.539 
use this with my would wind turbine too
so<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:16.910> can<00:04:17.150> measure<00:04:17.900> what<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.470> voltage<00:04:18.979> is<00:04:19.160> as

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
so I can measure what the voltage is as

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.120 
so I can measure what the voltage is as
well<00:04:19.820> as<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.739> output<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:22.039> the<00:04:22.460> wind<00:04:23.090> turbine

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
well as the output of the wind turbine

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.700 
well as the output of the wind turbine
so<00:04:26.620> yeah<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.979> seems<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.490> be<00:04:28.520> working<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.680> have<00:04:30.680> a

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
so yeah it seems to be working I have a

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.940 
so yeah it seems to be working I have a
suspicion<00:04:31.070> that<00:04:31.580> this<00:04:31.910> was<00:04:32.180> working<00:04:32.570> ok<00:04:33.610> as<00:04:34.610> a

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
suspicion that this was working ok as a

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.180 
suspicion that this was working ok as a
voltage<00:04:36.950> regulator<00:04:37.460> and

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
voltage regulator and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.770 
voltage regulator and
the<00:04:39.730> amperage<00:04:40.180> seems<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.840> be<00:04:40.990> very<00:04:41.020> steady<00:04:41.740> at

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
the amperage seems to be very steady at

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.860 
the amperage seems to be very steady at
20<00:04:43.780> milliamps<00:04:44.670> if<00:04:45.670> I<00:04:45.850> lower<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.360> voltage<00:04:46.540> it

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
20 milliamps if I lower the voltage it

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.670 
20 milliamps if I lower the voltage it
would<00:04:46.990> be<00:04:47.140> even<00:04:47.470> less<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:48.450> just<00:04:49.500> turn<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.650> clock

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
would be even less I just turn the clock

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:59.640 
would be even less I just turn the clock
wise<00:04:55.140> 12-1<00:04:56.610> 12.5<00:04:57.610> volts<00:04:58.060> it's<00:04:58.840> about<00:04:58.990> little

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
wise 12-1 12.5 volts it's about little

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:06.450 
wise 12-1 12.5 volts it's about little
over<00:05:01.440> 10<00:05:02.440> milliamps<00:05:03.270> point<00:05:04.270> 11<00:05:05.310> step<00:05:06.310> up

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
over 10 milliamps point 11 step up

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.940 
over 10 milliamps point 11 step up
converter<00:05:06.640> cause<00:05:07.360> only<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.810> few<00:05:08.050> dollars<00:05:08.350> and

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
converter cause only a few dollars and

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.300 
converter cause only a few dollars and
it<00:05:09.850> basically<00:05:10.000> uses<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:12.330> 2577<00:05:13.330> chip<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:15.280> can

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
it basically uses the 2577 chip you can

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.690 
it basically uses the 2577 chip you can
bind<00:05:15.760> for<00:05:16.090> five<00:05:16.840> to<00:05:17.050> ten<00:05:17.080> dollars<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.890> it<00:05:18.400> can

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
bind for five to ten dollars it it can

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.240 
bind for five to ten dollars it it can
handle<00:05:19.420> up<00:05:19.810> to<00:05:19.840> 60<00:05:20.380> watts<00:05:20.640> according<00:05:21.640> to<00:05:21.670> the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
handle up to 60 watts according to the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.290 
handle up to 60 watts according to the
specification<00:05:24.450> so<00:05:26.370> there's<00:05:27.370> no<00:05:27.520> problem<00:05:28.030> if

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
specification so there's no problem if

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.930 
specification so there's no problem if
you're<00:05:28.480> just<00:05:28.690> using<00:05:28.980> it<00:05:29.980> as<00:05:30.070> a<00:05:30.280> charger<00:05:30.910> for

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
you're just using it as a charger for

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.640 
you're just using it as a charger for
something<00:05:32.250> something<00:05:33.250> light
