a<00:01:40.750> great<00:01:41.020> idea<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.440> do<00:01:41.560> so<00:01:41.770> now<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.190> as<00:01:42.310> we<00:01:42.490> all

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
a great idea to do so now and as we all

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.280 
a great idea to do so now and as we all
know<00:01:42.730> that<00:01:42.880> these<00:01:43.240> food<00:01:43.480> prices<00:01:43.750> are<00:01:43.930> going<00:01:44.080> up

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
know that these food prices are going up

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.480 
know that these food prices are going up
and<00:01:44.410> up<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.680> up<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:44.800> they're<00:01:45.220> not<00:01:45.340> going<00:01:45.460> to

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
and up and up so they're not going to

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.280 
and up and up so they're not going to
probably<00:01:45.820> get<00:01:45.970> any<00:01:46.150> cheaper<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.080> product

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
probably get any cheaper and a product

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.310

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
really a low supply because it's

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.670
