and<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.240> angle<00:01:33.420> right<00:01:33.690> here<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.050> looks

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
and from this angle right here it looks

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.020 
and from this angle right here it looks
like<00:01:34.350> all<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.130> cards<00:01:35.400> are<00:01:35.520> actually<00:01:35.820> faced

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like all the cards are actually faced

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.360 
like all the cards are actually faced
