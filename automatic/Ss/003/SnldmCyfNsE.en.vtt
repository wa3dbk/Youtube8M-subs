it very compelling and it's basically

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.810 
it very compelling and it's basically
like<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> piece<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.829> art<00:00:38.040> almost<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.610> vase

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the highest volume setting so it does

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.119 
the highest volume setting so it does
