00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.799
 Hello friends today I would like 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.259
 share with you theories of 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.160
 overcoming so we can understand what 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.920
 is happening 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.939
 At the tip of your profile we need to look 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.750
 at the needle point below the 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:32.320
 microscope these little pieces of cielito 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 that tape us if we see it 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.289
 Profile 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.300
 this is my needle point is the one that most 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:46.010
 and we tested a microscope with a magnifying glass 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.010
 so this after 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:56.359
 We met formaldehyde with grain 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.359
 I feel like this is 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.900
 very thick the tip is very thick and this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.720
 to push to push kill nova 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.460
 short and that's why when we have something 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.160
 we help tool then what 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.470
 we try so if it has edge and so if it is 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.880
 soft this I do not want much to try because 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.880
 like the super sharp 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.330
 then as the world we know 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.020
 while one day 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.539
 they have grains 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.939
 with 300 180 with 500 then we know the 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.350
 Famous little pebble, very soft, I feel 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.350
 look like glass 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.090
 start natural reach 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.359
 we have the magic lame 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.820
 if you get up to aggressive you have 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.820
 2500 grains 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.410
 500 what thing about that these grains about 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.020
 how many bits of abrasive grains 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.120
 work on one-inch surface 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.400
 so if we have 100 grams we have 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.650
 larger particles and obviously 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:27.599
 attentive one inch only if not 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.599
 we have finer grain is more 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.830
 finite grains 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.440
 work on surface if we activate 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.710
 our formed a Serbian sheet with 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.150
 land with 100 grain this is that we have 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.150
 here to understand 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.970
 this line 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.140
 then when we did it with grain 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:01.300
 100 that's the thickness of the tip that I edge 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.989
 battery then this will not cost 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.849
 this is a final poster that you are going to 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.140
 wood and it is going to way up 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.450
 of asia if one already took a 500 pebble 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.740
 then as being thinner more 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:23.140
 particles 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.140
 to work a little better but still 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.280
 Kill it is going to punish because 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.170
 it is also caterpillar 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:38.819
 this is a thousand bevel where these I 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:42.349
 I would like courts and piedritas 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.349
 I already have more boys 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:51.200
 then it is closer to us no 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.860
 they are both so thick is finite and 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.040
 so you can notice that the mind already 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.990
 especially the summits already finally 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.940
 they have the oatmeal if still this is a 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:09.070
 notice if this has been seen with precise 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.840
 bank so I still feel better but 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.790
 when he starts learning about 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.289
 flowering 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.750
 and emotion affiliation systems 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:24.699
 here until now while it had 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.699
 sense was improved more 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.550
 i 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.680
 I could not believe it was still improved almost 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.729
 perfect but after having tried 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.220
 this for this action not as it is more 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.080
 fine 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.009
 then to I'm closer 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.879
 I'm not feeling I could still feel 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.719
 the best all then when the next 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:58.660
 is that the city has the history mind 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:02.170
 to be able to see 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:06.340
 my videos here I will put a link 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:10.780
 a photo of glasses sharpening complete with 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.060
 Stones 100 500 cards and with disks 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.200
 mini has no more no minutes ahead 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.080
 here you go you can click and 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:23.800
 also here I put another video 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.740
 with only sharpening with the discs cob 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.250
 so that you can watch how much time 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.330
 delay in centralia 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.520
 before I forget 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.990
 If you like this video please to 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.810
 cambric 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.960
 there is a tool called cause or me 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.050
 like pressed if you like this 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.240
 he also writes in the comments 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.639
 or you can subscribe to our channel to 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.659
 Be informed when there are new videos 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.659
 until next year
