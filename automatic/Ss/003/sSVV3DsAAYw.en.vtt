00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
back this reminded me of Oz the great

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.510 
back this reminded me of Oz the great
and<00:01:30.659> powerful<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:31.079> little<00:01:31.350> bit<00:01:31.470> yeah<00:01:31.890> did<00:01:32.430> he

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and powerful a little bit yeah did he

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.440 
and powerful a little bit yeah did he
work<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.090> another<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.689> me<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
work on that one another for me and so I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.010 
work on that one another for me and so I
and<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.289> really<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:38.430> complaint<00:01:38.939> yeah<00:01:39.630> I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and that's not really a complaint yeah I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.419 
and that's not really a complaint yeah I
mean<00:01:40.140> those<00:01:40.289> aren't<00:01:40.470> too<00:01:40.770> visually<00:01:41.220> striking

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
mean those aren't too visually striking

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.560 
mean those aren't too visually striking
right

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
right

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.730 
right
so<00:01:44.200> I'm<00:01:44.470> assuming<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:45.160> is<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:46.740> origin

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
so I'm assuming that this is the origin

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.130 
so I'm assuming that this is the origin
story<00:01:48.160> of<00:01:48.510> Maleficent<00:01:49.510> yes<00:01:50.260> how<00:01:50.650> she<00:01:50.710> became

her not unlike wicked I think it's right

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.350 
her not unlike wicked I think it's right
trying<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.400> be<00:02:12.460> like<00:02:12.580> an<00:02:12.700> origin<00:02:13.060> story<00:02:13.300> for

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
trying to be like an origin story for

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.080 
trying to be like an origin story for
what<00:02:13.960> we<00:02:14.140> always<00:02:14.710> assumed<00:02:15.100> was<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.340> right<00:02:15.550> yeah

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
what we always assumed was it right yeah

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.550 
what we always assumed was it right yeah
absolutely<00:02:16.420> yeah<00:02:16.959> that's<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.260> really<00:02:17.470> good

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
absolutely yeah that's a really good

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.210 
absolutely yeah that's a really good
point<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:17.980> it's<00:02:18.280> probably<00:02:19.620> gonna<00:02:20.620> tell<00:02:21.010> us<00:02:21.130> a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220

those<00:02:51.100> exist<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.230> fact<00:02:53.410> that

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
those exist and I like the fact that

yeah like but you can see the horns and

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.280 
yeah like but you can see the horns and
they're<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:00.310> iconic<00:03:00.640> yeah<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.390> mean<00:03:01.870> they<00:03:02.020> could

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
they're so iconic yeah I mean they could

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.260 
they're so iconic yeah I mean they could
have<00:03:02.320> made<00:03:02.770> her<00:03:02.980> just<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.310> towering<00:03:03.700> figure<00:03:04.000> but

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
have made her just a towering figure but

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.390 
have made her just a towering figure but
he<00:03:04.300> has<00:03:04.510> not<00:03:04.780> -<00:03:04.960> and<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.410> actually<00:03:05.740> maybe<00:03:06.100> she's

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
he has not - and I actually maybe she's

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.000 
he has not - and I actually maybe she's
a<00:03:06.430> little<00:03:06.640> more<00:03:06.910> menacing<00:03:07.180> yeah<00:03:07.810> because<00:03:08.200> she

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
a little more menacing yeah because she

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.860 
a little more menacing yeah because she
does<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.490> mean<00:03:09.640> in<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.090> animated<00:03:10.420> films<00:03:10.720> she

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
does I mean in the animated films she

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.840 
does I mean in the animated films she
turns<00:03:11.110> into<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.380> dragon<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.040> maybe<00:03:12.250> if<00:03:12.550> she<00:03:12.700> does

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
turns into a dragon so maybe if she does

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.280 
turns into a dragon so maybe if she does
turn<00:03:13.030> into<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.330> dragon<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:13.840> film<00:03:14.080> maybe

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
turn into a dragon in this film maybe

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.740 
turn into a dragon in this film maybe
it'll<00:03:14.590> from<00:03:15.550> that<00:03:15.850> transition<00:03:16.210> from<00:03:16.510> her

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
it'll from that transition from her

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.060 
it'll from that transition from her
maybe<00:03:16.960> they<00:03:17.170> wanted<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.590> be<00:03:17.710> more<00:03:17.860> extreme

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
maybe they wanted it to be more extreme

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.220 
maybe they wanted it to be more extreme
yeah<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:19.150> they<00:03:19.300> probably<00:03:19.540> made<00:03:19.870> her<00:03:19.960> a<00:03:20.020> little

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
yeah so they probably made her a little

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.250 
yeah so they probably made her a little
bit<00:03:20.380> smaller<00:03:21.450> okay<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:22.510> these<00:03:22.810> are<00:03:23.020> all<00:03:23.140> the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
bit smaller okay so these are all the

I<00:04:16.670> am<00:04:16.970> my<00:04:17.180> first<00:04:17.329> thought<00:04:17.600> when<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.840> saw<00:04:17.900> the

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
I am my first thought when I saw the

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.400 
I am my first thought when I saw the
poster<00:04:18.470> was<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.190> looked<00:04:19.340> like<00:04:19.459> Madonna

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
poster was that it looked like Madonna

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.680 
poster was that it looked like Madonna
first<00:04:21.410> or<00:04:21.620> me<00:04:21.769> but<00:04:22.580> then<00:04:23.090> I<00:04:23.120> remembered<00:04:23.660> that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
first or me but then I remembered that

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.690 
first or me but then I remembered that
it<00:04:23.900> was<00:04:23.930> angelina<00:04:24.590> jolie<00:04:24.860> angelina<00:04:25.130> jolie<00:04:25.610> i

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
it was angelina jolie angelina jolie i

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.100 
it was angelina jolie angelina jolie i
think<00:04:25.970> was<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.120> great<00:04:26.270> choice<00:04:26.540> because<00:04:26.570> she's

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
think was a great choice because she's

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.800 
think was a great choice because she's
kind<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.650> painfully<00:04:28.190> thin<00:04:28.400> right<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.630> makes

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
kind of painfully thin right so it makes

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.300 
kind of painfully thin right so it makes
her<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.050> little<00:04:30.169> bit<00:04:30.350> more<00:04:30.500> menacing<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:31.130> can

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
her a little bit more menacing you can

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.070 
her a little bit more menacing you can
tell<00:04:31.520> in<00:04:31.790> this<00:04:32.000> shot<00:04:32.210> especially<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:32.960> they

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
tell in this shot especially that they

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.570 
tell in this shot especially that they
probably<00:04:33.320> amped<00:04:33.830> up<00:04:33.890> her<00:04:34.040> cheekbones<00:04:34.430> a

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
probably amped up her cheekbones a

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.070 
probably amped up her cheekbones a
little<00:04:34.730> bit<00:04:34.880> in<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.090> makeup<00:04:35.270> department<00:04:35.570> to

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
little bit in the makeup department to

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.290 
little bit in the makeup department to
make<00:04:36.110> her<00:04:36.470> look<00:04:36.680> more<00:04:36.740> menacing<00:04:37.700> but<00:04:38.180> her

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
make her look more menacing but her

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.880 
make her look more menacing but her
already<00:04:38.690> being<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.140> thin<00:04:39.320> was<00:04:39.500> probably

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
already being so thin was probably

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.630 
already being so thin was probably
pretty<00:04:40.100> helpful

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
pretty helpful

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.180 
pretty helpful
yeah<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.480> should<00:04:41.750> better<00:04:42.020> staff<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.919> it's

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
fairness

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.859 

that's<00:05:01.619> that's<00:05:02.619> her<00:05:02.800> putting<00:05:03.069> the<00:05:03.869> thorns

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:04.869 
that's that's her putting the thorns

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:07.260 
that's that's her putting the thorns
around<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.349> castle<00:05:05.559> right<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:06.759> this<00:05:07.150> is

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
around the castle right and this is

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.029 
around the castle right and this is
where<00:05:07.449> I<00:05:07.479> and<00:05:07.839> the<00:05:08.050> fairies<00:05:08.439> a<00:05:08.469> little<00:05:08.740> bit<00:05:08.860> too

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
where I and the fairies a little bit too

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.489 
where I and the fairies a little bit too
it<00:05:09.399> just<00:05:09.430> becomes<00:05:09.939> so<00:05:10.409> oversaturated<00:05:11.409> with

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:11.499 
it just becomes so oversaturated with

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.010 
it just becomes so oversaturated with
CGI<00:05:11.860> yeah<00:05:12.219> I<00:05:12.669> mean<00:05:13.059> which<00:05:13.210> is<00:05:13.240> something

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
CGI yeah I mean which is something

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.529 
CGI yeah I mean which is something
really<00:05:14.319> easy<00:05:14.529> to<00:05:14.800> complain<00:05:15.159> about<00:05:15.309> but<00:05:15.849> I<00:05:16.210> mean

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
really easy to complain about but I mean

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.659 
really easy to complain about but I mean
it<00:05:16.689> looks<00:05:17.050> better<00:05:17.289> than<00:05:17.589> it<00:05:17.860> does<00:05:18.159> it<00:05:18.430> looks

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
it looks better than it does it looks

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.260 
it looks better than it does it looks
rather<00:05:18.909> realistic<00:05:19.689> which<00:05:20.080> I<00:05:21.059> weirdly<00:05:22.059> enough

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
rather realistic which I weirdly enough

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.170 
rather realistic which I weirdly enough
I<00:05:22.449> think<00:05:22.509> that<00:05:22.719> her<00:05:23.050> like<00:05:23.469> eyes<00:05:23.740> are<00:05:24.520> it's<00:05:24.969> a

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
I think that her like eyes are it's a

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.790 
I think that her like eyes are it's a
little<00:05:25.389> obvious<00:05:25.509> that<00:05:25.930> they're<00:05:26.080> contacts<00:05:26.649> so

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
little obvious that they're contacts so

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.309 
little obvious that they're contacts so
it<00:05:26.860> makes<00:05:27.099> it<00:05:27.279> a<00:05:27.339> little<00:05:27.610> distracting<00:05:28.270> but<00:05:28.569> but

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
it makes it a little distracting but but

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.200 
it makes it a little distracting but but
the<00:05:29.439> CGI<00:05:29.830> is<00:05:29.949> actually<00:05:30.490> probably<00:05:30.939> because<00:05:31.180> of

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
the CGI is actually probably because of

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.730 
the CGI is actually probably because of
the<00:05:31.360> director<00:05:31.749> in<00:05:31.930> shutter<00:05:32.199> it<00:05:32.379> probably<00:05:32.620> was

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
the director in shutter it probably was

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.739 
the director in shutter it probably was
a<00:05:32.770> pretty<00:05:33.009> big<00:05:33.129> stickler<00:05:33.370> for<00:05:33.569> making<00:05:34.569> it<00:05:34.659> look

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:34.749 
a pretty big stickler for making it look

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:36.270 
a pretty big stickler for making it look
realistic

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
realistic

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.490 
realistic
as

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.250

cannot<00:06:00.660> wait<00:06:00.870> for<00:06:01.140> a<00:06:01.170> full<00:06:01.440> trailer<00:06:01.770> yeah<00:06:02.130> I

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
cannot wait for a full trailer yeah I

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.640 
cannot wait for a full trailer yeah I
think<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.670> full<00:06:02.880> trailer<00:06:03.230> hoping<00:06:04.230> that<00:06:04.500> it's

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
think the full trailer hoping that it's

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.910 
think the full trailer hoping that it's
at<00:06:05.070> least<00:06:05.130> over<00:06:05.760> 2<00:06:05.970> minutes<00:06:06.270> long<00:06:06.480> yeah<00:06:06.920> it'll

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
at least over 2 minutes long yeah it'll

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.060 
at least over 2 minutes long yeah it'll
probably<00:06:08.760> I<00:06:09.480> hope<00:06:10.230> it<00:06:10.380> shows<00:06:10.410> a<00:06:10.710> little<00:06:10.950> bit

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
probably I hope it shows a little bit

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.090 
probably I hope it shows a little bit
more<00:06:11.190> of<00:06:11.580> Maleficent<00:06:12.570> as<00:06:12.690> a<00:06:12.720> as<00:06:13.050> this<00:06:13.620> young

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
more of Maleficent as a as this young

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.070 
more of Maleficent as a as this young
girl<00:06:14.400> since<00:06:14.730> I'm<00:06:14.910> assuming<00:06:15.360> it's<00:06:15.510> an<00:06:15.690> origin

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
girl since I'm assuming it's an origin

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.470 
girl since I'm assuming it's an origin
story<00:06:16.110> so<00:06:16.740> I<00:06:17.370> think<00:06:17.670> that<00:06:18.030> I<00:06:18.150> hope<00:06:18.300> that

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
story so I think that I hope that

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.790 
story so I think that I hope that
trailer<00:06:18.720> tells<00:06:18.930> us<00:06:19.050> a<00:06:19.110> little<00:06:19.230> bit<00:06:19.410> more<00:06:19.560> about

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
trailer tells us a little bit more about

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.490 
trailer tells us a little bit more about
that<00:06:19.860> but<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.820> think<00:06:21.120> for<00:06:21.420> a<00:06:21.480> teaser<00:06:21.810> it<00:06:22.230> does<00:06:22.470> a

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
that but I think for a teaser it does a

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.920 
that but I think for a teaser it does a
pretty<00:06:22.770> good<00:06:22.860> job<00:06:23.010> of<00:06:23.460> telling<00:06:23.640> us<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.180> mean<00:06:24.810> it

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
that would have been extremely

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.820 
that would have been extremely
interesting<00:07:14.430> yeah<00:07:14.760> bleed<00:07:15.240> a<00:07:15.720> little<00:07:16.290> darker
