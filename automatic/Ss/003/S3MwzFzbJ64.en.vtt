this is part 2 part 3 to be an item to

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.690 
this is part 2 part 3 to be an item to
find<00:00:04.740> it<00:00:05.779> and<00:00:06.779> my<00:00:07.529> little<00:00:07.649> buddy<00:00:07.859> finally<00:00:08.580> has

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
to tote by the head and has maybe

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.770 
to tote by the head and has maybe
commenced<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.349> swallowing<00:00:13.950> once<00:00:14.160> he

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
commenced with the swallowing once he

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.140 
commenced with the swallowing once he
properly<00:00:15.780> punctures<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.440> toad<00:00:18.470> it's<00:00:19.470> time

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
properly punctures the toad it's time

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.400 
properly punctures the toad it's time
stop<00:00:21.150> moving<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.539> suppose<00:00:21.840> maybe<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.140> disturb

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
stop moving I suppose maybe we disturb

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.630 
stop moving I suppose maybe we disturb
him<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> little<00:00:22.740> bit<00:00:22.859> he's<00:00:23.100> deciding<00:00:23.519> whether

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
him a little bit he's deciding whether

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.950 
him a little bit he's deciding whether
or<00:00:23.699> not<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.970> do<00:00:24.090> anything<00:00:24.390> about<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:25.670> but<00:00:26.960> he's

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
or not to do anything about it but he's

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.779 
or not to do anything about it but he's
never<00:00:28.140> food<00:00:28.470> Shively<00:00:28.859> he<00:00:29.279> never<00:00:29.460> been<00:00:29.550> clearly

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
never food Shively he never been clearly

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.220 
never food Shively he never been clearly
shy<00:00:29.970> before<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.660> don't<00:00:30.750> suspect<00:00:30.929> that's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
shy before so I don't suspect that's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.560 
shy before so I don't suspect that's
really<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> problem

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
really a problem

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.069 
really a problem
although<00:00:33.570> he<00:00:33.719> has<00:00:33.809> flatly<00:00:34.140> out<00:00:34.260> pretty<00:00:34.469> good

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.660 

back<00:00:38.680> I'd<00:00:39.489> give<00:00:40.480> him<00:00:40.629> some<00:00:40.930> space

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
back I'd give him some space

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.850 
back I'd give him some space
and<00:00:43.120> use<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:44.110> zoom<00:00:44.320> function<00:00:44.559> maybe

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.110 

maybe<00:00:48.860> if<00:00:49.220> I<00:00:49.370> can<00:00:49.430> zoom<00:00:50.890> seems<00:00:51.890> I<00:00:52.010> can't

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
maybe if I can zoom seems I can't

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.319 
maybe if I can zoom seems I can't
so

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.539 

their<00:01:00.899> egos

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.820 

he's<00:01:06.359> just<00:01:06.539> chomping<00:01:06.930> down

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.550 

you<00:01:11.370> might<00:01:11.580> well<00:01:11.940> be<00:01:11.970> doing<00:01:12.720> battle<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.140> toad

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
you might well be doing battle with toad

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.840 
you might well be doing battle with toad
for<00:01:13.800> some<00:01:13.980> time<00:01:16.190> again<00:01:17.190> because<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.670> toad

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
for some time again because the toad

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.480 
for some time again because the toad
needs<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.330> deflated<00:01:18.780> first<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.370> see

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
needs to be deflated first you can see

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.610 
needs to be deflated first you can see
the<00:01:20.640> toad<00:01:20.940> it<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.810> patch<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.320> swollen

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
the toad it see patch is swollen

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.450 
the toad it see patch is swollen
probably<00:01:23.520> due<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> venom<00:01:25.280> also<00:01:26.280> because

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
probably due to the venom also because

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.860 
probably due to the venom also because
he<00:01:26.520> was<00:01:26.610> storing<00:01:26.850> water<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.390> he's<00:01:27.600> probably

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
he was storing water there he's probably

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.630 
he was storing water there he's probably
just<00:01:28.080> suffering<00:01:28.830> from<00:01:29.010> a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.340> internal

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
just suffering from a lot of internal

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:41.770 
just suffering from a lot of internal
bleeding<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.970> now

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.270 

I<00:01:41.869> know<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.560> looks<00:01:42.710> like<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:42.890> have<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.040> really

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
I know it looks like I have a really

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.880 
I know it looks like I have a really
long<00:01:43.549> still<00:01:43.970> photo<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:44.510> this<00:01:44.930> is<00:01:45.110> in<00:01:45.229> fact

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:59.420 

video

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060 

and<00:01:59.700> if<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.910> look<00:02:00.060> over<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.720> see

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and if you look over you can see

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.140 
and if you look over you can see
like<00:02:02.610> them<00:02:02.850> Memphis<00:02:03.260> elegans<00:02:04.260> vagrants

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
like them Memphis elegans vagrants

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.730 
like them Memphis elegans vagrants
hanging<00:02:06.150> out<00:02:06.300> right<00:02:07.110> there<00:02:09.290> other<00:02:10.290> sirtalis

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
hanging out right there other sirtalis

Sura<00:02:14.010> Taos<00:02:14.280> pariah<00:02:14.760> talus<00:02:19.370> there<00:02:20.370> he<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:23.330> they

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
Sura Taos pariah talus there he is they

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.640 
Sura Taos pariah talus there he is they
get<00:02:24.510> along<00:02:24.750> pretty<00:02:25.020> well

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
get along pretty well

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.400 
get along pretty well
I<00:02:25.680> brought<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.160> toad<00:02:26.460> like<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.960> they<00:02:27.960> tend<00:02:28.260> to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
I brought a toad like this they tend to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.820 
I brought a toad like this they tend to
fight<00:02:28.560> over<00:02:28.740> them<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:30.080> that's<00:02:31.080> kind<00:02:31.440> of

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
fight over them and that's kind of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.260 
fight over them and that's kind of
problematic<00:02:32.010> if<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.670> were<00:02:32.790> just<00:02:32.880> feeding<00:02:33.090> them

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
problematic if I were just feeding them

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.250 
problematic if I were just feeding them
fish<00:02:33.480> by<00:02:33.660> hand<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:34.020> wouldn't<00:02:34.200> be<00:02:34.290> an<00:02:34.350> issue<00:02:34.470> but

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
fish by hand it wouldn't be an issue but

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.170 
fish by hand it wouldn't be an issue but
with<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.770> would<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.460> overly

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
with this it would just get overly

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.120 
with this it would just get overly
complicated<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:40.080> little<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:40.800> painful<00:02:41.100> for

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
complicated a little more painful for

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.790 
complicated a little more painful for
the<00:02:41.310> toe<00:02:41.460> than<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> needs<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.030> be

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.020 

so

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.600 

oh<00:02:53.090> there<00:02:53.660> we<00:02:53.750> go<00:02:54.140> group<00:02:54.770> of<00:02:54.920> life

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.860 

sort<00:03:02.330> of

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.780 

yeah<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.500> think<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.190> think<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.459> snake<00:03:09.640> is

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
yeah I think that I think the snake is

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.410 
yeah I think that I think the snake is
camera<00:03:10.150> shy<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:11.400> once<00:03:12.400> he<00:03:12.610> gets<00:03:12.819> moving<00:03:13.180> around

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
camera shy so once he gets moving around

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.869 
camera shy so once he gets moving around
a<00:03:13.569> little<00:03:13.660> more<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.290> will<00:03:14.650> commence<00:03:15.340> with<00:03:15.459> part

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
a little more I will commence with part

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.500 
a little more I will commence with part
3<00:03:16.330> part<00:03:17.310> 4<00:03:18.310> again<00:03:18.879> depending<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.239> how<00:03:19.360> I<00:03:19.390> want

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
3 part 4 again depending on how I want

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.820 
3 part 4 again depending on how I want
you<00:03:19.629> to<00:03:19.750> find<00:03:19.900> it
