 procedure and you do not have any 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.449
 problem first thing the most essential 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.420
 although you can download the drivers from 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.890

 they have what little try to say install 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.110
 USB driver and without any problem 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.450
 if you want, do not download arturo from 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.970
 here we are going to download what is the jean 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.200
 judga mobile is to be able to update 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.740
 our phone either for windows xp 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.840
 vista or windows 7 windows 8 here we can 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.200
 we download it just a click 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.000
 well let's start once 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.479
 we already have everything we need 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.420
 to begin the procedure we are going to 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.350
 go to open the application but tell you 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:44.500
 here we can see on my phone 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.090
 and on the 7th we are going to find that we have 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.130
 some options at the moment that we 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 we install 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.960
 our usb in our device 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.600
 when we connect it we will observe 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.470
 that we have several options we have 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.860
 debugging or anchoring usb or software 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.380
 of pc, what are we going to do? 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.570
 in pc software since what we want 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.310
 change us or update is the 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.710
 our device software either 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.930
 By mistake or we want to update it 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.420
 to see if there is another update or 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.850
 simply an option features 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.070
 additional, such as the recovery of 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.450
 the errors in an update that does not 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.410
 it was installed well in our device 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.970
 the chip and once that's done we're going to 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.200
 connect our mobile without any 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.570
 problem more so let's go and we're going to 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.990
 start what is the update let's 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.280
 to click on the update and we will 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.280
 leave a window 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.960
 to check some programs and data 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.820
 can be eliminated due to the problem that 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.000
 arise during the update of 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.520
 backup phone good in itself 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.100
 it's going to erase everything the update is 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.890
 how to install new software to your 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.130
 phone is new so we 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.160
 let's click on ok and it's going to 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.250
 open a new window later 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.180
 I'm not going to execute it anymore because I already 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.189
 I've updated it so 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.530
 here keep checking verifying 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.769
 phone connection so we 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.680
 let's see some options these options 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.420
 here is checking here I already know 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.379
 canceled what is the software you are going to 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.030
 download here will go down in the world 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.439
 will download the software information 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.980
 new that will be installed on your 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.620
 jee and here is obviously loading 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.920
 the new software to our jean not 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.290
 matter what all of the yi are 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.810
 the portal is part of the mobile gym 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.790
 without any problem and we will get the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.689
 last option that is when we 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:56.790
 we conclude to install it good this is 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:59.919
 the easiest method we download 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.510
 we install we puncture our device 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:06.760
 the option and we come to install 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.829
 good updates I think that from there 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.569
 everything was understood we are going to close the 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.510
 application 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.590
 that's updating our device 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.790
 let's remove this 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.579
 [Music] 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.169
 and I want to close this but there can not be 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.840
 if you have no problems the other application 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.600
 that I'm going to execute but here I have the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.430
 another application but I also want them 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.190
 show that I just installed a new 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.729
 software a few days ago 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.880
 of a mobile that did not turn on absolutely 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.800
 nothing besides there are very different problems 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.050
 like the mobile stays in the gym 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.820
 nothing more and this is to relive 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.610

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.949

 what are we going to do here, I'm going to go to my 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.290
 device 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.240
 and let's remove the fat I fall these 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.280
 true passwords 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.460
 but it's from a friend that your device 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.590
 I did not want to work well and I've done it 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.380

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.840
 very well and have no problems well I'll 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.940

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.960
 once we put mode 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.330
 emergency there we go 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.400

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.190

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.740

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.479
 have a problem 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.930
 let's click and look in this case 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.169
 this 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.229

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.219
 I'm going to disconnect what is my 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.219
 device 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.520
 well what are we going to do here 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.270
 boys is going to be the next thing to put 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.569
 volume up and turn off at the same time 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.699
 but we're also going to put what is the 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.000
 connector to put it in mode 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:02.470
 emergency 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.200
 [Music] 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.330
 and we can already see that it has been put in 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.210
 emergency mode and we can now 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.780
 start to relive our skiing and 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:17.169
 install a new firmware so a 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.670
 Once we have it in emergency mode 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:23.180

 let's do that we will appear some 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.980
 letters but before mentioning that 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.080
 some people struggle to be able to 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.620
 revive your device since some do not 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.300
 they learn nothing at all and you have to 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.380
 try several times for you 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.180
 it turns out so what emergency way to have the 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.730

 a new firmware that is what we are 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.550

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.750
 a little but 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.090
