00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 the river and the chicken that is making and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.110
 That's the way it was 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.900
 You were going to start bringing cars. 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.840
 famous here and it is mine that saw a series 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.820
 had already brought by skyline walker from 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.289
 fast and furious for those who did not see 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 leave here in the video description as well 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.460
 cool car looks pretty good and this one 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.340
 series that was the subscribers suggestion 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.929
 It was luiz's and he follows me at 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.460
 twitter is also always supporting me 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.800
 on the channel so I'll leave it here 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.649
 description twitter it for you to give 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.480
 A little glimpse for you to see how it is 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.040
 This car is so similar, I'll leave it. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.800
 he is more or less in the position of a 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.809
 photo that I have to put on the side there 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.149
 You'll see so much you're here for this. 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.270
 day is also cute this is it here is the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.399
 Herbie is the rubin I do not know it's a movie 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.100
 very old face of this club that I 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.890
 I honestly do not remember very well how it is 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.020
 what is the movie around than with 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.570
 This movie turns out only that it's really cool if 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.689
 of the most famous car movies 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 we got there and the only thing one 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.439
 The only things I did in that car. 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 here was to improve the engine I made it 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.320
 violent change increase speed 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.869
 it was not there these things 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.810
 any very thick wheels with 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.240
 certainty thicker than that of the film and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.860
 touch those bars there that I diminish 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.320
 a little his weight is also seeing 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.600
 he runs there behind him are the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.280
 large lines to decrease weight 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.020
 I think basically I only did this with 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.060
 relation to the original in and mainly 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.640
 to get competitive old 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.630
 because he is not a strong fighter 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.680
 When we buy, I think the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.570
 category d 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.479
 is well capable of being the most 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.450
 weak of the game until I'll see it later 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.409
 a beauty and let's look here for a 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.159
 racing 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.070
 I'll come back that way when I get there. 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.680
 This is it, man. We're here the first time. 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.630
 race seems to be a sprint 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.009
 point-to-point every time I forget to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.159
 look before entering but I think it is 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.370
 That's it, we'll just see it here. 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.370
 As soon as you begin to take this doubt 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.530
 He lets me see that, can I? 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.720
 percentage there then the spirit 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.660
 point-to-point is yes we will see if we 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.120
 can do something a class 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.850
 very difficult because you can find 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.580
 those who run a lot and such because 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.640
 It is difficult to control and passable and tals 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.160
 It's very easy, it's not going to be easy either. 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.870
 it is easy to control, it means if well 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.550
 that it is easy to control to count from 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.190
 factory with the modifications I made here 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.600
 It's not so easy, I will not try not 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.430
 hit beauty 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.920
 I said that I was going to say that I was going to try 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.050
 not beat mother to stick to here continues 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:52.580
 cute little 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:55.190
 now I think it was already then this is it 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.270
 For those who do not know, old man, it's a fuck, right? 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.950
 I have to think twice before 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.040
 talk and end up not thinking and talking 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.910
 shit beauty is the name of that capital 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.550
 out there right quib town if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.820
 means beetle is to see pudera né bicho 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:15.340
 looks like a beetle and even the inspiration 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:19.550
 of the name of the in the beats is not the face that is 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:23.630
 bi is the web is not equal bitomsky is the 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.940
 beach on the beat with a title cab am right 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.910
 Even that's understandable. 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.860
 this looking at the hair of the hair 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.390
 it does not look like oriental docks 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.840
 I say this because I'm very fan of bits 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.200
 I know a lot provided that is 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.790
 Let's go to the quiet moment, and I 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.640
 I think it will be easy to listen to the 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.910
 His little motor is until I know it 's a 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.200
 fuse and such a motor of that shit but 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.200
 listen listen a little 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.950
 this is the tension here, this engine is not 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.450
 even his original is I changed the 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.980
 engine of that car I put one with more 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.170
 acceleration that I can not remember which was 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:35.960
 to be honest and engine is far from being 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.880
 This way you know, you know then. 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.250
 beauty first race was much more 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.800
 very easy even guys so let's go 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.330
 Then jump straight to the second one here. 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:49.190
 I want to see what it's going to be like. 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.630
 Lighthouse bean is back 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.400
 I already realized that I always made a point of 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.470
 back to the song after I shoot for 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.290
 to listen to the sound of the old car 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.260
 yes start here I'm going to put the song 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:06.890
 back his blanket an ass in the 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:10.460
 The steering wheel began to play in the bay. 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:13.970
 marina or marina I do not know what that 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.690
 bread if the pulse was listening 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.060
 good of variable do not cut way 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.340
 I think this type of race here is 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.610
 another point to point only that this is more 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.660
 time to cut the expensive roads 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.120
 I think it has one end to end more 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.290
 within the city a point to point more 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.550
 thus drew but outside the city where he has 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.090
 how we cut a lot more 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.400
 quiet stop car losing the 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.290
 rear right 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.260
 nothing more just besides weaving traction 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:49.100
 rear traction the motoboy behind 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.760
 then the pt lost the traction here bring is 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.800
 easy with the rear wheels 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.410
 We're already here while you 're good. 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.240
 who will have a very secret race that does not 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.450
 again if you have any personal 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.020
 series suggestion and attacked as bringing 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.450
 movie cars now I know if there are any 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.940
 suggestion of some movie that will have the 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.790
 car in the game because I was seeing it 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.920
 It's hard, dude, it's hard to have a car. 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:20.460
 It's from famous movie that also has in the game 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.530
 to equivalents and tals resembling only 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.510
 who does not want to do the same 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.120
 car is very much like the original 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.600
 only when the movie itself wanted to bring 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.090
 in this style, if someone has 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.820
 idea of ​​what I can bring so leave 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.780

 be a hint of a writing she 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.450
 won begins to bring challenges as well 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.940
 only the challenge has to be plausible 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.610
 There have already been people who have challenged me 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.740
 some very intense things to do then 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.410
 honestly I do not know if it will be worth 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.940
 A pleasure, I'll try, I 'll try to record 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.730
