 Alexander Y. Nazarenko not replaceable 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.980
 leading all competitions 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.089
 bodybuilding and fitness championships and 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.799
 St. Petersburg Cup 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.190
 Alexander, please say this: 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.080
 success is you as the lead 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.690
 success that people come and i'm bored i 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.270
 I think this is very important because 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.449
 our sign they go very long but 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.810
 the average tournament lasts 6 hours 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.970
 short mostly from maybe 10 and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.070
 12 hours and during this time you need to do 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 so that people are interested 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.930
 be the hall this presenter need for 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.660
 so that people don't get up don't leave 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.469
 remained and applauded how long 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.270
 we can see you in this post 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.280

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.559
 fifty but i don't mind this 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.020
 Aura of competition because at the level of Russia 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.360
 Dmitry Kornyukhin at my request me 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.940
 replace periodically now in change 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.219
 will i eat actually he then i'm not in it 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.769
 nothing i'm not closing myself 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.270
 recess and no path is not there 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.939
 block if someone wants to try 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.030
 let him try it absolutely 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.430
 how would please please asian labor 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.630
 you often arina nick us stand up for 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.939
 some kind of sporty plan 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.460
 justice refereeing you are not afraid 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.390
 negative there someone influence others 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.350
 people Well firstly that is, you like here 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.620
 precisely for the objective 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.150
 weights why why should i be afraid 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.560
 true if the person who wants 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.250
 somehow change the course of refereeing 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.910
 for example make everything biased and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.500
 become no evaluation 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.180
 but the same can be seen in the protocol which 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.180
 falls including my hands in front 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.930
 award I see that someone from the judges 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.360
 put the wrong grade 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.150
 but clearly underestimated or removed man 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.160
 generally away why should I about this 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.420
 be silent if I am of last resort 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.610
 who can say this this 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.430
 protocol passes the secretariat pass 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.810
 appeal commission and last point 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.930
 in which you can stop the results 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.510
 speeches it's just me and something 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.000
 announce we can reconsider something 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.220
 We can turn to Vladimir Wang Li 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.350
 dubinin to appeal lived somewhere 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.110
 Boris Vasiliev Alexander enters 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.030
 cherry and just can personally ask 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.730
 them look at exactly specific 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.170
 situations and there have been cases of such 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.850
 appeal led to a change 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.830
 the result of all the actions just in 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.500
 I did not know the side of objectivity 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.970
 the fact that someone is worse is worse if I or 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.150
 no, there are some favorites yes no 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.680
 nothing for the time I sing the podium 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.320
 there are a huge number of people already 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.050
 won lost lost grew all 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.290
 it happens long enough but i 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.970
 I think that it is necessary that people are better 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.709
 perform better they look and become 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.250
 the champions they cut some 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.090
 fraud 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.920
 what they are not afraid of nothing nothing well yes then 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.720
 There are honest, there are times when someone 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.920
 Someone you do not have of course they are constantly 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.670
 and very often these are people who 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.340
 put the interests of the club 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.660
 but we have several circle of major 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.250
 networks and it's hard not to see your 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.140
 staff lion man who 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.420
 engaged in this club not to see that he 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.950
 worse but in people just have a real look 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.120
 thinks he's better here he looks in 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.910
 man in love with the world does not notice 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.030
 I do not notice it may not be intentional 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.250
 even being done but we have it stopped like 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.320
 can we for objectivity into action then 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.260
 there must win the strongest best 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.360
 not the one who is your club or there on 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.030
 for some reason, he must suddenly 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.340
 go such a fight in Petersburg 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.470
 I want to highlight the judging 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.720
 quite objectively and we know 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.580
 cases when people from russia even from 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.800
 Moscow come to us for the championship 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.900
 because here they can rate their 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.340
 form honestly they either win either 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.470
 lose but they treat it with 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.090
 understanding and can explain why not 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.950
 busy or another place we have 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.870
 some arguments we can see 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.580
 photos see video explain 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.420
 man that he is not ready where he is not ready 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.990
 why in other places regions of this 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.410
 there is no analysis 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.900
 very often athletes are in the role 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.430
 very strange without athletes no 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.040
 competitions on the athlete on these 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.500
 competitions are often denied the right 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.810
 voices that's wrong with us this 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.120
 we have no people who act and 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.810
 performs well they both ken hold 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.600
 high places 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.700
 thank you very much alexander good luck to you 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.010
 conducting very weak in the role of lead 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.010
 if only you had fun we had a lot of fun
