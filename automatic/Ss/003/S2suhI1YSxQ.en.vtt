00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:09.970
 What you Zonchi is with you server 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:12.610
 Access one file from multiple PCs and save backup 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:19.140
 You can not be on an external Hearts disuccinimidyl 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:23.700
 I have various interests this time and I think that I want to form a server 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.660
 First of all - it will be the introduction of parts of the street 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.660
 Here is the case 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.360
 CPU 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.080
 memory 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.080
 ssd 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.840
 then 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.990
 Motherboard 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.170
 And the most important part of the server is the hard disk 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.340
 This time using the theme of 3 tyrannober disc 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.340
 I think that I want to make a server 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.340
 The other power rest is cables 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.910
 Case this time please be prepared to your liking is you do not want to take the place 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.910
 We have prepared constants for mini itx 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.149
 Inside is like this 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.149
 I think that I want to incorporate parts towards here. 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.450
 First of all to send in the motherboard and Wengen 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:22.079
 Remove the parts that get in the way 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.079
 I tried to remove the part to mount the fur water sk this time 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:33.070
 As this pace seems to be better from power supply, we incorporate power supply 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.830
 Because server is basic for 20 hours 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:41.320
 Ting is a manor 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.320
 I think it would be better to prepare something with high ability 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.850
 I want to incorporate water and a motherboard that has broken the power supply 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:57.789
 At first we will incorporate five 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.860
 If you are following this cp to built-in as one of the notes on the motherboard, click here 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:05.170
 Please do not lose the person of 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.860
 Later collecting this here cover such as when you want to eat sister and stay back be greatly reduced 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.609
 There is 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.609
 be careful 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.540
 Include the cp First remove the here clasp 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 And cover 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.890
 Remove 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.350
 Place the cp Once you 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.490
 cpu's 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:41.010
 Motherboard with this arrow 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.010
 Make this part of the notch live 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.079
 It is good with this, and after a lid, rain is neo 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.079
 To go 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.150
 This completes cpu embedding 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.110
 Incorporate cpu cooler 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.520
 What d this time 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.000
 First of all I use the storehouse 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.600
 Opposite to the direction of this arrow 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.020
 Well do 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:20.280
 This is such a movement 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:25.410
 Please turn to the place where there is all the same in the same way and stay 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.880
 My brother is cooler because Chris is attached from the stain 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.880
 You can salt loss of cpu 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.159
 And 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.730
 This just Re also the guy until it clicks into place 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.730
 Push 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.060
 Yes It was 4 places in this and see from the back 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.080
 in this way 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.950
 do you understand 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.190
 I think you can see it pushed out 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.190
 Click everything in this way with your head 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.040
 The next step is to incorporate memory 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.940
 First of all 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.300
 Open the claw and No Moi woman 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.799
 I feel- 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.840
 Notch 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.730
 of course 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.730
 I will stick to this notch 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.320
 I always think, but it is difficult with Inaba 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:47.000
 Yes i did 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:50.980
 The spec stop is rare 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.980
 Push it into the mouth 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:00.190
 I would like to incorporate it into my mother's hairdresser 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.800
 Such a spacer 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.200
 Use 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:10.550
 It will incorporate the mother board 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.550
 I will attach this spacer to this one and continue the motherboard 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.220
 I will attach the spacer in this way and listen to the back plate 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.539
 It is a major way 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.950
 Had 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.950
 Yes install like this 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:35.200
 Come on the motherboard oh 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.200
 Built into the case
