clip<00:01:55.110> basically<00:01:56.110> it's<00:01:56.260> a<00:01:56.350> full<00:01:56.530> metal<00:01:56.740> clip

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
clip basically it's a full metal clip

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.550 
clip basically it's a full metal clip
this<00:01:57.970> is<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.600> normal<00:01:59.050> magnet<00:01:59.620> holds<00:01:59.890> about<00:02:00.040> 30

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
this is the normal magnet holds about 30

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.840 
this is the normal magnet holds about 30
normally<00:02:02.560> have<00:02:02.770> problems<00:02:03.190> once<00:02:03.370> we<00:02:03.460> get<00:02:03.610> down

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
normally have problems once we get down

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.730 
normally have problems once we get down
to<00:02:04.030> two<00:02:04.210> BB's<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.840> doesn't<00:02:05.140> want<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.410> seem<00:02:05.590> to

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
to two BB's it doesn't want to seem to

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.160 
to two BB's it doesn't want to seem to
shoot<00:02:05.950> them<00:02:06.300> other<00:02:07.300> than<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.720> there's<00:02:08.020> no

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
shoot them other than that there's no

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.580 
shoot them other than that there's no
problem<00:02:08.619> with<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.980> gun<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.399> far<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.320> I'll<00:02:11.320> tell

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
problem with the gun so far so I'll tell

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.810 
problem with the gun so far so I'll tell
you<00:02:11.680> if<00:02:11.770> there's<00:02:11.980> anything<00:02:12.220> else

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
you if there's anything else

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.320 
you if there's anything else
okay<00:02:13.600> now<00:02:13.780> flipping<00:02:14.020> over<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.620> other<00:02:14.740> side

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
okay now flipping over to the other side

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.950 
okay now flipping over to the other side
here's<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.570> switch<00:02:16.870> between<00:02:17.280> safe<00:02:18.510> semi<00:02:19.510> and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
here's the switch between safe semi and

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.710 
here's the switch between safe semi and
auto<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.040> switch<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.520> pretty<00:02:21.760> easy<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.390> is

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
auto you can switch it pretty easy it is

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.520 
auto you can switch it pretty easy it is
only<00:02:22.960> a<00:02:23.110> right-handed<00:02:23.800> switch<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:25.530> basically

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
only a right-handed switch and basically

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.980 
only a right-handed switch and basically
the<00:02:26.830> mag<00:02:27.070> release<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.970> left-handed<00:02:28.720> switch

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
the mag release is a left-handed switch

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.470 
the mag release is a left-handed switch
so<00:02:29.410> it's<00:02:29.770> pretty<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:32.080> not<00:02:32.410> like<00:02:32.739> it's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
so it's pretty it's not like it's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.940 
so it's pretty it's not like it's
completely<00:02:34.480> determined<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.260> guess<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.800> could

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
completely determined I guess you could

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.110 
completely determined I guess you could
use<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.250> as<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.370> right<00:02:36.610> if<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:36.970> was<00:02:37.120> easier

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
use it as a right if it was easier

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.760 
use it as a right if it was easier
overall<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.360> gun<00:02:40.540> has<00:02:40.780> no<00:02:40.810> really<00:02:41.290> problems

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
overall the gun has no really problems

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.660 
overall the gun has no really problems
you<00:02:42.310> can<00:02:42.580> take<00:02:42.940> off<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.540> top<00:02:44.320> sight<00:02:44.739> all<00:02:45.489> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
you can take off the top sight all you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.729 
you can take off the top sight all you
have<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:46.000> do<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.420> unscrew<00:02:46.600> both<00:02:46.900> these<00:02:47.320> bolts

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
have to do is unscrew both these bolts

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.830 
have to do is unscrew both these bolts
and<00:02:47.860> slide<00:02:48.130> right<00:02:48.160> off<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.270> has<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> rail

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
and slide right off and that has a rail

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.350 
and slide right off and that has a rail
underneath<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.550> rail<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.850> underneath<00:02:52.180> it

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
underneath it the rail is underneath it

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.820 
underneath it the rail is underneath it
you<00:02:52.510> can<00:02:52.660> put<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> sight<00:02:53.140> like<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.320> red<00:02:53.560> dot<00:02:53.590> or

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
you can put a sight like a red dot or

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.570 
you can put a sight like a red dot or
green<00:02:54.220> dot<00:02:54.430> there<00:02:55.000> heck<00:02:55.540> even<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.870> neck<00:02:56.080> hog

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
green dot there heck even the neck hog

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.040 
green dot there heck even the neck hog
okay<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:57.940> there's<00:02:58.180> two<00:02:58.239> different<00:02:58.390> types<00:02:58.870> of

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
okay so there's two different types of

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.440 
okay so there's two different types of
rails<00:02:59.290> there's<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.400> one<00:03:00.580> that<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:01.060> that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
rails there's this one that I have that

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.729 
rails there's this one that I have that
has<00:03:01.690> no<00:03:02.320> rails<00:03:02.620> under<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.130> it's<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:03.519> a<00:03:03.700> plain

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
has no rails under it it's just a plain

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.870 
has no rails under it it's just a plain
just<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.860> grip<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:08.100> grip<00:03:09.100> you<00:03:09.700> can

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
just to grip and for this grip you can

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.330 
just to grip and for this grip you can
basically<00:03:10.590> right<00:03:11.590> under<00:03:11.800> there<00:03:11.980> if<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:12.190> can

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
basically right under there if you can

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.880 
basically right under there if you can
see<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:13.209> can<00:03:13.360> put<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.690> battery<00:03:14.080> the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
see it you can put the battery the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.890 
see it you can put the battery the
battery<00:03:15.040> goes<00:03:15.430> right<00:03:15.700> into<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.239> no<00:03:16.450> problem

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
battery goes right into it no problem

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.440 
battery goes right into it no problem
but<00:03:17.110> there<00:03:17.830> is<00:03:17.980> another<00:03:18.370> rail<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:19.030> has<00:03:19.180> four

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
but there is another rail that has four

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.600 
but there is another rail that has four
rails<00:03:19.840> two<00:03:20.050> on<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.230> sides<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.890> one<00:03:21.459> on<00:03:21.580> top

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
rails two on the sides and one on top

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.120 
rails two on the sides and one on top
one<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.000> bottom<00:03:22.350> basically<00:03:23.350> that's<00:03:23.769> where<00:03:23.980> you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
one on bottom basically that's where you

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.550 
one on bottom basically that's where you
attach<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.580> foregrip<00:03:25.060> or<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:26.110> can<00:03:26.260> attach

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
attach the foregrip or you can attach

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.970 
attach the foregrip or you can attach
flashlights<00:03:27.370> or<00:03:27.790> anything<00:03:28.000> like<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.590> now<00:03:29.590> if

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
flashlights or anything like that now if

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.650 
flashlights or anything like that now if
you<00:03:30.340> do<00:03:30.790> want<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.060> put<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.360> grenade<00:03:31.510> launcher

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
you do want to put the grenade launcher

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.530 
you do want to put the grenade launcher
on<00:03:32.170> there<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.280> have<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.640> have<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.850> top<00:03:34.269> one

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
on there you do have to have the top one

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.690 
on there you do have to have the top one
but<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.260> bottom<00:03:35.620> one<00:03:35.770> you<00:03:35.800> do<00:03:36.069> not<00:03:36.220> have<00:03:36.490> you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
but the bottom one you do not have you

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.080 
but the bottom one you do not have you
just<00:03:36.880> put<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.150> grenade<00:03:37.300> launcher<00:03:37.750> right

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
just put the grenade launcher right

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.960 
just put the grenade launcher right
there<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.629> covers<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.140> grenade<00:03:39.410> launchers

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
there that covers the grenade launchers

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.280 
there that covers the grenade launchers
railing<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.569> don't<00:03:41.840> have<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.019> worry<00:03:42.200> about

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
railing so you don't have to worry about

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.530 
railing so you don't have to worry about
that<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:43.160> battery<00:03:43.519> can<00:03:43.940> go<00:03:44.180> into<00:03:44.450> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
that and the battery can go into the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.900 
that and the battery can go into the
grenade<00:03:44.810> launcher<00:03:45.170> at<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.349> tip<00:03:45.910> basically

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
grenade launcher at the tip basically

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.820 
grenade launcher at the tip basically
other<00:03:47.209> than<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:48.170> sights<00:03:48.470> are<00:03:48.800> pretty

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
other than that the sights are pretty

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.720 
other than that the sights are pretty
standard<00:03:49.720> there<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.959> an<00:03:51.170> elevation<00:03:51.650> where<00:03:52.640> you

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
standard there is an elevation where you

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.130 
standard there is an elevation where you
can<00:03:52.849> make<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.120> go<00:03:53.150> up<00:03:53.300> and<00:03:53.510> down<00:03:53.599> and<00:03:53.930> then

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
can make it go up and down and then

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.309 
can make it go up and down and then
there<00:03:54.349> is<00:03:54.530> also<00:03:54.950> side<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.430> side<00:03:55.610> on<00:03:55.849> this<00:03:56.030> side

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
there is also side to side on this side

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.589 
there is also side to side on this side
by<00:03:57.319> that<00:03:57.500> knob<00:03:57.739> it's<00:03:58.340> pretty<00:03:58.580> simple

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
by that knob it's pretty simple

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.110 
by that knob it's pretty simple
its<00:04:00.140> standard<00:04:00.560> sights<00:04:01.010> there<00:04:01.370> is<00:04:01.549> a<00:04:01.580> hop-up

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
its standard sights there is a hop-up

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.490 
its standard sights there is a hop-up
sight<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:04.160> where<00:04:04.340> there's<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:05.049> bigger<00:04:06.049> one<00:04:06.290> for

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
sight to where there's a bigger one for

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.440 
sight to where there's a bigger one for
a<00:04:06.650> close<00:04:06.890> range<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.700> there's<00:04:07.910> a<00:04:08.000> smaller<00:04:08.269> one

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
a close range and there's a smaller one

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.990 
a close range and there's a smaller one
for<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.720> more<00:04:08.959> precision<00:04:09.470> that's<00:04:10.430> just<00:04:10.730> about

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
for a more precision that's just about

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000 
for a more precision that's just about
