the only problem is it's I think it's

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.530 
the only problem is it's I think it's
about<00:04:50.810> four<00:04:51.410> US<00:04:52.250> dollar<00:04:53.830> on<00:04:54.880> Syria<00:04:55.880> so<00:04:56.240> if

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
about four US dollar on Syria so if

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.100
