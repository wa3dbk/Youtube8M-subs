00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
of greyish and it has pearls in it I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.570 
of greyish and it has pearls in it I
guess<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.050> sparkly<00:01:04.739> things<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.400> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
guess the the sparkly things in there is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.630 
guess the the sparkly things in there is
the<00:01:05.910> encapsulated<00:01:07.250> pigments<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.490> it's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the encapsulated pigments so it's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640 
the encapsulated pigments so it's
infused<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.480> kept<00:01:09.720> encapsulated

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
infused with and kept encapsulated

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.610 
infused with and kept encapsulated
pigments<00:01:11.160> and<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:12.360> guess<00:01:12.690> that's<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.350> gives

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
pigments and I guess that's what gives

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.230 
pigments and I guess that's what gives
it<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:13.830> glow<00:01:14.160> cuz<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> feel<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.850> whenever<00:01:15.030> I
