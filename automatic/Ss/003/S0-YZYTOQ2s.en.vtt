00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
like this but it's kind of wobbly

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.880

whenever you sit like this it takes a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.380 
whenever you sit like this it takes a
little<00:02:50.010> while<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:50.940> actually<00:02:51.180> get

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
little while and you can actually get

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.120 
little while and you can actually get
something<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> didn't<00:02:53.040> even

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
something like that but I didn't even

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.410 
something like that but I didn't even
know<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.400> could<00:02:53.550> do<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.790> until<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.120> looked<00:02:54.240> on

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
know it could do that until I looked on

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.170 
know it could do that until I looked on
the<00:02:54.480> website<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.200> really<00:02:55.500> wobbly

tries<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.250> get<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.430> standing<00:02:59.850> like<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.030> was

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
tries to get to standing like that was

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.800

but<00:03:01.020> if<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.410> ever<00:03:01.530> use<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.830> for<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.100> stand<00:03:02.370> I

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
but if I ever use it for the stand I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.040 
but if I ever use it for the stand I
always<00:03:03.810> use<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:03.960> like<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.930> it

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
you know kind of topples like that so

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.120 
you know kind of topples like that so
that<00:03:41.130> is<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.580> case<00:03:41.910> on<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.480> phone<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:43.010> how<00:03:44.010> it

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
that is the case on the phone and how it

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.790 
that is the case on the phone and how it
works<00:03:44.370> um<00:03:44.810> for<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.870> price<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.440> think<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.739> might

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
works um for the price I think it might

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.800 
works um for the price I think it might
be<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:46.980> little<00:03:47.160> bit<00:03:47.340> expensive<00:03:47.640> but<00:03:48.030> it's<00:03:48.630> nice

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
be a little bit expensive but it's nice

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.630 
be a little bit expensive but it's nice
that<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.110> covers<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.530> back<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:49.950> your<00:03:50.070> firm<00:03:50.340> all

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
that it covers the back of your firm all

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.670 
that it covers the back of your firm all
the<00:03:50.760> cases<00:03:50.970> on<00:03:51.270> it<00:03:51.390> like<00:03:51.780> inside<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.380> back<00:03:52.530> of

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
the cases on it like inside the back of

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.780 
the cases on it like inside the back of
the<00:03:52.739> silicone<00:03:53.160> it's<00:03:53.340> not<00:03:53.459> going<00:03:53.550> to<00:03:53.640> scratch

the silicone it's not going to scratch

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.350 
the silicone it's not going to scratch
the<00:03:54.000> back<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.270> your<00:03:54.360> phone<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:55.770> stan<00:03:56.670> is<00:03:57.030> nice

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
the back of your phone the stan is nice

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.390 
the back of your phone the stan is nice
am<00:03:57.750> i<00:03:58.260> guessing<00:03:58.620> that's<00:03:58.920> why<00:03:59.070> it's<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> little

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
am i guessing that's why it's a little

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.070 
am i guessing that's why it's a little
more<00:03:59.489> expensive<00:03:59.940> than<00:04:00.060> most<00:04:00.300> phone<00:04:00.810> cases

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
more expensive than most phone cases

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.070 
more expensive than most phone cases
because<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.040> has<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.160> stand<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:03.540> works<00:04:03.780> in

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
because it has a stand and it works in

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.070 
because it has a stand and it works in
portrait<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:04.739> i<00:04:04.800> said<00:04:04.860> not<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.280> much<00:04:05.489> and

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
portrait like i said not so much and

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.960 
portrait like i said not so much and
well<00:04:07.080> it<00:04:07.470> doesn't<00:04:07.890> work<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.160> portrait<00:04:08.550> but<00:04:08.880> it

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
well it doesn't work in portrait but it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.790 
well it doesn't work in portrait but it
does<00:04:09.180> work<00:04:09.209> in<00:04:09.540> landscape<00:04:10.019> little<00:04:10.320> wobbly<00:04:10.530> and

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
does work in landscape little wobbly and

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.860 
does work in landscape little wobbly and
portrait<00:04:11.190> but<00:04:11.760> i'm<00:04:11.940> guessing<00:04:12.120> that's<00:04:12.450> where

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
portrait but i'm guessing that's where

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.390 
portrait but i'm guessing that's where
they<00:04:13.050> get<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.410> little<00:04:13.590> higher<00:04:13.830> price<00:04:14.160> point

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
they get the little higher price point

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.940 
they get the little higher price point
you<00:04:14.670> can<00:04:15.090> buy<00:04:15.180> other<00:04:15.330> cases<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:16.350> protected

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
you can buy other cases that protected

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.460 
you can buy other cases that protected
that<00:04:17.130> looks<00:04:17.310> similar<00:04:17.489> than<00:04:17.820> this<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.840> this<00:04:19.019> for

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
that looks similar than this to this for

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.090 
that looks similar than this to this for
around<00:04:19.680> twenty<00:04:20.040> dollars<00:04:20.340> on<00:04:20.760> 25<00:04:21.800> but<00:04:22.800> this

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
around twenty dollars on 25 but this

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.310 
around twenty dollars on 25 but this
costs<00:04:23.490> around<00:04:23.760> $35<00:04:24.539> so<00:04:24.780> might<00:04:25.080> be<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.229> little

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
costs around $35 so might be a little

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.659 
costs around $35 so might be a little
bit<00:04:25.470> overpriced<00:04:25.830> i<00:04:26.039> wasn't<00:04:26.250> really<00:04:26.310> happy

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
bit overpriced i wasn't really happy

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.320 
bit overpriced i wasn't really happy
with<00:04:26.760> paying<00:04:26.940> 30

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
other than that there's not much lay on

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.670 
other than that there's not much lay on
the<00:04:57.419> table<00:04:57.449> design<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:57.990> mean<00:04:58.289> there's<00:04:58.469> just

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
the table design I mean there's just

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.640 
the table design I mean there's just
enough<00:04:59.009> there<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.520> say<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.569> have<00:05:00.780> some<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.620> I

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
enough there to say you have some so I

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.529 
enough there to say you have some so I
really<00:05:02.069> like<00:05:02.250> this<00:05:02.400> case<00:05:02.699> like<00:05:03.180> I<00:05:03.270> said<00:05:03.330> it

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
really like this case like I said it

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.540 
really like this case like I said it
might<00:05:03.690> be<00:05:03.719> a<00:05:03.810> little<00:05:04.020> bit<00:05:04.169> expensive<00:05:04.469> at<00:05:04.740> $35

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
might be a little bit expensive at $35

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.159 
might be a little bit expensive at $35
and<00:05:05.819> there<00:05:06.060> are<00:05:06.210> other<00:05:06.389> alternatives<00:05:06.449> on

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
and there are other alternatives on

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.930 
and there are other alternatives on
amazon<00:05:07.650> for<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.979> little<00:05:08.099> bit<00:05:08.219> cheaper<00:05:08.610> but<00:05:08.819> they

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
amazon for a little bit cheaper but they

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.869 
amazon for a little bit cheaper but they
might<00:05:09.150> be<00:05:09.300> cheaper<00:05:09.509> made<00:05:09.919> but<00:05:10.919> i<00:05:11.250> really<00:05:11.669> like

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
might be cheaper made but i really like

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.520 
might be cheaper made but i really like
this<00:05:12.060> i<00:05:12.240> like<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.539> way<00:05:12.659> it<00:05:12.780> feels<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:13.289> doesn't

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
this i like the way it feels it doesn't

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.379 
this i like the way it feels it doesn't

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.930 
phone I mean the stands nice the grips
really<00:05:18.479> nice<00:05:18.659> as<00:05:19.139> a<00:05:19.169> nice<00:05:19.440> grip<00:05:19.770> feels<00:05:20.610> good

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
really nice as a nice grip feels good

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.640 
really nice as a nice grip feels good
handling<00:05:21.360> both<00:05:21.569> like<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:22.440> like<00:05:22.469> this

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
handling both like this and like this

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.040 
handling both like this and like this
I'm<00:05:23.069> no<00:05:23.279> issues<00:05:23.699> buttons<00:05:24.479> are<00:05:24.599> all<00:05:24.719> easy<00:05:24.870> to

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
I'm no issues buttons are all easy to

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.200 
I'm no issues buttons are all easy to
get<00:05:25.199> to<00:05:25.379> I<00:05:25.620> have<00:05:26.189> a<00:05:26.250> screen<00:05:26.490> protector<00:05:26.639> with<00:05:27.060> it

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
get to I have a screen protector with it

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.450 
get to I have a screen protector with it
so<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.509> front<00:05:27.870> is<00:05:27.990> protected<00:05:28.439> as<00:05:28.529> well<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:28.979> so

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
so the front is protected as well and so

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.249 
so the front is protected as well and so
I<00:05:29.490> think<00:05:29.789> this<00:05:30.060> works<00:05:30.300> just<00:05:30.659> right<00:05:30.930> for<00:05:31.139> me<00:05:31.229> I

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
I think this works just right for me I

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:32.990 
I think this works just right for me I
don't<00:05:31.590> like<00:05:31.680> having<00:05:31.889> a<00:05:31.979> big<00:05:32.129> bulky<00:05:32.490> phone<00:05:32.729> and

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
don't like having a big bulky phone and

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.700 
don't like having a big bulky phone and
so<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.389> think<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.779> combination<00:05:33.960> of<00:05:34.319> this<00:05:34.440> case

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
so I think the combination of this case

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.019 
so I think the combination of this case
of<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:34.919> screen<00:05:35.190> protector<00:05:35.580> just<00:05:35.879> works

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.029 
of the screen protector just works

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.300 
of the screen protector just works
perfectly<00:05:36.449> fine<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.830> if<00:05:37.919> you're<00:05:38.039> looking<00:05:38.129> for

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
perfectly fine so if you're looking for

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.209 
perfectly fine so if you're looking for
a<00:05:38.699> case<00:05:39.270> that's<00:05:39.449> kind<00:05:39.719> of<00:05:39.779> a<00:05:40.259> little<00:05:41.039> above

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
a case that's kind of a little above

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:43.790 
a case that's kind of a little above
minimalistic<00:05:41.940> but<00:05:42.150> it's<00:05:42.509> I'm<00:05:43.020> not<00:05:43.319> like<00:05:43.770> a

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
minimalistic but it's I'm not like a

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.279 
minimalistic but it's I'm not like a
defender<00:05:44.400> or<00:05:44.580> auto<00:05:44.759> box<00:05:45.029> full<00:05:45.629> water<00:05:45.839> box<00:05:46.080> or

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
defender or auto box full water box or

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.689 
defender or auto box full water box or
something<00:05:46.379> like<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.680> this<00:05:47.460> would<00:05:47.610> be<00:05:47.639> the

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
something like that this would be the

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.579 
something like that this would be the
case<00:05:48.000> for<00:05:48.029> you<00:05:48.330> it's<00:05:49.020> up<00:05:49.139> to<00:05:49.229> you<00:05:49.319> if<00:05:49.409> you<00:05:49.440> want

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:49.589 
case for you it's up to you if you want

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:51.350 
case for you it's up to you if you want
to<00:05:49.650> spend<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:49.889> money<00:05:50.099> but<00:05:50.699> I<00:05:50.729> think<00:05:51.240> it's

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
to spend the money but I think it's

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.420 
to spend the money but I think it's
worth<00:05:51.419> it<00:05:51.750> I'm<00:05:51.930> after<00:05:52.440> having<00:05:53.159> it<00:05:53.250> for<00:05:53.400> a
