silk screening you know it's only one
color<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.479> only<00:01:36.659> way<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.290> a

color so the only way to get it like a
grey<00:01:37.770> or<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.189> value<00:01:38.820> effect<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.810> work<00:01:39.930> with

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
grey or a value effect is to work with

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
grey or a value effect is to work with
half<00:01:40.290> tones<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:42.270> halftone<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.950> small

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
half tones and the halftone is so small

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.780 
half tones and the halftone is so small
on<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.119> trying<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.869> much<00:01:46.020> detail

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
on this one trying to get as much detail

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.120 
on this one trying to get as much detail

some of the image got compromised this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.340 
some of the image got compromised this
is<00:01:50.280> probably<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> better<00:01:51.060> prints<00:01:51.509> as

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
is probably one of the better prints as

is probably one of the better prints as
you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:52.979> see<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.680> big<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.920> obama<00:01:56.340> stat

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you can see it's a a big like obama stat

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.560 
you can see it's a a big like obama stat
or<00:01:56.880> obama<00:01:57.450> obey<00:01:58.200> style<00:01:58.619> thing<00:01:59.399> he<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.329> going

for with this one and you know it kind

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.209 
for with this one and you know it kind
of<00:02:03.570> looks<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.840> he's<00:02:04.020> got<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> dirty<00:02:04.530> robot<00:02:04.979> now

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
of looks like he's got a dirty robot now

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.139 
of looks like he's got a dirty robot now
but<00:02:05.700> um<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:07.049> know<00:02:07.459> it's<00:02:08.459> kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> be

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
but um you know it's kind of going to be

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.639 
but um you know it's kind of going to be
up<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> my<00:02:09.509> judgment<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.200> whether<00:02:10.440> i

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
up to my judgment as to whether i

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.710 
up to my judgment as to whether i
continue<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.430> i<00:02:11.730> think<00:02:12.450> they<00:02:12.540> look

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
continue with these i think they look

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
continue with these i think they look
pretty<00:02:12.750> cool<00:02:13.110> from<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.470> fall

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
pretty cool from a fall

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.240 
pretty cool from a fall
are<00:02:13.830> as<00:02:14.990> it<00:02:15.990> kind<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.320> gives<00:02:16.500> some<00:02:16.770> character

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
are as it kind of gives some character

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.140 
are as it kind of gives some character
to<00:02:17.280> them<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.420> obviously<00:02:18.570> isn't<00:02:19.550> what<00:02:20.550> he's

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
to them but it obviously isn't what he's

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.810 
to them but it obviously isn't what he's
really<00:02:21.360> looking<00:02:21.600> for<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.230> think<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.340> what<00:02:23.730> I'm

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
really looking for I think so what I'm

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.640 
really looking for I think so what I'm
going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> do<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.510> probably<00:02:24.900> finish<00:02:25.350> out<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
going to do is probably finish out the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.550 
going to do is probably finish out the
print<00:02:26.630> clean<00:02:27.630> off<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> screen<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.350> do<00:02:28.470> as

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
print clean off the screen and do as

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.710 
print clean off the screen and do as
best<00:02:28.710> I<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:28.980> I'll<00:02:29.910> talk<00:02:30.060> about<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.360> one<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.660> a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
best I can I'll talk about this one in a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.680 
best I can I'll talk about this one in a
second<00:02:31.050> but<00:02:31.200> yeah<00:02:31.590> finish<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.100> maybe<00:02:32.940> six<00:02:33.600> or

seven more of these in the white as I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.030 
seven more of these in the white as I
got<00:02:36.120> through<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.450> red<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.810> kind<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.140> stopped

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040

got through the red and kind of stopped
myself<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.840> kind<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.960> think<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.500> through

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
myself to kind of think it through

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.830 
myself to kind of think it through
before<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.580> just<00:02:41.880> kind<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.120> waste<00:02:42.450> supplies

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
before I just kind of waste supplies

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.410 
before I just kind of waste supplies
doing<00:02:43.290> uh<00:02:43.520> doing<00:02:44.520> some<00:02:44.640> old<00:02:44.910> friends<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.270> it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
doing uh doing some old friends of it

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.060 
doing uh doing some old friends of it
but<00:02:45.990> I'm<00:02:46.140> going<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.350> go<00:02:46.470> back<00:02:46.500> at<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.830> with<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
but I'm going to go back at it with a

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.970 
but I'm going to go back at it with a
nice<00:02:47.280> clean<00:02:47.610> screen<00:02:48.030> maybe<00:02:48.620> clean<00:02:49.620> up<00:02:49.740> some<00:02:49.920> of

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
nice clean screen maybe clean up some of

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.220 
nice clean screen maybe clean up some of
this<00:02:50.070> because<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.700> started<00:02:51.090> off<00:02:51.240> pretty<00:02:51.690> good

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
this because it started off pretty good

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.560 
this because it started off pretty good
and<00:02:52.500> then<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.920> got<00:02:53.040> worse<00:02:53.250> as<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.670> went<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:54.450> not

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
and then it got worse as I went it's not

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.000 
and then it got worse as I went it's not
like<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.870> emulsion<00:02:55.260> was<00:02:55.350> kicking<00:02:55.680> out<00:02:55.830> or

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
like the emulsion was kicking out or

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.990 
like the emulsion was kicking out or
something<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.760> yeah<00:02:57.290> over<00:02:58.290> here<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:59.670> one

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
something but yeah over here this one

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.540 
something but yeah over here this one
actually<00:03:00.300> got<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:00.720> cooked<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.890> had<00:03:02.340> late

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
actually got like cooked in I had late

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.250 
actually got like cooked in I had late
to<00:03:02.820> on<00:03:03.000> top<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.330> eight<00:03:03.450> one<00:03:03.720> another<00:03:03.960> to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
to on top of eight one another to

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260 
to on top of eight one another to
because<00:03:05.130> only<00:03:05.280> like<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.640> bottoms<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.150> them

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
because only like the bottoms of them

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.320 
because only like the bottoms of them
were<00:03:06.390> wet<00:03:06.630> still<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:08.550> like<00:03:08.790> melted

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
were wet still and it like melted

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.180 
were wet still and it like melted
totally<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.580> that's<00:03:11.690> not<00:03:12.690> really<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.530> it's

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
totally so that's not really a it's

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.280 
totally so that's not really a it's
still<00:03:14.430> sticky<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.970> back<00:03:15.290> surprisingly

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
still sticky on the back surprisingly

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.000 
still sticky on the back surprisingly
but<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:17.540> definitely<00:03:18.540> had<00:03:18.870> something<00:03:19.770> else

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
but it's definitely had something else

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.710 
but it's definitely had something else
to<00:03:20.160> look<00:03:20.250> out<00:03:20.490> for<00:03:20.520> because<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.150> didn't<00:03:21.630> even

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
to look out for because I didn't even

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.240 
to look out for because I didn't even
leave<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.050> in<00:03:22.140> for<00:03:22.170> too<00:03:22.410> long<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.040> back

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
leave it in for too long and the back

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.500 
leave it in for too long and the back
isn't<00:03:23.580> even<00:03:23.820> like<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.030> charred<00:03:24.570> it's<00:03:25.820> just<00:03:26.820> kind

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
isn't even like a charred it's just kind

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.080 
isn't even like a charred it's just kind
of<00:03:27.570> melted<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.200> don't<00:03:28.590> know<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:29.640> I'm<00:03:29.820> going<00:03:30.030> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
of melted I don't know that I'm going to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.640 
of melted I don't know that I'm going to
be<00:03:30.150> looking<00:03:30.450> at<00:03:30.570> doing<00:03:30.720> some<00:03:31.050> circle

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
be looking at doing some circle

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.110 
be looking at doing some circle
halftones<00:03:32.040> because<00:03:32.370> these<00:03:32.520> ones<00:03:32.760> worked<00:03:32.970> out

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
halftones because these ones worked out

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.350 
halftones because these ones worked out
just<00:03:33.150> fine<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.670> granted<00:03:35.670> it's<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.940> bit<00:03:36.120> bigger

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
just fine and granted it's a bit bigger

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.660 
just fine and granted it's a bit bigger
of<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.600> halftone<00:03:37.050> but<00:03:37.830> hopefully<00:03:38.310> I'll<00:03:38.460> be<00:03:38.490> able

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
of a halftone but hopefully I'll be able

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.830 
of a halftone but hopefully I'll be able
to<00:03:38.820> get<00:03:39.090> better<00:03:39.390> results<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:40.380> later<00:03:40.890> prints

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
to get better results with later prints

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.600 
to get better results with later prints
because<00:03:42.840> he<00:03:43.170> has<00:03:43.260> some<00:03:43.470> other<00:03:43.590> ones<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.580> I

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
because he has some other ones that I

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.700 
because he has some other ones that I
was<00:03:44.820> going<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.090> do<00:03:45.270> instead<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.350> just<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
was going to do instead of just the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.280 
was going to do instead of just the
black<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.070> white<00:03:47.190> version<00:03:47.580> try<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.850> get<00:03:47.940> some

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
black and white version try and get some

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.690 
black and white version try and get some
variations<00:03:49.290> but<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.620> not<00:03:49.800> i'll<00:03:50.130> have<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.460> stick

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
variations but if not i'll have to stick

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.550 
variations but if not i'll have to stick
with<00:03:50.730> these<00:03:51.450> because<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.870> mean<00:03:52.170> these<00:03:52.320> come<00:03:52.530> out

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
with these because I mean these come out

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.280 
with these because I mean these come out
really<00:03:52.890> nice<00:03:53.360> really<00:03:54.360> crisp<00:03:54.750> lines<00:03:55.020> because

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
really nice really crisp lines because

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.740 
really nice really crisp lines because
they<00:03:55.440> are<00:03:55.530> just<00:03:55.740> black<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:55.980> white<00:03:56.310> and

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
they are just black and white and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.930 
they are just black and white and
there's<00:03:57.750> no<00:03:57.900> really<00:03:58.350> thin<00:03:58.620> sections<00:03:59.160> like

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
there's no really thin sections like

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.290 
there's no really thin sections like
this<00:04:00.240> because<00:04:00.480> these<00:04:00.720> are<00:04:00.930> just<00:04:01.650> barely<00:04:02.300> have

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
this because these are just barely have

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.990 
this because these are just barely have
emulsion<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:03.870> them<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.290> if<00:04:04.410> I'm<00:04:04.980> guessing<00:04:05.790> it's

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
emulsion on them so if I'm guessing it's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.090 
emulsion on them so if I'm guessing it's
like<00:04:06.210> when<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.510> screen<00:04:06.810> shifts<00:04:08.360> or<00:04:09.360> like<00:04:09.630> the

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
like when the screen shifts or like the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.260 
like when the screen shifts or like the
fibers<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.310> mesh<00:04:11.550> shift<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:12.000> little<00:04:12.120> bit

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
fibers of the mesh shift a little bit

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.420 
fibers of the mesh shift a little bit
that's<00:04:12.870> why<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.200> have<00:04:13.770> like<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.160> thicker

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
that's why I have like the thicker

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.449 
that's why I have like the thicker
sections<00:04:14.730> in<00:04:15.150> there<00:04:15.360> so<00:04:15.990> you<00:04:16.890> know<00:04:16.980> I'll<00:04:17.310> have

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
sections in there so you know I'll have

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.539 
sections in there so you know I'll have
to<00:04:17.640> play<00:04:17.910> around<00:04:18.030> with<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.480> bit<00:04:18.510> more<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.140> uh

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
to play around with it a bit more but uh

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.250 
to play around with it a bit more but uh
I've<00:04:20.549> got<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.790> bunch<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.090> good<00:04:21.270> little<00:04:21.900> ones<00:04:22.080> at

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
I've got a bunch of good little ones at

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.190 
I've got a bunch of good little ones at
least<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.620> show<00:04:22.800> from<00:04:23.040> today's<00:04:23.790> work<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.419> you

least the show from today's work and you
know<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.320> bit<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.680> disappointment<00:04:26.070> towards<00:04:26.550> the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
know a bit of disappointment towards the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.590 
know a bit of disappointment towards the
live<00:04:26.820> stream<00:04:27.150> but

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
live stream but

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.530 
live stream but
I<00:04:27.690> update<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:29.100> this<00:04:29.310> video<00:04:29.670> hopefully

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
I update you in this video hopefully

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.150 
I update you in this video hopefully
five<00:04:30.960> minutes<00:04:31.290> of<00:04:32.000> little<00:04:33.000> excuses<00:04:33.540> can<00:04:34.160> deal

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
five minutes of little excuses can deal

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.160 
five minutes of little excuses can deal
with<00:04:35.310> that<00:04:35.340> until<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:35.940> can<00:04:36.300> figure<00:04:36.930> out<00:04:37.080> the

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
with that until I can figure out the

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.410 
with that until I can figure out the
live<00:04:37.860> stream<00:04:38.130> situation<00:04:38.700> as<00:04:38.850> streaming<00:04:39.240> on

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
live stream situation as streaming on

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.600 
live stream situation as streaming on
other<00:04:39.570> sites<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:40.080> just<00:04:40.350> not<00:04:40.920> worth<00:04:41.190> it<00:04:41.370> in<00:04:41.520> the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
other sites is just not worth it in the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.920 
other sites is just not worth it in the
least<00:04:41.790> bit<00:04:41.910> because<00:04:42.210> they<00:04:42.420> always<00:04:42.750> have

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
least bit because they always have

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.840 
least bit because they always have
advertisements<00:04:43.860> every<00:04:44.250> like<00:04:44.430> two<00:04:44.640> minutes

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
advertisements every like two minutes

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.240 
advertisements every like two minutes
and<00:04:45.150> it's<00:04:45.300> just<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.660> big<00:04:46.410> pain<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:46.980> that's<00:04:47.160> going

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
and it's just a big pain so that's going

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.230 
and it's just a big pain so that's going
to<00:04:47.310> do<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.550> for<00:04:47.580> me<00:04:47.790> if<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.000> have<00:04:48.090> any
