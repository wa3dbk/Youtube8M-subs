steeping<00:01:56.790> temperature<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:57.689> again<00:01:58.290> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
steeping temperature here again you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
steeping temperature here again you
don't<00:01:58.590> want<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> boil<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.640> will

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
don't want it to boil because that will

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.690 
don't want it to boil because that will
attack<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.049> outside<00:02:01.530> surface<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.340> ham

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
attack the outside surface of the ham

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.730 
attack the outside surface of the ham
deteriorating<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> little<00:02:04.619> bit

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
deteriorating it and so a little bit

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.479 
deteriorating it and so a little bit
slower<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.759> better<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.509> regard<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.489> four

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
slower is better in this regard so four

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.210 
slower is better in this regard so four
hours<00:02:09.020> we'll<00:02:10.020> check<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> temperature<00:02:10.770> we

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
hours we'll check the temperature we

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.660 
hours we'll check the temperature we
might<00:02:11.400> need<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.580> little<00:02:11.790> bit<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:12.030> time

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
might need a little bit more time

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.830 
might need a little bit more time
after<00:02:12.970> that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.230 

it's<00:02:20.840> been<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.050> little<00:02:21.260> over<00:02:21.410> four<00:02:21.770> hours<00:02:22.240> I'm

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
it's been a little over four hours I'm

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.400 
it's been a little over four hours I'm
going<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.480> reach<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.780> here<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.960> grab<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.260> little

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
going to reach in here and grab a little

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.710 
going to reach in here and grab a little
piece<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.040> netting<00:02:25.630> with<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.350 
and we're going to grab the clip right
use<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> towel<00:02:33.830> if<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.100> want<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.460> pull<00:02:35.240> this

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
use a towel if you want and pull this

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.200 
use a towel if you want and pull this
ham<00:02:35.660> out<00:02:42.310> we're<00:02:43.310> going<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.490> check<00:02:44.000> its

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
ham out we're going to check its

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.630 
ham out we're going to check its
temperature<00:02:44.560> through<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.680> medius<00:02:46.250> part

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
temperature through this medius part

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.310 
temperature through this medius part
here<00:02:46.940> there's<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.180> bone<00:02:47.420> running<00:02:47.840> up<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.200> then

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
here there's a bone running up and then

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.550 
here there's a bone running up and then
the<00:02:48.410> H<00:02:48.590> bone<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.730> thickest<00:02:50.150> part

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the H bone this is the thickest part

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.100 
the H bone this is the thickest part
this<00:02:51.580> thermometer<00:02:52.580> here<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.720> got<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> little

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
this thermometer here it's got a little

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.110 
this thermometer here it's got a little
dimple<00:02:54.560> about<00:02:54.950> an<00:02:55.070> inch<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.490> a<00:02:55.640> quarter<00:02:55.850> up

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
dimple about an inch and a quarter up

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.449 
dimple about an inch and a quarter up
the<00:02:56.300> shaft<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.709> part<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.100> the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
the shaft and that is the part of the

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.070 
the shaft and that is the part of the
thermometer<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.090> actually<00:02:59.480> reads<00:02:59.900> the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
thermometer that actually reads the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.890 
thermometer that actually reads the
temperature<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:00.890> want<00:03:01.130> this<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.580> be<00:03:02.180> into

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
temperature so you want this to be into

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.160 
temperature so you want this to be into
the<00:03:03.080> thickest<00:03:03.470> part<00:03:03.530> or<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.040> middle<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:05.170> the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
the thickest part or the middle of the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.090 
the thickest part or the middle of the
ham<00:03:07.030> when<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.120> insert<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.690> thermometer<00:03:09.100> do

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
ham when you insert the thermometer do

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.430 
ham when you insert the thermometer do
it<00:03:10.220> in<00:03:10.340> an<00:03:10.459> upright<00:03:10.820> position<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.630> 120

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
it in an upright position so the 120

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.430 
it in an upright position so the 120
degree<00:03:12.709> mark<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.100> say<00:03:13.520> at<00:03:13.760> 12<00:03:14.090> 12<00:03:14.870> o'clock<00:03:15.260> for

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
degree mark is say at 12 12 o'clock for

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.510 
degree mark is say at 12 12 o'clock for
example<00:03:15.830> because<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.100> don't<00:03:16.280> want<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.459> be

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
example because you don't want to be

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.300 
example because you don't want to be
twisting<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:18.110> dial<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.709> this<00:03:18.890> because<00:03:19.190> these

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
twisting the dial of this because these

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.150 
twisting the dial of this because these
you<00:03:19.640> can<00:03:19.820> knock<00:03:20.480> off<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.080> calibration<00:03:21.709> so

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
you can knock off the the calibration so

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.770 
you can knock off the the calibration so
I'm<00:03:22.250> turning<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.180> using<00:03:24.019> a<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:25.160> shaft<00:03:25.780> now

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
I'm turning this using a the shaft now

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.509 
I'm turning this using a the shaft now
we're<00:03:27.530> looking<00:03:27.620> for<00:03:27.800> an<00:03:28.340> internal

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
we're looking for an internal

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.440 
we're looking for an internal
temperature<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:29.620> 155<00:03:30.620> degrees<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.420> with<00:03:32.420> a

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
temperature of 155 degrees and with a

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.240 
temperature of 155 degrees and with a
little<00:03:32.720> carryover<00:03:33.290> cooking<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:34.100> will

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
little carryover cooking it will

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.940 
little carryover cooking it will
eventually<00:03:34.459> peak<00:03:35.000> at<00:03:35.180> about<00:03:35.420> 160<00:03:36.170> which<00:03:36.709> will

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
eventually peak at about 160 which will

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.239 
eventually peak at about 160 which will
be<00:03:37.239> perfect
