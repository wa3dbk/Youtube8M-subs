00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 life and she can take us because I 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 I always give it light and it does not spoil 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.619

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:23.359

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.910
 and the bottom of your wood will stay 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.910

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:16.400
 You will speak in the white and brown logan. 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.780

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.320

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.520
 enjoy 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.100
 then you will presenting water 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:54.500
 risking representing the water goes 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.899
 registering and going to stay more or less 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.119
 in this result here 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.950
 Now that much I do not know if they are 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:13.489

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:22.340
 So there you now cover you both, right? 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:29.269
 gil carey show is good 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:35.720
 white is closed then you do 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:41.930
 that you close and which ended in the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:45.739
 bottle and shake it and the inks stay 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.230
 in voting you want you can also 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.549
 to put a finger on a brush 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.400
 But anyway mines is this result and you 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.540
 it can not make darker because otherwise 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.769
 a monk drank but inside that's it 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.170
 always remember to give a bottle of 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.570

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.489
