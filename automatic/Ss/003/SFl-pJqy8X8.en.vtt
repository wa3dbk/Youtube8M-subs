00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
actually hiding the kits really nicely

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.729 
actually hiding the kits really nicely
but<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.809> I'll<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.079> I'll<00:00:37.170> take<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.469> off<00:00:37.530> her

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
but what I'll do is I'll take it off her

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.850 
but what I'll do is I'll take it off her
and<00:00:37.980> I'll<00:00:38.070> show<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.930> exactly<00:00:39.930> how<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.590> looks

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and I'll show you exactly how it looks

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.240 
and I'll show you exactly how it looks
so<00:00:41.309> there's<00:00:42.300> little<00:00:42.390> press<00:00:42.690> studs<00:00:43.250> so

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so there's little press studs so

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
so there's little press studs so
basically<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:45.660> nice<00:00:45.809> soft

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
basically and it's really nice soft

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.680 
basically and it's really nice soft
material<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.000> because<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.149> new<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
material but because it's new it's a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.790 
material but because it's new it's a
little<00:00:48.989> bit<00:00:49.079> tricky<00:00:49.430> sorta<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.730> one-handed

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
little bit tricky sorta to do one-handed

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:01.549 
little bit tricky sorta to do one-handed
but<00:00:53.149> it's<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.270> stunts<00:00:59.030> okay<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
but it's all stunts okay so it is and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.359 
but it's all stunts okay so it is and
basically<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:03.449> outer<00:01:03.750> layer<00:01:04.369> so

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
basically it's just an outer layer so

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.300 
basically it's just an outer layer so
just<00:01:05.700> probably<00:01:05.850> Garcinia<00:01:10.010> just<00:01:11.010> take<00:01:11.189> these

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
just probably Garcinia just take these

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.050 
just probably Garcinia just take these
off<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.640> quickly

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.810 

okay<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.120> this<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.810> um<00:01:21.320> basically<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.550> nappy

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
okay so this is um basically the nappy

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.880 
okay so this is um basically the nappy
and<00:01:23.240> like<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.480> said<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:24.050> can<00:01:24.080> change<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.530> sizes

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
and like I said you can change the sizes

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.630 
and like I said you can change the sizes
so<00:01:25.220> if<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.610> just<00:01:25.640> unclip<00:01:26.770> he<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.400> like

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
so if I just unclip he is this like

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.320 
so if I just unclip he is this like
three<00:01:28.910> Clips<00:01:30.220> just<00:01:31.220> there<00:01:32.410> so<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.650> goes<00:01:34.330> I'm

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
three Clips just there so it goes I'm

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.760 
three Clips just there so it goes I'm
assuming<00:01:35.720> poor<00:01:35.930> because<00:01:36.110> she's<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.410> small

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
assuming poor because she's a small

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.930 
assuming poor because she's a small
docket<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.050> I'd<00:01:39.050> say<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.440> 16<00:01:39.830> inches<00:01:40.160> right<00:01:40.760> up

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
docket so I'd say the 16 inches right up

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.249 
docket so I'd say the 16 inches right up
to<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:42.229> 22<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:43.340> sort<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.610> 23<00:01:44.090> inches<00:01:44.840> i<00:01:45.020> haven't

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
to the 22 to sort of 23 inches i haven't

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.690 
to the 22 to sort of 23 inches i haven't
tried<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:45.440> on<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.650> toddler's<00:01:46.100> yet<00:01:46.280> but<00:01:46.490> i

tried it on the toddler's yet but i

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.640 
tried it on the toddler's yet but i

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
don't think they will fit the toddler's

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.620 
don't think they will fit the toddler's
because<00:01:48.860> they<00:01:48.979> are<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.400> little<00:01:49.910> bit<00:01:50.090> well<00:01:50.540> they

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.050 
look a little bit to sort of small for
them<00:01:52.520> but<00:01:52.960> that's<00:01:53.960> okay<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:55.130> anyway<00:01:55.580> so<00:01:55.940> you've

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.250 
here is where you actually downsize it
so<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.320> can<00:02:15.470> downsize<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:16.010> I'm<00:02:16.489> sort<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.790> twice

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
so you can downsize it I'm sort of twice

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.770 
so you can downsize it I'm sort of twice
I'm<00:02:18.260> thinking<00:02:18.910> just<00:02:19.910> put<00:02:20.120> them<00:02:20.269> together<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
I'm thinking just put them together and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.570 
I'm thinking just put them together and
that<00:02:21.049> shortens<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.130> can<00:02:22.250> put<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.489> on

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
that shortens it so you can put it on

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.289 
that shortens it so you can put it on
your<00:02:22.730> smaller<00:02:23.030> babies<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:24.790> you've<00:02:25.790> also<00:02:26.000> got
