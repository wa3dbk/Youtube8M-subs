the<00:00:04.920> concept<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.580> relaxation<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.599> Taichi<00:00:06.809> is

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
the concept of relaxation and Taichi is

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.930 
the concept of relaxation and Taichi is
interesting<00:00:07.889> because<00:00:08.480> the<00:00:09.480> idea<00:00:09.690> behind<00:00:10.940> sort

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
interesting because the idea behind sort

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.240 
interesting because the idea behind sort
of<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.090> real<00:00:12.300> technical<00:00:12.870> meaning<00:00:13.260> of<00:00:13.769> what

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
of the real technical meaning of what

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.369 
of the real technical meaning of what
we're<00:00:14.370> trying<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.760> do<00:00:14.940> when<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.360> try<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> relax

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
we're trying to do when we try to relax

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.399 
we're trying to do when we try to relax
is<00:00:16.470> not<00:00:17.340> necessarily<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.390> same<00:00:18.659> idea<00:00:19.019> people

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:19.409 
is not necessarily the same idea people

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.380 
is not necessarily the same idea people
have<00:00:19.619> when<00:00:20.249> they<00:00:20.369> think<00:00:20.400> about<00:00:20.669> relaxation

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
have when they think about relaxation

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.649 
have when they think about relaxation
like<00:00:21.900> lying<00:00:22.679> on<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.009> beach<00:00:23.159> or<00:00:23.730> crashing<00:00:24.539> on

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:24.659 
like lying on the beach or crashing on

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.499 
like lying on the beach or crashing on
your<00:00:24.689> couch<00:00:24.989> or<00:00:25.730> whatever<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.210> kind<00:00:27.419> of

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
your couch or whatever we do to kind of

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.969 
your couch or whatever we do to kind of
blow<00:00:27.779> off<00:00:27.960> steam<00:00:28.169> and<00:00:28.649> relax<00:00:30.259> ultimately<00:00:31.259> what

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:31.979 
blow off steam and relax ultimately what

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:33.350 
blow off steam and relax ultimately what
you're<00:00:32.099> setting<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.820> Tai<00:00:33.000> Chi<00:00:33.239> is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
you're setting up in Tai Chi is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.689 
you're setting up in Tai Chi is
incredibly<00:00:34.020> relaxing<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.859> incredibly

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
incredibly relaxing and incredibly

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.599 
incredibly relaxing and incredibly
rejuvenating<00:00:36.449> but<00:00:37.199> it<00:00:37.320> takes<00:00:38.039> a<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.460> bit

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
rejuvenating but it takes a little bit

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.419 
rejuvenating but it takes a little bit

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
more explaining to get across what we

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.750 
more explaining to get across what we
mean<00:00:41.609> by<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.969> term<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:43.370> one<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> ways

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
mean by this term and one of the ways

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.490 
mean by this term and one of the ways
that<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.390> start<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:45.780> about<00:00:46.199> it<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that you can start to think about it is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.040 
that you can start to think about it is
you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:47.129> start<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.519> think<00:00:47.550> about<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.570> idea<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you can start to think about the idea of

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.389 
you can start to think about the idea of
hanging<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.460> something<00:00:51.589> right<00:00:52.589> so<00:00:52.920> when

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
hanging off of something right so when

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
hanging off of something right so when
you're<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.609> kid<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.629> grab<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you're a kid and you grab on to the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.770 
you're a kid and you grab on to the
monkey<00:00:55.859> bars<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.609> you're<00:00:56.879> holding<00:00:57.089> on<00:00:57.420> or

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
monkey bars and you're holding on or

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.759 
monkey bars and you're holding on or
think<00:00:58.019> about<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> would<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
think about what you would do at a

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.099 
think about what you would do at a
playground<00:00:59.249> or<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.940> kind<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.179> let<00:01:00.839> your

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
playground or you kind of let your

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.889 
playground or you kind of let your
weight<00:01:01.350> sink<00:01:02.039> back<00:01:02.460> from<00:01:02.909> something<00:01:03.390> or

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
weight sink back from something or

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.650 
weight sink back from something or
you're<00:01:04.080> hanging<00:01:04.650> off<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.800> up<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
you're hanging off it up here and you

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.110 
you're hanging off it up here and you
dangle<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.820> first

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
dangle down like that that's the first

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.300 
dangle down like that that's the first
that's<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.780> sort<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.200> relatable<00:01:10.830> feeling

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that's a sort of relatable feeling

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
that's a sort of relatable feeling
that's<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> first<00:01:11.850> feeling<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> want

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that's the first feeling that you want

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.960 
that's the first feeling that you want
to<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:13.800> get<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.340> inside<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
to get but we get it going inside the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.430 
to get but we get it going inside the
body<00:01:15.410> so<00:01:16.410> imagine<00:01:16.860> holding<00:01:17.010> onto<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.550> bar<00:01:17.730> and

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
body so imagine holding onto the bar and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.800 
body so imagine holding onto the bar and
let<00:01:19.440> yourself<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.190> sink<00:01:20.730> gradually<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
let yourself kind of sink gradually and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.400 
let yourself kind of sink gradually and
hang<00:01:22.650> off<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.370> and<00:01:24.020> what<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> notice

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
hang off of it and what do you notice

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.710 
hang off of it and what do you notice
about<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.980> difference<00:01:26.370> between<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.120> way<00:01:27.510> of

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
about the difference between that way of

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.560 
about the difference between that way of
letting<00:01:28.050> stuff<00:01:28.350> sink<00:01:28.710> versus<00:01:29.550> not<00:01:30.000> holding<00:01:30.450> on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
letting stuff sink versus not holding on

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.540 
letting stuff sink versus not holding on
to<00:01:30.720> anything<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.460> letting<00:01:32.460> yourself

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
to anything and just letting yourself

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.320 
to anything and just letting yourself
droop<00:01:33.210> down<00:01:34.010> can<00:01:35.010> you<00:01:35.100> feel<00:01:35.640> how<00:01:35.910> in<00:01:36.150> this

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
droop down can you feel how in this

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.740 
droop down can you feel how in this
version<00:01:36.660> everything<00:01:37.530> gets<00:01:37.710> compressed

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
version everything gets compressed

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.780 
version everything gets compressed
whereas<00:01:39.750> when<00:01:40.410> you've<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.010> fixed<00:01:41.370> point

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
whereas when you've got a fixed point

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.890 
whereas when you've got a fixed point
that<00:01:42.480> you're<00:01:42.720> hanging<00:01:42.930> from<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.450> Hang

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
that you're hanging from the Hang

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.430 
that you're hanging from the Hang
actually<00:01:46.830> lengthens<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.210> body<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.410> you

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
actually lengthens the body so you

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.470 
actually lengthens the body so you
release<00:01:49.980> from<00:01:50.430> here<00:01:50.760> from<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.300> and

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
release from here from here and

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.720 
release from here from here and
everything<00:01:52.020> starts<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.530> sink<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
everything starts to sink down and

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.490 
everything starts to sink down and
there's<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:54.360> there's<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.810> lengthening<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
there's just there's a lengthening that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.010 
there's just there's a lengthening that
goes<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.890> internally<00:01:56.600> that's<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.870> you're

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
goes on internally that's what you're

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.920 
goes on internally that's what you're
trying<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.440> across<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.040> Tai<00:01:59.220> Chi<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> let

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930

where you want to have that sense of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.340

lengthening<00:02:07.800> going<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.780> first<00:02:10.140> one<00:02:10.379> is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
lengthening going the first one is

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.290 
lengthening going the first one is
through<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> chest<00:02:11.450> right<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.900> in

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
of holding the chest up or even tensing

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.560 
of holding the chest up or even tensing
and<00:02:16.540> holding<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> shoulders<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.300> say

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
and holding the shoulders but you say

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.360 
and holding the shoulders but you say
and<00:02:19.780> Taichi<00:02:19.960> is<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.560> want<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.830> stretch

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and Taichi is that you want to stretch

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.720 
and Taichi is that you want to stretch
through<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.790> back<00:02:22.030> pluck<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.930> spine<00:02:23.260> up

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
through the back pluck the spine up

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.970 
through the back pluck the spine up
imagine<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.300> fixed-point<00:02:25.980> pulling

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
imagine this is the fixed-point pulling

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.830 
imagine this is the fixed-point pulling
up<00:02:27.100> through<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.430> spine<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.570> let<00:02:28.750> your

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
up through the spine and you let your

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.800 
up through the spine and you let your
chest<00:02:29.200> hang<00:02:29.530> down<00:02:29.800> from<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.330> this<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.660> one

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
chest hang down from it so this is one

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.890 
chest hang down from it so this is one
where<00:02:32.020> again<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:32.710> you<00:02:32.800> grab<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> bar<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:33.640> this

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
where again if you grab a bar like this

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.200 
where again if you grab a bar like this
you<00:02:34.900> let<00:02:35.260> your<00:02:35.470> chest<00:02:35.800> empty<00:02:36.430> into<00:02:36.790> your<00:02:36.940> back

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
you let your chest empty into your back

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.020 
you let your chest empty into your back
and<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:38.230> feel<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> stretch<00:02:39.130> up<00:02:39.460> through<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
and you feel the stretch up through the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.780 
and you feel the stretch up through the
spine<00:02:40.330> but<00:02:41.110> at<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.350> same<00:02:41.560> time<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.400> release

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
spine but at the same time you release

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.150 
spine but at the same time you release
the<00:02:43.030> energy<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.600> chest<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.530> ribs<00:02:44.830> and

the energy of the chest the ribs and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.310 
the energy of the chest the ribs and
everything<00:02:45.730> starts<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.180> relax<00:02:46.570> down<00:02:46.870> into<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
everything starts to relax down into the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.540 
everything starts to relax down into the
belly<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.720> second<00:02:50.200> place<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.710> in<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.160> qua<00:02:51.520> ran

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
belly the second place is in the qua ran

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.090 
belly the second place is in the qua ran
the<00:02:52.120> hips<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.720> want<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.230> sink<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.800> quads

the hips you want to sink the quads
soften<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:54.970> loosen<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.510> claw<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.230> again<00:02:57.220> it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
soften and loosen the claw and again it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.370 
soften and loosen the claw and again it
doesn't<00:02:58.210> happen<00:02:58.420> if<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.900> go<00:02:59.050> into<00:02:59.260> a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
doesn't happen if you go into a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.430 
doesn't happen if you go into a
squatting<00:03:00.220> motion<00:03:00.370> by<00:03:00.730> thinking<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.440> tensing

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
squatting motion by thinking of tensing

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.780 
squatting motion by thinking of tensing
everything<00:03:02.770> up<00:03:02.860> you<00:03:02.950> won't<00:03:03.100> get<00:03:03.250> any<00:03:03.400> release

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
everything up you won't get any release

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.870 
everything up you won't get any release
or<00:03:04.150> any<00:03:04.300> relaxation<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:05.200> way<00:03:05.400> but<00:03:06.400> instead

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
or any relaxation that way but instead

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.150 
or any relaxation that way but instead
if<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.480> have<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.110> upper<00:03:08.350> body<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.860> spine

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
if you have the upper body and the spine

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.230 
if you have the upper body and the spine
fixed<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.120> again<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.480> hold<00:03:10.690> on<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.020> something

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
fixed and again you hold on to something

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.680 
fixed and again you hold on to something
you<00:03:13.240> let<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.930> Lapp<00:03:14.730> soften<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.000> settle<00:03:16.420> down

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
you let the Lapp soften and settle down

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.750 
you let the Lapp soften and settle down
and<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.620> start<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.100> get<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.400> sense<00:03:18.670> of

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
and you start to get that sense of

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.729 
and you start to get that sense of
hollowing<00:03:19.300> through<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.840> claws<00:03:20.080> so<00:03:20.440> again

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
hollowing through the claws so again

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.150 
hollowing through the claws so again
it's<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.430> from<00:03:21.640> here<00:03:21.940> I'm<00:03:22.510> going<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.720> just

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
it's like from here I'm going to just

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.740 
it's like from here I'm going to just
instead<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.280> forcing<00:03:25.000> everything<00:03:25.390> back<00:03:25.570> and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
instead of forcing everything back and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.190 
instead of forcing everything back and
down<00:03:28.709> let<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:29.860> all<00:03:30.040> sink<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.510> there<00:03:31.900> are<00:03:31.989> two

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
down let it all sink and there are two

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.720 
down let it all sink and there are two
signs<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.800> you're<00:03:32.950> really<00:03:33.070> getting<00:03:33.310> this<00:03:33.550> to

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
signs that you're really getting this to

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.350 
signs that you're really getting this to
happen<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.239> claw<00:03:34.450> one<00:03:35.350> is<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.830> lap

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
happen in the claw one is that the lap

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.470 
happen in the claw one is that the lap
like<00:03:37.360> quality<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.320> front<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.860> qua

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
like quality of the front of the qua

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.420 
like quality of the front of the qua
gets<00:03:40.480> bigger<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.050> hollows<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.739> opens<00:03:42.130> and

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
gets bigger and hollows and opens and

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.780 
gets bigger and hollows and opens and
the<00:03:43.180> second<00:03:43.600> one<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.959> that<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.980> space<00:03:45.400> around

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the second one is that the space around

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.699 
the second one is that the space around
your<00:03:46.000> lumbar<00:03:46.390> spine<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:47.140> these<00:03:47.260> lumbar

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
your lumbar spine and these lumbar

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.790 
your lumbar spine and these lumbar
vertebra<00:03:48.250> open<00:03:49.150> up

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
vertebra open up

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.310 
vertebra open up
so<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.950> tailbone<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.670> sinking<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:53.170> hear

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
so the tailbone is sinking you hear

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.830 
so the tailbone is sinking you hear
tailbone<00:03:53.800> tucking<00:03:54.130> yes<00:03:54.940> eventually<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
tailbone tucking yes eventually the

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.260 
tailbone tucking yes eventually the
tailbone<00:03:56.320> rolls<00:03:56.650> under<00:03:57.040> but<00:03:57.580> not<00:03:57.850> from<00:03:58.150> a

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
tailbone rolls under but not from a

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.100 
tailbone rolls under but not from a
pelvic<00:03:58.630> tilt

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
pelvic tilt

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.790 
pelvic tilt
it's<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.250> sinking<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:00.880> claw<00:04:01.270> that

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
it's the sinking of the claw that

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.290 
it's the sinking of the claw that
releases<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:02.830> space<00:04:03.370> around<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.910> hips<00:04:04.090> and

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
releases the space around the hips and

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.530 
releases the space around the hips and
the<00:04:04.420> pelvis<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.080> sacrum<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:07.209> third

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
the pelvis and the sacrum and the third

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.180 
the pelvis and the sacrum and the third
one<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:08.050> I<00:04:08.080> think<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.380> lot<00:04:08.410> of<00:04:08.560> people<00:04:08.890> miss

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
one that I think a lot of people miss

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.310 
one that I think a lot of people miss
but<00:04:09.970> you<00:04:10.000> have<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.570> get<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:10.870> in<00:04:11.050> order<00:04:11.200> to

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
but you have to get this in order to

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.470 
but you have to get this in order to
really<00:04:11.680> get<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.040> energy<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.670> legs<00:04:12.910> to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
really get the energy of the legs to

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.250 
really get the energy of the legs to
sink<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:14.130> through<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.419> like<00:04:16.419> from<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.810> of

bad squat that's not what you want this
is<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.479> bad<00:04:39.750> version<00:04:40.160> but<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.340> try<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.669> go<00:04:41.819> down

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
is the bad version but I try to go down

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.300 
is the bad version but I try to go down
with<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.360> hips<00:04:42.740> but<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.770> push<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.160> knees

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
you see I actually stay a little more

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.279 
you see I actually stay a little more
vertical<00:04:49.639> and<00:04:50.639> it's<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.180> subtle<00:04:51.660> change<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:52.169> the

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
vertical and it's a subtle change in the

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.430 
vertical and it's a subtle change in the
angle<00:04:52.590> of<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.800> shin<00:04:53.069> to<00:04:53.280> go<00:04:53.759> from<00:04:54.569> here's

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
angle of the shin to go from here's

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.839 
angle of the shin to go from here's
where<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.800> foot<00:04:56.009> is<00:04:56.039> here's<00:04:56.430> where<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.639> shin

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
where the foot is here's where the shin

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.020 
where the foot is here's where the shin
is<00:04:56.880> you're<00:04:57.660> holding<00:04:57.870> this<00:04:58.229> up<00:04:58.410> no<00:04:59.039> you<00:04:59.070> let<00:04:59.849> it

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
is you're holding this up no you let it

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.330 
is you're holding this up no you let it
release<00:05:00.930> a<00:05:00.990> little<00:05:01.410> bit<00:05:01.560> you<00:05:01.889> let<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.190> energy

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
release a little bit you let the energy

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.270 
release a little bit you let the energy
from<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:02.880> knees<00:05:03.139> drop<00:05:04.139> down<00:05:04.560> into<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.039> feet

so you get the chest the kua and the
shins<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.599> ankles<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:11.340> have<00:05:11.750> the

shins and the ankles and you have the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.260 
shins and the ankles and you have the
lengthening<00:05:13.229> of<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.410> spine<00:05:13.889> and<00:05:14.280> the

lengthening of the spine and the

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.730 
lengthening of the spine and the
