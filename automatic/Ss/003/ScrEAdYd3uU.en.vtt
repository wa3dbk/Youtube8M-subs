a device now if you put that on top of
something<00:05:29.080> like<00:05:29.200> the<00:05:29.410> face<00:05:29.590> recognition<00:05:29.890> that

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
something like the face recognition that

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.330 
something like the face recognition that
google<00:05:30.640> already<00:05:30.910> has<00:05:31.180> or<00:05:31.540> pin<00:05:32.080> or<00:05:32.380> whatever

other authentication that you have on
your<00:05:34.780> device<00:05:35.280> definitely<00:05:36.280> very<00:05:36.460> nice<00:05:36.670> to<00:05:36.850> have

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
your device definitely very nice to have

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.150 
your device definitely very nice to have

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
some sort of stronger two-level

some sort of stronger two-level
authentication<00:05:39.670> on<00:05:39.940> the<00:05:40.060> device<00:05:40.330> so<00:05:40.660> it

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
authentication on the device so it

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.909 
authentication on the device so it
should<00:05:40.840> be<00:05:40.870> very<00:05:40.930> interesting<00:05:41.140> to<00:05:41.560> see<00:05:41.710> where

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
should be very interesting to see where

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.409 
should be very interesting to see where
Google<00:05:42.220> goes<00:05:42.430> with<00:05:42.669> this<00:05:42.850> if<00:05:43.090> it's<00:05:43.240> something

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
Google goes with this if it's something

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.909 
Google goes with this if it's something
maybe<00:05:43.720> they'll<00:05:43.930> let<00:05:44.020> you<00:05:44.110> integrate<00:05:44.440> into

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919

that can be kind of scary and not
terribly<00:06:22.150> useful<00:06:22.240> because<00:06:22.750> my<00:06:23.410> pc<00:06:23.770> is<00:06:23.800> not<00:06:24.040> at

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190

work<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:24.700> if<00:06:24.910> i<00:06:25.000> had<00:06:25.150> to<00:06:25.210> have<00:06:25.300> the<00:06:25.390> same

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
work and if i had to have the same

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.630 
work and if i had to have the same
software<00:06:25.900> running<00:06:26.140> on<00:06:26.260> every<00:06:26.530> machine<00:06:26.650> the

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
software running on every machine the

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.730 
software running on every machine the
security<00:06:28.510> factor<00:06:28.810> of<00:06:28.900> it<00:06:29.020> definitely<00:06:29.140> drops

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
security factor of it definitely drops

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.170 
security factor of it definitely drops
but<00:06:30.100> anyway<00:06:30.340> that's<00:06:30.520> gonna<00:06:30.730> be<00:06:30.880> about<00:06:31.000> all
