were to be a bit more upright I find
that<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.950> much<00:01:11.369> better<00:01:11.400> stretch

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that you get a much better stretch

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.060 
that you get a much better stretch
through<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> entire<00:01:12.869> range<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.560> motion<00:01:13.920> and

through the entire range of motion and
again<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.850> cables<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.689> nice<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> include

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
again with cables it's nice to include

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.170 
again with cables it's nice to include
them<00:01:16.619> every<00:01:16.830> once<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> while<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:17.939> with

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
them every once in a while because with

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.480 
them every once in a while because with
dumbbells<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> bottom<00:01:19.950> portion<00:01:20.100> when

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
dumbbells at the bottom portion when

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.760 
dumbbells at the bottom portion when
they're<00:01:20.610> down<00:01:20.820> close<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> your<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.409> sides

they're down close to your at your sides
there<00:01:23.189> there's<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.710> not<00:01:25.710> much<00:01:25.950> very<00:01:26.369> very

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
there there's really not much very very

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.510 
there there's really not much very very

that<00:01:46.259> tension<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.310> side<00:01:47.520> delt<00:01:47.909> you're

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that tension in the side delt you're

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.100 
that tension in the side delt you're
going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> rest<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.229> 90<00:01:50.070> seconds<00:01:50.540> repeat<00:01:51.540> two

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
going to rest for 90 seconds repeat two

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.260 
going to rest for 90 seconds repeat two
more<00:01:52.140> times<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.770> total<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:53.280> three<00:01:53.610> sets

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
more times for a total of three sets

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.999 
more times for a total of three sets
then<00:01:55.170> we're<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.409> move<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.740> some

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
then we're going to move on to some

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.050 
then we're going to move on to some
hypertrophy<00:01:56.790> work<00:01:56.969> doing<00:01:57.240> try<00:01:57.719> sets<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:59.280> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
hypertrophy work doing try sets in the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.230 
hypertrophy work doing try sets in the
10<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.479> 15<00:02:00.780> Reverend<00:02:01.320> using<00:02:02.159> cables<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.700> really

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
10 to 15 Reverend using cables I really

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.670 
10 to 15 Reverend using cables I really
love<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.509> cable<00:02:03.930> machine<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.350> set<00:02:04.649> up

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
love this cable machine it's set up

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.950 
love this cable machine it's set up
great<00:02:05.159> adjustable

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
great adjustable

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.199 
great adjustable
so<00:02:07.560> we're<00:02:07.710> doing<00:02:07.770> some<00:02:08.039> bent<00:02:08.369> over<00:02:08.850> cable

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
so we're doing some bent over cable

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.870 
so we're doing some bent over cable
raises<00:02:09.600> first<00:02:09.840> once<00:02:10.170> again<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:11.700> want

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
raises first once again I really want

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.449 
raises first once again I really want
you<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> focus<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.540> reaching<00:02:13.110> out<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
you to focus on reaching out for the

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.460 
you to focus on reaching out for the
walls<00:02:14.790> you're<00:02:15.120> really<00:02:15.450> trying<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.870> keep<00:02:16.290> your

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
walls you're really trying to keep your

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.240 
walls you're really trying to keep your
arms<00:02:17.480> attention<00:02:18.480> outward<00:02:18.830> tension<00:02:19.830> outward

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
arms attention outward tension outward

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.130 
arms attention outward tension outward
force<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.940> on<00:02:21.120> there<00:02:21.330> if<00:02:21.480> you're

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
force going on there if you're

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.530 
force going on there if you're
contracting<00:02:22.830> your<00:02:23.280> traps<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.390> really

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
contracting your traps and really

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.990 
contracting your traps and really
squeezing<00:02:24.989> your<00:02:25.170> shoulder<00:02:25.200> blades<00:02:25.500> together

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
squeezing your shoulder blades together

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.280 
squeezing your shoulder blades together
it's<00:02:27.000> going<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.150> take<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.569> tension<00:02:27.810> off<00:02:28.080> of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
it's going to take the tension off of

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.250 
it's going to take the tension off of
the<00:02:29.130> rear<00:02:29.310> delts<00:02:29.819> where<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.720> really<00:02:31.020> want<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
the rear delts where you really want to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.370 
the rear delts where you really want to
focus<00:02:31.440> during<00:02:31.890> these<00:02:32.160> sets<00:02:32.489> here<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.200> that's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
focus during these sets here so that's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.550 
focus during these sets here so that's
10<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.739> 15<00:02:35.069> reps<00:02:35.459> I'm<00:02:36.050> lowering<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.230> weight<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
10 to 15 reps I'm lowering the weight a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.190 
10 to 15 reps I'm lowering the weight a
little<00:02:37.770> bit<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.610> notch<00:02:39.200> we're

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
little bit here just the notch we're

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.160 
little bit here just the notch we're
going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.350> do<00:02:40.620> some<00:02:41.040> lateral<00:02:41.910> cable<00:02:42.690> raises

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
going to do some lateral cable raises

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.800 
going to do some lateral cable raises
here<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.500> now<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.650> may<00:02:43.860> say<00:02:44.700> well<00:02:44.750> didn't<00:02:45.750> you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
here and now you may say well didn't you

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.220 
here and now you may say well didn't you
just<00:02:46.050> do<00:02:46.489> lateral<00:02:47.489> raises<00:02:47.970> well<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:49.080> were

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
just do lateral raises well we were

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.680 
just do lateral raises well we were
creating<00:02:49.620> tension<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:51.269> slightly<00:02:51.540> different

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
creating tension in a slightly different

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.570 
creating tension in a slightly different
way<00:02:51.959> here<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.590> also<00:02:52.680> notice<00:02:53.070> I've<00:02:53.220> got<00:02:53.400> my

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
way here and you also notice I've got my

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.240 
way here and you also notice I've got my
pinkies<00:02:54.170> pointing<00:02:55.170> upward<00:02:55.709> which<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.070> going

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
pinkies pointing upward which is going

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.900 
pinkies pointing upward which is going
to<00:02:56.340> have<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.760> different<00:02:57.030> kind<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.450> impact<00:02:58.019> on

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
to have a different kind of impact on

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.660 
to have a different kind of impact on
which<00:02:59.910> fibers<00:03:00.540> are<00:03:00.780> being<00:03:01.019> targeted<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.950> this

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
which fibers are being targeted and this

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.360 
which fibers are being targeted and this
exercise<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.330> opposed<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.019> one<00:03:04.230> arm<00:03:04.560> where

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
exercise as opposed to the one arm where

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.280 
exercise as opposed to the one arm where
I<00:03:05.400> was<00:03:05.610> leaning<00:03:06.090> over<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> side<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.260> just

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
I was leaning over to the side so just

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.400 
I was leaning over to the side so just
creating<00:03:08.420> tension<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.630> resistance<00:03:10.200> from

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
creating tension and resistance from

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.300 
creating tension and resistance from
different<00:03:10.980> angles<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:12.739> just<00:03:13.739> mixing<00:03:14.040> up<00:03:14.160> it's

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
different angles and just mixing up it's

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.920 
different angles and just mixing up it's
great<00:03:14.459> way<00:03:14.579> for<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:15.209> variety<00:03:15.390> there<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
great way for a variety there and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.780 
great way for a variety there and
maximizing<00:03:16.680> muscle<00:03:17.010> potential

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
maximizing muscle potential

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.640 
maximizing muscle potential
and<00:03:18.969> next<00:03:19.659> we're<00:03:19.780> going<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.930> be<00:03:20.019> moving<00:03:20.140> on<00:03:20.379> to

with<00:03:29.650> your<00:03:29.950> front<00:03:30.219> delts<00:03:30.489> try<00:03:30.939> to<00:03:31.000> use<00:03:31.150> as

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
with your front delts try to use as

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.940 
with your front delts try to use as
little<00:03:31.480> supporting<00:03:32.019> muscles<00:03:32.319> as<00:03:32.469> possible

the<00:03:35.739> only<00:03:35.980> issue<00:03:36.159> with<00:03:36.280> using<00:03:36.459> a<00:03:36.640> weight<00:03:36.819> plate

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
the only issue with using a weight plate

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.569 
the only issue with using a weight plate
is<00:03:37.329> if<00:03:38.079> you're<00:03:38.200> starting<00:03:38.409> off<00:03:38.590> at<00:03:38.829> 10<00:03:39.129> pounds

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
is if you're starting off at 10 pounds

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.940 
is if you're starting off at 10 pounds
going<00:03:40.239> up<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:40.450> 25<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.019> pretty<00:03:41.319> massive<00:03:41.500> jump

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
going up to 25 is a pretty massive jump

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.910 
going up to 25 is a pretty massive jump
so<00:03:42.909> what<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.060> recommend<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.540> using<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:44.140> 15<00:03:44.650> pound

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
so what I recommend is using a 15 pound

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.250 
so what I recommend is using a 15 pound
or<00:03:45.189> 20<00:03:45.519> pound<00:03:45.730> dumbbell<00:03:46.329> for<00:03:47.139> those

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
or 20 pound dumbbell for those

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.140 
or 20 pound dumbbell for those
in-between<00:03:47.439> weights<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:48.879> they're<00:03:48.969> going<00:03:49.090> to

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
in-between weights so they're going to

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.690 
in-between weights so they're going to
be<00:03:49.209> no<00:03:49.480> rest<00:03:49.689> between<00:03:49.780> exercises<00:03:50.469> here<00:03:51.099> we're

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
be no rest between exercises here we're

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.429 
be no rest between exercises here we're
repeating<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.450> two<00:03:52.780> more<00:03:52.930> times<00:03:52.989> for<00:03:53.409> a

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 
repeating this two more times for a

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.649 
repeating this two more times for a
