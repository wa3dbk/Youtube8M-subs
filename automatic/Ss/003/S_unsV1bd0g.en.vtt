solid industrial design from before it
but<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.380> still<00:00:28.650> pretty<00:00:28.859> wide<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.490> hold<00:00:29.699> the

changes to the passport silver edition
is<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> curved<00:00:37.350> edges<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:38.460> Blackberry

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
is now the curved edges which Blackberry

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.520 
is now the curved edges which Blackberry
says<00:00:39.870> now<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.710> kind<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.160> basically<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
says now it's kind of basically like a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
says now it's kind of basically like a
beveled<00:00:43.530> curved<00:00:43.920> edge<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.760> there's<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.329> slight

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
beveled curved edge so there's a slight

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.959 
beveled curved edge so there's a slight
taper<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.309> sharp<00:00:47.730> which

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
taper to it it's not really sharp which

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.490 
taper to it it's not really sharp which
is<00:00:48.000> good<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.660> has<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:49.260> bit<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
is good and has a little bit of a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.299 
is good and has a little bit of a
roundness<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
roundness to it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.549 
roundness to it
so<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.760> gives<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.570> striking<00:00:52.020> appeal

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
so it gives it a very striking appeal

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.369 
so it gives it a very striking appeal
and<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.370> course<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:53.910> has<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.870> subtle

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and of course it just has a subtle

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.160 
and of course it just has a subtle
difference<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.969> rounded<00:00:57.360> edges<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
difference to the more rounded edges of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.160 
difference to the more rounded edges of
the<00:00:58.500> original<00:00:59.219> passport<00:00:59.660> but<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:00.840> pretty

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the original passport but that's pretty

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170 
the original passport but that's pretty
much<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.980> terms<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> design<00:01:02.609> changes<00:01:03.030> you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
much it in terms of design changes you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.640 
much it in terms of design changes you
still<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> same<00:01:03.750> exact<00:01:04.080> keyboard<00:01:04.559> from
