people<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.259> don't<00:00:13.469> tend<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.889> use<00:00:14.160> them

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
people just don't tend to use them

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.430 
people just don't tend to use them
because<00:00:14.790> it's<00:00:15.150> not<00:00:15.269> like<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> attack<00:00:15.960> Buzzard

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440

supersonic speeds but I for a six-person
vehicle<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:28.039> pretty<00:00:29.039> easy

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 

first<00:00:37.470> thing<00:00:37.710> you're<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.980> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.280> do

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
first thing you're going to want to do

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.970 
first thing you're going to want to do
is<00:00:38.610> switch<00:00:38.730> over<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.270> first-person<00:00:39.750> view<00:00:40.020> as

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
is switch over the first-person view as

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.580 
is switch over the first-person view as
you<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.390> hell<00:00:42.630> of<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.840> lot<00:00:42.990> easier<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
you see it's a hell of a lot easier to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.000 
you see it's a hell of a lot easier to
shoot<00:00:43.800> when<00:00:44.040> you're<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.430> view<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:46.010> don't

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
shoot when you're in this view so don't

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.120 
shoot when you're in this view so don't
try<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.400> don't<00:00:47.550> buy<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.880> and<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.270> those<00:00:48.540> of

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
try and don't buy it and for those of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.530 
try and don't buy it and for those of
getting<00:00:50.450> your<00:00:51.450> ass<00:00:51.570> handed<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.080> you<00:00:53.090> now<00:00:54.090> as

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
getting your ass handed to you now as

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.470 
getting your ass handed to you now as
you<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:54.989> most<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.440> these<00:00:55.530> dogfights<00:00:55.800> end<00:00:56.550> up

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you see most of these dogfights end up

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
you see most of these dogfights end up
being<00:00:57.690> against<00:00:57.989> people<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.379> attack<00:00:58.949> courses

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
being against people in attack courses

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.280 
being against people in attack courses
that's<00:00:59.580> just<00:00:59.820> simply<00:01:00.360> because<00:01:00.510> most<00:01:00.900> people

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
that's just simply because most people

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.830 
that's just simply because most people
in<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.559> GTA<00:01:02.070> 5<00:01:02.340> seem<00:01:02.610> to<00:01:02.790> think<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> attack<00:01:03.570> was

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
in a GTA 5 seem to think the attack was

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.250 
in a GTA 5 seem to think the attack was
it<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.800> superior<00:01:05.190> helicopter<00:01:06.110> which<00:01:07.110> in

it is the superior helicopter which in

was<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> hell<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.810> lot<00:01:12.960> weaker<00:01:13.140> than<00:01:13.350> the

you have your finger on the trigger to
move<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.350> vertically<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.490> drifting

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
move up vertically and you're drifting

Rockets and when eventually he gets in

Rockets and when eventually he gets in
close<00:01:42.450> enough<00:01:42.660> that<00:01:42.959> I<00:01:43.050> actually<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.619> damage

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
close enough that I actually do damage

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.499 
close enough that I actually do damage
on<00:01:44.160> it<00:01:44.899> as<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.050> see<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.470> aside<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:48.090> nothing

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
on it as you see an aside it's nothing

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.929 
on it as you see an aside it's nothing
again

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.669 

this<00:01:51.939> demonstrates<00:01:52.659> one<00:01:53.049> of<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:53.229> things<00:01:53.469> that

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
this demonstrates one of the things that

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.679 
this demonstrates one of the things that
can<00:01:53.829> be<00:01:53.950> annoying<00:01:54.189> fighting<00:01:54.939> attack<00:01:55.240> buzzards

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
can be annoying fighting attack buzzards

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.569 
can be annoying fighting attack buzzards
in<00:01:55.869> an<00:01:56.049> eye<00:01:56.170> lasers<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:57.009> that's<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.369> fact

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
in an eye lasers and that's the fact

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.309 
in an eye lasers and that's the fact
that<00:01:57.759> you're<00:01:58.030> tactless<00:01:58.479> is<00:01:58.689> much<00:01:59.020> more

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
that you're tactless is much more

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.800 
that you're tactless is much more
maneuverable<00:01:59.729> game's<00:02:00.729> height<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.210> lot<00:02:01.539> more

maneuverable game's height a lot more

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.090 
maneuverable game's height a lot more
rapidly<00:02:02.229> than<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.770> United<00:02:03.069> later<00:02:03.219> does<00:02:05.100> what

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
rapidly than the United later does what

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.609 
rapidly than the United later does what
this<00:02:06.280> means<00:02:06.549> is<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.149> you<00:02:07.840> might<00:02:08.080> like<00:02:08.319> lose

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
this means is that you might like lose

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.250 
this means is that you might like lose
vision<00:02:09.009> with<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.789> attack<00:02:10.030> Buzzard<00:02:10.479> so<00:02:11.140> I'd

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
vision with the attack Buzzard so I'd

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.809 
vision with the attack Buzzard so I'd
recommend<00:02:11.440> just<00:02:11.799> keeping<00:02:12.010> an<00:02:12.489> eye<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:12.610> the

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
recommend just keeping an eye on the

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.640 
recommend just keeping an eye on the
mini-map<00:02:12.910> making<00:02:13.750> sure<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.200> stays<00:02:14.470> in

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
mini-map making sure that you stays in

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.240 
mini-map making sure that you stays in
front<00:02:14.799> of<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.360> keep<00:02:16.360> moving<00:02:16.720> sideways<00:02:17.250> don't

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
front of you keep moving sideways don't

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.190 
front of you keep moving sideways don't
ever<00:02:18.430> forget<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.849> move<00:02:19.090> sideways<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.900> end<00:02:20.080> up

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
ever forget to move sideways you end up

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.420 
ever forget to move sideways you end up
with<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.379> rock<00:02:20.560> then<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:20.860> face<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.340> you

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
with the rock then the face and you

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.240 
with the rock then the face and you
won't<00:02:21.580> be<00:02:21.700> have<00:02:22.379> wafer<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:23.799> on<00:02:23.890> your<00:02:24.040> level

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
won't be have wafer to get on your level

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.369 
won't be have wafer to get on your level
and<00:02:24.700> light<00:02:24.879> them<00:02:25.000> all<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.840> won't<00:02:25.959> stand<00:02:26.230> a

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
and light them all you won't stand a

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.440 
and light them all you won't stand a
chance

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.100 

now<00:02:32.020> this<00:02:32.670> demonstrates<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.940> weak<00:02:34.599> points<00:02:35.020> of

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
now this demonstrates the weak points of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.460 
now this demonstrates the weak points of
helicopters<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.330> points<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:37.780> helicopters

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
helicopters the we points on helicopters

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.729 
helicopters the we points on helicopters
around<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.980> engine<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.520> on<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.180> tail<00:02:40.739> you

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
around the engine and on the tail you

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.440 
around the engine and on the tail you
can<00:02:41.800> manage<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.340> get<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.610> tail<00:02:42.880> rotor<00:02:43.150> off

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
can manage you get the tail rotor off

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.510 
can manage you get the tail rotor off
the<00:02:43.599> helicopter<00:02:44.200> you'll<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:45.069> go<00:02:45.220> into<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
the helicopter you'll just go into a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.190 
the helicopter you'll just go into a
spin<00:02:45.760> like<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.450> eventually<00:02:46.900> crash

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
spin like this and eventually crash

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:58.750 
spin like this and eventually crash
giving<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.100> kill

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.880 

now<00:02:59.760> shooting<00:03:00.420> people<00:03:00.599> on<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.930> ground<00:03:01.200> isn't

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
now shooting people on the ground isn't

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.790 
now shooting people on the ground isn't
it<00:03:02.160> possible<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.330> it's<00:03:04.200> also<00:03:04.470> not

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
it possible on this but it's also not

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.259 
it possible on this but it's also not
the<00:03:04.920> easiest<00:03:05.280> thing<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.670> world<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:06.060> deal

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
the easiest thing in the world to deal

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.140 
the easiest thing in the world to deal
with<00:03:06.989> all<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> turbulence<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.459> lack<00:03:09.120> of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
with all the turbulence and the lack of

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150 
with all the turbulence and the lack of
maneuverability<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.230> annihilator<00:03:10.680> I

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
maneuverability in the annihilator I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.759 
maneuverability in the annihilator I
would<00:03:12.000> really<00:03:12.330> recommend<00:03:12.540> them<00:03:12.989> but<00:03:13.500> as<00:03:13.620> you

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
would really recommend them but as you

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.470 
would really recommend them but as you
see<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.099> killed<00:03:14.519> somebody

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
see I just killed somebody

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.900 
see I just killed somebody
it<00:03:16.230> wasn't<00:03:16.620> too<00:03:16.800> difficult<00:03:18.319> but<00:03:19.670> yeah<00:03:20.670> the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
it wasn't too difficult but yeah the

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.490 
it wasn't too difficult but yeah the
thing<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.209> much<00:03:21.660> about<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.290> shooting

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
thing is much about it the shooting

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.119 
thing is much about it the shooting
helicopters<00:03:23.250> down<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.760> anything<00:03:24.450> else

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
helicopters down and anything else

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.070 
helicopters down and anything else
that's<00:03:26.129> really<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.940> only<00:03:27.150> thing<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.599> find<00:03:27.810> fun

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
that's really the only thing I find fun

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.430 
that's really the only thing I find fun
with<00:03:29.269> thanks<00:03:30.269> for<00:03:30.420> watching<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:31.019> hope<00:03:31.380> you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
with thanks for watching I hope you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.690 
with thanks for watching I hope you
enjoyed<00:03:32.690> see
