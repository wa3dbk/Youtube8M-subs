00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.450
 and 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.910
 the broths are one of the preparations 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.309
 most important within our 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.080
 kitchens because they will mark the personality 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.630
 of all or almost all of our 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.119
 preparations below I'm going to 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.940
 present the chicken and fish broth 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.800
 honor me help me a lot the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.350
 dehydrated broths allow us 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.539
 customize the dish enrich it or give 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.730
 the finishing touch to your recipes Us 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.190
 the cooks to get a broth from 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.590
 fish we take between 40 or 45 minutes 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.070
 in its preparation while in one of 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.470
 chicken we can be up to four hours 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.390
 Once ready we use the broth as 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.000
 base in all kinds of stews soups 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.949
 rice or sauces we should also have 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.019
 note that many times kitchens 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.089
 They are small and not always space 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.920
 can have a large boiling pot 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.989
 several hours and occupying a valuable 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.150
 space to contribute on this 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.990
 preparation dusted directly on 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.180
 dehydrated broth in order my recipe 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.560
 A benefit of these wines is that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.380
 although it does not incorporate several times to me 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.390
 recipe increase the taste without having a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.610
 excess salt 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.710
 both in fish fry and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.540
 chicken I mix a quantity of honor broth 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.460
 together with the breadcrumbs getting 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.159
 well a point of special taste 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.350
 interesting the fish stock we 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.619
 can give a special touch to the typical 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.640
 garlic seasoning parsley and white wine well 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.190
 easy 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.729
 add a small amount what you mix 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.340
 and season it before going to the oven or 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.670
 directly on the plate here we have 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.500
 a pudding with nuts or a pesto 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.740
 we add a small amount of broth 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.110
 so the taste will be transmitted also in 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.890
 any recipe where it incorporates 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.960
 sauce a pasta a risotto 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.340
 As you can see, I use the broths 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.100
 dehydrated for many 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.040
 applications in this case I mix it with 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.960
 olive oil and freshly ground pepper 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.650
 the mixture will serve to give shine 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.990
 flavor and juiciness to this chicken here 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.920
 I'm preparing a French chicken with 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.000
 shallots sauteed with salt and pepper 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.000
 I added brandy 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.710
 great original 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.900
 margarine nuts and chicken broth 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.450
 nor 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.329
 thus having a recipe with a flavor 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.950
 perfect a trick so that our 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.519
 chicken salads for appointments or 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.590
 sandwiches are more tasty consists of 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.829
 cook the breasts in a short broth 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.900
 well seasoned with the broth nor already what 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.299
 you have seen with the chicken broths and 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.430
 fish we have earned a while and 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.970
 until the money contributing at the same time 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.970
 better flavor
