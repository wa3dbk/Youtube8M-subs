 Thank you very much for your teacher 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.140
 Have you been associated for quite a long time? 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.450
 That's right University 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.410
 3 grade 7 car has much one Cass 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.220
 Also do 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.340
 5 years Hey I do about half 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.710
 What kind of person 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.710
 It is what kind of person firm's 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.579
 I heard of something like me going to pull 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.270
 I am fine 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.130
 There is an indecision in deciding things 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.320
 It looks chair that I was me determined running all the way Bashibashi 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:48.520
 There is a reliance 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:53.210
 But to say that completely this announcement is standing was the day of the antipathy I was Why is there 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:56.280
 Say and want you to know before issuing squirrel people of early Well quickly fans 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.030
 I was lucky enough 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.790
 It was covered happen time to fan a sense or say 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:07.560
 Because it was the timing that can be said directly from one's own mouth 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.979
 I was married to Tasaka player 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.979
 Tei on the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.810
 I want to quickly get married even minute Yes 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:22.770
 ran 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 But at the time of the talk of a senior high school group before , the marriage desire is the first of its members 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.090
 U 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:32.109
 I want to get married quickly 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:38.340
 I recently I I've been a little still changed now but 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:38.340
 Why is Kano people and when it is of a certain yes high school students up to at 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.290
 What was the cause of fishing? 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:55.150
 It is Sukane I was aware of the solid 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:57.320
 Toka or was a mansion something you another go autumn me to quickly marry me a little difficult difficult No. 4 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.540
 Yes because I see 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:06.820
 It was said that people who are good at cooking are good, but it has not changed 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.600
 I just want to cook myself 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.600
 There is my AAH 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.650
 Water recently 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.860
 I bought it, it's a good seto cutlery hey 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.730
 Something also something strangely's train 1000 system 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.640
 I guess there will be some kind of future 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.890
 I need to make something already 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.830
 I just bought it I bought it, I'm satisfied I 'm fine with the ply 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.250
 But what do you want to make the most 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:43.640
 It's omelet rice that I like and it's heavy 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:49.550
 What a play what you are currently asking for from the director 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:52.900
 Suddenly a little serious talk it is a great turnaround 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.900
 I myself 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.510
 I think you are asked to play in connection with the score 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:09.110
 Previous formation There are also cases where you have done in a good position before going 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.400
 As it was more frequent to receive more 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.040
 The Tteyuu behind was or goal Imuapure of firm defense line is being sought 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.540
 I think that there 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.490
 Great consciousness that faces the front 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.360
 It is said that better was 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:28.010
 Married woman more often than ever before 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.129
 Oh dear 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.950
 Team by turning to the back 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:37.500
 The speed was slow and I was also 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:43.280
 By the consciousness to turn to the front 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:48.440
 I think that the previous player is also a little easy to move 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:55.580
 Do not put turned to this week office who competed opportunity is a jerk, etc. 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:57.500
 First goal is also not N Mars a success Ya' I'd have been a big success Decide 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.890
 Delicious place 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.890
 It feels like I think it is the second goal 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:11.220
 Hey's election 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:13.090
 I think there are a lot of manners from my seniors, but what kind of place is the best 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.270
 I learned strongly 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.540
 Do you feel 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.370
 There of Tteyuu put out their own good 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:26.870
 Because there is a part of the room that is often said to be sour 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:31.449
 What's Tteyuu wonder if what is larger went stealing gold Tteyuu learn 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:37.210
 But that the people were, respectively, I think that there is a good part whether slow even point in the feature 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:39.270
 I've thought that I think we capitalize in such your door is, but he was prefecture production through-pass 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.200
 If you are good 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.200
 Which timing 0 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.330
 I wonder if I'm looking forward 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.270
 Tara 50 people started to move is delicious 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.050
 Which timing of Tteyuu wonder out movement 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.639
 Look by yourself before listening 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.330
 Have news 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.330
 I think I have been in 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:06.190
 I could talk with you about Strong Points but each other's 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.580
 It is the point of the straw in the feeling that I put together 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.520
 Body is 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.650
 It is strong 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.050
 Really do 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.630
 Felony not many 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.990
 How can I use that body or something like that in my own shop ? 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.950
 I want to learn 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.950
 Number you want to steal 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.440
 The 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:32.370
 Ryota is 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:37.960
 I am a great player and I am getting balanced 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:43.940
 Speaking of Aso who thinks it is a victory, there is also the amount of movement that can be done 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:47.169
 It is very expensive to say anything without saying anything 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.980
 If you have a graph of the whole high 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.360
 It 's such a want to go to increase all its graph 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.370
 is not it 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.370
 I'm glad I'm bad 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.470
 Hmm 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:04.220
 She really thinks it 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:08.370
 I Toka scan Kana 19-year-old that he could not be like this in the Toka 18-year-old 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:11.910
 Say I want you to go carrying a Frontale to 2 people 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.100
 I think I have a hot feeling 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.870
 Now Frontale Oh 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:22.969
 I think it 's our generation that makes us stronger 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.070
 Or rather thrust up from below Yappa but so is my generation 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:27.080
 After all 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.400
 I think it's important 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.180
 The generation of Ryota Kuraray is high 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.180
 Out to share 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.910
 I think that it is good for the fluorocarbon body to be active more and more later 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.689
 Including myself 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:47.039
 I think I mean working hard under the generation or rather went know that it is important to 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.039
 It is the roadway does not if 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.180
 I say all good things 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.610
 What are you saying 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:01.240
 I think you Welcome 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.650
 It is a place from where you say from this 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.310
 from now on 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:13.580
 Well, first of all I want to be able to stay in the game forever 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:16.390
 Well there are 3 people in sync with 3 games in all games 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.020
 Exit frontare 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.020
 Flow Te Oka 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.180
 Changes to Fu Tteyuu want to contribute to
