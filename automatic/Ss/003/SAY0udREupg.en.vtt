00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.460 
let me demonstrate so that's heelflip a
lot<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> people<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.480> skaters<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.320> learn

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
lot of people that skaters have to learn

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.010 
lot of people that skaters have to learn
the<00:02:07.650> heel<00:02:07.860> flip<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.940> kickflip<00:02:09.390> then

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the heel flip and the kickflip then

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.280 
the heel flip and the kickflip then
learn<00:02:10.259> faking<00:02:10.890> moves<00:02:11.270> so<00:02:12.270> make<00:02:12.720> your<00:02:12.900> move<00:02:12.930> is

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
learn faking moves so make your move is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.890 
learn faking moves so make your move is
if<00:02:13.440> you're<00:02:13.620> going<00:02:14.040> regular<00:02:14.490> pushing<00:02:15.360> regular

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
if you're going regular pushing regular

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.900 
if you're going regular pushing regular
like<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.560> fakie<00:02:16.950> move<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.370> anything<00:02:17.790> in

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
like that a fakie move is anything in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.750 
like that a fakie move is anything in
this<00:02:18.000> direction<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:19.040> lot<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.070> skateboarders

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
this direction a lot of skateboarders

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.500 
this direction a lot of skateboarders
first<00:02:21.120> learn<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.450> fakie<00:02:21.959> ollie<00:02:26.360> which<00:02:27.360> is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
first learn the fakie ollie which is

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.770 
first learn the fakie ollie which is
simply<00:02:27.720> an<00:02:27.959> ollie<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.680> backwards<00:02:29.780> after

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
simply an ollie going backwards after

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.140 
simply an ollie going backwards after
you've<00:02:31.230> learned<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.680> fakie<00:02:31.950> ollie<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.940> can

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
you've learned the fakie ollie you can

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.240 
you've learned the fakie ollie you can
then<00:02:33.180> learn<00:02:33.570> i'll<00:02:33.780> pick<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.140> flip<00:02:34.530> which<00:02:35.070> is

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
then learn i'll pick you flip which is

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.280 
then learn i'll pick you flip which is
simply<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.730> fakie<00:02:36.090> kickflip<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.810> let<00:02:37.200> me

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
simply a fakie kickflip and let me

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:46.480 
simply a fakie kickflip and let me
demonstrate

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.550
