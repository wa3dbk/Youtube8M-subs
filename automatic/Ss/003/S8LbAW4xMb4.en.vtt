00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
on making free different lists of user

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 
on making free different lists of user
names<00:00:25.050> depending<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.560> what<00:00:25.650> prize<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.160> wanted

and selecting a random name from each

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.130 
and selecting a random name from each
but<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.640> would<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:29.880> taken<00:00:30.179> forever<00:00:30.689> with

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
but that would have taken forever with

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.049

so<00:00:31.320> many<00:00:31.439> entries<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:31.980> then<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.309> figured<00:00:32.910> I'd

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
so many entries so then I figured I'd

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
so many entries so then I figured I'd
just<00:00:33.270> select<00:00:33.570> around<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> number<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.380> account

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
just select around a number and account

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.500
