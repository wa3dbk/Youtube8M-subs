00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.840 
today's video I'm gonna be showing you
guys<00:00:03.780> what<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.110> potentially<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.890> brand<00:00:05.370> new<00:00:05.609> DLC

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
guys what is potentially a brand new DLC

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.330 
guys what is potentially a brand new DLC
apartment<00:00:06.690> or<00:00:07.020> place<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.470> live<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
apartment or place to live in and the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.040 
apartment or place to live in and the
reason<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.880> say<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.420> because<00:00:09.599> there<00:00:09.929> was<00:00:10.019> a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
reason I say this is because there was a

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.070 
reason I say this is because there was a
brand<00:00:10.469> new<00:00:10.700> secret<00:00:11.700> interior<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.690> secret

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
potential DLC apartment or hotel room

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.779 
potential DLC apartment or hotel room
it's<00:00:46.320> actually<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> hotel<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> could<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it's actually a hotel so it could be a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.790 
it's actually a hotel so it could be a
hotel<00:00:48.180> room<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.050> reason<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.500> actually

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
hotel room and the reason we actually

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.529 
hotel room and the reason we actually
say<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.129> could<00:00:50.340> potentially<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.090> brand

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
say this could potentially be a brand

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
say this could potentially be a brand
new<00:00:51.690> DLC<00:00:51.840> apartment<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:52.800> hotel<00:00:52.980> room<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
new DLC apartment or hotel room is

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.819 
new DLC apartment or hotel room is
because<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.149> actually<00:00:54.360> has<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.020> rendered

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
because it actually has a rendered

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
because it actually has a rendered
interior<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> mean<00:00:57.030> by<00:00:57.090> rendered

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
interior and what I mean by rendered

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.180 
interior and what I mean by rendered
interior<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.379> know<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> enter<00:00:59.100> your

of course focus more on my mini-map when

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.330 
of course focus more on my mini-map when
you<00:02:58.720> are<00:02:58.810> watching<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.200> back<00:02:59.440> rather<00:03:00.160> than

direction of how to get inside of here

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.720 
direction of how to get inside of here
but<00:03:05.290> as<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.500> can<00:03:05.620> see<00:03:05.680> if<00:03:05.980> done<00:03:06.160> correctly<00:03:06.190> you

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
but as you can see if done correctly you

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.640 
but as you can see if done correctly you
will<00:03:07.269> end<00:03:07.450> up<00:03:07.569> inside<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:08.140> this<00:03:08.260> secret

will end up inside of this secret

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.280 
will end up inside of this secret
interior<00:03:09.220> inside<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> garage<00:03:10.720> located

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
interior inside of the garage located

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.350 
interior inside of the garage located
exactly<00:03:11.980> where<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.550> showed<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.850> guys<00:03:13.030> at<00:03:13.239> the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
exactly where I showed you guys at the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.990 
exactly where I showed you guys at the
beginning<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.470> question<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.100> why<00:03:15.580> is<00:03:15.640> this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
beginning so the question is why is this

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.479 
beginning so the question is why is this
rendered<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.900> why<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.590> interior<00:03:17.860> here<00:03:18.250> if

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
rendered and why is the interior here if

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.250 
rendered and why is the interior here if
Rockstar<00:03:19.090> do<00:03:19.329> not<00:03:19.480> plan<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.690> do<00:03:19.900> something

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
Rockstar do not plan to do something

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.990 
Rockstar do not plan to do something
with<00:03:20.380> this<00:03:20.470> in<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.709> future<00:03:20.890> maybe<00:03:21.640> bring<00:03:21.880> it

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
with this in the future maybe bring it

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.729 
with this in the future maybe bring it
in<00:03:22.090> as<00:03:22.239> DLC<00:03:22.810> or<00:03:22.840> something<00:03:23.350> along<00:03:23.530> them<00:03:23.709> lines

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
in as DLC or something along them lines

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.190 
in as DLC or something along them lines
and<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.130> course<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.760> interior<00:03:25.209> is<00:03:25.570> similar

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
and of course this interior is similar

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.509 
and of course this interior is similar
to<00:03:26.320> things<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.739> would<00:03:26.890> see<00:03:27.040> if<00:03:27.190> maybe<00:03:27.400> if

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
to things that you would see if maybe if

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.890 
to things that you would see if maybe if
you<00:03:27.640> go<00:03:27.760> into<00:03:27.910> your<00:03:28.060> garage<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.630> see<00:03:28.780> the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
you go into your garage and you see the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.080 
you go into your garage and you see the
garage<00:03:29.079> door<00:03:29.320> open<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.709> players<00:03:30.370> look<00:03:30.640> inside

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
garage door open and players look inside

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.150 
garage door open and players look inside
it's<00:03:31.390> very<00:03:31.480> similar<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.500> kind<00:03:33.010> of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
it's very similar to that kind of

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.650 
it's very similar to that kind of
interior<00:03:33.489> but<00:03:33.820> it's<00:03:33.970> kind<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.239> weird<00:03:34.450> at<00:03:34.630> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
interior but it's kind of weird at the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.970 
interior but it's kind of weird at the
same<00:03:34.750> time<00:03:35.079> as<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.290> can<00:03:35.410> see<00:03:35.560> there<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.769> kind

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
same time as you can see there is kind

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.069 
same time as you can see there is kind
of<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.130> built<00:03:36.370> in<00:03:36.549> house<00:03:36.760> in<00:03:37.030> between<00:03:37.390> as<00:03:37.570> well

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
of a built in house in between as well

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.660 
of a built in house in between as well
as<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.200> chandelier<00:03:38.739> on<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.980> roof<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.310> don't<00:03:39.519> know

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
as a chandelier on the roof I don't know

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.880 
as a chandelier on the roof I don't know
why<00:03:39.850> that's<00:03:40.000> there<00:03:40.360> but<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.989> seems<00:03:41.380> very<00:03:41.500> odd

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
why that's there but it seems very odd

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.470 
why that's there but it seems very odd
to<00:03:41.920> me<00:03:42.100> Rockstar<00:03:42.640> don't<00:03:42.910> really<00:03:43.150> add<00:03:43.299> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
to me Rockstar don't really add the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.630 
to me Rockstar don't really add the
interiors<00:03:44.079> of<00:03:44.260> garages<00:03:44.500> anywhere<00:03:45.220> else<00:03:45.430> on

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
interiors of garages anywhere else on

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.490 
interiors of garages anywhere else on
the<00:03:45.670> map<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.480> course<00:03:46.780> because<00:03:46.959> of<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.410> way

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
the map and of course because of the way

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.410 
the map and of course because of the way
this<00:03:47.620> interior<00:03:48.010> is<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.549> does<00:03:48.760> kind<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.060> suggest

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
this interior is it does kind of suggest

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.210 
this interior is it does kind of suggest
that<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.019> garage<00:03:50.290> door<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.769> going<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.100> open

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
that the garage door is going to open

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.190 
that the garage door is going to open
because<00:03:51.609> of<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.329> know<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.570> interior<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.109> very

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
because of you know the interior is very

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.990 
because of you know the interior is very
similar<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.280> ones<00:03:54.489> we<00:03:54.670> already<00:03:54.730> have

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
similar to the ones we already have

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.759 
similar to the ones we already have
inside<00:03:55.600> of<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.780> garages<00:03:55.989> so<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.380> don't<00:03:56.650> know

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
inside of the garages so I don't know

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.170 
inside of the garages so I don't know

in the comment section down below of
course<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.430> speculation<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.329> we<00:04:01.450> are

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
course this is speculation so we are

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.970 
course this is speculation so we are
speculating<00:04:01.810> here<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.530> could<00:04:02.799> potentially

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
speculating here this could potentially

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.280 
speculating here this could potentially
be<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.790> hotel<00:04:04.480> room<00:04:04.660> or<00:04:04.780> something<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.200> you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
be a hotel room or something that you

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.530 
be a hotel room or something that you
guys<00:04:05.410> can<00:04:05.470> use<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.609> course<00:04:06.910> go<00:04:07.120> ahead<00:04:07.150> and

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
guys can use and of course go ahead and
