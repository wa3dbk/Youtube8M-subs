00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
that don't know how to wire redstone it

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.229 
that don't know how to wire redstone it
will<00:00:32.710> be<00:00:32.860> very<00:00:33.129> helpful<00:00:33.460> for<00:00:33.610> them<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:34.090> learn

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
will be very helpful for them to learn

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.580 
will be very helpful for them to learn
and<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:35.800> it<00:00:36.070> is<00:00:36.129> is<00:00:36.300> wiring<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.570> fence<00:00:38.050> gate<00:00:38.320> to

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
and all it is is wiring a fence gate to

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.650 
and all it is is wiring a fence gate to
open<00:00:38.890> up<00:00:39.010> with<00:00:39.250> buttons<00:00:39.730> without<00:00:40.210> pressure

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
open up with buttons without pressure

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.710 
open up with buttons without pressure
plates<00:00:40.930> in<00:00:41.050> front<00:00:41.080> of<00:00:41.350> them<00:00:41.879> yeah<00:00:42.879> yeah<00:00:43.449> it's

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
plates in front of them yeah yeah it's

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.090 
plates in front of them yeah yeah it's
very<00:00:43.809> simple<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:46.470> some<00:00:47.470> people<00:00:47.800> don't<00:00:47.920> know

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
very simple and some people don't know

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.520 
very simple and some people don't know
how<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.340> do<00:00:48.519> it<00:00:48.699> so<00:00:50.370> let's<00:00:51.370> go<00:00:51.839> all<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:53.229> items

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
how to do it so let's go all the items

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.340 
how to do it so let's go all the items
you<00:00:53.589> need<00:00:53.830> are<00:00:54.100> in<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.729> inventory<00:00:55.000> below<00:00:55.570> and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
you need are in the inventory below and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.880 
you need are in the inventory below and
how<00:00:57.250> it<00:00:57.400> works<00:00:57.610> is<00:00:58.059> on<00:00:58.690> one<00:00:58.960> side<00:00:58.989> you<00:00:59.559> can<00:00:59.710> push

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
how it works is on one side you can push

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.570 
how it works is on one side you can push
a<00:00:59.920> button<00:01:00.390> opens<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.449> fence<00:01:01.690> gate<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.580> you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
a button opens the fence gate and you

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.300 
a button opens the fence gate and you
can<00:01:03.909> go<00:01:04.030> through<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:05.470> don't<00:01:05.590> have<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.040> use<00:01:06.190> the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
can go through you don't have to use the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.250 
can go through you don't have to use the
button<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:06.790> can<00:01:06.970> use<00:01:07.120> like<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.420> lever<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:08.080> keep

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
button you can use like a lever to keep

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.700 
button you can use like a lever to keep
it<00:01:08.409> open<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.870> can't<00:01:11.110> do<00:01:11.260> it<00:01:11.290> for<00:01:11.560> the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
it open but you can't do it for the

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.480 
it open but you can't do it for the
other<00:01:11.830> side<00:01:13.740> kind<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.799> a<00:01:14.920> shame<00:01:15.100> right<00:01:15.250> there

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
other side kind of a shame right there

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.970 
other side kind of a shame right there
so<00:01:17.610> let's<00:01:18.610> get<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.560> we'll<00:01:23.560> just<00:01:23.590> add

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
so let's get to it and we'll just add

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.590 
so let's get to it and we'll just add
some<00:01:24.370> fence<00:01:25.800> three<00:01:26.800> on<00:01:26.980> each<00:01:27.670> side<00:01:27.700> should<00:01:28.540> be

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
some fence three on each side should be

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.430 
some fence three on each side should be
fine<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:31.770> okay<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:33.490> wire<00:01:33.610> this<00:01:34.230> first<00:01:35.230> you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
fine and okay to wire this first you

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.460 
fine and okay to wire this first you
have<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:36.070> have<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.720> redstone<00:01:37.720> torch<00:01:37.870> underneath

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
have to have a redstone torch underneath

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:48.300 
have to have a redstone torch underneath
there<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.140> must<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:46.390> may<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:48.280> may

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
there that is a must and you may you may

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.760 
there that is a must and you may you may
ask<00:01:48.640> how<00:01:49.240> come<00:01:49.720> there's<00:01:49.900> like<00:01:50.050> no<00:01:50.290> redstone

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
ask how come there's like no redstone

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.760 
ask how come there's like no redstone
showing<00:01:51.160> out<00:01:51.310> there<00:01:51.580> because<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.660> uses<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.320> a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
showing out there because it uses a a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.510 
showing out there because it uses a a
trick

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
trick

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.990 
trick
which<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.270> key<00:01:55.510> important<00:01:56.140> part<00:01:56.440> where

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
which is the key important part where

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.950 
which is the key important part where
you<00:01:58.000> may<00:01:58.180> not<00:01:58.390> know<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:01.060> place<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.540> redstone

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
you may not know you place the redstone

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.590 
you may not know you place the redstone
under<00:02:02.470> there<00:02:02.650> and<00:02:02.920> then<00:02:03.520> underneath<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.420> use

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
under there and then underneath you use

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.399 
under there and then underneath you use
a<00:02:04.920> repeater<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.340> grab<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.570> power<00:02:07.750> out<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.110> this

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
a repeater to grab the power out of this

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.839 
a repeater to grab the power out of this
block<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:11.379> you<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.709> see<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.340> powers<00:02:12.819> through

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
block as you can see it powers through

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:27.050 
block as you can see it powers through
there<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:15.090> under<00:02:16.090> here<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:19.269> wire<00:02:19.780> it

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.450 

hmm<00:02:28.220> why<00:02:29.220> write<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:30.920> out<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.160> brain

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
hmm why write like that out of a brain

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.230 
hmm why write like that out of a brain
thought<00:02:32.640> right<00:02:32.880> there

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
thought right there

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.960 
thought right there
and<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:35.250> power<00:02:35.460> on<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.940> off<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:37.400> then<00:02:38.400> all<00:02:38.730> of

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
and can power on it off and then all of

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.230 
and can power on it off and then all of
this<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:40.490> able<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.640> cover<00:02:41.880> up<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.820> may<00:02:44.970> ask

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
this is able to cover up but you may ask

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.390 
this is able to cover up but you may ask
about<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:48.740> when<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.800> push<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.040> button<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
about the when you push the button the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.030 
about the when you push the button the
gate<00:02:50.550> stays<00:02:50.820> open<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:52.320> invert<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.860> power

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
gate stays open you invert the power

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.390 
gate stays open you invert the power
somewhere<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:54.480> doesn't<00:02:55.170> really<00:02:55.320> matter<00:02:56.010> where

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
somewhere it doesn't really matter where

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.200 
somewhere it doesn't really matter where
as<00:02:59.420> this<00:03:00.420> will<00:03:00.930> need<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.320> be<00:03:01.470> moved<00:03:02.400> over<00:03:02.640> here

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
as this will need to be moved over here

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.960 
as this will need to be moved over here
just<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.870> get<00:03:04.380> them<00:03:05.900> get<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.050> power<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.970> change

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
just to get them get the power to change

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:18.710 
just to get them get the power to change
out<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:16.940> this<00:03:17.940> area<00:03:18.360> where<00:03:18.570> you

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
out and this this this area where you

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.920 
out and this this this area where you
can<00:03:18.960> invert<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.680> doesn't<00:03:20.640> have<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.180> be<00:03:21.330> this

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
can invert it doesn't have to be this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.580 
can invert it doesn't have to be this
way<00:03:22.200> but<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.850> just<00:03:24.030> works<00:03:27.080> as<00:03:28.080> for<00:03:28.380> over

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
way but it it just works as for over

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.130 
way but it it just works as for over
there<00:03:28.710> I<00:03:28.860> it's<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.580> made<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.600> all<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.990> one

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
there I it's I made it all to one

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.680 
there I it's I made it all to one
centralized<00:03:31.710> location<00:03:31.740> and<00:03:32.730> then<00:03:32.820> swapped<00:03:33.480> it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
centralized location and then swapped it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.430 
centralized location and then swapped it
over<00:03:33.960> here

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
over here

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.800 
over here
I<00:03:35.120> prefer<00:03:36.120> adding<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.840> three<00:03:37.620> tick<00:03:37.860> delay<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.460> it

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
I prefer adding a three tick delay on it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.210 
I prefer adding a three tick delay on it
so<00:03:39.810> when<00:03:39.990> you<00:03:40.080> have<00:03:40.350> when<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:40.890> push<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
so when you have when you push the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.950 
so when you have when you push the
button<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.640> gives<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.910> time<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.150> open<00:03:42.600> it

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
button it gives you time to open it

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.640 
button it gives you time to open it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
and you can get through like I said this

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.360 
and you can get through like I said this

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
can go open it a little side one side

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.360 
can go open it a little side one side
the<00:04:01.800> other<00:04:01.830> side<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.550> just<00:04:03.860> place<00:04:04.860> it<00:04:04.890> down

the other side you just place it down
again<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.120> let's<00:04:06.870> use<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.050> lever<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.500> time<00:04:08.060> go

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
again and let's use a lever this time go

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.500 
again and let's use a lever this time go
down

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
down

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.660 
down
you<00:04:09.900> place<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.560> redstone<00:04:11.480> there<00:04:12.480> repeater

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.750 

and<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.660> just<00:04:17.230> wire<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.850> up<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.519> main

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
and you just wire it up to the main

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.030 
and you just wire it up to the main
central<00:04:22.360> hub<00:04:22.540> over<00:04:22.690> there<00:04:22.960> as<00:04:23.170> it's<00:04:23.800> already

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
central hub over there as it's already

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.010 
central hub over there as it's already
inverted<00:04:24.790> on<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.030> section<00:04:25.390> down<00:04:25.510> there<00:04:25.750> so

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
inverted on the section down there so

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.540 
inverted on the section down there so
you<00:04:26.770> can<00:04:26.920> open<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.370> close<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:29.550> that's

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
you can open it close so that's

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.110 
you can open it close so that's
basically<00:04:31.270> how<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.630> do<00:04:31.870> it<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.970> reason
