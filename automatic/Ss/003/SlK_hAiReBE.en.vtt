I have not seen this color lately very

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.649 
I have not seen this color lately very
similar<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> little<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.299> hair

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
similar this one is a little just a hair

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.859 
similar this one is a little just a hair
bit<00:01:51.990> more<00:01:52.469> it<00:01:53.219> looks<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.549> hair<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.509> pink

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
bit more it looks a hair but more pink

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.420 
bit more it looks a hair but more pink
on<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.229> lips<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.590> cannot<00:01:55.950> tell<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
on the lips you cannot tell the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.429 
on the lips you cannot tell the
difference<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.420> difference<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.200> think

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
difference the difference here I think

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.649 
difference the difference here I think
is<00:01:58.770> because<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> matte<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.479> is

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
is because this is a matte and this is

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.690 
is because this is a matte and this is
more<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.200> regular<00:02:01.380> kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.159> shiny<00:02:02.460> finish

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
more of a regular kind of a shiny finish

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.370 
more of a regular kind of a shiny finish
so<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.090> don't<00:02:06.359> know<00:02:06.450> what's<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.869> with<00:02:06.899> burberry
