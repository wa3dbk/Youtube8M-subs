just<00:01:47.009> leave<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.369> xmax<00:01:47.850> ymax<00:01:48.210> coordinates

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
just leave the xmax ymax coordinates

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
just leave the xmax ymax coordinates
alone<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.799> we're<00:01:49.950> putting<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
alone because we're putting in the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.740 
alone because we're putting in the
bottom<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.759> hand<00:01:50.790> corner<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.329> wanted

bottom right hand corner if you wanted
to<00:01:51.869> move<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> somewhere<00:01:52.290> else<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.829> could<00:01:53.040> use

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to move it somewhere else you could use

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.080 
to move it somewhere else you could use
these<00:01:53.399> coordinates<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.430> then<00:01:56.430> last

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
these coordinates to do so and then last

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.179 
these coordinates to do so and then last
but<00:01:57.180> not<00:01:57.299> least<00:01:57.479> we've<00:01:57.600> got<00:01:57.750> an<00:01:57.840> option<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.290> add

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
but not least we've got an option to add

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160
