00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.709
 but I do not share it 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.309
 also tones and rhythms on the guitar 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.639
 we can also play requintos or 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.760
 melodies we're going to learn to do this to 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:20.119
 through some exercises that we are going to 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.810
 see below and we will support 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.890
 with the scales that we're going to see in the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.080
 video number three good 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.940
 the first exercises that we are going to see 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:37.030
 they are supported exercises these are 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:42.070
 they run playing on the same string 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.809
 alternately one finger and then the other 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.510
 I'm going to see the first formula that is 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:53.320
 starting with index finger and then 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:55.829
 changing to middle finger this is played like this 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.829
 Y 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.050
 they are called supported because they run 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:34.670
 touching the string and resting the finger on 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.670
 the rope that follows everything 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.220
 the requintos can also be touched 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.729
 with the nail for that we're going to take it and 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.140
 let's play on the string first one 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.490
 time down 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.490
 and then up 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.630
 let's repeat the exercise several 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.060
 times rope by rope first 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.240
 ascending mind and then descending 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.970
 also with the barb we are going to 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.990
 practice the exercises we saw of the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.480
 left hand 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.620
 this 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.620
 and then this 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.780
 to make an example about the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.200
 I'm going to play a melody that 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.200
 we all know 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.310
 do not 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.890
 no no no 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.350
 and well this would be all for this video 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.750
 Viktor thank you very much to the teacher 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.240
 to you at home please follow 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.510
 practicing and see you in the next 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.510
