00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
Benjamin straight on my left and I don't

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.410 
Benjamin straight on my left and I don't
think<00:01:33.500> he's<00:01:33.680> gonna<00:01:33.890> let<00:01:34.100> me<00:01:34.250> bully<00:01:34.550> that<00:01:35.180> much

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
think he's gonna let me bully that much

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.120 
think he's gonna let me bully that much
even<00:01:35.720> though<00:01:35.900> he's<00:01:36.110> short<00:01:36.350> stack<00:01:36.620> I<00:01:36.800> know<00:01:36.860> he's

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
even though he's short stack I know he's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.740 
even though he's short stack I know he's
willing<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.460> play<00:01:37.670> for<00:01:37.730> his<00:01:37.940> life<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:40.750> think

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's better just to take it a little

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.800 
it's better just to take it a little
slower<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:44.000> not<00:01:44.180> just<00:01:44.420> going<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.900> figure

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810
