item<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.340> our<00:01:56.430> list<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.000> calibrate

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
item in our list here is calibrate

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.600 
item in our list here is calibrate
compass<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> good<00:01:58.860> idea<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.399> if

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
compass so this is a good idea to do if

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.910 
compass so this is a good idea to do if
you<00:02:00.329> are<00:02:00.360> getting<00:02:00.990> some<00:02:01.200> funny<00:02:01.409> readings<00:02:01.799> on

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
you are getting some funny readings on

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.620 
you are getting some funny readings on
your<00:02:02.070> compass<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.700> should<00:02:02.850> also<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.329> try

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
your compass or you should also just try

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
your compass or you should also just try
and<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.990> once<00:02:04.200> every<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.710> often<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.460> you

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and do it once every so often all you

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.429 
and do it once every so often all you
have<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.149> press<00:02:06.390> Start<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.259> it's

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
have to do is press Start and then it's

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.359 
have to do is press Start and then it's
going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.799> give<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.040> step-by-step
