00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.680
 how did you prepare a meringue out artist 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.450
 Italian 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.809
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.020
 They are 2 egg whites 200 grams of 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.020
 sugar half cup of water essence 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:20.200
 taste 2 tablespoons of optional sugar and 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.750
 200 grams of butter 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.550
 well we start putting in a pot the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.950
 200 grams of sugar with the half cup 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.430
 of water to make the syrup on fire 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.430
 medium-high 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.059
 when our syrup starts to boil 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.850
 let's add a teaspoon of 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.800
 glucose when it starts to thicken 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.829
 we put to beat the egg whites to 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.150
 slow speed with a pinch of salt the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.780
 speed and we will increase it 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.780
 progressively 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.000
 We verify the point of the syrup by throwing 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.550
 a few drops in a cup of cold water 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.470
 if we can catch him and form a ball 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.010
 it lasts with my fingers means that 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.110
 it's ready 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240
 when the foam of the whites those that 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.130
 we add in the form of rain the two 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.119
 spoonfuls of sugar and beat 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.119
 high speed 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.820
 it's time to add the syrup we're going to 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.250
 do it in the form of it very slowly and 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.170
 away from the beater once it 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.420
 add everything we must let beat 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.930
 until the container is cooled by 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.930
 full 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 I 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.870
 with the container completely cold 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.110
 let's start adding the butter 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.360
 go to spoonfuls once we are 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.650
 all the butter we should let beat 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.650
 minimum for 2 minutes 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.780
 once reached 12 minutes of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.450
 shakes it's time to add the flavoring 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.130
 and food coloring if I will use it 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.250
 in this case use the plain of 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.660
 lemon and we hope it mixes well and 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.770
