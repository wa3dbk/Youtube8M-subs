00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
that there was something in here that I

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.899 
that there was something in here that I
wasn't<00:03:26.860> able<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.099> get<00:03:27.280> out<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.580> first<00:03:27.760> time

wasn't able to get out the first time

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.170 
wasn't able to get out the first time
and<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.090> played<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:29.489> over<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.519> course<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:31.000> a

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
and I played it and over the course of a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.070 
and I played it and over the course of a
little<00:03:31.390> bit<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.510> time<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.900> I've<00:03:31.989> been

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
little bit of time that I've been

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.600 
little bit of time that I've been
playing<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.590> toying<00:03:32.890> with<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.159> I<00:03:33.250> found

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
playing it and toying with it I found

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.140 
playing it and toying with it I found
that<00:03:33.790> I'm<00:03:35.159> you<00:03:36.159> know<00:03:36.250> I'm<00:03:36.340> getting<00:03:36.640> exactly

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
that I'm you know I'm getting exactly

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.089 
that I'm you know I'm getting exactly
what<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.450> about<00:03:38.140> my<00:03:38.409> own<00:03:38.560> sound<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:39.010> I

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
what it is about my own sound that I

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.830 
what it is about my own sound that I
like<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.400> best<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:41.730> I'm<00:03:42.730> making<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.569> horn

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
like the best and I'm making this horn

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.530 
like the best and I'm making this horn
sound<00:03:44.340> pretty<00:03:45.340> much<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.730> way<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:45.879> wanted<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.329> or

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
sound pretty much the way I wanted to or

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.940 
sound pretty much the way I wanted to or
at<00:03:46.629> least<00:03:46.750> if<00:03:46.900> that's<00:03:47.079> ever<00:03:47.349> not<00:03:47.560> happening

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
at least if that's ever not happening

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.780 
at least if that's ever not happening
that's<00:03:48.129> got<00:03:48.280> nothing<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.549> do<00:03:48.640> with<00:03:48.700> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
that's got nothing to do with the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.240 
that's got nothing to do with the
instrument<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:51.190> um<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.510> basically<00:03:53.099> you<00:03:54.099> know

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250
