00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.110
 hello dear motorsport friends of 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.790
 speedweek is off this weekend 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.620
 second championship run to guest in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.600
 hockenheim and we have the opportunity 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.730
 you at the landing gear service of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.080
 to put the motorcycle before you go there 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.780
 Let's go in and have a look 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.060
 there is still so nice we ask 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.920
 now with those lars what you are so beautiful 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.110
 make a fork here and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.180
 Modified yes hello first better 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.750
 street triple fans so we have 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.340
 here 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 later came a cup of relative 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.300
 is held close to the series and have 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.250
 Of course, with the series forks now 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.090
 a make at the start what the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.380
 course a bit 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 modified a bit to be tuned 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.750
 Anna should have it will be nice 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.010
 rausgefahren 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.270
 I think we already have experience 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.310
 that we collected with the whole 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.630
 Setting something too soft are what we are 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.920
 definitely make the right one 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.840
 Select track town hall 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.790
 a first line that we have the geometry 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.500
 can properly put on the feet and 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 of course , the internal settings 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.890
 So say the worst something 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.630
 customize that we have one 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.979
 really nice crisp damping 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.570
 find a vote for the beauty 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.579
 yes, that's 40 times after that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.420
 extensive program and I think 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.100
 that is noticeable 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.140
 most cup participants have this 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.540
 Chassis conversion already made and are 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.740
 most happy with it and look now 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.740
 we make a water truck 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.869
 we have the worst of the place now 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.200
 that your fund is broken down 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.490
 Differences lie on the table and 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.380
 Now notice that the pressure level 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.390
 pretty stylish is designed so 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.700
 the level is something under the motto 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.099
 too hard as we align now 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.650
 that we are a very very nice cook 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.130
 stage selling canada canada 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.130
 together 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.210
 the whole looks like in the 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.760
 Final phase here and now I ask 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.650
 my load as time claimed 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.510
 ever such a complete fork conversion 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.680
 for the triumph yes so if we now 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.180
 really starting from the founder on 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.800
 as it were from the complete standard condition 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.000
 I would just be a short two 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.770
 hours two to two and a half hours 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.480
 Estimated and gifts if you are on 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.400
 one we are looking at the clock then 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.810
 already want to do it well 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.330
 get that to two hours to two 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.510
 hours brand definitely ready 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.390
 stem 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.290
 We make good votes on that 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.360
 hopefully on the end of the track 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.590
 see better result that is see 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.210
 Tomorrow I am already looking forward to animal 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.980
 on the matter is really great 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.130
 Professionally you can see that the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.510
 sit by hand now look something 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.510
 All thinking will come later 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.500
 a new motorcycle really simply great
