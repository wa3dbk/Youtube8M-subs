00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.100
 ah 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.050
 and good here the tensions went 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.350
 they rearrange their chairs and now we are going to 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.260
 play for 100 points so a lot 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.900
 attention to the next game plasma me 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.480
 more kangaroos are always very busy 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.610
 as fine that does everything assaults with the 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.400
 little habit we follow the in their 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.400
 activities in the supermarket 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.950
 in the houses 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.950
 do not 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.310
 in the shopping center 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.900
 at the time of leaving 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 in which of the activities did not jump 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.610
 as the state center a kangaroo 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.250
 jumping all the time in this way 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.720
 it would be great very novel you can invent 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.409
 a machine that looks like a kangaroo and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.799
 I can 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.909
 hear, the good time is over, let's see 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.909
 Which is the right answer 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.310
 it was the letters 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.020
 and who will keep the 100 points 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.210
 it will be 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.010
 juanjo and trains 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.690
 and surely at home they will be 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.540
 asking how is the table of 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.659
 positions and in here too 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:44.450
 then let's look at the 4th and trini 150 points 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:51.140
 mates 60 points 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.940
 martÃ­ 50 points and not 10 points no 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.490
 make whoever goes to the washing machine 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.940
 ideas but it will leave us empty-handed 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.580
 because it takes this incredible prize and 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.170
 this board game kit now study 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.240
 so you can spend the most moments 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.110
 fun with your friends 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.450
 it's not like that today we're ready to 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.459
 send no to the ideas washer know 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.470
 how to activate this clear machine yes 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.250
 we have to say 3 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.250
 one 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.330
 and there they go quickly feeling not for 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.700
 please I do not want water if not no no no 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.430
 we are leaving the brains I 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.290
 gaining those ideas a bit you do not know 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.340
 move from there because when we come back 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.340
 We will be alone
