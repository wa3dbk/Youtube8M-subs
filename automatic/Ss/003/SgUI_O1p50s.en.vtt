before just using some stones and a
hamel<00:03:14.220> stone<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.600> made<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.260> knife<00:03:16.850> like

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
and I eventually ended up crumbling the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.220 
and I eventually ended up crumbling the
knife<00:03:23.549> or<00:03:23.880> breaking<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.360> knife<00:03:24.540> when<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.019> was

only<00:03:40.250> 2997<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.519> think<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:43.790> thought<00:03:44.790> what<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
only 2997 I think and I thought what the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.270 
only 2997 I think and I thought what the
heck<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.510> might<00:03:45.570> as<00:03:45.780> well<00:03:45.989> try<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.260> out<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.799> I

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
heck I might as well try it out and I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.380 
heck I might as well try it out and I
really<00:03:47.610> seriously<00:03:48.000> wanted<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.390> use<00:03:48.540> us<00:03:48.720> as<00:03:48.900> a

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
really seriously wanted to use us as a

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.180 
really seriously wanted to use us as a
hunting<00:03:51.390> knife<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.140> got<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.799> before<00:03:52.950> I

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
hunting knife so I got it and before I

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.220 
hunting knife so I got it and before I
half<00:03:53.459> did<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> blade<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.330> got<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.660> knife<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.170> I

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.000 
half did the blade I got the knife and I
was<00:03:55.650> going<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.950> say<00:03:56.310> how<00:03:56.430> sharp<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.910> was<00:03:58.010> forced

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
was going to say how sharp it was forced

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:07.640 
was going to say how sharp it was forced
with<00:03:59.880> cutting<00:04:00.120> people

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.800 

then<00:04:08.650> walk<00:04:08.800> out<00:04:08.920> too<00:04:09.160> well<00:04:09.340> then<00:04:10.000> shaving

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
then walk out too well then shaving

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.180 
then walk out too well then shaving
although<00:04:11.349> I<00:04:11.380> should've<00:04:11.709> did<00:04:11.800> this<00:04:11.950> test

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
although I should've did this test

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.430 
although I should've did this test
forced<00:04:12.700> it's<00:04:13.450> definitely<00:04:13.810> not<00:04:13.900> taking<00:04:14.140> her

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
forced it's definitely not taking her

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.310 
forced it's definitely not taking her
out<00:04:14.680> then<00:04:15.489> finally<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.030> performed<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.780> test<00:04:17.019> of

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
out then finally I performed the test of

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.500 
out then finally I performed the test of
sharpening<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:17.950> pencil<00:04:17.980> and<00:04:21.090> it's<00:04:22.090> really<00:04:22.360> not

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.560 
I would call it a knife shaped object
and<00:04:40.380> I<00:04:41.380> was<00:04:41.710> really<00:04:42.040> so<00:04:42.490> disappointed<00:04:43.120> in<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.360> I
