00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
different than the v mag machine that we

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.270 
different than the v mag machine that we
showed<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.509> earlier<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:14.560> hamburger<00:01:14.979> goes<00:01:15.159> to

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
the hopper it kind of gets woven into

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.480 
the hopper it kind of gets woven into
the<00:01:18.789> die<00:01:19.149> and<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:20.110> machine<00:01:20.710> comes<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.130> shears

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
the die and the machine comes and shears

off the hamburger so the problem with a

lot of times in hamburgers packed into a

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.620 
lot of times in hamburgers packed into a
dying<00:01:26.829> to<00:01:27.069> a<00:01:27.100> machine<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.640> gets<00:01:27.759> tough<00:01:28.060> what

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
dying to a machine it gets tough what

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.840 
dying to a machine it gets tough what
this<00:01:28.780> does<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.200> allow<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.469> muscle<00:01:29.979> fibers<00:01:30.009> the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
this does it allow the muscle fibers the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.219 
this does it allow the muscle fibers the
sam<00:01:31.119> straight<00:01:31.450> up<00:01:31.569> so<00:01:31.689> when<00:01:31.780> you're<00:01:31.899> planning

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
sam straight up so when you're planning

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.410 
sam straight up so when you're planning
said<00:01:32.649> you're<00:01:32.770> costa<00:01:33.069> recent<00:01:33.520> it's<00:01:33.909> a<00:01:34.060> tender

said you're costa recent it's a tender
product<00:01:34.929> and<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.799> can<00:01:35.920> see<00:01:36.100> it's<00:01:36.219> a<00:01:36.250> little

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
product and you can see it's a little

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.420 
product and you can see it's a little
bit<00:01:36.610> tighter<00:01:36.850> than<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.240> v<00:01:37.720> mag

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
bit tighter than the v mag

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.310 
bit tighter than the v mag
but<00:01:39.910> it's<00:01:40.030> not<00:01:40.090> near<00:01:40.420> as<00:01:40.540> tight<00:01:40.780> as<00:01:40.960> some<00:01:41.200> of

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
but it's not near as tight as some of

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.810 
but it's not near as tight as some of
the<00:01:41.410> other<00:01:41.740> implement<00:01:42.160> that<00:01:42.220> people<00:01:42.520> use<00:01:42.640> I've

the other implement that people use I've

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.270 
the other implement that people use I've
really<00:01:43.060> smashed<00:01:43.420> those<00:01:43.720> patties<00:01:43.990> in<00:01:44.740> the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.230 
I'm pretty loose patty
now<00:01:48.440> behind<00:01:48.680> me<00:01:48.830> is<00:01:48.980> a<00:01:49.010> forest<00:01:49.490> by<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.700> form<00:01:50.030> ax

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
now behind me is a forest by the form ax

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.820 
now behind me is a forest by the form ax
machine<00:01:50.690> that<00:01:50.900> like<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.200> Holly<00:01:51.380> matic<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.800> a

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
machine that like the Holly matic is a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.400 
machine that like the Holly matic is a
brand<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:53.090> works<00:01:53.330> similar<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.080> haleem

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
brand and it works similar to the haleem

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.140 
brand and it works similar to the haleem
attic<00:01:54.710> where<00:01:55.190> instead<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.610> just<00:01:55.790> putting<00:01:55.850> the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
attic where instead of just putting the

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.350 
attic where instead of just putting the
meat<00:01:56.450> into<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:57.050> dye<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.830> packing<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.550> down<00:01:58.610> it

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
meat into the dye and packing it down it

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.270 
meat into the dye and packing it down it
actually<00:01:59.540> puts<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.170> in<00:02:00.260> from<00:02:00.440> above<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:00.950> below

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
actually puts it in from above and below

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.300 
actually puts it in from above and below
so<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.060> get<00:02:02.210> that<00:02:02.240> nice<00:02:02.570> loose<00:02:03.110> fill<00:02:03.500> as<00:02:04.010> well

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
so you get that nice loose fill as well

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.280 
so you get that nice loose fill as well
so<00:02:04.610> when<00:02:04.700> your<00:02:04.820> customer<00:02:05.240> eats<00:02:05.390> at<00:02:05.660> it's<00:02:06.080> going

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
so when your customer eats at it's going

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.719 
so when your customer eats at it's going
to<00:02:06.350> be<00:02:06.440> like<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.650> haleem<00:02:06.950> attic<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.369> similar

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
to be like the haleem attic and similar

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.100 
to be like the haleem attic and similar
to<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.910> vmac<00:02:08.270> where<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:08.810> going<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.959> be<00:02:09.080> a

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
to the vmac where it's going to be a

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.449 
to the vmac where it's going to be a
tender<00:02:09.530> patty<00:02:09.800> it's<00:02:10.009> not<00:02:10.160> going<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.340> be<00:02:10.399> a

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
tender patty it's not going to be a

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.120 
tender patty it's not going to be a
tough<00:02:10.670> patty<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:15.440> more<00:02:15.590> thing<00:02:15.620> before<00:02:15.920> we

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.340 
ground beef when you smash it into the
machines<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:11.060> same<00:03:11.450> patty<00:03:11.780> it's

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
machines this is the same patty it's

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.320 
machines this is the same patty it's
just<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.620> little<00:03:12.769> bit<00:03:12.860> wider<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.519> can<00:03:13.700> if

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
just a little bit wider so you can if

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.699 
just a little bit wider so you can if
you<00:03:14.420> want<00:03:14.510> some<00:03:14.720> more<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:15.350> some<00:03:15.530> meat

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
you want some more like some meat

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.020 
you want some more like some meat
sticking<00:03:16.040> out<00:03:16.130> from<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.340> bun<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.790> could<00:03:16.910> use

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
sticking out from the bun you could use

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.970 
sticking out from the bun you could use
something<00:03:17.269> like<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:17.690> as<00:03:18.320> opposed<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.799> some<00:03:18.950> a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
something like this as opposed to some a

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.860 
something like this as opposed to some a
little<00:03:19.100> bit<00:03:19.280> thicker<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.570> we<00:03:20.660> have<00:03:20.750> that

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
little bit thicker so we have that

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.949 
little bit thicker so we have that
option<00:03:21.080> as<00:03:21.380> well<00:03:22.299> almost<00:03:23.299> all<00:03:23.570> these<00:03:23.750> patties

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
called the cloud it's a little bit more

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
that one the cloud that one's the heart

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.020 
that one the cloud that one's the heart
style<00:05:36.770> such<00:05:37.039> as<00:05:37.190> a<00:05:37.220> little<00:05:37.490> bit<00:05:37.610> sharper<00:05:38.000> edges

but<00:05:41.030> what<00:05:41.180> you<00:05:41.240> should<00:05:41.479> do<00:05:41.659> when<00:05:41.840> you're

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
but what you should do when you're

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.230 
but what you should do when you're
buying<00:05:42.169> a<00:05:42.320> frozen<00:05:42.740> patty<00:05:42.979> and<00:05:43.310> even<00:05:43.970> a<00:05:44.030> fresh

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
buying a frozen patty and even a fresh

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.149 
buying a frozen patty and even a fresh
patty<00:05:44.479> they<00:05:44.930> have<00:05:45.080> these<00:05:45.199> perforations<00:05:45.740> and

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
patty they have these perforations and

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.500 
patty they have these perforations and
what<00:05:46.310> that<00:05:46.460> does<00:05:46.550> is<00:05:46.610> increases<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.330> surface

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
what that does is increases the surface

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.360 
what that does is increases the surface
area<00:05:47.840> so<00:05:48.139> the<00:05:48.229> heat<00:05:48.380> actually<00:05:48.830> penetrates

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
area so the heat actually penetrates

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.339 
area so the heat actually penetrates
whenever<00:05:50.030> you<00:05:50.180> put<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.389> perforated<00:05:50.930> patty<00:05:51.139> on

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
whenever you put a perforated patty on

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.529 
whenever you put a perforated patty on
the<00:05:51.440> grill<00:05:51.949> it<00:05:52.610> always<00:05:52.849> goes<00:05:53.000> perforation

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
the grill it always goes perforation

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.719 
the grill it always goes perforation
down<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.110> it<00:05:54.169> captures<00:05:54.409> that<00:05:54.650> heat<00:05:55.039> and<00:05:55.250> it'll

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
down so it captures that heat and it'll

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.930 
down so it captures that heat and it'll
cook<00:05:55.880> the<00:05:56.000> patty<00:05:56.240> faster<00:05:57.460> it's<00:05:58.460> a<00:05:58.490> gray<00:05:58.669> patti

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
cook the patty faster it's a gray patti
