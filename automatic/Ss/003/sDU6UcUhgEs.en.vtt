00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
we receive a lot of questions about our

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.730 
we receive a lot of questions about our
sound-alikes<00:00:09.510> or<00:00:09.690> our<00:00:09.809> sample<00:00:10.320> replay

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740

sound-alikes or our sample replay
projects<00:00:11.370> so<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.700> wanted<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> open<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:12.540> up<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
projects so I wanted to open one up and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
show to you what this is when we

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.650 
show to you what this is when we
recreate<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.890> song<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.699> already<00:00:18.060> exists

anything<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.939> was<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:28.140> try<00:00:28.380> to

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
anything that was in it we try to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.349 
anything that was in it we try to
reproduce<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.400> sound<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.849> close<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
reproduce to sound as close to the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.319 
reproduce to sound as close to the
original<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.840> possible<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.940> project

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
original as possible so in this project

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:48.970 
original as possible so in this project
I<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:34.730> imagine<00:00:35.730> dragons<00:00:36.180> radioactive

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.090 

and<00:00:49.460> this<00:00:49.820> track<00:00:50.090> is<00:00:50.270> broken<00:00:50.510> up<00:00:50.720> into

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
and this track is broken up into

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.500 
and this track is broken up into
that's<00:00:52.940> how<00:00:53.060> we<00:00:53.120> tackle<00:00:53.360> it<00:00:53.660> we<00:00:53.810> do<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.080> drums

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.080 

the<00:00:59.510> background<00:01:00.230> instrumentation

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.090 

and<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> remainder<00:01:07.140> his<00:01:07.500> song<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.240> focus<00:01:10.100> and

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and the remainder his song is focus and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.910 
and the remainder his song is focus and
Watson

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.679 

now<00:01:16.920> these<00:01:17.070> tracks<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.610> not<00:01:17.640> copies<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.539> one

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
now these tracks are not copies of one

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.690 
now these tracks are not copies of one
another<00:01:18.720> they<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.619> multiple<00:01:20.100> takes<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
another they are multiple takes of the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.580 
another they are multiple takes of the
same<00:01:20.729> thing<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.539> we<00:01:21.659> double<00:01:22.049> triple<00:01:22.289> quadruple

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
same thing so we double triple quadruple

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.460 
same thing so we double triple quadruple
track<00:01:23.369> some<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.149> lead<00:01:24.330> lines<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
track some of the lead lines the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:35.960 
track some of the lead lines the
harmonies<00:01:25.890> are<00:01:26.039> separate<00:01:26.369> as<00:01:26.490> well<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.670> then

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
harmonies are separate as well and then

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
harmonies are separate as well and then
the<00:01:36.149> gang<00:01:36.450> vocals<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.320> simulating<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the gang vocals which is simulating a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.050 
the gang vocals which is simulating a
crowd<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.310> has<00:01:44.490> some<00:01:44.670> pretty<00:01:44.850> wild

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
crowd and this has some pretty wild

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.760 
crowd and this has some pretty wild
performances<00:01:45.959> in<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> because<00:01:46.500> when<00:01:46.679> you

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
performances in it because when you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.690 
performances in it because when you
record<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.220> crowd<00:01:47.490> or<00:01:47.789> a<00:01:47.819> gang<00:01:49.310> not<00:01:50.310> everybody

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
record a crowd or a gang not everybody

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.699 
record a crowd or a gang not everybody
is<00:01:50.819> doing<00:01:50.939> exactly<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:51.599> same<00:01:51.630> thing<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.560> we

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
is doing exactly the same thing so we

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:59.179 
is doing exactly the same thing so we
have<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> emulate<00:01:53.099> that<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.580> well<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.979> pretty

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
have to emulate that as well it's pretty

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.990 
have to emulate that as well it's pretty
wild<00:01:59.640> but<00:01:59.849> it<00:02:00.000> helps<00:02:00.299> create<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:02.729> helps

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
wild but it helps create the it helps

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.390 
wild but it helps create the it helps
reproduce<00:02:03.599> the<00:02:03.840> sound<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.289> this<00:02:04.409> track

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.640 

so<00:02:14.030> there's<00:02:14.360> two<00:02:14.540> things<00:02:14.659> I<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:15.049> to<00:02:15.080> do<00:02:15.319> just

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
so there's two things I like to do just

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.740 
so there's two things I like to do just
just<00:02:15.920> for<00:02:16.099> fun<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.459> show<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.730> series<00:02:17.090> one<00:02:17.360> turn

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
just for fun to show the series one turn

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.750 
just for fun to show the series one turn
off<00:02:17.959> all<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.739> effects<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.280> just<00:02:19.580> play<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
off all of the effects and just play the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.940 
off all of the effects and just play the
recordings<00:02:20.450> which<00:02:20.959> is<00:02:21.110> kind<00:02:21.319> of<00:02:21.409> wild<00:02:21.769> it's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
recordings which is kind of wild it's

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.080 
recordings which is kind of wild it's
drastically<00:02:22.400> different<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.060> really

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
drastically different and it really

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.300 
drastically different and it really
shows<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.659> importance<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.319> production<00:02:25.129> and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
shows the importance of production and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.309 
shows the importance of production and
then<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> second<00:02:26.510> thing<00:02:26.629> would<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:26.989> just<00:02:27.200> to

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
then the second thing would be just to

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.110 
then the second thing would be just to
isolate<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> couple<00:02:28.310> more<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.489> these<00:02:28.610> parts<00:02:28.970> and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
isolate a couple more of these parts and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.970 
isolate a couple more of these parts and
listen<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.420> them<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.629> their<00:02:29.810> own<00:02:29.870> as<00:02:30.739> it's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
listen to them on their own as it's

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.800 
listen to them on their own as it's
pretty<00:02:31.220> interesting<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.700> hear<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.599> raw

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
pretty interesting to hear the raw

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.430 
pretty interesting to hear the raw
recording<00:02:33.170> versus<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.159> produced<00:02:34.640> recording

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
recording versus the produced recording

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.490 
recording versus the produced recording
so<00:02:36.440> first<00:02:36.950> we'll<00:02:37.790> turn<00:02:38.030> off<00:02:38.269> all<00:02:38.629> of<00:02:39.049> our<00:02:39.200> fix

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
so first we'll turn off all of our fix

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.319 
so first we'll turn off all of our fix
I'll<00:02:40.250> also<00:02:40.549> have<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.909> lower<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.209> volume

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
I'll also have to lower the volume

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.640 
I'll also have to lower the volume
otherwise<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.930> will<00:02:42.079> be<00:02:42.170> clipping<00:02:42.409> like

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
otherwise this will be clipping like

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.890 
otherwise this will be clipping like
crazy

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.210 

so<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.020> sounds<00:02:51.230> absolutely<00:02:51.530> nothing<00:02:51.950> like<00:02:52.069> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
so it sounds absolutely nothing like the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:03.229 
so it sounds absolutely nothing like the
finished<00:02:52.520> product

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.460 

and<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.420> reason<00:03:04.750> why<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:04.900> because<00:03:05.049> every

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
and the reason why is because every

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.960 
and the reason why is because every

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
single one of these tracks has effects

single one of these tracks has effects
to<00:03:07.120> some<00:03:07.329> degree<00:03:07.739> if<00:03:08.739> they're<00:03:08.980> guitar<00:03:09.280> parts

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840

they may have a stomp box or some type
of<00:03:13.420> amp<00:03:13.720> simulator<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.620> without<00:03:14.980> it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
of amp simulator that without it

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.080 
of amp simulator that without it
we<00:03:17.650> still<00:03:17.920> have<00:03:18.040> our<00:03:18.160> guitar<00:03:18.460> tone<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:19.000> it's

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
we still have our guitar tone but it's

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:29.910 
we still have our guitar tone but it's
not<00:03:19.240> quite<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.600> same<00:03:20.820> if<00:03:21.820> it's<00:03:22.120> vocals<00:03:28.920> it

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
not quite the same if it's vocals it

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.140 
not quite the same if it's vocals it
won't<00:03:30.130> be<00:03:30.220> shaped<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.700> same<00:03:30.910> way<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.730> it'll

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
won't be shaped the same way so it'll

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:49.500 
won't be shaped the same way so it'll
still<00:03:37.420> be<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:46.090> then<00:03:46.209> we<00:03:46.270> compress<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:49.390> it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
still be and then we compress it and it

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.970 
still be and then we compress it and it
starts<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.900> make<00:03:49.990> a<00:03:50.050> big<00:03:50.260> difference<00:03:50.410> after<00:03:50.800> a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
starts to make a big difference after a

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.800 
starts to make a big difference after a
while<00:03:51.190> maybe<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.270> hear<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.480> difference

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
while maybe you hear the difference

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.750 
while maybe you hear the difference
maybe<00:03:53.050> you<00:03:53.170> don't<00:03:53.350> but<00:03:53.530> either<00:03:53.620> way<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:54.430> think

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
maybe you don't but either way I think

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:15.539 
maybe you don't but either way I think
everybody<00:03:55.510> hears<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.900> difference<00:03:57.690> between

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:59.770 

solo

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.990 

it's<00:05:00.780> just<00:05:01.140> a<00:05:01.260> reverberations<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:04.500> is<00:05:05.000> where

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
it's just a reverberations this is where

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.870 
it's just a reverberations this is where
we<00:05:06.150> emulate<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.900> environment<00:05:07.770> this<00:05:07.890> larger

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
we emulate the environment this larger

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.670 
we emulate the environment this larger
mood<00:05:09.120> that<00:05:09.780> we're<00:05:09.960> trying<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.350> give<00:05:10.560> the

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
mood that we're trying to give the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.040 
mood that we're trying to give the
appearance<00:05:11.010> of

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
appearance of

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.219 
appearance of
so<00:05:13.500> we<00:05:13.620> create<00:05:14.490> reverberation<00:05:15.360> tracks<00:05:15.660> for

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
so we create reverberation tracks for

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.050 
so we create reverberation tracks for
all<00:05:16.319> the<00:05:16.440> different<00:05:16.740> instruments<00:05:16.979> some<00:05:17.940> are

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
all the different instruments some are

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.230 
all the different instruments some are
for<00:05:18.240> background<00:05:19.129> some<00:05:20.129> are<00:05:20.280> for<00:05:20.430> particular

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
for background some are for particular

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.890 
for background some are for particular
vocal<00:05:21.599> sections<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:24.210> others<00:05:24.539> are<00:05:24.659> for<00:05:24.780> other

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
vocal sections and others are for other

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.680 
vocal sections and others are for other
vocals<00:05:28.699> every<00:05:29.699> little<00:05:29.970> piece<00:05:30.090> in<00:05:30.360> this<00:05:30.449> plays

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
vocals every little piece in this plays

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.610 
vocals every little piece in this plays
a<00:05:30.720> role<00:05:31.020> in<00:05:31.229> the<00:05:31.349> overall<00:05:31.770> sound<00:05:32.870> so<00:05:33.870> that's

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
a role in the overall sound so that's

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:42.770 
a role in the overall sound so that's
pretty<00:05:34.889> much<00:05:34.979> what

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780
