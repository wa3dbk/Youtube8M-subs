what follows is a step-by-step

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.610 
what follows is a step-by-step
instruction<00:00:02.879> sequence<00:00:03.360> on<00:00:03.629> how<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:03.990> remove

without damaging the watch or the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.080 
without damaging the watch or the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
packaging so we're going to go now and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.900 
packaging so we're going to go now and
start<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.840> unpacking<00:00:13.309> i'm<00:00:14.309> going<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.610> use

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
start the unpacking i'm going to use

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.670 
start the unpacking i'm going to use
exacto<00:00:15.900> here<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.970> gently<00:00:17.970> cut<00:00:18.240> through<00:00:18.680> this

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
exacto here to gently cut through this

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.970 
exacto here to gently cut through this
is<00:00:19.890> makes<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.820> process<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.300> little<00:00:21.420> bit<00:00:21.660> easier

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
is makes the process a little bit easier

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.189 
is makes the process a little bit easier
normally<00:00:22.980> there'd<00:00:23.189> be<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> hole<00:00:23.699> there<00:00:24.080> if<00:00:25.080> I

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
normally there'd be a hole there if I

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.099 
normally there'd be a hole there if I
had<00:00:25.320> pulled<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.769> top<00:00:25.949> down<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.539> in

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
had pulled the top down like that so in

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.429 
had pulled the top down like that so in
order<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.529> pull<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.279> apart<00:00:30.080> I'm<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.289> to

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
order to pull this apart I'm going to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.780 
order to pull this apart I'm going to
have<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.759> cut<00:00:32.759> through<00:00:32.940> all<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.149> way<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.430> in

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
have to cut through all the way so in

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.700 
have to cut through all the way so in
order<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.090> pull<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.480> apart<00:00:36.710> there<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.770> go

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
order to pull this apart there we go

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.110 
order to pull this apart there we go
there<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.739> go<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:43.190> we've<00:00:44.190> got<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> instruction

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
there we go so we've got the instruction

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600 
there we go so we've got the instruction
manual<00:00:45.149> right<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.960> as<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.520> I'm
