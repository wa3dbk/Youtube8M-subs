00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.990 
tour-de-force in one of our great fears
which<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.020> robots<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.919> what<00:00:08.460> they<00:00:08.580> will<00:00:08.760> do<00:00:08.970> to

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
which is robots and what they will do to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.860 
which is robots and what they will do to
us<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.990> assumption<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:10.950> need<00:00:11.429> human<00:00:12.300> labor

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
us the assumption is we need human labor

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.749 
us the assumption is we need human labor
is<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.410> assumption<00:00:13.950> being<00:00:14.099> tested<00:00:14.580> well

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
is that assumption being tested well

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.129 
is that assumption being tested well
this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.089> great<00:00:15.299> question<00:00:15.660> right<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:15.809> if

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
this is the great question right so if

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.630 
this is the great question right so if
you<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> early<00:00:16.710> 19th<00:00:17.039> century<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.490> might

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
you in the early 19th century you might

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.429 
you in the early 19th century you might
have<00:00:17.730> said<00:00:17.880> automation<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.690> technological

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
have said automation and technological

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.260 
have said automation and technological
change<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.890> coming<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.340> horses<00:00:20.970> are<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.210> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
change is coming and horses are going to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.670 
change is coming and horses are going to
be<00:00:21.330> out<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.480> business<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.230> over<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> course

be out of business but over the course

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.439 
be out of business but over the course
of<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.890> 19th<00:00:23.220> century<00:00:23.250> horses<00:00:24.000> actually<00:00:24.300> did

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
of the 19th century horses actually did

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.150 
of the 19th century horses actually did
really<00:00:24.480> well<00:00:24.750> there<00:00:25.109> were<00:00:25.199> more<00:00:25.380> horses<00:00:25.920> in

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
really well there were more horses in

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800 
really well there were more horses in
the<00:00:26.340> economy<00:00:26.849> at<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> end<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.539> entry

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the economy at the end of this entry

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.120 
the economy at the end of this entry
than<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> beginning<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.949> could

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
than at the beginning and so you could

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
than at the beginning and so you could
have<00:00:29.220> said<00:00:29.400> gee<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.179> lump<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.660> equine

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
have said gee it's a lump of equine

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.870 
have said gee it's a lump of equine
labor<00:00:31.380> fallacy<00:00:31.920> they'll<00:00:32.070> always<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.460> demand

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
labor fallacy they'll always be demand

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.370 
labor fallacy they'll always be demand
for<00:00:33.030> horses<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.420> then<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> next<00:00:34.110> half

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
for horses and then in the next half

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.979 
for horses and then in the next half
century<00:00:34.559> horses<00:00:35.460> went<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> way<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> horses

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
century horses went the way of horses

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
century horses went the way of horses
and<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> question<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.309> humans<00:00:38.820> whose

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and so the question is will humans whose

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
and so the question is will humans whose
jobs<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.930> actually<00:00:40.410> stayed<00:00:40.680> around<00:00:40.829> even

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
jobs have actually stayed around even

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
jobs have actually stayed around even
with<00:00:41.579> previous<00:00:42.000> technology<00:00:42.329> things<00:00:42.750> will

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
with previous technology things will

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.869 
with previous technology things will
they<00:00:43.290> eventually<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.980> facing<00:00:44.250> their<00:00:44.610> horse

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
they eventually be facing their horse

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
they eventually be facing their horse
and<00:00:45.059> buggy<00:00:45.210> moment<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> future<00:00:46.620> will

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and buggy moment and in the future will

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100 
and buggy moment and in the future will
their<00:00:47.010> jobs<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.550> away<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.420> horses<00:00:48.750> jobs

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
their jobs go away just like horses jobs

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.569 
their jobs go away just like horses jobs
did<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.219> interesting<00:00:50.250> question

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
did that's a really interesting question

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.850 
did that's a really interesting question

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to do but in our role as workers our

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 
to do but in our role as workers our
jobs<00:01:33.720> might<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.439> taken<00:01:34.770> away<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.189> so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
jobs might be going to taken away and so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.399 
jobs might be going to taken away and so
the<00:01:35.369> question<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.790> will<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:36.689> how<00:01:36.960> will<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.200> be

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the question is will what how will we be

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.460 
the question is will what how will we be
able<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.680> purchase<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:39.150> leisure<00:01:39.750> time<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
able to purchase the leisure time and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
able to purchase the leisure time and
the<00:01:40.560> goods<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.009> fill<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.189> leisure<00:01:41.610> time<00:01:41.850> with

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the goods to fill that leisure time with

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.880 
the goods to fill that leisure time with
what<00:01:42.780> kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.170> money<00:01:43.320> where<00:01:43.619> were<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
what kind of money where were you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770 
what kind of money where were you
getting<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.790> wherewithal<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:45.600> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
getting the the wherewithal to do that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600 
getting the the wherewithal to do that
because<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.079> may<00:01:46.290> not<00:01:46.380> actually<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.310> jobs

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
because we may not actually have jobs

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.249 
because we may not actually have jobs
it's<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.479> interesting<00:01:48.540> question<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it's a really interesting question and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.280 
it's a really interesting question and
the<00:01:49.979> nobody<00:01:50.729> has<00:01:50.909> answers<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.720> job<00:01:52.049> will<00:01:52.229> be

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the nobody has answers your job will be

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.660 
the nobody has answers your job will be
going<00:01:52.590> away<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.310> really<00:01:53.610> interesting

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
going away the really interesting

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.330 
going away the really interesting
question<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.570> new<00:01:54.840> jobs<00:01:55.259> emerge<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.219> we

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
question is will new jobs emerge that we

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.130 
question is will new jobs emerge that we
don't<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.640> about<00:01:56.670> yet<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.509> fill<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.750> space

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
don't know about yet to fill that space

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.770 
don't know about yet to fill that space
that's<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.430> people<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.820> favor<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.270> automation

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
that's the people in favor of automation

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.660 
that's the people in favor of automation
and<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.200> favor<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.710> great<00:02:02.189> new<00:02:02.369> world

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and in favor of this great new world

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.730 
and in favor of this great new world
make<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.509> we'll<00:02:03.810> need<00:02:03.990> people<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.560> run

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
make is that we'll need people to run

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.139 
make is that we'll need people to run
the<00:02:04.860> robots<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.430> robots<00:02:05.700> won't<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.909> able<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the robots the robots won't be able to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.630 
the robots the robots won't be able to
run<00:02:06.240> themselves<00:02:06.530> will<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:07.680> enough<00:02:08.009> jobs

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
run themselves will there be enough jobs

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.249 
run themselves will there be enough jobs
for<00:02:08.819> those<00:02:09.030> people<00:02:09.390> well<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:09.959> know<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
for those people well we don't know the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.540 
for those people well we don't know the
key<00:02:10.410> essentially<00:02:10.920> you're<00:02:11.039> betting<00:02:11.340> on<00:02:11.430> the

there's been new

there's been new
kinds<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.640> things<00:02:14.880> developing<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
kinds of things developing but the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140 
kinds of things developing but the
question<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.069> happen<00:02:17.280> now<00:02:17.640> or<00:02:17.970> will

time around the machines might actually

fundamentally change things the question

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.860 
fundamentally change things the question
though<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.069> humans<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.120> power<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.569> halt

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
though is humans have the power to halt

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.780 
though is humans have the power to halt
that<00:03:01.110> right<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.860> like<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.190> Greeks<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
that right just like the Greeks have the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.150 
that right just like the Greeks have the
power<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.090> say<00:03:03.330> no<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.660> Europe<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.680> humans

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
power to say no to Europe so humans

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.420 
power to say no to Europe so humans
might<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> power<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.790> say<00:03:06.030> no<00:03:06.209> to

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
might have the power to say no to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.350 
might have the power to say no to
increasing<00:03:08.430> automation<00:03:08.910> they're<00:03:09.180> not<00:03:09.239> going

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
increasing automation they're not going

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
pushing a Dyson it's a thing you don't

even look like a robot and that's the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.130 
even look like a robot and that's the
interesting<00:03:36.180> question<00:03:36.360> there<00:03:36.690> will<00:03:36.840> be<00:03:36.989> when

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
interesting question there will be when

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.780 
interesting question there will be when
automation<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:37.920> artificial<00:03:38.340> intelligence

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
and robotics are ubiquitous will that

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.160 
and robotics are ubiquitous will that
actually<00:03:42.329> fundamentally<00:03:42.780> what's<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
actually fundamentally what's the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.470 
actually fundamentally what's the
timeline<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:44.070> edit<00:03:44.400> magazines<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.209> used<00:03:45.420> to

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
timeline you edit magazines I used to

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.580 
timeline you edit magazines I used to
write<00:03:45.660> for<00:03:45.780> magazines<00:03:45.870> when<00:03:46.380> are<00:03:46.500> they<00:03:46.560> coming

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
write for magazines when are they coming

write for magazines when are they coming
for<00:03:46.950> our<00:03:47.130> jobs<00:03:47.459> well<00:03:47.910> that's<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.269> great

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
for our jobs well that's a great

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.970 
for our jobs well that's a great
question<00:03:48.600> i<00:03:48.870> think<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.230> one<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.739> things

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
question i think the one of the things

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.229 
question i think the one of the things
that<00:03:50.040> people<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.489> magazine<00:03:50.820> say<00:03:51.030> this

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
that people in the magazine say this

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.120 
that people in the magazine say this
issue<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:52.019> next<00:03:52.260> ten<00:03:52.440> years<00:03:52.470> won't<00:03:52.950> look

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
issue is the next ten years won't look

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.650 
issue is the next ten years won't look
dramatically<00:03:53.730> different<00:03:53.820> but<00:03:54.269> after<00:03:54.540> that

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
dramatically different but after that

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.810 
dramatically different but after that
all<00:03:54.840> bets<00:03:54.870> are<00:03:55.170> off<00:03:55.370> do<00:03:56.370> we<00:03:56.459> have<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.670> make

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
all bets are off do we have to make

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.979 
all bets are off do we have to make
great<00:03:57.030> strides<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.540> our<00:03:57.630> special

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
great strides and our special

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.479 
great strides and our special
intelligence<00:03:58.230> before<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.829> is<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.010> reality

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
intelligence before this is a reality

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.250 
intelligence before this is a reality
you<00:03:59.910> know<00:04:00.030> those<00:04:00.269> strides<00:04:00.570> are<00:04:00.810> actually

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
you know those strides are actually

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.650 
you know those strides are actually
happening<00:04:01.680> it's<00:04:02.070> going<00:04:02.489> forward<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.120> fast<00:04:03.420> so

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
happening it's going forward so fast so

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.840 
happening it's going forward so fast so
quickly<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.650> only<00:04:04.950> question<00:04:05.340> is<00:04:05.519> how

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
quickly that the only question is how

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.960 
quickly that the only question is how
cumulative<00:04:06.329> will<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.930> actually<00:04:07.170> be<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.820> will

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
cumulative will it actually be and will

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.490 
cumulative will it actually be and will
you<00:04:09.090> reach<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.359> sort<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.570> singularity<00:04:10.230> talk

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
you reach a sort of singularity talk

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.680 
you reach a sort of singularity talk

out<00:04:12.780> moments<00:04:13.230> ago<00:04:13.440> at<00:04:13.640> BTIG<00:04:14.640> Netflix<00:04:15.600> he<00:04:15.810> ups

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
out moments ago at BTIG Netflix he ups

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.620 
out moments ago at BTIG Netflix he ups
the<00:04:16.350> price<00:04:16.590> target<00:04:17.130> because<00:04:17.430> linear<00:04:17.940> TV<00:04:18.299> is

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
the price target because linear TV is

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.469 
the price target because linear TV is
done<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.289> mean<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.829> talk<00:04:19.859> about<00:04:20.479> technological

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
done I mean you talk about technological

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.000 
done I mean you talk about technological
change<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.930> see<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.289> in<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.500> media<00:04:22.830> biz

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
change you see that in the media biz

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.469 
change you see that in the media biz
yeah<00:04:23.130> but<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.700> where<00:04:23.820> Martin<00:04:24.120> wolf<00:04:24.270> piece

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
yeah but this is where Martin wolf piece

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.149 
yeah but this is where Martin wolf piece
is<00:04:24.630> so<00:04:24.810> good<00:04:25.020> because<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.590> know<00:04:25.680> get

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
is so good because you know get

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.250 
is so good because you know get
driverless<00:04:26.580> cars<00:04:27.000> are

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
driverless cars are

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.360 
driverless cars are
really<00:04:27.470> cool<00:04:27.680> but<00:04:27.980> you<00:04:28.010> know<00:04:28.130> what's<00:04:28.280> even

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
really cool but you know what's even

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.880 
really cool but you know what's even
cooler<00:04:28.670> cars<00:04:29.390> so<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.990> question<00:04:30.380> is<00:04:30.440> not<00:04:30.620> just

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
cooler cars so the question is not just

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.380 
cooler cars so the question is not just
are<00:04:30.980> things<00:04:31.190> changing<00:04:31.250> but<00:04:32.000> are<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.150> changes

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
are things changing but are the changes

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.910 
are things changing but are the changes
that<00:04:32.630> are<00:04:32.780> occurring<00:04:32.870> now<00:04:33.410> how<00:04:33.710> do<00:04:33.770> they

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
that are occurring now how do they

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.710 
that are occurring now how do they
relate<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.490> changes<00:04:34.910> we<00:04:35.210> used<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.570> have

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
relate to the changes we used to have

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.600 
relate to the changes we used to have
and<00:04:35.930> wolf<00:04:36.200> court<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:36.920> Gordon<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.430> others

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
and wolf court and Gordon and others

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.400 
and wolf court and Gordon and others
says<00:04:38.030> that<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.300> know<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.570> older<00:04:38.960> changes

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
says that you know the older changes
