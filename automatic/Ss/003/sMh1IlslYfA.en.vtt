00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.409 
but why I decided to get this one in
particular<00:05:44.180> is<00:05:45.169> because<00:05:45.439> this<00:05:46.430> chibi<00:05:47.089> super

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
particular is because this chibi super

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.450 
particular is because this chibi super
deformed<00:05:47.629> wind<00:05:47.930> was<00:05:48.349> actually<00:05:48.919> featured<00:05:49.339> in

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
deformed wind was actually featured in

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.719 
deformed wind was actually featured in
the<00:05:49.580> ending<00:05:50.029> sequence<00:05:50.240> and<00:05:50.689> it<00:05:51.379> was<00:05:51.650> too<00:05:52.189> cute

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
the ending sequence and it was too cute

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:54.939 
the ending sequence and it was too cute
to<00:05:52.759> pass<00:05:53.029> up<00:05:53.300> because<00:05:53.689> I<00:05:53.930> absolutely<00:05:54.529> loved

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
to pass up because I absolutely loved

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.950 
to pass up because I absolutely loved
the<00:05:55.129> ending<00:05:55.279> sequence<00:05:55.699> so<00:05:56.629> we<00:05:56.750> actually

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
the ending sequence so we actually

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.640 
the ending sequence so we actually
placed<00:05:57.349> her<00:05:57.469> arms<00:05:57.770> like<00:05:57.889> so<00:05:59.289> we<00:06:00.289> can<00:06:00.469> actually

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
placed her arms like so we can actually

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:10.580 
placed her arms like so we can actually
emanate<00:06:01.250> the<00:06:01.460> ending<00:06:01.939> scene

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.620 

so<00:06:11.310> out<00:06:11.550> of<00:06:11.669> all<00:06:11.790> the<00:06:11.910> figures<00:06:12.150> have<00:06:12.300> ridden

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
so out of all the figures have ridden

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.600 
so out of all the figures have ridden
the<00:06:12.660> 1/4<00:06:13.230> scale<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:13.830> 1/8<00:06:14.100> scale

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
the 1/4 scale the 1/8 scale

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.430 
the 1/4 scale the 1/8 scale
I<00:06:14.639> believe<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.270> ninja<00:06:15.600> figure<00:06:15.900> is<00:06:16.050> actually
