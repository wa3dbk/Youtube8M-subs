introduction video for this particular
baseline<00:00:15.120> series<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:16.230> starts<00:00:16.560> off<00:00:16.680> pretty

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
baseline series it starts off pretty

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.250 
baseline series it starts off pretty
easy<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.460> gets<00:00:17.670> quite<00:00:18.480> complex<00:00:18.900> quite

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
easy and it gets quite complex quite

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.840 
easy and it gets quite complex quite
quickly<00:00:19.619> while<00:00:20.070> less<00:00:20.220> than<00:00:20.250> 10<00:00:20.520> you'll<00:00:20.730> be

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
quickly while less than 10 you'll be

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.970 
quickly while less than 10 you'll be
constructing<00:00:21.420> some<00:00:21.660> very<00:00:22.170> complex<00:00:22.680> base

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
let's have a look at rule number one

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.500 
let's have a look at rule number one
we're<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.910> jump<00:00:57.120> straight<00:00:57.180> into

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
we're just going to jump straight into

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.400 
we're just going to jump straight into
it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.049 
it
rule<00:00:58.890> number<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> what<00:00:59.850> we're<00:00:59.940> going

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
rule number one and is what we're going

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
rule number one and is what we're going
to<00:01:00.120> look<00:01:00.210> at<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.600> first<00:01:00.840> lesson<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.859> we're

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
to look at in this first lesson is we're

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.490 
to look at in this first lesson is we're
going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.280> hit<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> tonic<00:01:02.910> at<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> start<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
going to hit the tonic at the start of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.890 
going to hit the tonic at the start of
every<00:01:04.860> chord<00:01:05.220> change<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.630> particular

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
every chord change so this particular

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.330 
every chord change so this particular
progression<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.740> we're<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> be

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
progression that we're going to be

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
progression that we're going to be
looking<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.939> an<00:01:09.060> 8<00:01:09.240> bar<00:01:09.479> progression<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
looking at is an 8 bar progression and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
looking at is an 8 bar progression and
it's<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> first<00:01:10.860> eight<00:01:11.070> bars<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> song

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
it's the first eight bars to a song

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.960 
it's the first eight bars to a song
called<00:01:12.060> autumn<00:01:12.360> leaves<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:13.590> also<00:01:13.970> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
called autumn leaves it's also the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.390 
called autumn leaves it's also the
progression<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> many<00:01:15.990> other<00:01:16.200> songs<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
progression to many other songs and the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.999 
progression to many other songs and the
the<00:01:18.210> way<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> progresses<00:01:19.110> you'll<00:01:19.830> actually

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the way it progresses you'll actually

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.490 
the way it progresses you'll actually
notice<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.820> keeps<00:01:21.000> jumping<00:01:21.330> up<00:01:21.630> around

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
notice that it keeps jumping up around

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
notice that it keeps jumping up around
the<00:01:22.680> circle<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.070> fourths<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.850> first<00:01:24.090> chord<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the circle of fourths the first chord is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.230 
the circle of fourths the first chord is
a<00:01:24.570> C<00:01:24.869> chord<00:01:25.290> -<00:01:25.920> an<00:01:26.040> F<00:01:26.189> chord<00:01:26.220> -<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> B<00:01:26.970> flat<00:01:27.210> chord

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
a C chord - an F chord - a B flat chord

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660 
a C chord - an F chord - a B flat chord
-<00:01:27.720> an<00:01:27.810> E<00:01:27.900> flat<00:01:28.020> chord<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:29.159> goes<00:01:29.340> off<00:01:29.490> track

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
- an E flat chord it goes off track

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.330 
- an E flat chord it goes off track
they're<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.060> bit<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.479> after<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.409> but

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
they're a little bit but after that but

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.880 
they're a little bit but after that but
it<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.420> know<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.570> basic<00:01:34.200> circular<00:01:34.439> force

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it is you know that basic circular force

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.520 
it is you know that basic circular force
and<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.280> such<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> common<00:01:35.939> progression<00:01:36.630> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and it's such a common progression that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.870 
and it's such a common progression that
I<00:01:37.590> think<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.340> make<00:01:38.430> sense<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I think it would just make sense to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.999 
I think it would just make sense to
attack<00:01:39.180> something<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.770> we're<00:01:40.979> just

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
attack something like that so we're just

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.130 
attack something like that so we're just
going<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.250> go<00:01:41.400> over<00:01:41.700> those<00:01:41.820> eight<00:01:42.090> bars<00:01:42.360> for

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
going to go over those eight bars for

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.010 
going to go over those eight bars for
this<00:01:43.759> for<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.850> whole<00:01:45.030> series<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.509> fact<00:01:45.720> but

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
this for this whole series in fact but

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.859 
this for this whole series in fact but
you'll<00:01:46.950> notice<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.509> we're<00:01:48.720> halfway

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you'll notice you know as we're halfway

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.600 
you'll notice you know as we're halfway
through<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.320> you'll<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.530> realize<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
through it you'll just realize that you

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.560 
through it you'll just realize that you
can<00:01:50.790> start<00:01:51.030> applying<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.540> anything<00:01:52.399> so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
can start applying that to anything so

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.200 
can start applying that to anything so
so<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.780> said<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> hit<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.610> tonic<00:01:57.030> on

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
so as I said we want to hit the tonic on

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.440 
so as I said we want to hit the tonic on
every<00:01:57.899> chord<00:01:58.140> change<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.969> important

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
every chord change this is important

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.950 
every chord change this is important
because<00:02:01.219> that<00:02:02.219> bass<00:02:02.729> line<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.180> outlining<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
because that bass line is outlining the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.810 
because that bass line is outlining the
structure<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> tonality<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> entire

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
structure and the tonality of the entire

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.930 
structure and the tonality of the entire
piece<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.829> go<00:02:07.979> off<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.280> doesn't<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
piece it can go off it doesn't have to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.350 
piece it can go off it doesn't have to
do<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.690> saying<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:11.310> let's<00:02:11.580> learn<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
do what I'm saying but let's learn the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.610 
do what I'm saying but let's learn the
basics<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.200> then<00:02:13.349> we'll

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
basics of it and then we'll

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500 
basics of it and then we'll
that<00:02:13.769> messing<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.209> off<00:02:15.299> on<00:02:15.330> a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
that messing with it and going off on a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.300 
that messing with it and going off on a
tangent<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.530> fact<00:02:16.680> by<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.920> end<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.190> this

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
tangent and in fact by the end of this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.809 
tangent and in fact by the end of this
series<00:02:17.549> we<00:02:17.849> will<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:19.370> wandered<00:02:20.370> off<00:02:20.519> a

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
series we will have wandered off a

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.740 
series we will have wandered off a
little<00:02:21.239> bit

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
little bit

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.509 
little bit
on<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.260> few<00:02:22.470> different<00:02:22.560> tangents<00:02:23.159> so<00:02:23.340> you'll

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
on to a few different tangents so you'll

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.729 
on to a few different tangents so you'll
get<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> bit<00:02:23.909> of<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.060> taste<00:02:24.239> of<00:02:24.390> everything<00:02:24.810> but

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
get a bit of a taste of everything but

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.270 
get a bit of a taste of everything but
let's<00:02:25.890> look<00:02:26.040> at<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.280> basic<00:02:26.940> first<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.280> our

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
let's look at the basic first so our

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.220 
let's look at the basic first so our
first<00:02:29.580> chord<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.150> C<00:02:30.690> minor<00:02:30.900> chord

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
first chord is a C minor chord

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.330 
first chord is a C minor chord
okay<00:02:31.829> so<00:02:31.970> simple<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.290> C<00:02:34.290> 2<00:02:34.920> 3<00:02:35.700> 4<00:02:36.920> ok<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.220> know

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
okay so simple is this C 2 3 4 ok I know

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.339 
okay so simple is this C 2 3 4 ok I know
it's<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.790> very<00:02:38.970> very<00:02:39.269> simple<00:02:39.659> in<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.140> first

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
it's a very very simple in this first

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.990 
it's a very very simple in this first
lesson<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:40.860> bear<00:02:41.519> with<00:02:41.549> me

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
lesson but bear with me

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.240 
lesson but bear with me
it'll<00:02:42.239> be<00:02:42.390> incredibly<00:02:43.290> complex<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.129> a

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
it'll be incredibly complex in just a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.569 
it'll be incredibly complex in just a
few<00:02:44.459> lessons<00:02:44.840> ok<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:45.900> that's<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> idea<00:02:46.470> an<00:02:47.340> X

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
few lessons ok so that's the idea an X

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.759 
few lessons ok so that's the idea an X
bar<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.060> bar<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.420> f7<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.940> just<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.000> note<00:02:51.120> F<00:02:51.329> 1<00:02:52.079> 2

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
bar is a bar of f7 so just a note F 1 2

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.990 
bar is a bar of f7 so just a note F 1 2
3<00:02:53.430> 4<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.470> really<00:02:56.129> as<00:02:56.220> simple<00:02:56.250> as<00:02:56.579> that

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
3 4 and it's really as simple as that

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.449 
3 4 and it's really as simple as that
ok<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:57.930> let's<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.500> go<00:02:58.890> through<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.250> first

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
ok so let's just go through the first

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.970 
ok so let's just go through the first
eight<00:02:59.640> bars<00:03:00.019> you're<00:03:01.019> pretty<00:03:01.440> smart<00:03:01.560> I'm<00:03:01.829> sure

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
eight bars you're pretty smart I'm sure

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.339 
eight bars you're pretty smart I'm sure
you<00:03:02.159> can<00:03:02.280> figure<00:03:02.489> out<00:03:02.549> what's<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.090> here

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
you can figure out what's going on here

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.399 
you can figure out what's going on here
so<00:03:04.849> here's<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:05.970> progression<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:06.780> bar<00:03:07.079> AC

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
so here's the progression it's a bar AC

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.270 
so here's the progression it's a bar AC
minor<00:03:07.650> 7<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:08.640> bar<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.030> f7<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:10.620> bar<00:03:10.829> B<00:03:11.040> flat

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
minor 7 to a bar of f7 to bar B flat

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.990 
minor 7 to a bar of f7 to bar B flat
major<00:03:11.489> 7<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.359> a<00:03:12.390> bar<00:03:12.599> of<00:03:12.720> E<00:03:12.870> flat<00:03:13.079> major<00:03:13.260> 7<00:03:13.849> to<00:03:14.849> an

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
major 7 to a bar of E flat major 7 to an

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.930 
major 7 to a bar of E flat major 7 to an
a<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.750> half<00:03:16.349> diminished<00:03:16.560> chord<00:03:16.859> or<00:03:17.250> an<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.669> minor

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
a a half diminished chord or an a minor

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.900 
a a half diminished chord or an a minor
7<00:03:18.060> with<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> flat<00:03:18.780> 5<00:03:19.220> we'll<00:03:20.220> look<00:03:20.310> at<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.609> chord

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
7 with a flat 5 we'll look at that chord

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.140 
7 with a flat 5 we'll look at that chord
when<00:03:21.359> we<00:03:21.450> get<00:03:21.599> to<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.810> but<00:03:22.099> then<00:03:23.099> to<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> bio<00:03:23.609> d7

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
when we get to it but then to a bio d7

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.159 
when we get to it but then to a bio d7
and<00:03:24.810> then<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.380> two<00:03:25.620> bars<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:25.950> G<00:03:26.160> minor<00:03:26.400> 7<00:03:27.109> ok<00:03:28.109> so

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
and then to two bars of G minor 7 ok so

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.360 
and then to two bars of G minor 7 ok so
here's<00:03:28.650> what<00:03:28.829> we're<00:03:28.919> going<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.069> do<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
here's what we're going to do in the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.530 
here's what we're going to do in the
bass<00:03:29.519> line<00:03:29.730> there's<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.000> rule<00:03:30.150> number<00:03:30.299> one

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
bass line there's a rule number one

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.800 
bass line there's a rule number one
tonic<00:03:31.500> on<00:03:31.650> every<00:03:32.310> chord<00:03:32.549> change<00:03:32.819> so<00:03:33.180> 1<00:03:34.049> 2<00:03:34.739> 3<00:03:35.400> 4<00:03:36.120> 2

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
tonic on every chord change so 1 2 3 4 2

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:45.490 
tonic on every chord change so 1 2 3 4 2
2<00:03:37.109> 3<00:03:37.970> 4<00:03:38.970> 3<00:03:39.660> 2<00:03:40.019> 3<00:03:40.379> 4<00:03:41.310> 4<00:03:42.060> 2<00:03:42.919> 2<00:03:43.919> bar<00:03:44.099> 5

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
2 3 4 3 2 3 4 4 2 2 bar 5

two three four d two three four G two
three<00:03:52.880> four<00:03:53.570> and<00:03:53.690> we'll<00:03:53.780> get<00:03:53.870> another<00:03:53.960> bar<00:03:54.320> G

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
three four and we'll get another bar G

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.430 
three four and we'll get another bar G
so<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.190> can<00:03:55.310> just<00:03:55.400> play<00:03:55.550> another<00:03:55.790> G<00:03:56.030> form<00:03:56.360> 2<00:03:56.660> 3

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
so you can just play another G form 2 3

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.020 
so you can just play another G form 2 3
4<00:03:58.420> so<00:03:59.420> that's<00:03:59.620> lesson<00:04:00.620> one<00:04:00.770> let's<00:04:01.760> just<00:04:01.940> do

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
4 so that's lesson one let's just do

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:10.300 
4 so that's lesson one let's just do
that<00:04:02.120> once<00:04:02.330> more<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.260> 1<00:04:04.220> 2<00:04:04.880> 3<00:04:05.170> 4<00:04:06.170> 2<00:04:06.800> 2<00:04:07.459> 3<00:04:07.490> 4<00:04:08.300> 3<00:04:09.040> 2<00:04:10.040> 3

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
that once more so 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 3 2 3

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:22.870 
that once more so 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 3 2 3
4<00:04:10.910> 4<00:04:11.570> 2<00:04:12.560> 3<00:04:12.850> 4<00:04:13.850> 1<00:04:14.450> 2<00:04:15.110> 3<00:04:15.140> 4<00:04:15.850> 2<00:04:16.850> 2<00:04:17.480> 3<00:04:17.739> 4<00:04:18.739> 1<00:04:19.340> 2<00:04:19.609> 3<00:04:20.510> 4<00:04:21.140> 1<00:04:21.709> 2<00:04:22.010> 3

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
4 4 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.420 
4 4 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3
4<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:25.250> that's<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.490> idea<00:04:26.560> with<00:04:27.560> this<00:04:28.100> whole

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
4 so that's the idea with this whole

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.210 
4 so that's the idea with this whole
pack<00:04:28.870> why<00:04:29.870> not<00:04:30.050> go<00:04:30.230> and<00:04:30.410> grab<00:04:30.590> some<00:04:30.620> chord

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
pack why not go and grab some chord

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.190 
pack why not go and grab some chord
charts<00:04:31.640> go<00:04:31.940> on<00:04:32.090> find<00:04:32.330> some<00:04:32.450> tunes<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:32.990> have

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
charts go on find some tunes that have

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.110 
charts go on find some tunes that have
progressions<00:04:33.680> like<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.490> actually

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
progressions like this and actually

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.880 
progressions like this and actually
apply<00:04:35.690> what<00:04:36.020> we're<00:04:36.169> doing<00:04:36.380> in<00:04:36.470> this<00:04:36.560> lesson

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
apply what we're doing in this lesson

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.740 
apply what we're doing in this lesson
because<00:04:36.980> that<00:04:37.310> is<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.910> really<00:04:38.000> simple<00:04:38.450> concept

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
because that is a really simple concept

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.720 
because that is a really simple concept
and<00:04:39.680> if<00:04:40.430> in<00:04:40.700> particular<00:04:41.000> you're<00:04:41.570> very<00:04:41.900> new<00:04:42.260> to

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
and if in particular you're very new to

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.950 
and if in particular you're very new to
finding<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:43.790> notes<00:04:43.910> on<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.180> piano<00:04:44.390> quickly

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
finding the notes on the piano quickly

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.320 
finding the notes on the piano quickly
then<00:04:45.320> this<00:04:45.470> can<00:04:45.650> be<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.770> great<00:04:46.010> way<00:04:46.160> just<00:04:46.330> you

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
then this can be a great way just you

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.610 
then this can be a great way just you
know<00:04:47.419> grabbing<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.810> chart<00:04:48.050> up<00:04:48.169> and<00:04:48.350> trying<00:04:48.530> to

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
know grabbing a chart up and trying to

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.000 
know grabbing a chart up and trying to
get<00:04:48.740> through<00:04:48.919> it<00:04:48.950> really<00:04:49.130> quickly<00:04:49.540> of<00:04:50.540> course

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
get through it really quickly of course

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.980 
get through it really quickly of course
many<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.070> you<00:04:52.250> will<00:04:52.520> find<00:04:52.790> this<00:04:53.419> particularly

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
many of you will find this particularly

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.140 
many of you will find this particularly
easy<00:04:54.260> so<00:04:54.620> of<00:04:55.160> course<00:04:55.340> feel<00:04:55.610> free<00:04:55.640> to<00:04:55.850> move<00:04:56.030> on

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
easy so of course feel free to move on

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.620 
easy so of course feel free to move on
to<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.390> next<00:04:56.510> lesson<00:04:57.070> but<00:04:58.070> that's<00:04:58.310> probably

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
to the next lesson but that's probably

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.270 
to the next lesson but that's probably
the<00:04:59.630> most<00:05:00.080> important<00:05:00.590> thing<00:05:00.620> we<00:05:00.890> can<00:05:01.010> start

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
the most important thing we can start

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.620 
the most important thing we can start
off<00:05:01.370> with<00:05:01.630> so<00:05:03.790> let's<00:05:04.790> leave<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.030> right<00:05:05.570> there

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
off with so let's leave it right there

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.840 
off with so let's leave it right there
and<00:05:06.020> we'll<00:05:07.010> see<00:05:07.160> you<00:05:07.250> in<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.460> next<00:05:07.640> video

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
and we'll see you in the next video

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.490 
and we'll see you in the next video
lesson<00:05:08.090> when<00:05:08.419> we<00:05:08.450> start<00:05:08.750> getting<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:09.080> little

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
lesson when we start getting a little

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.930 
lesson when we start getting a little
bit<00:05:09.740> more<00:05:09.919> advanced<00:05:10.850> than<00:05:10.970> that

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.000
