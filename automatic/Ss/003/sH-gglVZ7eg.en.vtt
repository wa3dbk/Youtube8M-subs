00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
bust this is actually the one I picked

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.100 
bust this is actually the one I picked
that's<00:04:46.830> like<00:04:47.100> it's<00:04:47.790> good<00:04:48.060> condition<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:48.750> got

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
that's like it's good condition I got

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.830 
that's like it's good condition I got
for<00:04:49.290> ten<00:04:49.470> dollars<00:04:49.620> but<00:04:50.240> obviously<00:04:51.240> with<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.660> L

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
for ten dollars but obviously with the L

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.050 
for ten dollars but obviously with the L
on<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.560> ribbon<00:04:52.770> which<00:04:53.100> is<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.280> variety<00:04:53.850> it's

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
on the ribbon which is the variety it's

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.000 
on the ribbon which is the variety it's
worth<00:04:54.330> maybe<00:04:54.720> two<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.350> half<00:04:55.470> three<00:04:55.650> times

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
worth maybe two and a half three times

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.990 
worth maybe two and a half three times
that<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.800> other<00:04:58.830> diagnostic<00:04:59.790> that<00:04:59.880> I'm

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000
