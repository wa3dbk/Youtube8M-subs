00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
know they're always kind of one batch of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.819 
know they're always kind of one batch of
service<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.720> gonna<00:01:48.869> kind<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
service so it's just gonna kind of be to

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.920 
service so it's just gonna kind of be to
go<00:01:49.950> over<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> same<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.460> worldwide<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.360> yeah

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
go over the same time worldwide but yeah

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
go over the same time worldwide but yeah
let<00:01:52.110> me<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.439> obviously<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.860> you're

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
let me know because obviously if you're

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.840 
let me know because obviously if you're
in<00:01:53.070> different<00:01:53.280> country<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:53.820> of

works<00:01:54.060> differently<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:55.079> maybe<00:01:55.290> it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
works differently to you then maybe it's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.780 
works differently to you then maybe it's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
it's supposed to affect the handling of

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.290 
it's supposed to affect the handling of
your<00:02:14.560> car<00:02:14.740> now<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.280> could<00:02:15.460> just<00:02:15.610> be<00:02:15.700> because<00:02:16.120> I

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
your car now it could just be because I

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.880 
your car now it could just be because I
had<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> really<00:02:16.660> good<00:02:16.810> car<00:02:17.050> which<00:02:17.620> handles

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
had a really good car which handles

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.380 
had a really good car which handles
really<00:02:17.980> well<00:02:18.070> ignore<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.030> fact<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.240> it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
really well ignore the fact that it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.580 
really well ignore the fact that it
looks<00:02:19.420> pretty<00:02:19.660> wrecked<00:02:19.960> in<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.200> footage<00:02:20.440> or

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
looks pretty wrecked in the footage or

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.590 
looks pretty wrecked in the footage or
seen<00:02:20.740> but<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.880> car<00:02:22.060> handles<00:02:22.390> really<00:02:22.510> well

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
seen but that car handles really well

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.090 
seen but that car handles really well
ordinarily<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.320> I<00:02:23.350> wonder<00:02:23.680> whether<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:23.860> just

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
ordinarily so I wonder whether it just

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.130 
ordinarily so I wonder whether it just
handles<00:02:24.190> really<00:02:24.430> won't<00:02:24.610> smoke<00:02:24.940> um<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:26.080> fact

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
handles really won't smoke um in fact

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.540 
handles really won't smoke um in fact

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
it's only real quick one you know

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.650 
it's only real quick one you know
because<00:03:21.130> don't<00:03:21.550> necessarily<00:03:22.060> need<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.300> hold

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
because don't necessarily need to hold

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.450 
because don't necessarily need to hold
them<00:03:22.750> up<00:03:22.990> I<00:03:23.170> mean<00:03:23.350> because<00:03:23.440> that's<00:03:23.950> me<00:03:24.160> down<00:03:24.340> to

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
them up I mean because that's me down to

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.340 
them up I mean because that's me down to
you<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.730> explore<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.840> most<00:03:25.990> part<00:03:26.230> is

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
you to explore but the most part is

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.050 
you to explore but the most part is
covered<00:03:26.740> in<00:03:26.800> snow<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.490> if<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:27.610> go<00:03:27.730> check<00:03:27.940> out

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
covered in snow so if you go check out

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.000 
covered in snow so if you go check out
now<00:03:28.270> it<00:03:28.510> does<00:03:28.690> look<00:03:28.720> really<00:03:29.080> cool<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.560> don't

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
now it does look really cool I don't

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.860 
now it does look really cool I don't
know<00:03:30.310> exactly<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.700> think<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.150> think<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.720> vaguely

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
know exactly I think I think I vaguely

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.390 
know exactly I think I think I vaguely
remember<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:32.920> they're<00:03:33.040> saying<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.310> is

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
remember and they're saying this is

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.440 
remember and they're saying this is
gonna<00:03:33.490> run<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.820> bout<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> fifth<00:03:34.360> of

window<00:03:36.490> in<00:03:36.610> general<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.000> i<00:03:37.060> don't<00:03:37.300> know<00:03:37.450> if

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
window in general so i don't know if

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.210 
window in general so i don't know if
that's<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.990> snow<00:03:38.230> itself<00:03:38.590> or<00:03:38.800> whether<00:03:38.950> that's

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
that's the snow itself or whether that's

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.390 
that's the snow itself or whether that's
just<00:03:39.520> go<00:03:39.880> christmas<00:03:40.540> items<00:03:40.800> so<00:03:41.800> if<00:03:42.070> I<00:03:42.160> when<00:03:42.370> I
