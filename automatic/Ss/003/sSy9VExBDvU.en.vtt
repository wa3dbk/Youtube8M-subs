under<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> potato<00:02:13.020> clear<00:02:13.380> plastic<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:15.480> see

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
under the potato clear plastic you see

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.350 
under the potato clear plastic you see
got<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> glossy<00:02:16.380> finish<00:02:16.530> under<00:02:17.010> there<00:02:20.360> just

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
got a glossy finish under there just

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.570 
got a glossy finish under there just
look<00:02:21.450> at<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.630> back<00:02:21.830> nothing<00:02:22.830> too<00:02:23.070> special<00:02:23.310> they

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
look at it back nothing too special they

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.920 
look at it back nothing too special they
just<00:02:23.940> got<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.210> circuit<00:02:25.140> board<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:26.010> PCIe<00:02:26.930> x16

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
just got the circuit board the PCIe x16

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.640 
just got the circuit board the PCIe x16
slot<00:02:28.470> believe<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.130> it's<00:02:29.340> PCI<00:02:29.730> Express<00:02:30.030> 3<00:02:30.650> but

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
slot believe it it's PCI Express 3 but

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.010 
slot believe it it's PCI Express 3 but
it<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.860> backwardly<00:02:32.280> compatible<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:33.120> PCI

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
it is backwardly compatible with PCI

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.570 
it is backwardly compatible with PCI
Express<00:02:34.320> -<00:02:35.240> there's<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.300> front<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.720> there

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
Express - there's a front of it there

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.740 
Express - there's a front of it there
well<00:02:38.580> here<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:38.850> installed<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.540> case

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
well here it is installed in the case

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.630 
well here it is installed in the case
now<00:02:40.080> could<00:02:40.290> only<00:02:40.410> use<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.040> brackets

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
now could only use one of the brackets

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.180 
now could only use one of the brackets
there<00:02:41.940> because<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:43.020> use<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> next<00:02:43.500> one

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
there because if I use the next one

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.820 
there because if I use the next one
it<00:02:44.490> means<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.570> VGA<00:02:46.050> plug<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.710> have

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
it means the VGA plug would have

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.830 
it means the VGA plug would have
conflicted<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> plastic<00:02:47.880> cover<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.630> that

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
conflicted the plastic cover and that

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.690 
conflicted the plastic cover and that
would<00:02:48.990> have<00:02:49.080> been<00:02:49.200> no<00:02:49.350> good<00:02:49.620> however<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.520> did

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
would have been no good however I did

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.760 
would have been no good however I did
most<00:02:50.880> bolt<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.420> one<00:02:51.780> screw<00:02:52.290> down<00:02:52.500> there

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
most bolt it in one screw down there

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.850 
most bolt it in one screw down there
just<00:02:53.430> hold<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.820> cover<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.180> place<00:02:54.710> watch<00:02:55.710> on

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
just hold the cover in place watch on

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.510 
just hold the cover in place watch on
this<00:02:55.980> case<00:02:56.280> as<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:57.510> VGA<00:02:57.930> port<00:02:57.990> just<00:02:58.860> at<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> side

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
this case as a VGA port just at the side

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.280 
this case as a VGA port just at the side
here<00:02:59.550> there's<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.330> cutout<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.960> VGA<00:03:01.260> port

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
here there's a cutout for a VGA port

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.770 
here there's a cutout for a VGA port
just<00:03:01.740> at<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.920> side<00:03:02.130> here<00:03:02.480> not<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.630> I'm<00:03:03.690> ever

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
just at the side here not that I'm ever

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.810 
just at the side here not that I'm ever
gonna<00:03:03.900> use<00:03:04.020> VJ<00:03:04.620> anyway<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.310> could<00:03:05.730> have

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
gonna use VJ anyway so I could have

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.220 
gonna use VJ anyway so I could have
actually<00:03:06.060> left<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.480> dangling<00:03:06.810> inside<00:03:07.020> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
actually left it dangling inside the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.110 
actually left it dangling inside the
case<00:03:07.440> ok<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.280> hope<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.730> for<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.940> sake<00:03:09.090> of

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
case ok I hope you for the sake of

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.640 
case ok I hope you for the sake of
neatness<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:10.050> could<00:03:10.260> get<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.440> nice<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
neatness in here could get it nice and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.070 
neatness in here could get it nice and
tidy<00:03:11.030> there<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.210> we're<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.540> looking<00:03:12.780> down<00:03:12.900> on

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
tidy there is we're just looking down on

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.240 
tidy there is we're just looking down on
the<00:03:13.170> case<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.410> not<00:03:16.590> much<00:03:16.710> more<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.100> say

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
in the XBMC and this is built on a bun -

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.370 
in the XBMC and this is built on a bun -
12.04<00:03:27.000> as<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.450> mentioned<00:03:27.810> earlier<00:03:28.050> I've<00:03:28.110> had<00:03:28.260> to

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
12.04 as I mentioned earlier I've had to

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.100 
12.04 as I mentioned earlier I've had to
update<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:29.010> kernel<00:03:29.520> and<00:03:29.990> Nvidia<00:03:30.990> graphics

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
update the kernel and Nvidia graphics

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.810 
update the kernel and Nvidia graphics

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
card they see Dolby true HD yeah so I

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.190 
card they see Dolby true HD yeah so I
play<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.240> yeah<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:36.960> resumed<00:03:39.110> see<00:03:40.110> the

play it yeah just resumed see the
picture<00:03:40.500> there<00:03:40.680> looks<00:03:41.610> absolutely<00:03:42.060> fine<00:03:42.360> not

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
picture there looks absolutely fine not

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.210 
picture there looks absolutely fine not
sure<00:03:43.230> how<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.470> come<00:03:43.650> out<00:03:43.770> on<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.100> video<00:03:44.190> though

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
sure how it come out on the video though

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.590 
sure how it come out on the video though
just<00:03:47.220> give<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.490> head<00:03:47.610> a<00:03:47.640> bit<00:03:47.850> there<00:03:48.030> yeah

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
just give it a head a bit there yeah

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.680 
just give it a head a bit there yeah
absolutely<00:03:48.960> crystal-clear<00:03:50.360> now<00:03:51.360> if<00:03:51.420> we<00:03:51.540> look

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
absolutely crystal-clear now if we look

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.740 
absolutely crystal-clear now if we look
down<00:03:51.960> at<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.380> amplifier<00:03:53.270> just<00:03:54.270> zoom<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.630> on

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
down at the amplifier just zoom in on

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.730 
down at the amplifier just zoom in on
that<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:56.040> see<00:03:56.280> true<00:03:57.030> HD<00:03:57.170> there<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.230> go<00:03:58.410> true

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
that and see true HD there you go true

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.870 
that and see true HD there you go true
HD<00:03:58.980> output<00:03:59.550> in<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.910> NEX<00:04:00.090> in<00:04:00.480> XBMC<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:02.550> so<00:04:02.760> that

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
HD output in the NEX in XBMC and so that

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.570 
HD output in the NEX in XBMC and so that
was<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.120> pilot<00:04:03.450> Nvidia<00:04:03.960> GT<00:04:04.260> 640<00:04:05.130> which<00:04:05.400> are

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
was the pilot Nvidia GT 640 which are

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.600 
was the pilot Nvidia GT 640 which are
bought<00:04:05.760> from<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.300> buyer<00:04:06.980> so<00:04:07.980> fixed<00:04:08.280> watching

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
bought from a buyer so fixed watching

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.390 
bought from a buyer so fixed watching
see<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.209> later
