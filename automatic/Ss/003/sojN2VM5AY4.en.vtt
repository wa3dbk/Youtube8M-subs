00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
appearance Siberian tigers that I've

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.840 
appearance Siberian tigers that I've
ever<00:01:55.350> seen<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.860> she's<00:01:56.009> been<00:01:56.160> declawed<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
ever seen and she's been declawed and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.570 
ever seen and she's been declawed and
spayed<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.450> she's<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.140> not<00:01:58.320> much<00:01:58.560> value<00:01:59.009> for

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
spayed so she's of not much value for

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.070 
spayed so she's of not much value for
the<00:01:59.640> breeder<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:00.210> don't<00:02:00.390> want<00:02:00.600> her<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
the breeder so they don't want her and

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.219 
the breeder so they don't want her and
basically<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:03.060> puts<00:02:03.300> Fish<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.630> Wildlife<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
basically it puts Fish and Wildlife in a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.870 
basically it puts Fish and Wildlife in a
position<00:02:04.500> where<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.920> Tiger<00:02:05.310> has<00:02:05.460> nowhere<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
position where this Tiger has nowhere to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
position where this Tiger has nowhere to
go<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.960> no<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.410> will<00:02:07.560> take

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
go and they have no one that will take

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
go and they have no one that will take
it<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:09.239> only<00:02:09.360> thing<00:02:09.450> they<00:02:09.630> can<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it so the only thing they can do is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.800 
it so the only thing they can do is
euthanize<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:12.180> know<00:02:12.299> it's<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
euthanize it and it's you know it's a

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.300 
euthanize it and it's you know it's a
lot<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:12.989> money<00:02:13.080> she's<00:02:13.380> only<00:02:13.530> six<00:02:13.769> years<00:02:13.830> old<00:02:14.130> so

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
lot of money she's only six years old so

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.690 
lot of money she's only six years old so
we're<00:02:14.430> looking<00:02:14.549> at<00:02:14.760> probably<00:02:15.000> 14<00:02:15.510> 15<00:02:15.900> years<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
we're looking at probably 14 15 years of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.660

you know it's people that meant well in

first<00:02:35.500> time<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:36.459> was<00:02:36.519> straining<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.360> climb<00:02:37.989> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
first time it was straining to climb the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.140 
first time it was straining to climb the
chain<00:02:38.440> link<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.890> look<00:02:39.129> outside<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.819> actually

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
chain link to look outside and actually

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.479 
chain link to look outside and actually
get<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.299> glimpse<00:02:40.629> of<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.930> outside<00:02:41.200> world<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.860> it

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
get a glimpse of the outside world so it

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.789 
get a glimpse of the outside world so it
would<00:02:42.640> be<00:02:42.760> awesome<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.409> give<00:02:44.409> this<00:02:44.530> girl<00:02:44.709> a

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
would be awesome to give this girl a

would be awesome to give this girl a
good<00:02:44.980> life<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:45.760> can<00:02:45.970> has<00:02:46.120> never<00:02:46.299> had<00:02:46.569> like

good life so this can has never had like

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.660 
good life so this can has never had like
I<00:02:47.019> mean<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.620> past<00:02:47.650> three<00:02:48.190> years<00:02:48.220> like

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
I mean in the past three years like

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.059 
I mean in the past three years like
fresh<00:02:49.030> air<00:02:50.069> no<00:02:52.019> not<00:02:53.019> at<00:02:53.200> all<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.590> before<00:02:53.799> that

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
fresh air no not at all and before that

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.330 
fresh air no not at all and before that
she<00:02:54.310> only<00:02:54.940> went<00:02:55.239> outside<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> leash<00:02:56.079> so<00:02:56.980> it's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
she only went outside on a leash so it's

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.949 
she only went outside on a leash so it's
not<00:02:57.489> like<00:02:57.940> she<00:02:58.120> ever<00:02:58.360> had<00:02:58.659> an<00:02:58.780> outdoor

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
not like she ever had an outdoor

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.199 
not like she ever had an outdoor
enclosure<00:02:59.530> or<00:02:59.709> that<00:02:59.980> she<00:03:00.129> ever<00:03:00.159> got<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.910> swim

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
enclosure or that she ever got to swim

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.660 
enclosure or that she ever got to swim
and<00:03:01.629> run<00:03:02.319> on<00:03:02.530> grass<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.040> have<00:03:03.160> any<00:03:03.340> sort<00:03:03.579> of

and run on grass and have any sort of

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.809 
and run on grass and have any sort of
life<00:03:03.849> so<00:03:04.150> it's<00:03:04.690> essentially<00:03:05.519> this<00:03:06.519> has<00:03:06.700> been

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
life so it's essentially this has been

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.539 
life so it's essentially this has been
it<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.000> her<00:03:07.620> but<00:03:08.620> she's<00:03:08.769> huge<00:03:09.040> she's<00:03:09.129> about
