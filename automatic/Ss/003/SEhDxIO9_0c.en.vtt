run around and died and I mean I

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.019 
run around and died and I mean I

however<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:37.110> game<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.610> no<00:00:38.760> particular

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
however this game just for no particular

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.479 
however this game just for no particular
reason<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.660> decided<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.260> was<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> use

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
reason I decided I was just going to use

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.750 
reason I decided I was just going to use
my<00:00:41.520> lmg<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.739> camp<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:43.950> here<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.489> head

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
my lmg and camp right here on this head

glitch<00:00:45.530> now<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.250> know<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> head

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
glitch now if you don't know what a head

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.000 
glitch now if you don't know what a head
glitch<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.149> basically<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.079> an<00:00:49.260> area<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
glitch is basically it's an area that

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.639 
glitch is basically it's an area that
you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.670> either<00:00:50.789> crouch<00:00:51.210> behind<00:00:51.239> or<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.500> I'm

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you can either crouch behind or like I'm

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
you can either crouch behind or like I'm
doing<00:00:52.980> stand<00:00:53.340> behind<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.059> basically<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
doing stand behind and basically the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.580 
doing stand behind and basically the
enemy<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.649> only<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.219> your<00:00:56.370> head<00:00:57.109> and<00:00:58.109> because

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
enemy can only see your head and because

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.930 
enemy can only see your head and because
your<00:00:59.070> gun<00:00:59.550> fires<00:01:00.059> actually<00:01:00.600> from<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.500> head

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
your gun fires actually from your head

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.549 
your gun fires actually from your head
instead<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> end<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> gun<00:01:04.140> you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
instead of out of the end of the gun you

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.760 
instead of out of the end of the gun you
can<00:01:04.680> actually<00:01:04.890> shoot<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.420> enemy<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:07.619> your

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
can actually shoot the enemy from your

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.240 
can actually shoot the enemy from your
head<00:01:07.920> level<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.740> pretty<00:01:10.740> much<00:01:10.799> not

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
head level and they can pretty much not

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
head level and they can pretty much not
hit<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.049> unless<00:01:13.049> they've<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.439> some

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
hit you unless they've got some

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
hit you unless they've got some
seriously<00:01:14.280> good<00:01:14.400> aim<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.780> can

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
seriously good aim but because you can

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.469 
seriously good aim but because you can
see<00:01:16.080> their<00:01:16.259> entire<00:01:16.590> body<00:01:17.150> you<00:01:18.150> pretty<00:01:18.390> much

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
see their entire body you pretty much

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.070 
see their entire body you pretty much
kill<00:01:18.900> everybody<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.729> that's<00:01:20.729> that's<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.600> big

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
kill everybody and that's that's a big

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080 
kill everybody and that's that's a big
advantage<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.770> camping<00:01:23.340> at<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> head<00:01:23.850> glitch

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
advantage of camping at a head glitch

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.740 
advantage of camping at a head glitch
and<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.979> map<00:01:26.250> raid<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.880> backed

and this one on this map raid is backed

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.840 
and this one on this map raid is backed
into<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.229> corner<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.920> because<00:01:29.490> i<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
into this corner and because i have a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090 
into this corner and because i have a
few<00:01:30.180> teammates<00:01:30.630> who<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.500> happen<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.829> join

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
few teammates who I just happen to join

few teammates who I just happen to join
this<00:01:32.280> Lobby<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.119> were<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.390> campers

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
this Lobby and they were all campers

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.560 
this Lobby and they were all campers
they<00:01:34.799> were<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.100> camping<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:35.970> middle<00:01:36.329> here

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
they were all camping in the middle here

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.140 
they were all camping in the middle here
and<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.650> guy<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:38.070> camping<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.549> me<00:01:38.880> for

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and this one guy was camping with me for

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.969 
and this one guy was camping with me for
no<00:01:39.329> particular<00:01:39.570> reason<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.350> most<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
no particular reason for most of the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.399 
no particular reason for most of the
game<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.820> guess<00:01:42.420> he<00:01:42.570> was<00:01:42.689> trying<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> steal<00:01:43.170> some

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
game I guess he was trying to steal some

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.010 
game I guess he was trying to steal some
kills<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:43.770> something<00:01:44.100> who<00:01:44.189> knows<00:01:44.689> but<00:01:45.689> anyway

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
kills or something who knows but anyway

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.710 
kills or something who knows but anyway
guys<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.229> wanted<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.770> show<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.850> how<00:01:47.970> easy<00:01:48.420> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
guys I wanted to show just how easy it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.550 
guys I wanted to show just how easy it
is<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.640> find<00:01:50.640> an<00:01:50.820> area<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.840> mean<00:01:52.500> this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
is to find an area like this I mean this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.740 
is to find an area like this I mean this
is<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.100> even<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.119> good<00:01:54.299> head<00:01:54.509> glitch

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
is not even a really good head glitch

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.109 
is not even a really good head glitch
here<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> mean<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.860> exposing<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.610> much<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.969> my

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
here I mean it's exposing so much of my

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.539 
here I mean it's exposing so much of my
body<00:01:57.360> when<00:01:57.719> there's<00:01:58.469> there's<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.250> head

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
body when there's there's a head

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.880 
body when there's there's a head
glitches<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.210> grind<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.140> example<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
glitches on grind for example that you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.530 
glitches on grind for example that you
can<00:02:02.040> only<00:02:02.189> see<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> very<00:02:02.939> tip<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> your

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
can only see like the very tip of your

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.929 
can only see like the very tip of your
head<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.020> mean<00:02:04.560> those<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.040> god<00:02:05.340> mode<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
head I mean those are like god mode and
