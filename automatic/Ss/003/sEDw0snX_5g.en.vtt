I'm<00:00:07.710> currently<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.280> believe<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.940> fifth<00:00:09.690> string

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
I'm currently I believe a fifth string

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.919 
I'm currently I believe a fifth string
wide<00:00:10.590> receiver<00:00:11.070> right<00:00:11.340> now<00:00:11.660> the<00:00:12.660> only<00:00:12.809> good

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
wide receiver right now the only good

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.200 
wide receiver right now the only good
thing<00:00:13.110> about<00:00:13.139> wide<00:00:13.500> receiver<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.519> even

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
thing about wide receiver is that even

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.490 
thing about wide receiver is that even
if<00:00:15.299> you're<00:00:15.420> not<00:00:15.540> first<00:00:15.870> string<00:00:16.199> there's

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
if you're not first string there's

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.590 
if you're not first string there's
certainly<00:00:17.100> opportunities<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:18.180> get<00:00:18.330> playing

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
certainly opportunities to get playing

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900 
certainly opportunities to get playing
time<00:00:18.720> at<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.740> wide<00:00:19.890> receiver<00:00:20.250> position<00:00:20.340> just

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
time at the wide receiver position just

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.120 
time at the wide receiver position just
because<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:22.050> lot<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.230> sets<00:00:22.590> there's<00:00:22.859> three

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
because in a lot of sets there's three

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.859 
because in a lot of sets there's three
four<00:00:23.430> sometimes<00:00:24.000> even<00:00:24.300> five<00:00:24.570> wide<00:00:24.840> receivers

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
playing time so that's one nice thing

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
episode I have a hard time sometimes in

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.330 
episode I have a hard time sometimes in
these<00:01:11.010> position<00:01:11.790> battles<00:01:13.070> there's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> few

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
these position battles there's a few

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.310 
these position battles there's a few
reasons<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.479> I've<00:01:15.659> been<00:01:16.049> able<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
reasons for that that I've been able to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.910 
reasons for that that I've been able to
find<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.070> figure<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:18.740> Michigan<00:01:19.740> has

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
find out or figure out one Michigan has

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.530 
find out or figure out one Michigan has
a<00:01:19.950> running<00:01:20.310> quarterback<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.090> there's<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.330> lot

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
a running quarterback so there's a lot

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.080 
a running quarterback so there's a lot
of<00:01:21.659> times<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.049> these<00:01:22.200> practices<00:01:22.409> where<00:01:23.090> even

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
of times in these practices where even

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.450 
of times in these practices where even
if<00:01:24.180> I'm<00:01:24.330> open<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.470> quarterback<00:01:26.040> will<00:01:26.280> take

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
if I'm open the quarterback will take

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.210 
if I'm open the quarterback will take
off<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.820> run<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.049> limits<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> amount<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
off and run so that limits the amount of

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.770 
off and run so that limits the amount of
times<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.790> catch<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.270> ball<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
times that I can catch the ball and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.050 
times that I can catch the ball and
secondly<00:01:31.740> they<00:01:32.009> put<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.400> bad<00:01:32.610> positions

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
secondly they put you in bad positions

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.990 
secondly they put you in bad positions
sometimes<00:01:33.270> with<00:01:33.720> some<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.790> routes

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
sometimes with some of the the routes

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.230 
sometimes with some of the the routes
that<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.360> ask<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.810> run<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.210> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that they ask you to run so it's one of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.210 
that they ask you to run so it's one of
those<00:01:39.360> things<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.900> failed<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.770> row<00:01:40.950> right

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
those things I failed two in a row right

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.429 
those things I failed two in a row right
there<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.790> you'll<00:01:42.540> see<00:01:42.780> me<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.110> little<00:01:43.320> bit

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
there and you'll see me in a little bit

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
there and you'll see me in a little bit
later<00:01:43.649> I'll<00:01:43.860> fail<00:01:44.159> another<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.759> but

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
later I'll fail another one but

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.179 
later I'll fail another one but
fortunately<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.140> me<00:01:46.380> once<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:46.950> into

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
fortunately for me once you get into

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.179 
fortunately for me once you get into
those<00:01:47.310> position<00:01:48.000> type<00:01:48.210> battles<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.920> seems

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
those position type battles it seems

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.469 
those position type battles it seems
like<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.460> start<00:01:50.729> getting<00:01:50.970> more<00:01:51.000> playing<00:01:51.360> time

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
like you start getting more playing time

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.230 
like you start getting more playing time
like<00:01:52.110> you're<00:01:52.439> almost<00:01:52.590> at<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.579> third<00:01:53.909> string

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
like you're almost at that third string

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.100 
like you're almost at that third string
level<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.320> uh<00:01:55.969> you're<00:01:56.969> still<00:01:57.060> four<00:01:57.509> set<00:01:57.930> as

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
level but uh you're still four set as

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.450 
level but uh you're still four set as
fourth<00:01:58.409> string<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:58.829> you'll<00:01:58.979> start<00:01:59.219> getting

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
fourth string but you'll start getting

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.359 
fourth string but you'll start getting
more<00:02:00.240> opportunities<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:00.960> play<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> field

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
more opportunities to play on the field

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.389 
more opportunities to play on the field
so<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.509> little<00:02:03.689> bit<00:02:03.869> good<00:02:04.409> thing<00:02:05.100> out<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
so that's a little bit good thing out of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.290 
so that's a little bit good thing out of
that<00:02:06.979> one<00:02:07.979> thing<00:02:08.160> too<00:02:08.399> before<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.729> get<00:02:08.910> too<00:02:09.060> far

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that one thing too before I get too far

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.770 
that one thing too before I get too far
into<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:10.250> had<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> file<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.910> was<00:02:12.000> 20<00:02:12.510> gigs

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
into this I had a file that was 20 gigs

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.880 
into this I had a file that was 20 gigs
you<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.230> imagine

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
you can imagine

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.820 
you can imagine
how<00:02:13.980> much<00:02:14.910> playing<00:02:15.300> time<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.600> had<00:02:15.960> on<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.530> file

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
how much playing time I had on that file

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.120 
how much playing time I had on that file
its<00:02:17.670> I'll<00:02:18.630> have<00:02:18.870> one<00:02:19.140> more<00:02:19.170> episode<00:02:19.530> with

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
current like basically at the end of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.410 
current like basically at the end of
this<00:02:22.830> episode<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.310> believe<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.790> played<00:02:24.030> one<00:02:24.209> more

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420

for<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.770> but<00:02:28.770> unfortunately<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.760> 20<00:02:30.150> gig

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
for you but unfortunately the 20 gig

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.040 
for you but unfortunately the 20 gig
file<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.050> was<00:02:31.700> Hall<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> peerage<00:02:33.750> wide

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
file that was Hall of the peerage wide

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.110 
file that was Hall of the peerage wide
receiver<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.980> was<00:02:35.160> probably<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.580> good<00:02:35.610> five<00:02:36.060> or

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.020 
receiver it was probably a good five or
six<00:02:36.300> games<00:02:37.250> somehow<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.459> file<00:02:38.760> got

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
six games somehow that file got

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.770 
six games somehow that file got
corrupted<00:02:39.270> or<00:02:39.810> something<00:02:41.390> when<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.420> moved<00:02:42.660> to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.140 
corrupted or something when I moved to
the<00:02:42.870> new<00:02:42.989> computer<00:02:43.470> it's<00:02:43.860> just<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.550> file<00:02:44.880> it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
the new computer it's just the file it

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.090 
the new computer it's just the file it
just<00:02:45.300> will<00:02:45.480> not<00:02:45.660> open<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.290> Vegas<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.920> won't

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.640 
just will not open in Vegas it won't
open<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.550> play<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.150> don't<00:02:49.080> have<00:02:49.200> any<00:02:49.380> backup

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.790 
open to play it I don't have any backup
of<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.690> unfortunately<00:02:51.690> pretty<00:02:52.290> much<00:02:52.500> my

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
of it so unfortunately pretty much my

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.040 
of it so unfortunately pretty much my
whole<00:02:53.010> first<00:02:53.280> season<00:02:53.760> you're<00:02:54.330> gonna<00:02:54.450> see<00:02:54.750> the

first six or seven games so this episode

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.850 
first six or seven games so this episode
and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.450> believe<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.810> have<00:03:00.959> one<00:03:01.230> more<00:03:01.470> saved

and then I believe I have one more saved
game<00:03:02.130> after<00:03:02.550> this<00:03:02.700> one<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.600> I'll<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.840> able<00:03:03.930> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
throwing to me and I think that all

throwing to me and I think that all
comes<00:04:17.430> down<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.700> once<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:18.720> start<00:04:18.959> getting

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
quarterback has a little bit more

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.260 
quarterback has a little bit more
confidence<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.580> coach<00:04:23.789> has<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> little

thing<00:05:09.569> you<00:05:10.050> could<00:05:10.169> see<00:05:10.440> when<00:05:10.889> I<00:05:10.919> caught<00:05:11.250> my

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
thing you could see when I caught my

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.469 
thing you could see when I caught my
long<00:05:11.729> touchdown<00:05:12.229> he<00:05:13.229> broke<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:14.120> record<00:05:15.120> I

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
long touchdown he broke a record I

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.770 
long touchdown he broke a record I
believe<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:16.020> was<00:05:16.340> touched<00:05:17.340> passes<00:05:18.150> thrown<00:05:18.509> our

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
believe it was touched passes thrown our

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.709 
believe it was touched passes thrown our
touchdown<00:05:19.409> passes<00:05:20.039> in<00:05:20.279> one<00:05:20.699> game<00:05:20.909> I<00:05:21.270> believe

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
touchdown passes in one game I believe

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.890 
touchdown passes in one game I believe
he<00:05:21.810> broke<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.259> as<00:05:22.500> a<00:05:22.529> team<00:05:22.800> record<00:05:23.039> and<00:05:23.900> my

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
he broke that as a team record and my

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.140 
he broke that as a team record and my
long<00:05:25.139> touchdown<00:05:25.710> is<00:05:25.949> what<00:05:26.340> sealed<00:05:26.759> the<00:05:26.939> deal

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
long touchdown is what sealed the deal

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.820 
long touchdown is what sealed the deal
for<00:05:27.419> that<00:05:27.539> one<00:05:27.719> so<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:28.050> course<00:05:28.259> he<00:05:28.409> gets<00:05:28.500> player

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
for that one so of course he gets player

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.119 
for that one so of course he gets player
of<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:28.979> game<00:05:29.009> there<00:05:29.490> six<00:05:29.849> total<00:05:30.150> touchdowns

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129

yes<00:05:32.129> at<00:05:32.310> 13<00:05:32.789> carries<00:05:33.120> so<00:05:33.569> you<00:05:33.629> can<00:05:33.900> see<00:05:34.139> having

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
yes at 13 carries so you can see having

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.950
