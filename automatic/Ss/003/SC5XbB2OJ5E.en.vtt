00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
of nonstick tin it's an all butter

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.449 
of nonstick tin it's an all butter
pastry<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.560> we've<00:02:44.709> got<00:02:44.830> butter<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.190> there<00:02:45.310> so

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
pastry and we've got butter in there so

pastry and we've got butter in there so
there<00:02:45.640> really<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.030> no<00:02:46.300> danger<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.750> them

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
there really is no danger of them

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.850 
there really is no danger of them
