00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.370
 hi everybody demanded it and 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.680
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.840
 multiplayer of call of duty ghosts and 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.760
 this trick is to get out of the map 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.530
 freight online in public games 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.880
 it is very easy to do surely that 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.099
 many of you will already know this 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.600
 trick but I upload it explaining it because 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.670
 many people who do not get stress anymore 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.830
 so I'm going to try to explain the best 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.570
 possible way and also attacks zones 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.940
 inaccessible where you can go 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.619
 ok and you also have some that 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.550
 I was discovering on my part that we 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.319
 I will teach what and tell you that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.909
 you may have seen this video 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:38.800
 Well, in another place in other channels, 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:41.440
 I have uploaded it on my secondary channel 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.440
 I got me doing this is the site for 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.149
 Where did I find out? I climbed it on my 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.280
 secondary channel but without explaining I did 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.589
 a compilation of the best jumps 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.449
 so it's good then I 'll leave you 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.769
 served in the description in space of 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.409
 stage and what you have to do is go up 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.769
 by the stairs position sideways 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.839
 sprint spin and jump and continue and 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.519
 keep turning bullet and you see that I put the 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.650
 jump and keep turning is very important 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.390
 doing this is quite complicated it 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.630
 they need a lot of practices if they never 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.060
 you have done this 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.649
 because the truth that very complicated to me 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.420
 I practically go to the first one 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.090
 can do also for the other side of 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.159
 the house in case the passion and one as you see 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.439
 then what we are going to do is go up to 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.869
 train that is quite complicated from 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.880
 station is much bigger bigger and there 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.590
 few people leave you okay I tell you that it is 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.409
 exactly the same we turn a little 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.270
 we ran butt and jumped like 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.710
 You see what we have done is jump 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.149
 more because if we did not do this it's 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.799
 impossible to get here until this 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.569
 barrier and this as I say in 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.069
 public games can be done 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.229
 finally we will make the third straight already 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.849
 As you already know, there is no insertion 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.030
 tactics and to do this I followed 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:48.860
 here you see that he sprung butt turn here 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.950
 you see that I put a pretty big turn and 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.330
 jump as you see I have come very far away 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.939
 because if you do this without doing 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.130
 star it is impossible to arrive as 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.049
 I'm telling you and here to get 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.310
 inside we do not just bend over and 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.920
 we will be so to speak on top of 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.830
 flying building and the truth that is 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.990
 quite handsome not 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.170
 then there is another way that once 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.570
 we are here we can climb in this 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.150
 small platform we jump here 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.610
 we jump again in the next the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.380
 next gate is up here because 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.090
 there are things that jump more or less like 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.350
 I do because if I do not cross over like that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.350
 fence because it has some 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.210
 You can not step directly 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.400
 because there you will see that I am going to jump 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.250
 next you can no longer just me 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.250
 this spot is left and here you can kill 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.420
 through the wall and then this one 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.210
 if I'm telling you what 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.920
 I was discovering for my part 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.320
 doing this trick and now just what 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.210
 what we can do is in one if we 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.430
 we go down to go down simply 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.190
 let's go back we're going to change 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.990
 back our voucher comes in there with that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.400
 let's jump there then we'll fall under the 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.370
 map and we can kill the enemies to 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.530
 through the roof wall at the same time 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.570
 that I'm going to jump I try to go for this 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.310
 edge to see if you could go but I already 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.900
 I noticed that you do not see that very slowly 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.150
 because you can go there but I do not 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.220
 I fall down here we can go by 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.620
 all the map below and the truth that is 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.510
 very handsome so good so I hope that 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.340
 you liked the video if it's like that 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.080
 forget to leave me to light and if you have 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.180
 Any doubt do not forget to leave me your 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.980
 comment and above all do not forget 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.260
 subscribe to my channel so as not to lose 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.650
 future tricks remember to wait in the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.250
 next video here he saluted and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.250
