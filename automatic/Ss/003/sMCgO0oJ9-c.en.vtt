00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.300
 Intel's booth at cebit 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.520
 2013 is one of those rare occasions. 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.110
 when one shot can kill once 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.040
 many many birds with one stone 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.630
 here are all at once 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.390
 existing smartphone models 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.370
 powered by intel processors 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.000
 atom 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.080
 the most certainly big and interesting 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.630
 the gadget with which we already of course 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.140
 met at the mvc exhibition 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.050
 this is lenovo k900 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.570
 Here is such a huge shovel with 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.910
 5.5 gigantic display 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.950
 inches 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.250
 Full hd resolution, it is completely 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.340
 metal is very thin 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.200
 and two gigabytes of RAM in general is real 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.020
 top device as soon as you come to 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.730
 Moscow immediately take it to the test and in all 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.730
 telling you about him 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.010
 on the apparatus 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.890
 further here we have 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.680
 This is just a reference design that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.130
 can be built on a processor base 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.470
 but 2580 on the same processor on 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.320
 which is built long it does not work 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.560
 it's just generally a kind of makkapani 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.900
 can be turned on like this 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.430
 devices based on new processors 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.430
 intel 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.450
 further processor easier 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.909
 saxifrage smartphone trees he 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.630
 appointed for sale in Africa with geniuses 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.869
 yes city is a small gadget 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.630
 display diagonal display inches with 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.290
 processor z 20-20 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.870
 running at 1.3 gigahertz 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.590
 he has only four gigabytes of core 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.980
 memory is not very capacious battery and a half 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.650
 Thousands of me: beer: an hour in general, but such 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.010
 quite a budget machine for the shadow 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.770
 Further, the most cool in my opinion 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.950
 A beautiful gadget that I saw at all 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.600
 lately I love very much 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.840
 motorola smartphones you just 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.489
 look too 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.209
 but not a work of art of course but 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.709
 very very beautiful machine 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.050
 built on an intel processor 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.060
 atom to 480 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.260
 running at 2 gigahertz in his 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.360
 4.3 inch Diana display 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.600
 gigabyte of RAM 8 gigabytes main 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.820
 of memory 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.130
 just handsome freedom on android 404 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.960
 until 41 but someday it is obvious 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.030
 will update anyway this is of course not 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.740
 about Russia because the company motorola 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.670
 in Russia there is no and sale only gray 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.740
 Further 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.350
 sets grand x in a did he 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.950
 same on the basis of naturally intel processors 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.760
 atom 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.220
 but already 2460 processor frequency to the whole 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.110
 10 gigahertz 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.230
 gigabyte of RAM 16 gigabytes main 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.560
 4.3 inch memory diagonal display 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.570
 1024 by 600 resolution 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.750
 will be yes running android of course 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.750
 same 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.680
 Here is such a classic flower 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.629
 ask 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.810
 here is such an apparatus behind the way very much 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.569
 cool ribbed cap it is available a 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.770
 in 10 countries 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:40.310
 from the first of October 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.050
 already 12 years old that is the previous one already 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.940
 screwed up almost half a year sold in 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.070
 austria 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.980
 but this is not all this step is not 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.200
 ends go further 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.110
 Here we have the shops of the sola with which we 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.129
 already were familiar and gases from the gay exhibition 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.129
 and if my memory serves me right 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.980
 so here 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.720
 gadget 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.360
 pressure android 2.3 unfortunately though 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.190
 very strange because 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.170
 she's not quite worth it yet 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.579
 maybe 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:21.250
 yes 404 of course though on the sheet with 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.980
 information is written that it is 2.3 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.450
 So yaga on display 4 inches resolution 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.160
 thousand 24,600 is naturally atom 24 61 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.610
 as many as 60 gigahertz 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.960
 gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigs 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.220
 main memory 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.390
 here is such 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.900
 bricks 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.710
 I would say what has been done without frills 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.710
 so what to do 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.240
 but 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.970
 what is the most interesting for us 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.990
 the device which is already on sale in networks 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.230
 company megaphone men's megaphone too 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.200
 works for 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.770
 go of course and built on the base 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.870
 processor intel atom 2460 with the same 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.270
 frequency as in the previous few 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.620
 that is one whole ten for hertz 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.620
 besides there is such 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.580
 slightly modified 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.260
 application panel here 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.260
 classic megaphone colors 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.980
 like that to say that everything 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.590
 the devices that I've kept for now 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.870
 on the atom and work pretty fast 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.440
 I wanted a lot of games here already 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.570
 Many real applications are installed but 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.390
 in general somehow 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:48.120
 for gives hope there is at least something 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:53.600
 another is a device for the operator orange 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.600
 sold in france and great britain 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.180
 slightly modified shell android 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.530
 4 0 4 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:05.310
 its display is four inches but in fact 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.860
 In fact, let's compare everything very 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.780
 this is simple 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.780
 two are essentially the same in the phone 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.639
 called differently 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:18.499
 so telling about but earlier i'm not 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:22.360
 I would just tell you a little bit 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:25.129
 About megaphone here side familiar lenovo 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.649
 k800 previous model is also very 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:33.610
 very impressive looks cool on 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:36.039
 back I rather even regret that 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.280
 you left this design because it 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:43.060
 was a bit unusual ladies 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:49.210
 built on a previous intel processor 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:52.210
 atom not 25 82 460 he has one gigabyte 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.020
 RAM and 16 gigabytes of built-in 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.729
 of memory 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.439
 4-inch display and resolution 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:02.860
 1280 by 720 points 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:06.520
 mighty battery enough for 1900 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.590
 milliamp hour and what I want to say 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.600
 not bad that 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.840
 There are many companies in the market 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.860
 producing iron at some point 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.870
 competition 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.560
 there was real competition happened 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:25.540
 only between india and qualcomm 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:28.860
 now having some weight 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.030
 not even some huge weight in the market 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.340
 intel computer systems 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.840
 trying to enter the mobile market as well 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.940
 very nice because it will 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.100
 promote competition in the end 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.440
 account will help users because 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.140
 prices will obviously decrease frequency 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.180
 grow but this device which I 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.600
 nod and we already looked over there that's 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.600
 Christmas tree 

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:54.360
 but we bal. mouth all smartphones based 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:58.600
 intel atom processors 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:02.070
 at ces 2013 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.070
 the guys are interested too
