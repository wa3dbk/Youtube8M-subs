switch

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.780 
switch
now<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.500> switch<00:00:07.799> transfers<00:00:08.400> your<00:00:08.550> power

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
now this switch transfers your power

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.910 
now this switch transfers your power
from<00:00:09.090> your<00:00:09.269> shoreline<00:00:09.599> or<00:00:10.530> from<00:00:10.830> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
from your shoreline or from the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.220 
from your shoreline or from the
generator<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.639> sends<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.599> coach<00:00:12.870> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
generator and sends it to the coach and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.499 
generator and sends it to the coach and
it<00:00:13.530> will<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.920> automatically<00:00:14.610> simply<00:00:15.360> by

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
it will do this automatically simply by

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.269 
it will do this automatically simply by
sensing<00:00:15.929> which<00:00:16.109> line<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.980> which<00:00:17.070> one's

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
sensing which line is on and which one's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.210 
sensing which line is on and which one's
off<00:00:17.609> now<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.420> default<00:00:18.660> mode<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.830> set

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
off now the default mode on this is set

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.939 
off now the default mode on this is set
for<00:00:20.520> your<00:00:20.640> shoreline<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:22.109> anytime<00:00:22.590> there's<00:00:22.800> no

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949
