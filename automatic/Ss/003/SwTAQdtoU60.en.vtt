can<00:01:00.370> reduce<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:01.530> metro<00:01:02.530> pre<00:01:02.769> creek<00:01:03.070> mean<00:01:03.489> yeah

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
can reduce the metro pre creek mean yeah

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.500 
can reduce the metro pre creek mean yeah
so<00:01:05.379> anyways<00:01:06.130> next<00:01:06.790> we<00:01:07.000> want<00:01:07.150> to<00:01:07.180> put<00:01:07.330> in<00:01:07.420> a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
so anyways next we want to put in a

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.160 
so anyways next we want to put in a
couple<00:01:07.660> resistor<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.470> after<00:01:09.370> i'll<00:01:09.700> do<00:01:09.910> this

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
couple resistor so after i'll do this

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.260 
couple resistor so after i'll do this
you<00:01:11.170> want<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.410> put<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:12.040> DC<00:01:12.790> power<00:01:13.000> supply

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
you want to put in a DC power supply

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.090 
you want to put in a DC power supply
which<00:01:13.480> is<00:01:13.630> just<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.930> basic<00:01:14.110> battery<00:01:14.620> you<00:01:14.950> want

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
which is just a basic battery you want

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.790 
which is just a basic battery you want
to<00:01:15.160> change<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> value<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.700> nine<00:01:16.110> obviously<00:01:19.800> as

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
to change the value to nine obviously as

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.270 
to change the value to nine obviously as
well<00:01:21.160> as<00:01:21.490> putting<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:26.020> seven<00:01:26.830> point<00:01:27.160> five

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
well as putting a to seven point five

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
well as putting a to seven point five
K's<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.720> go<00:01:28.840> ahead<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:29.050> go<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.380> resistors

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
K's so go ahead and go to resistors

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.740 
K's so go ahead and go to resistors
basic<00:01:31.930> resistors<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.960> I'm<00:01:34.960> playing<00:01:35.170> 5k<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
basic resistors so I'm playing 5k you

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.100 
basic resistors so I'm playing 5k you
won't<00:01:37.930> put<00:01:38.110> these<00:01:38.290> in<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:40.470> two<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:43.150> was<00:01:43.540> I'm

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
won't put these in one two as was I'm

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.480 
won't put these in one two as was I'm
sorry<00:01:44.430> 330<00:01:45.430> ohm<00:01:45.700> up<00:01:46.380> turn<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.500> 3000<00:01:48.010> my<00:01:48.250> turn

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:23.380 

swimming<00:02:14.270> is<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> 12-game<00:02:21.490> okay<00:02:22.490> so<00:02:23.120> now<00:02:23.240> we're

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
swimming is a 12-game okay so now we're

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.450 
swimming is a 12-game okay so now we're
gonna<00:02:23.480> set<00:02:24.020> these<00:02:24.170> all<00:02:24.380> up<00:02:24.530> say<00:02:24.770> look<00:02:25.010> like<00:02:25.250> the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
gonna set these all up say look like the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.050 
gonna set these all up say look like the
PCB<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.090> didn't<00:02:26.570> know<00:02:26.690> demo<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.610> I'll<00:02:28.820> make<00:02:28.970> them

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
PCB I didn't know demo so I'll make them

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:37.660 
PCB I didn't know demo so I'll make them
like<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.450> something<00:02:29.750> like<00:02:30.020> this

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.680 

okay<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:39.030> should<00:02:39.209> look<00:02:39.330> something<00:02:39.390> like

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
okay so it should look something like

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.160 
okay so it should look something like
this

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.809 
this
so<00:02:40.830> now<00:02:41.010> I'm<00:02:41.099> going<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.280> connect<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.610> parts

just<00:03:29.819> here<00:03:30.620> I'm<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.769> going<00:03:32.010> directly<00:03:32.340> down

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
just here I'm just going directly down

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:43.970 
just here I'm just going directly down
these<00:03:33.799> little<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.100> here<00:03:42.049> unfortunately

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
these little so here unfortunately

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.260 
these little so here unfortunately
can't<00:03:44.160> really<00:03:44.340> simulate<00:03:44.879> the<00:03:45.060> circuit

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
can't really simulate the circuit

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.930 
can't really simulate the circuit
because<00:03:45.660> I'm<00:03:45.780> using<00:03:45.959> transistors<00:03:46.700> yeah<00:03:47.700> I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
because I'm using transistors yeah I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.880 
because I'm using transistors yeah I
don't<00:03:48.330> really<00:03:48.599> want<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:48.989> find<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.440> software

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
don't really want to find a software

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.680 
don't really want to find a software
that<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.190> can<00:03:50.280> almost<00:03:50.550> simulate<00:03:51.330> everything

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
that you can almost simulate everything

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.020 
that you can almost simulate everything
and<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.170> has<00:03:52.319> everything<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.800> need<00:03:52.890> so<00:03:53.310> far

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
and it has everything I need so far

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.520 
and it has everything I need so far
multi-sim<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.660> best<00:03:54.870> kind<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.200> software

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
multi-sim is the best kind of software

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.240 
multi-sim is the best kind of software
I've<00:03:55.680> found<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.129> far

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
I've found so far

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.089 
I've found so far
okay<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.489> you<00:04:00.090> might<00:04:00.239> connect<00:04:00.510> these

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
okay and you might connect these

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.220 
okay and you might connect these
positives<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.819> positive<00:04:03.780> sides<00:04:03.989> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
positives to positive sides the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.449 
positives to positive sides the
capacitors<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:06.060> red<00:04:06.330> line<00:04:06.510> now<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.459> then

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
capacitors this red line now and then

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.990 
capacitors this red line now and then
this<00:04:08.670> one<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:09.480> positive<00:04:11.510> okay<00:04:12.510> oh<00:04:12.690> my<00:04:13.230> sir

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
this one to this positive okay oh my sir

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.930 
this one to this positive okay oh my sir
let's<00:04:15.000> step<00:04:15.320> move<00:04:16.320> these<00:04:16.500> over<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.799> little<00:04:16.979> bit

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.340 

these<00:04:20.940> are<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.180> LEDs<00:04:21.510> at<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.870> bottom<00:04:22.169> by<00:04:22.320> the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
these are the LEDs at the bottom by the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:32.050 
these are the LEDs at the bottom by the
way<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:24.630> gonna<00:04:24.750> connect<00:04:25.590> them<00:04:25.740> like<00:04:25.919> this

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.090 

okay<00:04:33.090> I'm<00:04:33.840> actually<00:04:34.200> going<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.560> move<00:04:34.710> this

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
okay I'm actually going to move this

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.460 
okay I'm actually going to move this
over<00:04:35.430> here<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:39.090> then<00:04:39.450> we<00:04:39.720> wander<00:04:40.110> with<00:04:40.229> these

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
over here and then we wander with these

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.890 
over here and then we wander with these
the<00:04:41.370> other<00:04:41.550> ends<00:04:41.880> of<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.030> transistors<00:04:42.690> you

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
the other ends of the transistors you

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.260 
the other ends of the transistors you
want<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.139> connect<00:04:43.440> them<00:04:43.680> though<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.820> other

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
want to connect them though the other

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.960 
want to connect them though the other
end<00:04:45.479> of<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.660> transistors<00:04:46.290> as<00:04:47.250> well<00:04:47.550> as<00:04:47.729> the

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
end of the transistors as well as the

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.370 
end of the transistors as well as the
negatives<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:49.310> LEDs<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:51.539> negative<00:04:52.050> of

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
negatives of the LEDs to the negative of

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:01.640 
negatives of the LEDs to the negative of
the<00:04:52.500> power<00:04:52.710> supply<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:54.240> do<00:04:54.510> this<00:05:00.020> okay<00:05:01.020> next

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
the power supply and do this okay next

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.580 
the power supply and do this okay next
time<00:05:01.889> we<00:05:02.010> move<00:05:02.190> this<00:05:02.340> time<00:05:02.580> ya<00:05:02.789> know<00:05:05.360> like

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
time we move this time ya know like

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.160 
time we move this time ya know like
straight<00:05:07.130> across<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.150> negative<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:09.020> it's

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
straight across to the negative so it's

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.790 
straight across to the negative so it's
just<00:05:09.260> easier<00:05:11.020> I'm<00:05:12.020> gonna<00:05:12.230> go<00:05:12.440> straight<00:05:12.650> out

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
just easier I'm gonna go straight out

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.560 
just easier I'm gonna go straight out
like<00:05:13.010> that

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
like that

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.600 
like that
and<00:05:14.570> then<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.290> positive<00:05:15.800> goes<00:05:16.100> to<00:05:16.400> where<00:05:16.580> the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
and then the positive goes to where the

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.490 
and then the positive goes to where the
resistors<00:05:17.330> are<00:05:17.480> which<00:05:17.660> is<00:05:17.780> just<00:05:18.050> right<00:05:18.290> here

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
resistors are which is just right here

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.280 
resistors are which is just right here
so<00:05:19.430> this<00:05:19.490> is<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:20.350> Dom<00:05:21.670> led<00:05:22.670> led<00:05:23.660> traffic<00:05:24.080> light

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
so this is a Dom led led traffic light

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.220 
so this is a Dom led led traffic light
