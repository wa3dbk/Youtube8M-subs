00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.790
 Y 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.310
 and she and very good kids and girls 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.250
 that I bring you a trick to make a 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.810
 stage and not leave the frame map and 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.490
 do it individually according 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.470
 the trick is not easy, we'll have to 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.810
 climb up here on this staircase and 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.130
 Jump to this little corner of the house 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.079
 agree 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.180
 the trick because the truth is quite 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.640
 complicated, you have to practice it a lot 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.290
 in private games and is done doing 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.329
 a month they agree here you see the 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.370
 they crash streisand means as per 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.050
 so to say super jump and it's made of 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.120
 do it with slow motion turning the 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.860
 camera to the left and pasting the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.470
 jump according 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.540
 to do this stress basically 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.070
 we will need a scoop control and the one that 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.420
 do without a command is that it is very 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.770
 professional because the truth is that it is 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.050
 very difficult to do without a command 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.640
 scoop and the scoop control is a control 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.440
 modified vale 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.120
 those command sell them over the internet and 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.979
 well those controls basically what 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.620
 they have is the jump button and the button 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.270
 of bending over back then have the 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.920
 back button then it allows us to turn the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.260
 jeaustin while we jump in agreement and 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.140
 so allow us to do the stress now 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.000
 very easily and good 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.770
 we can do this both in games 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.690
 public as in private parties I 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.190
 basically as always I do not like 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.300
 do it in public games because if a 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.090
 I do not like that they do it to me because 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.190
 I do not like to do it to others and 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.770
 well here you are seeing that we can go 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.350
 below the map for the entire map by 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.090
 below and we can go picking up weapons 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.020
 we can go killing the enemies these 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.170
 they are bosc 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.700
 ok they are not real enemies and there you see 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.800
 who caught the gun changed my 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.810
 gun for your weapon we can go catching 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.820
 and we can go killing all the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.280
 world we can also take out the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.259
 Streak is obviously very easily 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.810
 we can go all the way down and 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.100
 the streak so if they are packages of aid 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.800
 or new girl no, we can also 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.360
 stay according to the time of 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.820
 throw a package then throw it in a few 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.320
 cleared areas and the package will be 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.880
 totally our nobody will be able to 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.459
 remove since we want to touch in mind 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.600
 invincible and I also recommend another 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.910
 I forgot to tell 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.739
 principle is not recommended that is 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.870
 it is simply important to be able 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.000
 make them get down here if not 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.180
 we will die when we fall and expose ourselves 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.120
 Advantage of not suffering damages at the time 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.469
 falling from high places now no 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.230
 I remember exactly what that name was called 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.269
 advantage but it is not easy to recognize it 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.890
 and you can simply look for it and get 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.420
 okay, because if we do not put that on 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.489
 then when trying again and again 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.349
 Once we will be dying as it is a 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.500
 difficult trick and it is not to leave us won the 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.909
 first and hit the jump in the house 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.440
 we will die if it does not come out we fall towards 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.810
 down according 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.100
 and well here you see that we can also 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.500
 go taking the packages as I have 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.420
 said before it is quite easy we will take 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.340
 the help packages and here you see me with 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.780
 a government so good and it's worth as 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.070
 I would always like you to comment to see 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.450
