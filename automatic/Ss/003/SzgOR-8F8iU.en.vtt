00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello guys and i want you to see 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.530
 some of my very own nail art 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.029
 quickly 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:16.039
 then this is a very french 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:20.440
 simple with flowers so too 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.440
 these are little flowers in micro-painting 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.660
 this is a butterfly 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.620
 I state that I have not done any 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:39.850
 nor of the base in the gel up is 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:43.700
 simple passion means we say so 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:52.970
 this is a peacock feather I don't know if 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:01:00.130
 you understand these smurfette these are 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.130
 always with pitti gray colors 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:14.000
 hello spank was my first drawing 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:23.350
 in cardboard micro-painting this simple 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.350
 little cupcake with little flowers 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.420
 then this is the dancer 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.470
 and then there are those I prefer of 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.460
 more and have been more difficult here too 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.800
 a little spoiled because it didn't seal me 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.600
 video choice forgotten jack sparrow 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.600
 as you can see they are not stencils 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.000
 that is, one understands very well that they are seen 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.000
 the brush strokes 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.120
 this is the mythical freddie mercury too 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.120
 here the reggello a little ruined 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.670
 this is dedicated I did this in 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.330
 in short, watercolors I don't like 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.330
 lot 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.300
 then there is in my opinion what is me 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.850
 output better 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.290
 I am very proud of this nail art in 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.080
 how well we understand that the raven 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.750
 the mythical brandon lee and my film 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.739
 absolute favorite and wanted 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.440
 reproduce it on type 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:53.180
 here too the line is very well seen 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:58.690
 of the brush for which it is understood that they are 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:07.330
 been made by hand and are not stencils 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:07.330

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:17.120

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:22.130
 for a friend of mine in particular that me 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.330
 he asked her and then in the very art 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.730
 simple and somewhat this technique 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:35.810
 degradÃ© with so much decoration 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:45.200
 even these are the nuances 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:50.360
 been done with micro-painting and that's it 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:56.000

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:59.150
 of cherry blossoms with the inscription with 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.810
 the Japanese character of happiness 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:07.390
