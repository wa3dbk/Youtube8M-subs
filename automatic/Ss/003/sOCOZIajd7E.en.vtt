00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.420
Surely I was,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.360
Not anyone,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.980
Nor anything,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.660
But simply there as

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.600
A phenomenon, there without any meaning.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.160
But some time ago

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.000
I met you,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.680
And together

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.120
We had meaning and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:47.820
A future for the fantasy I was, was born.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.120
The roads we walked together

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.800
The places we visited together

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.340
The things we searched for together

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.180
The things we confirmed together

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.480
Embracing them all to my chest,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:25.320
…I send with them myself, my love.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.080
So then I,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.280
Not anyone,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.800
Nor even myself,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.660
will become “something”.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:30.280
A conviction, that has in itself meaning.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.220
Struck by such shock in my heart

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.980
I could not move, instead

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.580
Unable to clear my emotions

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.440
I gathered them to myself

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.540
Taking form, once again, in this place

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:07.240
-Pouring out myself, my love

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.260
Now, “together”, we will become one,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.040
Hidden within a form of eternity

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.980
So thus, the dream we once dreamed of

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.880
I will grant.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.680
Now, “together”, we will become a world,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:53.280
Sealed within a form of eternity.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:01.620
So thus, into this fantasy being born,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:16.080
I pour myself, my love.
