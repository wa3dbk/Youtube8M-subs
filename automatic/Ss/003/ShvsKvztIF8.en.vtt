00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello friends with you fox and today 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.900
 I would like to tell you about 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.660
 american anti-tank self-propelled gun 7 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.000
 left la t25 in half possess 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.430
 solely by the nature of the transition 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.890
 age if judged by the first 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.260
 look we notice that boyish 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.660
 agility t49 hulka something already 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.090
 starts to leave because our 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.949
 today's hero does not differ high 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 maximum speeds or 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.350
 mobility but with all this woman 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 hulk he has not yet grown well and armor 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.629
 as was not so strictly speaking and not 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.940
 increased and so t25 by 2 personally for 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.610
 I'm completely sweaty sa 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.950
 you want to grit your teeth as soon as possible 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.710
 already turn off and sell by going to 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.379
 next hell circle 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.020
 t28 prototype which actually already 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.420
 much more interesting in that bob hope 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.239
 he has already grown and yes such that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.090
 normal ride and for it he can not but 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.640
 Today, unfortunately, let's talk a T25 on 2 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.330
 first, let's talk about 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.760
 pros 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.340
 very much helps in pumping the fact that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.650
 stock and top option a little between 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.439
 what is the difference between the top gun 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.479
 adds only a little armor penetration 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.729
 and the engine and chassis pretty quickly 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.540
 pumped by the way I advise you to start 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.820
 card 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.250
 it is with the chassis and then from the engine 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.950
 in the client you can see that these two 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.140
 module well, exactly the same but on 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.500
 in fact, they have a big difference in 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.390
 parameters that are not displayed 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.119
 moves t25 in half with top 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.820
 chassis and stock engine much 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.159
 better than the reverse order of study 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.100
 of these two modules, well, and the tower 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.590
 you can leave last there already 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 which is, in principle, comfortable with the second plus 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.030
 is that on goldie 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.909
 it is potential and forgets what phase 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.860
 the commander did not break if other tanks 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.540
 or self-propelled guns usually have a difference in 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.360
 armor penetration between the base armor-piercing 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.030
 and a golden sabot projectile somewhere 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.800
 in 40 50 millimeters then ours today 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.170
 the hero has a difference from 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.210
 eighty eight millimeters masthead 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.070
 a gun and two hundred fifty eight 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.290
 millimeter bar beat me on the seventh 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.570
 tale vali indicator is extremely 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.480
 overestimated it is enough to 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.820
 punch the royal tiger blog and 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.610
 not only in his weak stock tower 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.860
 or you goals in nld and just purely in 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.580
 impudently sending a projectile upper frontal 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.280
 detail 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.950
 but the main disadvantage of this Fri 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.470
 is that developers too 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.680
 critical in my opinion the sole balance 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.900
 weapons on the tower signed understandable 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.250
 the thing is that having a tower is very strong 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.410
 adds comfort 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.380
 use and allows you to expand 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.870
 tactical decisions and therefore 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.430
 compared with peers 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.960
 anti-tank self-propelled guns should still 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.900
 be determined york 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.330
 but there is one thing but not only close 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.510
 signed are present compared to 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.480
 any heavy or medium tank T25 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.430
 very inferior for example 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.890
 imagine meeting first and yourself 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.350
 who can take out our hero with 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.690
 two shots if they will of course with 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.700
 good alpha or imagine for example 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.980
 meeting with the comments which 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.670
 potential damage per minute is palpable 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.040
 more 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.200
 so he also hepe Farm times more 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.650
 not to mention the vitality there is heavy 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.170
 tanks and vanoshot from su-152 and all 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.080
 we will not speak and therefore an option 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.780
 use of t25 at close range 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.390
 disappears immediately absolutely categorically 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.300
 we can punish near unless 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.940
 Only 5 lago la not even on the sixth 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.430
 I advise to get out well if the neighbor 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.860
 the battle is ineffective for us then switch 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.440
 purely on sniper use of this 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.820
 Fri where comfort from the use of the tower 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.030
 much lower 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.640
 it would be better and by the way there was n’t what we 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.510
 we can brag on long distances 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.130
 Firstly excellent accuracy in 036 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.440
 which combined with gorgeous 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.140
 gun downtime will allow 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.450
 confidently send shells right on target 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.260
 and the declination angle of the gun so in general 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.169
 beautiful 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.690
 as much as 10 degrees down which will allow to play 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.740
 from any floor nick wherein Plyuh 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.280
 rather still have 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.770
 all with you by 225 alpha which can 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.319
 issue at a rate of 8 pieces per minute 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.840
 everything seems to be cool but for the sixth 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:37.069
 level of such a setup would be very strong 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.900
 bent the potential to t25 2 is 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.900
 1900 enemy team strength points 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.000
 minute when sous-152 with skorostrel kai 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.880
 has over 3000 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.639
 parsing more than a thousand okay 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.259
 Soviet shaitan even German Jagdpanther 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.479
 it has more than his dpm is 2400 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.889
 halls points per minute i.e. if 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.810
 our today's hero 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.539
 try very hard 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.120
 and do everything correctly and effectively 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.430
 the result is still less than 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.590
 on competitors and so the winning percentage 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.069
 this self-propelled gun will be very strong 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.470
 depend on your allies skill if 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.509
 summarize all of the above then I personally 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.550
 I think that it is necessary to raise 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:24.449
 gun firing rate at least to the level 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:28.110
 fellow T25 at and then reckless will 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.449
 drag your alpha into 400 units a T25 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.300
 rate of fire but not the tower 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.729
 which barely barely turns in contrast 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.130
 from medium or even heavy tanks 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.909
 as for the other parameters 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.979
 here the conversation is much easier 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:46.530
 t25 2 the last among betka towers 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.139
 American birds self-propelled guns with low 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.990
 booking maximum thickness 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.360
 is 75 millimeters which is not 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.819
 stop a landmine from the Su-152 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.669
 not to mention the armor-piercing and the more 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.409
 sabot shells and therefore sew 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.139
 us all and sundry 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.870
 and considering that in general is not so 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.599
 many total 900 units stop you by the tower 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.940
 Send us to the hangar without any 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.460
 problems and therefore reminded melee 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.159
 the distance of the battle is absolutely not about ours 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.289
 today's hero even glow on 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.710
 Far I do not advise you crazy 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.240
 soviet guard on your karma word 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.460
 the only place to which you can 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.889
 breed opponents is false 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.280
 ceiling that not only protects 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.470
 rain crew 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.170
 but also not relevant to the model 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.330
 damage to the tank so shooting not 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.980
 shoot him with armor piercing and damage 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.310
 the tank will not be applied 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:45.040
 with dynamics u20 heels are still full 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.710
 order if help these very much 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.700
 there was a lack of agility then 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.250
 on t25 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.550
 this is a problem of declining decline 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.720
 mobility so it seems all like 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.169
 corresponds to the maximum speed 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.940
 equal to 56 kilometers per hour but development 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.490
 can only be from the hill 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.370
 ferry surface same engine and and not 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.610
 accelerates because 15 horses per ton 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:13.180
 obviously not enough here and it turns out that 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:16.270
 playfulness is no more woman hulka has not grown a 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.160
 pt itself is quite cardboard like on it 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.400
 I’m not going to drag 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.400
 and therefore immediately after the review I put 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:27.340
 her dad's face for a couple of days so that 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.979
 cool your chair and then charge 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.979
 most likely completely bk subcaliber 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:35.380
 shells and gritting his teeth will pass 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:38.680
 This thread is on to finally 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:41.620
 get to the two top Fri-sau who 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.440
 certainly worth all this suffering 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:47.110
 and on this I probably have everything today 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.600
 we forget to like if you 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.570
 liked my review subscribe to my 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.370
 channel join my group in contact 

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:57.280
 give your opinion on this tank 

00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:00.160
 pour yourself some more tea in general your body 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.740
 Kalym is well, but with you I was going 

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.479
 by sight the therapy itself on more than their beats 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.479
 Tanks all see you soon friends
