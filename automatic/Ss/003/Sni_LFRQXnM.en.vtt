yeah you know being legally blind I'm
and<00:04:07.960> I<00:04:08.080> think<00:04:08.380> amplitude<00:04:09.130> is<00:04:10.110> doing<00:04:11.110> something

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
and I think amplitude is doing something

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.160 
and I think amplitude is doing something
that<00:04:11.500> simply<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:12.190> run<00:04:12.690> yeah<00:04:13.690> they<00:04:13.840> said<00:04:14.020> this

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
that simply to run yeah they said this

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.039 
that simply to run yeah they said this
is<00:04:14.350> this<00:04:14.560> is<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.800> same<00:04:15.010> stack<00:04:15.310> went<00:04:15.670> out

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
is this is the same stack went out

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.860 
is this is the same stack went out
without<00:04:17.049> without<00:04:17.950> Mike<00:04:18.190> without<00:04:18.790> my<00:04:18.940> Nova
