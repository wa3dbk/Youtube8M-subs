00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.220
 introduces the pot you need in two stages 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.529
 first stage preparatory 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.650
 begin when the baby has learned to sit 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.840
 that is, about 6 7 months set 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.120
 pot in sight and offer it to a child 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.670
 when the probability of success is maximal 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.609
 after sleeping after walking and after 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.180
 feeding unnecessary him walking often 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.820
 pot 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.670
 let it be twice but efficiently and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.220
 after that, praise the child closer to 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.929
 a year and a half the child is already starting 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.270
 feel that the bladder is full 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.090
 it's time to go to the second stage 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.750
 show baby how you can make it clear 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.690
 mom what's the time and mom is very important here 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.450
 how can she catch this moment because 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 that the child manifests itself sometimes it 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.140
 anxious 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.530
 sometimes it manifests itself with the fact that the child 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.989
 when u play it freezes if mom 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.760
 carefully on the kind on the site of the throne 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.910
 pot and in time it will be 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.530
 effectively and if mom is in the computer 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.480
 somewhere with enthusiasm or by phone 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.450
 talking then these moments will be 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.069
 go down 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.950
 we land according to the old scheme after sleep 

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:13.170
 feeding and walking and more often we remove from 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.579
 baby's diaper because wet 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.950
 tights or romper 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.289
 it's uncomfortable and in children who 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.890
 always in diapers need to ask 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.459
 on the pot 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.959
 it just doesn't happen that the baby is afraid 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.719
 and resists 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.939
 it is impossible to force and sit down 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.579
 if you canâ€™t wait 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.979
 it means your time has not come yet 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.409
 close the topic of the pot for a month and not 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.560
 disturb your child and psyche 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.679
 need to let go of time and need 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.049
 child prepare can be along with 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.360
 it go to pick another pot 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.450
 adults need to work talking in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.670
 this relationship with the child 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.159
 let the pot hike be accompanied 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.799
 positive emotions can take 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.490
 a bear or look through a book case 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.340
 of success 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.340
 praise the case of failure grief and 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.649
 show favorite toy plant 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.039
 explain how important it is 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.980
 it needs a bear cub or a doll 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.790
 it calms a little baby and he 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.010
 then trying to sit down by yourself 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.410
 pot shape also matters to 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.540
 girls buy round for boy 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.730
 oblong I do not advise taking 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.110
 musical pots because firstly 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.569
 they are heavy in processing and secondly it 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.590
 should not be accompanied by such here 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.140
 violent bursts of emotion and even if 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.569
 take into account that the child needs to be raised at night 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.260
 sometimes happens on the pot so the music 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.900
 Of course that's not quite the time of night 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.150
 what more important point 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.700
 to accustom to the pot should 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.340
 be ready not only baby but his mother 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.109
 this complex science requires constant 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.060
 attention will not work if 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:03.250
 plant a child only on weekends 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.250
 or before grandma's visit
