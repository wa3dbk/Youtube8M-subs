about silver amalgam which is a material

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.400 
about silver amalgam which is a material
has<00:00:21.669> been<00:00:21.789> used<00:00:22.000> in<00:00:22.119> Destry<00:00:22.480> for<00:00:22.599> 150<00:00:23.230> years

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
has been used in Destry for 150 years

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.890 
has been used in Destry for 150 years
150<00:00:24.009> years<00:00:24.429> it's<00:00:25.119> one<00:00:25.300> of<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.449> first<00:00:25.689> ones

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
150 years it's one of the first ones

a<00:00:35.680> combination<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.910> mercury<00:00:37.840> 10<00:00:38.410> silver

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
a combination of mercury 10 silver

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.250 
a combination of mercury 10 silver
there's<00:00:39.789> a<00:00:39.910> lot<00:00:40.239> of<00:00:40.539> different<00:00:40.870> metals<00:00:41.020> that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
there's a lot of different metals that

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.990 
there's a lot of different metals that
are<00:00:41.320> put<00:00:41.500> together<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.340> kind<00:00:42.760> of<00:00:42.789> has<00:00:42.969> a

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
are put together and it kind of has a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.959 
are put together and it kind of has a
liquid<00:00:43.539> phase<00:00:43.809> that<00:00:44.260> where<00:00:44.440> you<00:00:44.590> can<00:00:44.969> if

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
liquid phase that where you can if

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.279 
liquid phase that where you can if
you're<00:00:46.180> ahead<00:00:46.359> one<00:00:46.690> you<00:00:46.840> there's<00:00:47.079> a<00:00:47.140> little

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
you're ahead one you there's a little

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.479 
you're ahead one you there's a little
squeaky<00:00:47.710> noise<00:00:47.949> that<00:00:48.219> when<00:00:48.340> you're

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
squeaky noise that when you're

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.700 
squeaky noise that when you're
compressing<00:00:49.420> it<00:00:49.690> into<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.989> teeth<00:00:50.170> have<00:00:50.440> fun

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
compressing it into the teeth have fun

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.770 
compressing it into the teeth have fun
squeaky<00:00:51.100> noise<00:00:51.370> it's<00:00:51.789> a<00:00:51.940> strange<00:00:52.269> deal<00:00:52.570> and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
squeaky noise it's a strange deal and

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.529 
squeaky noise it's a strange deal and
then<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.289> hardens<00:00:53.500> it<00:00:54.250> becomes<00:00:54.609> you<00:00:54.879> know<00:00:55.030> part

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
then it hardens it becomes you know part

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.000 
then it hardens it becomes you know part
of<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.690> tooth<00:00:55.899> kind<00:00:56.230> of<00:00:56.289> thing<00:00:56.440> okay<00:00:56.710> like<00:00:56.829> we

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
of the tooth kind of thing okay like we

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.439 
of the tooth kind of thing okay like we
see<00:00:57.190> there<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:57.519> these<00:00:57.640> pictures<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.090> we<00:00:58.269> had

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
see there and these pictures that we had

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.389 
see there and these pictures that we had
like<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:59.199> first<00:00:59.710> thing<00:00:59.890> I'm<00:01:00.010> thinking<00:01:00.039> is

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
like so first thing I'm thinking is

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.150 
like so first thing I'm thinking is
mercury<00:01:00.940> right<00:01:01.629> that's<00:01:02.620> one<00:01:02.829> of<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:02.980> real

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
mercury right that's one of the real

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.800 
mercury right that's one of the real
concerns<00:01:03.609> and<00:01:03.910> that's<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.210> reason<00:01:04.330> you<00:01:04.570> can't

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:04.810 
concerns and that's the reason you can't

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.020 
concerns and that's the reason you can't
put<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.200> material<00:01:05.650> in<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.800> landfill<00:01:06.310> is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
put the material in a landfill is

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.460 
put the material in a landfill is
because<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.990> mercury<00:01:08.110> content<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.210> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
because of the mercury content this is a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.540 
because of the mercury content this is a
controversy<00:01:11.470> where<00:01:11.650> you<00:01:11.770> can<00:01:11.890> get<00:01:12.040> to<00:01:12.250> dentist

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
controversy where you can get to dentist

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.160 
controversy where you can get to dentist
arguing<00:01:12.970> they'll<00:01:13.090> go<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.270> fisticuffs<00:01:13.690> really

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
arguing they'll go to fisticuffs really

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.320 
arguing they'll go to fisticuffs really
easily<00:01:14.440> because<00:01:14.860> that<00:01:15.130> because<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.030> people

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
easily because that because the people

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
easily because that because the people
and<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.380> arguments<00:01:17.830> on<00:01:17.950> both<00:01:18.160> sides<00:01:18.220> are<00:01:18.760> good

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and the arguments on both sides are good

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.950 
and the arguments on both sides are good
on<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.800> one<00:01:20.980> side<00:01:21.010> it's<00:01:21.760> been<00:01:21.970> used<00:01:22.180> for<00:01:22.300> 150

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
on the one side it's been used for 150

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.150 
on the one side it's been used for 150
years<00:01:23.170> there's<00:01:23.470> been<00:01:23.620> hundreds<00:01:24.070> of

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
years there's been hundreds of

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.550 
years there's been hundreds of
scientific<00:01:24.730> studies<00:01:25.030> done<00:01:25.240> nobody<00:01:26.080> can<00:01:26.260> prove

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
scientific studies done nobody can prove

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.270 
scientific studies done nobody can prove
that<00:01:26.620> it<00:01:26.890> does<00:01:27.220> any<00:01:27.460> harm<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.420> health<00:01:29.280> you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
that it does any harm to the health you

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.320 
that it does any harm to the health you
know<00:01:30.370> that<00:01:30.550> sort<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.850> thing<00:01:30.910> on<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.270> other

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
know that sort of thing on the other

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.000 
know that sort of thing on the other
hand<00:01:31.630> you've<00:01:31.870> got<00:01:31.900> mercury<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.710> huge

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
hand you've got mercury is a huge

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.350 
hand you've got mercury is a huge
concern<00:01:33.220> environmentally<00:01:34.090> right<00:01:34.300> now<00:01:35.340> that

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
concern environmentally right now that

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.630 
concern environmentally right now that
we<00:01:37.360> think<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.690> damages<00:01:38.410> teeth<00:01:38.710> cause<00:01:39.430> I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
we think that damages teeth cause I

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.790 
we think that damages teeth cause I
think<00:01:40.360> that<00:01:40.510> it<00:01:40.600> causes<00:01:40.840> teeth<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.380> break<00:01:41.590> more

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
think that it causes teeth to break more

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.150 
think that it causes teeth to break more
frequently<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.440> problem<00:01:44.770> is<00:01:44.890> it's

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
frequently but the problem is it's

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.120 
frequently but the problem is it's
