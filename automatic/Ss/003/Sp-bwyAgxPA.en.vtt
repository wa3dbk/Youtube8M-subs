iPhone six-plus incipio has been making

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.160 
iPhone six-plus incipio has been making
the<00:00:11.280> ng<00:00:11.519> P<00:00:11.730> for<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> long<00:00:12.420> time<00:00:12.690> now<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the ng P for a long time now for the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.419 
the ng P for a long time now for the
last<00:00:13.230> few<00:00:13.380> years<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.860> different<00:00:14.009> iPhone

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
last few years for different iPhone

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.640 
last few years for different iPhone
models<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.120> ng<00:00:16.109> P<00:00:16.260> stands<00:00:16.529> for

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
models and ng P stands for

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.279 
models and ng P stands for
next-generation<00:00:17.220> polymers<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.080> kind

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
next-generation polymers so this is kind

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.640 
next-generation polymers so this is kind
of<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.410> hybrid<00:00:19.650> between<00:00:19.830> rubber<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.820> plastic

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
of a hybrid between rubber and plastic

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.620 
of a hybrid between rubber and plastic
like<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.769> say<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> totally<00:00:23.430> different

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
like I say it's a totally different

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.580 
like I say it's a totally different
material<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:24.810> that's<00:00:24.960> kind<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.260> how<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> would

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
material but that's kind of how I would

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.160 
material but that's kind of how I would
describe<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.330> semi<00:00:27.750> translucent

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
describe it and it is semi translucent

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.769 
describe it and it is semi translucent
so<00:00:28.680> you'll<00:00:28.830> see<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.340> does<00:00:29.580> show<00:00:29.820> off<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
so you'll see that it does show off the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.680 
so you'll see that it does show off the
Apple<00:00:31.140> logo<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:31.980> bit<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.390> see

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
Apple logo a little bit and you can see

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.299 
Apple logo a little bit and you can see
that<00:00:33.840> through<00:00:34.200> there<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:35.010> even

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
that through there you can actually even

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.490 
that through there you can actually even
read<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.210> model<00:00:36.540> number<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
read the model number and see that it

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.740 
read the model number and see that it
says<00:00:37.680> iPhone<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.550> that's<00:00:39.149> important<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
says iPhone there so that's important to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.330 
says iPhone there so that's important to
you<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.930> does<00:00:40.200> show<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> off<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.160> bit

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
you it does show that off a little bit

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
you it does show that off a little bit
even<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> other<00:00:42.450> colors<00:00:42.960> you're<00:00:43.320> gonna

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
even with the other colors you're gonna

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470 
even with the other colors you're gonna
be<00:00:43.620> able<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.329> good

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
be able to see that and it's just a good

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.790 
be able to see that and it's just a good
option<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> semi

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
option to kind of have a semi

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.500 
option to kind of have a semi
translucent<00:00:47.219> case<00:00:47.700> that's<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
translucent case that's not going to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.110 
translucent case that's not going to
yellow<00:00:48.930> still<00:00:49.800> shows<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> an<00:00:50.730> iPhone

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
yellow still shows that it is an iPhone

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389 
yellow still shows that it is an iPhone
but<00:00:51.600> still<00:00:51.870> has<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.469> little<00:00:52.739> bit<00:00:52.829> more<00:00:52.890> drop

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
but still has a little bit more drop

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.420 
but still has a little bit more drop
absorption<00:00:54.120> than<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.289> hard<00:00:55.530> plastic<00:00:55.860> type

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
absorption than just a hard plastic type

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.090 
absorption than just a hard plastic type
clear<00:00:56.789> case<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.469> looks<00:00:58.649> good<00:00:58.859> it's

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
clear case so I think it looks good it's

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.069 
clear case so I think it looks good it's
a<00:00:59.190> good<00:00:59.370> all-around<00:00:59.640> protective<00:01:00.629> type<00:01:00.840> case

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

moshi-moshi
and<00:01:26.400> also<00:01:26.970> body<00:01:27.689> guards<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.350> zag<00:01:28.619> I'd

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and also body guards and zag I'd

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.950 
and also body guards and zag I'd
probably<00:01:29.070> stick<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.579> those<00:01:29.729> case<00:01:30.450> Friendly's

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
probably stick to those case Friendly's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.690 
probably stick to those case Friendly's
will<00:01:31.140> fit<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> little<00:01:31.530> bit<00:01:31.710> better<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.189> any

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
will fit a little bit better but any

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490 
will fit a little bit better but any
screen<00:01:33.240> protector<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.049> work<00:01:34.259> with

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
screen protector really will work with

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.990 
screen protector really will work with
that<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.700> good<00:01:35.850> all-around

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that so just a good all-around

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.789 
that so just a good all-around
protective<00:01:36.630> case<00:01:36.810> also<00:01:37.079> has<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.590> raised

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
protective case also has that raised

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.710 
protective case also has that raised
bezel<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> lands<00:01:39.000> facedown<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> will

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
bezel so if it lands facedown it will

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
bezel so if it lands facedown it will
provide<00:01:40.020> some<00:01:40.079> protection<00:01:40.710> has<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.100> lit

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
provide some protection has that lit

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
provide some protection has that lit
