00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.350
 hello I am sergio lujÃ¡n mora professor of 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.880
 the university of alicante and this video 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.980
 is part of a series of videos 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.490
 tutorials dedicated to accessibility 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.190
 web in this video santi a person 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.409
 deafblind along with his interpreter curro 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.109
 will show us your keyboard line 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:22.630
 braille electromechanical device that 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.839
 used to manage your mobile phone and 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.909
 your computer a braille keyboard line 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.029
 is a device that combines two 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:33.429
 devices in one lines only 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.129
 Braille keyboards are useful for 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:39.070
 blind people and especially for 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.440
 deafblind as santi 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.239
 On the one hand a braille line is a 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.790
 device that allows the output of 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.920
 Braille code content from another 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.559
 device like for example a 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.930
 computer or a mobile phone to which 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.629
 has connected allowing a person 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.870
 blind or with low vision access the 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.120
 information that this facilitates 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.550
 Braille lines are composed of a 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.470
 set of cells each with six u 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.350
 eight points that allow to show 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.630
 braille characters the dots can 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.330
 toggle between upload positions 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.610
 and lowered so that they can vary from 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.110
 dynamic way to represent the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.050
 different characters of the alphabet 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.330
 braille 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.370
 On the other hand, a braille keyboard is a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.890
 input device that allows 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.570
 represent any character by 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.270
 the simultaneous pulsation of a few 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.240
 keys which allows to reach a large 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.790
 writing speed the keyboards 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.030
 braille usually have 6 or 8 keys 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.310
 principal also have a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.170
 series of auxiliary keys that allow 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.690
 add various functionalities to 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.270
 device in combination with 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.610
 main keys these keys allow 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.280
 tell the device to perform 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.880
 a special function as it can be 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.680
 create open or save a document 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.619
 the braille line that will show us 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.009
 santi in the next video is a focus 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.680
 40 that we can see that its price is 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.860
 quite high I see there on the table 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.319
 you have the braille line and the phone 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.319
 mobile you can not teach and explain 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.970
 He first taught us 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.549
 phone have not told us that it is a 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.549
 iphone 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.910
 if an iPhone why 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.280
 accessibility conditions that you have to 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.720
 despite being tactile the accessibility that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.290
 has to with braille lines is 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.060
 much better has the rest of terminals 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.400
 then then the combination of the iphone 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.790
 with the braille line for me it is very 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.790
 very little 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.060
 and the line 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.680
 for people who do not know this 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.049
 device could explain us the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.420
 buttons that the line has for what 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.420
 serves each button how it is used 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.629
 good depends on him 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.540
 of how the application in which 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.099
 we are in the one that is inserted then each 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.970
 button is for the best to access 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:41.060
 to any of the sections that 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.040
 it has or in function if you're stuck 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.530
 put on the facebook or if you're stuck 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.140
 in some portal somewhere a magazine 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.680
 then the or 10 minutes or for example 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.680
 Applications 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.160
 sports, there are some that 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.530
 example do sports broadcasts 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.540
 they make comments that are going 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.190
 updating every minute every two 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.020
 minutes put to work through the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.430
 braille line for example imagine 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.290
 in a football game then when 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.240
 they make that update in the web portal 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.920
 because I get the line that has 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.570
 scored a goal so I can follow that 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.650
 football match through Braille 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.650
 it's great 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.190
 look at the votes that the line has as 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.170
 as usual 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.170
 that is bearable what it is for 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.090
 the braille line 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:39.240
 good first is and when when 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.860
 when I started using the internet and 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.270
 since then I have pipelines 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.250
 For example, the top part is 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.080
 the practice to write the buttons of 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.630
 up then these these buttons there 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.610
 in the middle 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:55.150
 they really do cursors 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.520
 and then the lower part of the dots 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.039
 what the text is that I write and 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.300
 the one on the screen then there's 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.650
 times that for example if I see that I 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.169
 I made a mistake somewhere with the 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.909
 cursors that I told you because I'm changing 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.150
 and I go to the site in the wrong and 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:14.080
 rectified scientist is that text then 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:17.259
 there are the wheels that are for the 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.249
 navigation and then there then others 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.559
 has commands 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.759
 it's the same to go browsing each button 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.679
 It has a functionality to go 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.179
 surfing the web but what you 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:28.969
 he said the most common thing for me can follow 

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:31.099
 the text through these little dots that 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.949
 I get all text in braille as 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.649
 Imagine maybe they send me a 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.269
 mail because I already know the steps of 

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:40.909
 keyboard how it works then if I what 

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:42.709
 I want to forward it through the 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.920
 I'm going to change the appointment 

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:49.250
 who comes to the elections 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.810
 to resend and I do the forwarding you have 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.000
 that work knowing all the 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.340
 shortcuts and the functions of each keyboard 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.320
 I will see that with this Braille line 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.810
 it works very well is very very comfortable 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.670
 I doing the comparison between the 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.740
 desktop computer 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.080
 and this braille line with the mobile 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.230
 I would tell you that I can do almost almost 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.980
 same things there are times that this line 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.390
 braille is more comfortable because 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.090
 because the commands are easier to 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.850
 continue for example in a computer 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.810
 after me personally 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.760
 commands and I find it more complicated 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.590
 that this braille line with the 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.400
 mobile but this line can also be 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.400
 connect to the computer 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.430
 or when connecting to the computer does not 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.960
 it works exactly the same as when 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.960
 is connected to the mobile 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:43.460
 yes yes yes yes excuse me for starting 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:46.790
 during the use with the mobile but 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.270
 I could also use it with him 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.270
 computer 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:56.949
 indistinctly one of the others no no to 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.270
 but you could use with 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:00.130
 any with any of others 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.349
 devices to me personally I like 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.990
 much more in using it than it said 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.990
 before using it with the mobile 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.840
 and this completes this video tutorial 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.570
 who has shown that it is a braille line 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.310
 and how it is used if they need more 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:20.230
 information or you want to contact me
