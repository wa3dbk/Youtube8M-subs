buttons<00:02:11.740> are<00:02:12.040> resist<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.960> just<00:02:17.320> it's<00:02:17.620> for<00:02:17.980> your

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
buttons are resist so just it's for your

buttons are resist so just it's for your
choice<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:19.770> didn't<00:02:20.770> share<00:02:21.070> it's<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:21.670> shock

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940

resistance<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.470> my<00:02:23.620> mind<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.670> similar

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
resistance but to my mind is the similar

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.100 
resistance but to my mind is the similar
for<00:02:25.510> both<00:02:25.540> items<00:02:26.880> I'd<00:02:27.880> like<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.360> show<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.690> al

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
for both items I'd like to show you al

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.500 
for both items I'd like to show you al
the<00:02:29.890> Clyde<00:02:31.890> both<00:02:32.890> models<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:33.640> ride<00:02:34.240> the

the Clyde both models have ride the
