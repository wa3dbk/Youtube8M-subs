00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.050 
because this kind of stories there comes
during<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.710> big<00:01:31.860> tournament<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.700> definitely

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
during a big tournament it definitely

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.289 
during a big tournament it definitely

as<00:01:36.479> well<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.310> PC<00:01:38.610> become<00:01:38.909> what

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
as well so it's up to the PC become what

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.940 
as well so it's up to the PC become what
action<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.810> take<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.170> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
action they have to take because it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.130 
action they have to take because it's
supposed<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> thing<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.090> right<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:42.990> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
supposed as this thing is right then I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.480 
supposed as this thing is right then I
think<00:01:43.350> he<00:01:43.439> has<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.710> he<00:01:43.890> has<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.250> sacked

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
think he has to he has to be sacked

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.330 
think he has to he has to be sacked
because<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.630> don't<00:01:45.840> know<00:01:46.110> who's<00:01:46.290> who<00:01:46.680> will
