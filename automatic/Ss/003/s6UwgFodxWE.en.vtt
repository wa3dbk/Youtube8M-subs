00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:08.440
 Hi girls , how are you? 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:11.379
 Today I'm going to show you how to do it. 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.760
 for different types of hairstyles with 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.949
 a bandana 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.920
 so that 's what you're going to need 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.920
 it is logical for a bandanna or more 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.470
 the first hairstyle will need a 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.740
 elastic and a bandana 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.750
 he is very easy to do 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.210
 then you can start by holding your 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.070
 hair anyway do not care too much 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.610
 because, after all, he's going to vote and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.360
 then idea is to just drop some pieces of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:51.120
 your hair flat irons and then hold the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:55.790
 people there you will get the bandana on 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.790
 she in fact singular and spinning her 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.480
 So you went to register that back 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.600
 the head and make a knot at the top of 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.290
 head can be in the middle of the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.290
 Any way you want it 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:23.610
 then just let go of your hair and give 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.610
 a check and your stepson is ready 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.300
 now second hairstyle is with tail 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.580
 horse 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.390
 So you can choose the band that you 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.500
 to prefer 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.060
 and you'll need me I think 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.640
 It's also the same as the previous one. 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.170
 More or less will leave a little brother. 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.090
 loose in front 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.810
 if you want if you do not want do not need 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.430
 but I like it and then it will make a tail 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.140
 with the volume behind his 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.350
 head because you will roll band 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.450
 same way as before 2007 and places 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.450
 her around your head and make a knot 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.640
 can leave thinner thicker leave 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.900
 upstairs and downstairs 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.900
 many varieties 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.670
 now this third hairstyle will be used 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.220
 he around the elastic hair then 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.490
 It's already there with a ponytail border. 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.160
 which is down something to some element 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.190
 more in your hairstyle then only 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.920
 put it around and make a knot 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.950
 I think that yes it is very fulfilled the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.140
 accounts will then help 290 crosses the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.340
 tips under my ponytail 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.060
 possible take another node that decreases 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.060
 the answers 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.040
 and this is how our third party is ready 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.040
 hairstyle 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.519
 now we are going to make the room in which more 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.950
 also likes 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.950
 my style is that 11 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.170
 Then you just went around your hair. 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.819
 mainly in the lower part and 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.269
 then bring up and do what is already 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.269
 ready 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:51.069
 this is one of the most famous types of 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:54.639
 bandanna that you see and for that leaves the 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.239
 band a little coarse showing and 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:00.280
 I did not do finep fine style because what 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.510
 I like a little messy coke but 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.310
 if you want to 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.900
 since the book nearby makes the ring 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.629
 well right on you with him almost a 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.450
 horizontal line of your head and passes 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:16.209
 makes 29 and then only hides little sai 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.880
 so it 's very simple to do 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.039
 but like I said I like doing the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.039
 hairstyle always more advanced than I 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:36.149

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:38.999
