to make sure that you'd never run out
you<00:03:50.209> always<00:03:50.420> want<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.630> have<00:03:50.810> some<00:03:51.079> fluid<00:03:51.380> in

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
you always want to have some fluid in

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.660 
you always want to have some fluid in
there<00:03:51.680> otherwise<00:03:51.920> you're<00:03:52.160> going<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.310> pull<00:03:52.519> in

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
there otherwise you're going to pull in

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.720 
there otherwise you're going to pull in
air<00:03:53.200> into<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.320> lines<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.889> that's<00:03:55.280> basically

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
air into the lines and that's basically

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.810 
air into the lines and that's basically
what<00:03:55.940> you're<00:03:56.000> trying<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.450> get<00:03:56.570> out<00:03:56.650> so<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:58.670> do

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
what you're trying to get out so you do

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.780 
what you're trying to get out so you do
this<00:03:59.079> you<00:04:00.079> start<00:04:00.410> out<00:04:00.560> with<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.950> right<00:04:01.280> rear

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
this you start out with the right rear

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.340 
this you start out with the right rear
you<00:04:02.030> always<00:04:02.239> start<00:04:02.450> out<00:04:02.600> from<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.900> farthest

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
you always start out from the farthest

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.099 
you always start out from the farthest
point<00:04:03.769> from<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:04.280> reservoir<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:05.750> go<00:04:06.079> right

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
point from the reservoir so you go right

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.970 
point from the reservoir so you go right
rear<00:04:06.620> left<00:04:07.579> rear<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.090> then<00:04:08.570> right<00:04:09.260> front<00:04:09.739> and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
rear left rear and then right front and

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.400 
rear left rear and then right front and
then<00:04:10.459> left<00:04:10.820> front<00:04:11.269> in<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:12.230> order<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:14.169> you<00:04:15.169> do

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
then left front in that order and you do

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.560 
then left front in that order and you do
about<00:04:15.889> you<00:04:16.459> know<00:04:16.549> when<00:04:16.700> you're<00:04:16.820> back<00:04:17.000> here<00:04:17.389> in

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
about you know when you're back here in

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.349 
about you know when you're back here in
the<00:04:18.109> rear<00:04:18.320> area<00:04:18.500> you've<00:04:19.310> got<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.669> do<00:04:19.820> maybe

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
the rear area you've got to do maybe

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.730 
the rear area you've got to do maybe
eight<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.989> ten<00:04:22.300> pumps<00:04:23.300> on<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.450> brake<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.960> then

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
eight to ten pumps on the brake and then

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.810 
eight to ten pumps on the brake and then
when<00:04:24.950> you're<00:04:25.100> in<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.280> front<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.790> can

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
when you're in the front you can

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.460 
when you're in the front you can
probably<00:04:26.060> reduce<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:26.840> like<00:04:26.990> six<00:04:27.320> to

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
probably reduce that to like six to

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.670 
probably reduce that to like six to
eight<00:04:27.970> in<00:04:28.970> order<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.450> until<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.139> start<00:04:30.440> seeing

brake<00:04:41.480> pedal<00:04:41.750> all<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:41.960> way<00:04:42.139> down<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.590> then<00:04:42.980> up

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
brake pedal all the way down and then up

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.240 
brake pedal all the way down and then up
then<00:04:44.810> they<00:04:44.930> let<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.230> up<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.760> you<00:04:46.760> say<00:04:47.000> floor

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
then they let it up and you say floor

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:56.480 
then they let it up and you say floor
and<00:04:49.250> then<00:04:49.370> up<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:51.380> then<00:04:51.440> floor<00:04:53.139> up

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:12.950 

floor<00:04:58.199> up<00:05:00.419> floor<00:05:02.370> up<00:05:04.620> floor<00:05:06.509> up<00:05:08.849> floor<00:05:10.740> up

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
floor up floor up floor up floor up

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.020 
floor up floor up floor up floor up
floor<00:05:14.669> up<00:05:15.669> and<00:05:16.599> you<00:05:17.229> can<00:05:17.349> see<00:05:17.590> that<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.310> fluid

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
floor up and you can see that the fluid

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.920 
floor up and you can see that the fluid
is<00:05:19.300> is<00:05:19.599> draining<00:05:20.080> into<00:05:20.349> the<00:05:21.030> into<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.180> bottle

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
is is draining into the into the bottle

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.020 
is is draining into the into the bottle
it<00:05:23.469> doesn't<00:05:23.770> have<00:05:23.889> to<00:05:24.009> be<00:05:24.129> the<00:05:24.460> tube<00:05:24.789> doesn't

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
it doesn't have to be the tube doesn't

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.700 
it doesn't have to be the tube doesn't
have<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.360> necessarily<00:05:25.509> be<00:05:25.840> submerged<00:05:26.379> because

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
have to necessarily be submerged because

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.890 
have to necessarily be submerged because
you're<00:05:26.860> actually<00:05:27.039> creating<00:05:27.580> a<00:05:27.639> vacuum<00:05:27.900> area

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
you're actually creating a vacuum area

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.860 
you're actually creating a vacuum area
right<00:05:29.139> up<00:05:29.289> here<00:05:30.090> not<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.120> vacuum<00:05:31.330> but<00:05:31.629> you<00:05:31.750> know

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
right up here not a vacuum but you know

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.969 
right up here not a vacuum but you know
yeah<00:05:32.560> basically<00:05:32.800> this<00:05:33.310> is<00:05:33.879> going<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.120> be<00:05:34.979> fluid

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
yeah basically this is going to be fluid

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.430 
yeah basically this is going to be fluid
in<00:05:36.190> this<00:05:36.340> line<00:05:36.610> so<00:05:37.090> even<00:05:37.750> if<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:37.930> pulls<00:05:38.169> back<00:05:38.379> a

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
in this line so even if it pulls back a

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.200 
in this line so even if it pulls back a
little<00:05:38.740> bit<00:05:38.949> it's<00:05:39.400> still<00:05:39.789> going<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.120> be

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
little bit it's still going to be

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.830 
little bit it's still going to be
pulling<00:05:40.419> fluid<00:05:40.810> back<00:05:41.250> so<00:05:42.250> this<00:05:42.969> one<00:05:43.210> didn't

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
pulling fluid back so this one didn't

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.689 
pulling fluid back so this one didn't
really<00:05:43.870> have<00:05:44.139> much<00:05:44.289> air<00:05:44.590> in<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:44.919> lines<00:05:45.159> of<00:05:45.430> the

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
really have much air in the lines of the

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.390 
really have much air in the lines of the
brake<00:05:46.090> pedal<00:05:46.659> felt<00:05:47.020> pretty<00:05:47.289> solid<00:05:47.770> so<00:05:48.250> we're

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
brake pedal felt pretty solid so we're

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.860 
brake pedal felt pretty solid so we're
not<00:05:48.490> going<00:05:48.669> to<00:05:48.759> see<00:05:48.969> a<00:05:49.000> lot<00:05:49.240> of<00:05:49.270> bubbles<00:05:49.690> or

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
not going to see a lot of bubbles or

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.469 
not going to see a lot of bubbles or
sputtering<00:05:50.379> coming<00:05:50.680> out<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:50.919> the<00:05:50.979> tubing<00:05:51.479> but

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
sputtering coming out of the tubing but

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.480 
sputtering coming out of the tubing but
what<00:05:52.690> we<00:05:52.810> want<00:05:53.020> to<00:05:53.110> do<00:05:53.229> is<00:05:53.379> we<00:05:53.500> want<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.830> push

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
what we want to do is we want to push

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.969 
what we want to do is we want to push
most<00:05:54.939> of<00:05:55.210> the<00:05:55.270> old<00:05:55.539> fluid<00:05:55.960> through<00:05:56.439> this<00:05:56.680> this

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
most of the old fluid through this this

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.939 
most of the old fluid through this this
right<00:05:57.550> rear<00:05:57.759> corner<00:05:58.090> all<00:05:58.629> right<00:05:58.840> floor<00:05:59.969> up

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
right rear corner all right floor up

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.580 
right rear corner all right floor up
floor<00:06:03.479> up

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
floor up

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:16.920 
floor up
floor<00:06:07.139> up<00:06:08.880> floor<00:06:10.650> up<00:06:12.450> floor<00:06:14.220> up<00:06:15.480> and<00:06:16.480> so<00:06:16.750> what

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
floor up floor up floor up and so what

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.230 
floor up floor up floor up and so what
you<00:06:17.050> want<00:06:17.230> to<00:06:17.290> do<00:06:17.410> now<00:06:17.860> is<00:06:18.220> you<00:06:18.639> want<00:06:18.850> to<00:06:18.940> go<00:06:19.090> and

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
you want to do now is you want to go and

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.980 
you want to do now is you want to go and
just<00:06:19.900> kind<00:06:20.110> of<00:06:20.169> look<00:06:20.380> at<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:21.000> reservoir<00:06:22.000> just

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
just kind of look at the reservoir just

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.820 
just kind of look at the reservoir just
to<00:06:23.110> make<00:06:23.260> sure<00:06:23.530> that<00:06:24.630> it's<00:06:25.630> not<00:06:25.870> drained<00:06:26.650> out

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
to make sure that it's not drained out

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.310 
to make sure that it's not drained out
and<00:06:27.270> then<00:06:28.270> refill<00:06:28.720> it<00:06:28.840> and<00:06:28.960> then<00:06:29.050> come<00:06:29.290> back

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
and then refill it and then come back

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.379 
and then refill it and then come back
here<00:06:29.500> and<00:06:29.740> alright<00:06:30.430> the<00:06:30.580> reservoir<00:06:31.000> was<00:06:31.150> about

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
here and alright the reservoir was about

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:32.159 
here and alright the reservoir was about
half<00:06:31.630> empty

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
half empty

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:33.690 
half empty
I<00:06:32.200> filled<00:06:32.560> it<00:06:32.650> back<00:06:32.800> up<00:06:33.070> and<00:06:33.250> then<00:06:33.310> was<00:06:33.490> around

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
I filled it back up and then was around

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.220 
I filled it back up and then was around
ten<00:06:34.000> times<00:06:34.270> so<00:06:34.480> we're<00:06:34.600> probably<00:06:34.690> going<00:06:34.870> to<00:06:35.020> do

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
ten times so we're probably going to do

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.200 
ten times so we're probably going to do
that<00:06:35.380> about<00:06:35.470> I<00:06:35.770> don't<00:06:36.010> know<00:06:36.100> 15<00:06:36.520> more<00:06:36.730> times<00:06:37.000> in

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
that about I don't know 15 more times in

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.659 
that about I don't know 15 more times in
order<00:06:37.419> to<00:06:37.510> push<00:06:37.750> through<00:06:38.110> most<00:06:39.040> of<00:06:39.340> the<00:06:39.430> old

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
order to push through most of the old

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.730 
order to push through most of the old
fluid<00:06:40.210> out<00:06:40.510> this<00:06:40.810> corner<00:06:41.200> and<00:06:41.350> then<00:06:41.620> we're

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
fluid out this corner and then we're

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.340 
fluid out this corner and then we're
going<00:06:41.860> to<00:06:41.889> do<00:06:42.070> the<00:06:42.250> other<00:06:42.970> side<00:06:43.419> the<00:06:43.479> left<00:06:43.840> rear

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
going to do the other side the left rear

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.290 
going to do the other side the left rear
and<00:06:44.680> that's<00:06:45.250> going<00:06:45.400> to<00:06:45.490> push<00:06:45.669> kind<00:06:45.940> of<00:06:46.030> a<00:06:46.090> rest

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
and that's going to push kind of a rest

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.940 
and that's going to push kind of a rest
of<00:06:46.510> it<00:06:46.600> through<00:06:46.900> all<00:06:47.560> right

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
of it through all right
