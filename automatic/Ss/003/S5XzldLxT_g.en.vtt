00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
be too big because you're not trying to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.520 
be too big because you're not trying to
make<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:37.190> big<00:00:38.190> entrance<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:39.440> after<00:00:40.440> you've

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
done that we're gonna open it this way

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.060 
done that we're gonna open it this way
this<00:00:44.789> will<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.270> my<00:00:45.420> back

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
this will be my back

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.330 
this will be my back
folding<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> evenly<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:48.030> will<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.480> cut<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.899> deep

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
folding it evenly I will now cut a deep

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.310 
folding it evenly I will now cut a deep
cut<00:00:50.340> make<00:00:51.059> sure<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.989> know<00:00:52.050> my

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
cut make sure because I know my

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.779 
cut make sure because I know my
measurement<00:00:52.829> already<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> guess<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.460> shouldn't

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
measurement already I guess I shouldn't

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
measurement already I guess I shouldn't
I<00:00:53.910> should<00:00:54.180> show<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.530> when<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> measure<00:00:55.829> myself

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I should show you when I measure myself

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.760 
I should show you when I measure myself
my<00:00:56.520> butt<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.539> much<00:00:57.780> will<00:00:57.930> cover<00:00:58.109> my<00:00:58.289> butt<00:00:58.500> so

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
my butt this much will cover my butt so

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.860 
my butt this much will cover my butt so
I<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:59.039> actually<00:00:59.250> cut<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> V<00:00:59.969> from<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.719> all

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
I can actually cut the V from here all

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.420 
I can actually cut the V from here all
the<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:01.020> down<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.649> comfortably<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the way down to here and comfortably I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.719 
the way down to here and comfortably I
guess<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.390> easier<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.379> measure<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
guess it's easier you measure and you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.520 
guess it's easier you measure and you
know<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:07.290> I've<00:01:07.439> been

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
know all this but because I've been

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.050 
know all this but because I've been
dealing<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.830> these<00:01:08.040> cloth<00:01:08.340> over<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.909> over

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
dealing with these cloth over and over

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.090 
dealing with these cloth over and over
again<00:01:09.150> I'm<00:01:09.360> trying<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.020> stylizing<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.710> sort<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
again I'm trying and stylizing I sort of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.700 
again I'm trying and stylizing I sort of
know<00:01:11.250> where<00:01:12.240> these<00:01:12.450> things<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.439> I'm<00:01:13.590> just

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.260 
know where these things are so I'm just
going<00:01:13.830> ahead<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.189> cut<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.520> first<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.000> then

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
going ahead and cut it first and then

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
going ahead and cut it first and then

you can go lower if you want you know

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.520 
you can go lower if you want you know
that's<00:02:33.460> up<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.880> but<00:02:34.090> actually<00:02:34.750> what<00:02:35.350> I'm

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
that's up to you but actually what I'm

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.930 
that's up to you but actually what I'm
going<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> do<00:02:36.010> next<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.280> I'm<00:02:36.460> gonna<00:02:36.580> add<00:02:36.730> rubber

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
going to do next is I'm gonna add rubber

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.400 
going to do next is I'm gonna add rubber
band<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.390> goes<00:02:37.540> from<00:02:37.630> here<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:38.170> all<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
band that goes from here going all the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.170 
band that goes from here going all the
way<00:02:38.440> through<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:39.190> reason<00:02:39.520> why<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.640> left<00:02:39.940> this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
way through the reason why I left this

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.750 
way through the reason why I left this
side<00:02:40.420> open<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.990> because<00:02:41.350> it's<00:02:41.770> easy<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.490> if

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
side open is because it's easy to so if

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.500 
side open is because it's easy to so if
you<00:02:42.790> just<00:02:43.030> leave<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.360> alone<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:45.510> continue

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
you just leave it alone and continue

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.150 
you just leave it alone and continue
this<00:02:46.630> way<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.170> one<00:02:47.470> way<00:02:47.740> all<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.130> way

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
this way so it's a one way all the way

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.980 
this way so it's a one way all the way
around<00:02:48.580> rubber<00:02:49.090> band<00:02:49.270> this<00:02:49.480> way<00:02:49.630> it's<00:02:49.840> an

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
around rubber band this way it's an

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.160 
around rubber band this way it's an
equal<00:02:50.410> pull<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.130> whole<00:02:51.340> way<00:02:51.490> around<00:02:51.610> and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
equal pull the whole way around and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.750 
equal pull the whole way around and
afterwards<00:02:53.170> then<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.620> will<00:02:53.890> sew<00:02:54.070> this<00:02:54.310> side<00:02:54.520> up

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
afterwards then I will sew this side up

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.490 
afterwards then I will sew this side up
and<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.720> rubber<00:02:55.870> band<00:02:56.020> would<00:02:56.110> be<00:02:56.140> with<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
and so the rubber band would be with the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.990 
and so the rubber band would be with the
wrong<00:02:56.650> side<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.220> won't<00:02:57.490> show<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.970> other

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
wrong side so I won't show on the other

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.690 
wrong side so I won't show on the other
side<00:02:58.450> which<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> good<00:02:59.080> thing

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
side which is a good thing

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.250 
side which is a good thing
so<00:03:00.700> now<00:03:00.910> what<00:03:01.180> I'm<00:03:01.300> going<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.570> do<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.990> I'm<00:03:02.230> going

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.550 
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:03:02.410> open<00:03:02.470> up<00:03:02.740> this<00:03:02.950> way<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:04.870> rub<00:03:05.020> in<00:03:05.230> here
