proposal to install it I think it's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.670

very<00:01:21.960> difficult<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.470> have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:23.009> deep

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
fit together if you don't actually have

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080 
fit together if you don't actually have
the<00:01:28.650> thing<00:01:28.860> made<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.490> can't<00:01:29.700> connect<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the thing made and can't connect the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.700 
the thing made and can't connect the
kind<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.360> learning<00:01:30.689> that's<00:01:30.810> most<00:01:31.049> important

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
kind of learning that's most important

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.160 
kind of learning that's most important
but<00:01:32.009> once<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> goals<00:01:32.700> were<00:01:32.970> set<00:01:33.240> tech<00:01:33.930> head

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
but once the goals were set tech head

but once the goals were set tech head
teacher<00:01:34.439> Gus<00:01:34.890> Goodwin<00:01:35.400> took<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
teacher Gus Goodwin took up the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
teacher Gus Goodwin took up the
challenge<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.630> building<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.290> model<00:01:37.650> prototype

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
challenge of building a model prototype

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
challenge of building a model prototype
so<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> decided<00:01:39.329> I'd<00:01:39.479> take<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.780> sculpture<00:01:40.320> course

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so I decided I'd take a sculpture course

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.039 
so I decided I'd take a sculpture course
and<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.150> made<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and and so this is what I made in that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.460 
and and so this is what I made in that
course<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> brought<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.930> the

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
this spin around and the weight from

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.580 
this spin around and the weight from
this<00:04:05.010> guy<00:04:05.160> makes<00:04:05.460> them<00:04:05.610> come<00:04:05.790> back<00:04:05.819> down<00:04:06.590> this

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
this guy makes them come back down this

class is like fun because like they

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.870 
class is like fun because like they
teach<00:04:09.420> us<00:04:09.630> how<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.290> be<00:04:10.500> creative<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.370> make

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
teach us how to be creative and to make

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.850 
teach us how to be creative and to make
our<00:04:12.030> own<00:04:12.209> designs<00:04:12.600> so<00:04:13.260> let<00:04:13.410> me<00:04:13.560> have<00:04:13.830> that

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
our own designs so let me have that

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.030 
our own designs so let me have that
experience<00:04:14.760> as<00:04:14.940> we<00:04:15.090> go<00:04:15.240> along<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.810> think<00:04:16.709> kids

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
experience as we go along I think kids

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.849 
experience as we go along I think kids
have<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:18.180> opportunity<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:19.079> kind<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:19.440> tinker

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
have the opportunity to kind of tinker

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.920 
have the opportunity to kind of tinker
they<00:04:20.370> get<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.669> think<00:04:20.970> about<00:04:21.060> something<00:04:21.750> but

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
they get to think about something but

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.650 
they get to think about something but
then<00:04:22.140> also<00:04:23.040> actually<00:04:23.310> build<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.090> create<00:04:24.630> it

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
then also actually build it create it

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.890 
then also actually build it create it
and<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.830> process<00:04:26.400> fix<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.540> when<00:04:27.720> things

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
and in that process fix it when things

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.610 
and in that process fix it when things
go<00:04:28.169> wrong<00:04:28.910> it's<00:04:29.910> an<00:04:30.090> incredible<00:04:30.630> value<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:31.440> I

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
go wrong it's an incredible value that I

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.710 
go wrong it's an incredible value that I
think<00:04:32.040> is<00:04:32.160> lacking<00:04:32.400> where<00:04:33.030> they<00:04:33.300> don't<00:04:33.480> have<00:04:33.690> a

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
think is lacking where they don't have a

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.050 
think is lacking where they don't have a
class<00:04:34.080> like<00:04:34.410> this<00:04:34.710> or<00:04:34.950> like<00:04:34.980> an<00:04:35.250> art<00:04:35.490> class<00:04:35.669> or

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
class like this or like an art class or

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.670 
class like this or like an art class or

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
night when I put all the sculptures so

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.659 
night when I put all the sculptures so
there's<00:04:46.080> like<00:04:46.200> 80<00:04:46.500> sculptures<00:04:47.220> in<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.370> front

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
of my room

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.780 
of my room
and<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.810> was<00:04:48.960> really<00:04:49.260> amazing<00:04:49.770> thinking<00:04:50.520> of

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
and it was really amazing thinking of

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.580 
and it was really amazing thinking of
where<00:04:51.030> we<00:04:51.060> started<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:51.870> where<00:04:51.930> we<00:04:52.169> ended<00:04:52.500> up

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
where we started and where we ended up

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.950 
where we started and where we ended up
just<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.130> variety<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.820> ideas<00:04:54.120> and<00:04:54.840> the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
just a variety of ideas and the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.780 
just a variety of ideas and the
ingenuity<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:55.830> had<00:04:56.070> but<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:56.490> should<00:04:56.700> be

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
ingenuity you had but you should be

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.030 
ingenuity you had but you should be
really<00:04:57.000> proud<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:57.870> just<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:58.350> cool<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.890> look

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
really proud it's just so cool to look

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.860 
really proud it's just so cool to look
at<00:04:59.190> them<00:04:59.370> all<00:04:59.520> together<00:04:59.730> because<00:05:00.210> it's<00:05:00.630> really

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
at them all together because it's really

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.409 
at them all together because it's really
very<00:05:01.050> cool

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.290 

in<00:05:04.900> kinetic<00:05:05.409> because<00:05:05.800> it<00:05:06.159> was<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.550> its<00:05:06.669> own<00:05:06.789> so

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
in kinetic because it was on its own so

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.469 
in kinetic because it was on its own so
it<00:05:07.330> blows<00:05:07.629> winds

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.860

mean<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.220> did<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.490> math<00:05:22.729> to<00:05:22.940> figure<00:05:22.970> out<00:05:23.240> the

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
mean you did the math to figure out the

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.980 
mean you did the math to figure out the
balance<00:05:24.550> which<00:05:25.550> is<00:05:25.729> 2<00:05:26.330> inches<00:05:26.539> by<00:05:26.780> 2<00:05:26.840> inches

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
balance which is 2 inches by 2 inches

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.070 
balance which is 2 inches by 2 inches
yeah<00:05:27.919> so<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.520> didn't<00:05:29.090> copy<00:05:29.389> that

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
yeah so I didn't copy that

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.840 
yeah so I didn't copy that
it's<00:05:30.470> pretty<00:05:30.710> exciting<00:05:30.979> to<00:05:31.160> see<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.430> kids<00:05:31.460> get

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
it's pretty exciting to see the kids get

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.070 
it's pretty exciting to see the kids get
engaged<00:05:32.240> in<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:32.539> work<00:05:32.720> that<00:05:32.750> they're<00:05:33.020> doing

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
engaged in the work that they're doing

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.900 
engaged in the work that they're doing
to<00:05:33.650> take<00:05:33.919> ownership<00:05:34.190> of<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.550> work<00:05:34.729> they're

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
to take ownership of the work they're

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.480 
to take ownership of the work they're
doing<00:05:34.940> feel<00:05:35.419> responsible<00:05:36.110> for<00:05:36.169> it<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.740> then

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
doing feel responsible for it and then

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.860 
doing feel responsible for it and then
be<00:05:37.639> able<00:05:37.729> to<00:05:37.850> talk<00:05:38.060> about<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.539> things<00:05:38.720> that

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
be able to talk about the things that

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.150 
be able to talk about the things that
they're<00:05:39.020> learning<00:05:39.139> so<00:05:39.560> that<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.830> have<00:05:39.949> this

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
they're learning so that you have this

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.879 
they're learning so that you have this
side<00:05:40.430> balancing<00:05:40.970> this<00:05:41.120> side<00:05:41.560> sometimes<00:05:42.560> I

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
side balancing this side sometimes I

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.490 
side balancing this side sometimes I
think<00:05:42.949> we<00:05:43.190> get<00:05:43.340> too<00:05:43.639> concerned<00:05:44.300> about<00:05:45.199> the

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
think we get too concerned about the

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.990 
think we get too concerned about the
standards<00:05:46.100> and<00:05:46.250> there's<00:05:46.490> an<00:05:46.610> assumption

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
standards and there's an assumption

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.430 
standards and there's an assumption
behind<00:05:47.330> a<00:05:47.690> lot<00:05:47.900> of<00:05:47.930> that<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.350> we<00:05:48.410> actually

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
behind a lot of that that we actually

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.230 
behind a lot of that that we actually
know<00:05:48.949> what<00:05:49.280> our<00:05:49.400> kids<00:05:49.610> are<00:05:49.669> going<00:05:49.850> to<00:05:49.910> face<00:05:50.060> in

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
know what our kids are going to face in

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.680 
know what our kids are going to face in
the<00:05:50.270> future
