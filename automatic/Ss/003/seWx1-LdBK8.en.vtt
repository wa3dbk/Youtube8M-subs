now it takes less time to run your
commands<00:00:47.070> well<00:00:47.399> let's<00:00:47.760> check<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
commands well let's check it out one of

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.260 
commands well let's check it out one of
the<00:00:48.780> main<00:00:48.960> things<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.950> found<00:00:50.270> really

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the main things that we found really

holding<00:00:51.629> back<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> jet<00:00:52.170> book<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.940> time

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
holding back the jet book was the time

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.790 
holding back the jet book was the time
it<00:00:54.120> took<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> click<00:00:54.600> anything<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.289> let's<00:00:55.680> go

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it took to click anything so let's go

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:06.740 
it took to click anything so let's go
ahead<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:55.980> try<00:00:56.340> some<00:00:56.579> stuff<00:01:00.020> back<00:01:02.149> library<00:01:05.750> 50

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
ahead and try some stuff back library 50

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
ahead and try some stuff back library 50
states<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.670> little

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
states you can see that it's a little

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.490 
states you can see that it's a little
quicker<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.510> would<00:01:09.930> say<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> little

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
quicker I would say it's a little

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.620 
quicker I would say it's a little
quicker<00:01:10.850> obviously<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:11.939> don't<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> jet

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
quicker obviously we don't have to jet

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.300 
quicker obviously we don't have to jet
book<00:01:12.780> codes<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> compare<00:01:13.500> side-by-side<00:01:13.710> but

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
book codes to compare side-by-side but

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.789 
book codes to compare side-by-side but
you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.670> always<00:01:15.000> check<00:01:15.780> our<00:01:15.840> past<00:01:16.200> videos<00:01:16.560> and

you can always check our past videos and
see<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.159> struggles<00:01:18.030> we've<00:01:18.360> had<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.840> them

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
see the struggles we've had with them

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410 
see the struggles we've had with them
loading<00:01:19.500> times<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.920> those<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.400> does<00:01:21.119> look<00:01:21.270> like

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
loading times on those so does look like

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
loading times on those so does look like
it's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.689> little<00:01:21.869> bit<00:01:21.960> quicker<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> would<00:01:22.619> say

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
it's a little bit quicker so I would say

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580 
it's a little bit quicker so I would say
that<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:24.030> does<00:01:24.270> take<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.750> little<00:01:24.930> bit<00:01:25.110> less<00:01:25.320> time

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that it does take a little bit less time

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.190 
that it does take a little bit less time
to<00:01:25.830> run<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.700> commands<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.390> let's<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.110> to

we're pressing the hardware keys at the
bottom<00:04:35.720> of<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.169> device<00:04:36.910> show<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.180> while

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
bottom of the device show you this while

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:46.990 
bottom of the device show you this while
we<00:04:38.450> do<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:40.540> so<00:04:41.540> let's<00:04:41.750> go<00:04:41.900> back<00:04:43.389> back<00:04:44.389> I<00:04:46.000> would

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
we do it so let's go back back I would

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.490 
we do it so let's go back back I would
say<00:04:47.180> it's<00:04:47.330> going<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.780> little<00:04:48.020> bit<00:04:48.230> quicker

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
say it's going a little bit quicker

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.610 
say it's going a little bit quicker
let's<00:04:48.919> just<00:04:49.130> do<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.460> navigation<00:04:50.120> with<00:04:50.300> the

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
let's just do the navigation with the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.220 
let's just do the navigation with the
keys<00:04:51.620> instead<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.310> pen<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:53.810> let's<00:04:53.930> go<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.200> a

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
keys instead of the pen so let's go to a

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:01.840 
keys instead of the pen so let's go to a
recent<00:04:54.560> reading<00:04:54.940> that's<00:04:55.940> okay<00:04:58.660> let's<00:04:59.660> go<00:05:00.850> down

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
recent reading that's okay let's go down

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.560 
recent reading that's okay let's go down
to<00:05:03.190> three<00:05:04.190> musketeers<00:05:04.700> again<00:05:04.910> just<00:05:05.150> open<00:05:05.540> that

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
to three musketeers again just open that

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:12.940 
to three musketeers again just open that
up<00:05:06.130> crack<00:05:07.130> that<00:05:07.310> open<00:05:09.310> yeah<00:05:10.600> honestly<00:05:11.950> it's

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
up crack that open yeah honestly it's

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.850 
up crack that open yeah honestly it's
not<00:05:13.130> too<00:05:13.820> much<00:05:14.120> of<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.450> difference<00:05:14.870> but<00:05:15.050> it<00:05:15.110> is

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
not too much of a difference but it is

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.620 
not too much of a difference but it is
indeed<00:05:16.280> going<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.820> little<00:05:16.970> bit<00:05:17.150> quicker<00:05:17.360> you

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
indeed going a little bit quicker you

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.520 
indeed going a little bit quicker you
find<00:05:17.960> it<00:05:18.729> less<00:05:19.729> laggy<00:05:20.000> with<00:05:20.510> those<00:05:20.720> big<00:05:21.169> ten

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
find it less laggy with those big ten

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.800 
find it less laggy with those big ten
second<00:05:22.130> gaps<00:05:22.370> of<00:05:22.669> just<00:05:22.880> you<00:05:23.330> don't<00:05:23.450> know<00:05:23.660> if

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
second gaps of just you don't know if

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.390 
second gaps of just you don't know if
you<00:05:23.930> really<00:05:24.200> clicked<00:05:24.470> anything<00:05:24.919> or<00:05:25.130> it's<00:05:25.250> not

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
you really clicked anything or it's not

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.150 
you really clicked anything or it's not
processing<00:05:26.000> or<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.510> is<00:05:26.660> but<00:05:27.200> you<00:05:27.440> can't<00:05:27.950> really

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
processing or it is but you can't really

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.280 
processing or it is but you can't really
tell<00:05:28.370> because<00:05:28.580> there's<00:05:28.820> no<00:05:28.910> bar<00:05:29.180> so<00:05:29.570> I<00:05:29.780> would

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
tell because there's no bar so I would

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.990 
tell because there's no bar so I would
have<00:05:30.470> to<00:05:30.680> say<00:05:30.710> there<00:05:31.160> is<00:05:31.430> an<00:05:31.610> improvement

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
have to say there is an improvement

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.820 
have to say there is an improvement
obviously<00:05:32.690> because<00:05:33.110> I<00:05:33.350> mean<00:05:33.530> it's<00:05:33.620> not<00:05:33.710> only

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
obviously because I mean it's not only

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.770 
obviously because I mean it's not only
that<00:05:33.950> they<00:05:34.190> claim<00:05:34.490> there<00:05:34.729> is<00:05:34.760> one<00:05:35.060> you<00:05:35.570> can

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
that they claim there is one you can

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.600 
that they claim there is one you can
kind<00:05:36.020> of<00:05:36.110> see<00:05:36.260> here<00:05:36.440> it's<00:05:36.770> going<00:05:37.190> a<00:05:37.340> little<00:05:37.460> bit

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
kind of see here it's going a little bit

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.430 
kind of see here it's going a little bit
quicker<00:05:37.850> at<00:05:38.330> least<00:05:38.570> with<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.780> hardware<00:05:39.020> keys

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
quicker at least with the hardware keys

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.520 
quicker at least with the hardware keys
and<00:05:40.390> one<00:05:41.390> of<00:05:41.510> the<00:05:41.600> last<00:05:41.750> things<00:05:41.900> I<00:05:42.229> said
