son I had to have a hysterectomy I was
hemorrhaging<00:01:10.750> pretty<00:01:11.290> bad<00:01:11.500> my<00:01:11.800> cycles<00:01:12.250> lasted

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
hemorrhaging pretty bad my cycles lasted

hemorrhaging pretty bad my cycles lasted
about<00:01:12.759> 3<00:01:13.090> or<00:01:13.119> 4<00:01:13.270> months

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
about 3 or 4 months

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.070 
about 3 or 4 months
which<00:01:13.930> isn't<00:01:14.229> normal<00:01:14.710> for<00:01:15.490> women<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:16.119> couldn't

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
which isn't normal for women I couldn't

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.990 
which isn't normal for women I couldn't
stop<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.450> bleeding<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:20.110> we<00:01:20.740> found<00:01:21.640> out<00:01:21.850> that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
stop the bleeding and we found out that

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.080 
stop the bleeding and we found out that
the<00:01:22.150> reason<00:01:22.479> why<00:01:22.690> I<00:01:23.140> my<00:01:24.100> cycles<00:01:24.580> continued<00:01:24.970> of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
the reason why I my cycles continued of

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.520 
the reason why I my cycles continued of
what<00:01:25.180> they<00:01:25.300> did<00:01:25.360> is<00:01:25.780> because<00:01:26.080> of<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.290> dairy

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
what they did is because of the dairy

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.450 
what they did is because of the dairy
products<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.640> was<00:01:28.979> consuming<00:01:29.979> which<00:01:30.280> at

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
products that I was consuming which at

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.870 
products that I was consuming which at
that<00:01:30.490> time<00:01:30.640> was<00:01:30.970> 2%<00:01:31.440> milk<00:01:32.440> so<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.460> hormones

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
that time was 2% milk so the hormones

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.950 
that time was 2% milk so the hormones
within<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.390> milk<00:01:34.690> was<00:01:35.530> causing<00:01:36.220> my<00:01:36.790> blood<00:01:37.659> to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
within the milk was causing my blood to

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.710 
within the milk was causing my blood to
not<00:01:38.110> clot<00:01:38.409> and<00:01:38.650> stop<00:01:38.950> oh<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:39.909> milk<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.600> I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
not clot and stop oh the the milk that I

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.780 
not clot and stop oh the the milk that I
was<00:01:40.960> drinking<00:01:41.380> was<00:01:41.470> causing<00:01:41.890> my<00:01:42.040> cycles

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
was drinking was causing my cycles

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.240 
was drinking was causing my cycles
Sonata<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.750> end<00:01:43.960> once<00:01:44.680> I<00:01:44.770> stopped<00:01:45.040> drinking

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
Sonata to end once I stopped drinking

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.190 
Sonata to end once I stopped drinking
milk<00:01:45.640> then<00:01:45.850> my<00:01:45.970> cycles<00:01:46.510> were<00:01:46.630> more<00:01:46.900> under

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
milk then my cycles were more under

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.789 
milk then my cycles were more under
control<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:48.070> so<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.909> was<00:01:49.180> able<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.600> have<00:01:50.500> a

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
control and so I was able to have a

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.310 
control and so I was able to have a
hysterectomy<00:01:51.640> which<00:01:52.600> was<00:01:52.840> caused<00:01:53.049> by<00:01:53.290> a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
hysterectomy which was caused by a

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.880 
hysterectomy which was caused by a

that I've been researching a lot what it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.949 
that I've been researching a lot what it
takes<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.440> be<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> vegan<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.959> additional

takes to be a vegan and additional

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.390 
takes to be a vegan and additional
reasons<00:02:20.230> why<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.440> would<00:02:20.680> want<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.190> it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
reasons why I would want to do it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.860 
reasons why I would want to do it
because<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> dairy<00:02:22.180> products<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.690> really

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
because of the dairy products I really

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.310 
because of the dairy products I really
stopped<00:02:23.970> consuming<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.030> lot<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.299> dairy<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.200> it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
stopped consuming a lot of dairy so it

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.199 
stopped consuming a lot of dairy so it
was<00:02:26.620> almost<00:02:26.799> like<00:02:27.040> an<00:02:27.190> easy<00:02:27.430> transition<00:02:27.760> to

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
was almost like an easy transition to

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.120 
was almost like an easy transition to
not<00:02:28.600> have<00:02:28.810> any<00:02:29.019> dairy<00:02:29.170> products<00:02:29.590> at<00:02:29.739> all<00:02:29.890> I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
also am NOT an egg eater so it was easy

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.860
