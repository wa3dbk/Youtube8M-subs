forward<00:01:07.380> he's<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.369> good<00:01:08.970> with<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.150> ball<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
forward he's very good with a ball and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
forward he's very good with a ball and
he's<00:01:10.020> very<00:01:10.140> difficult<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> dispossess<00:01:11.640> with

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
he's very difficult to dispossess with

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.000 
he's very difficult to dispossess with
the<00:01:12.000> ball<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.780> relieves<00:01:13.320> pressure<00:01:13.590> in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the ball and that relieves pressure in

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
the ball and that relieves pressure in
the<00:01:14.490> midfield<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> thought<00:01:15.450> he<00:01:15.600> had<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.750> very

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the midfield so I thought he had a very

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
the midfield so I thought he had a very
good<00:01:16.020> game<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:16.920> he<00:01:17.009> gets<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> box

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
good game but when he gets to the box

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
good game but when he gets to the box
though<00:01:18.000> there's<00:01:18.420> no<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.810> product<00:01:19.229> who<00:01:19.380> gets<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
though there's no in product who gets it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.219 
though there's no in product who gets it
so<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.189> twice<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:21.150> today<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.720> time<00:01:21.960> he<00:01:22.080> got

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229

offers a different type of problem to
the<00:01:44.430> opposition<00:01:44.720> when<00:01:45.720> he<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.990> when<00:01:46.110> he's<00:01:46.320> got

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the opposition when he get when he's got

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.289 
the opposition when he get when he's got
the<00:01:46.590> ball<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.950> his<00:01:47.070> feet<00:01:47.100> trust<00:01:47.670> me<00:01:47.850> he's<00:01:47.970> very

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the ball at his feet trust me he's very

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
the ball at his feet trust me he's very
difficult<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> dispossess<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.280> makes

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
difficult to dispossess and that makes

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.950 
difficult to dispossess and that makes
him<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:50.759> threatening<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.450> forward<00:01:51.810> so

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
him very threatening going forward so

tomorrow arm you know we don't know what

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.200 
tomorrow arm you know we don't know what
they're<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.009> yet<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.250> those<00:01:59.969> were

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
they're going to do yet but those were

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.230 
they're going to do yet but those were
free<00:02:00.659> massive<00:02:01.320> points<00:02:01.649> today<00:02:01.909> can<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:02.939> get

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
free massive points today can we get

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
free massive points today can we get
that<00:02:03.329> further<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.930> spot<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.979> know<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that further for spot you know what a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.490 
that further for spot you know what a
few<00:02:05.610> weeks<00:02:05.759> ago<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:07.110> skeptical

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
few weeks ago I was a little skeptical

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.139 
few weeks ago I was a little skeptical
but<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> last<00:02:08.160> couple<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.520> weeks<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.910> seen

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
but in the last couple of weeks I'm seen

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
but in the last couple of weeks I'm seen
signs<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> we're<00:02:09.810> picking<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.229> play<00:02:10.560> picking

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
signs that we're picking up play picking

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.900 
signs that we're picking up play picking
up<00:02:11.459> momentum<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:13.140> think<00:02:13.379> we<00:02:13.440> can<00:02:13.560> do<00:02:13.709> it

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
up momentum and I think we can do it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.970 
up momentum and I think we can do it
definitely<00:02:14.330> definitely<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:15.020> mean<00:02:15.290> before<00:02:15.530> like

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
definitely definitely I mean before like

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.060 
definitely definitely I mean before like
I<00:02:16.070> said<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.340> was<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.580> little<00:02:16.820> skeptical<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
I said I was a little skeptical but the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.790 
I said I was a little skeptical but the
last<00:02:19.280> couple<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.850> performances<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:21.590> saw

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
last couple of performances and you saw

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.230 
last couple of performances and you saw
the<00:02:21.860> way<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.250> team<00:02:22.460> were<00:02:22.580> fighting<00:02:23.000> for<00:02:23.120> the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
the way the team were fighting for the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.420 
the way the team were fighting for the
ball<00:02:23.390> today<00:02:23.630> fighting<00:02:24.080> for<00:02:24.350> each<00:02:24.440> other<00:02:24.680> there

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
ball today fighting for each other there

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.910 
ball today fighting for each other there
seems<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.820> be<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.330> bit<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.380> momentum<00:02:27.890> shift

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
seems to be a bit of a momentum shift

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.070 
seems to be a bit of a momentum shift
and<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:29.060> think<00:02:29.270> things<00:02:29.480> are<00:02:29.600> going<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:30.050> the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
and I think things are going in the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.820 
and I think things are going in the
right<00:02:30.260> way<00:02:30.470> I'm<00:02:30.680> positive<00:02:31.100> definitely<00:02:31.730> yeah
