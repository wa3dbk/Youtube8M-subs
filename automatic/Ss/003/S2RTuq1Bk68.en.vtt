00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
you can even kind of move his hair out

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.660 
you can even kind of move his hair out
of<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.030> way<00:02:36.150> make<00:02:36.540> them<00:02:36.570> ball<00:02:36.980> weird<00:02:37.980> anyway<00:02:38.640> I

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
of the way make them ball weird anyway I

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.640 
of the way make them ball weird anyway I
am<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.390> tried<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.930> take<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.200> head<00:02:40.320> off<00:02:40.440> it

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
am I tried to take the head off it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.260 
am I tried to take the head off it
really<00:02:40.740> doesn't<00:02:41.100> want<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.280> come<00:02:41.400> off<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.240> I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
really doesn't want to come off so I

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.700 
really doesn't want to come off so I
don't<00:02:42.450> want<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.630> force<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.050> maybe<00:02:43.200> break<00:02:43.470> it

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
don't want to force and maybe break it

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.590 
don't want to force and maybe break it
because<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.880> other<00:02:45.000> figure<00:02:45.300> comes<00:02:45.510> with

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
because I the other figure comes with

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.690 
because I the other figure comes with
extra<00:02:46.350> head<00:02:46.530> too<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.310> thought<00:02:47.460> maybe<00:02:47.580> we

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
extra head too and I thought maybe we

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.300 
extra head too and I thought maybe we
can<00:02:47.850> put<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.120> here<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.800> didn't<00:02:50.130> want<00:02:50.250> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
can put it on here but I didn't want to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.700 
can put it on here but I didn't want to
mess<00:02:50.430> with<00:02:50.460> it<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.600> anyway<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.260> can<00:02:52.290> see<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
mess with it but anyway you can see the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.580 
mess with it but anyway you can see the
real<00:02:52.860> fine<00:02:53.130> detail<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> jacket<00:02:54.560> which<00:02:55.560> is

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
real fine detail on the jacket which is

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.380 
real fine detail on the jacket which is
like<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.040> said<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.610> like<00:02:56.760> rubbery<00:02:57.120> made<00:02:57.360> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
like I said it's like rubbery made a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.420 
like I said it's like rubbery made a
rubber<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:59.750> articulation<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.080> arms

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
rubber and articulation and the arms

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.370 
rubber and articulation and the arms
it's<00:03:02.430> pretty<00:03:02.670> good<00:03:03.080> was<00:03:04.080> all<00:03:04.260> way<00:03:04.350> around<00:03:04.820> and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
it's pretty good was all way around and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.610 
it's pretty good was all way around and
his<00:03:07.380> hands<00:03:07.830> spin<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.990> little<00:03:09.990> bit<00:03:10.140> here

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
his hands spin a little bit here

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.980 
his hands spin a little bit here
I<00:03:10.700> think<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.820> jackets<00:03:12.240> preventing<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.960> from

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
I think the jackets preventing it from

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.230 
I think the jackets preventing it from
spinning<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.590> way<00:03:13.650> around<00:03:14.030> same<00:03:15.030> thing

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
spinning all the way around same thing

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.240 
spinning all the way around same thing
here<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:18.380> nothing<00:03:19.380> at<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.590> waist<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:20.010> course

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
here and nothing at the waist of course

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.160 
here and nothing at the waist of course
the<00:03:20.970> feet<00:03:21.180> do<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.420> spin<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> little<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.880> one

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
the feet do you spin a little this one

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.520 
the feet do you spin a little this one
does<00:03:25.170> good<00:03:26.100> detail<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.730> boots<00:03:27.470> looks<00:03:28.470> a

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
does good detail on the boots looks a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.880 
does good detail on the boots looks a
little<00:03:28.590> dirty<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:30.470> you've<00:03:31.470> got<00:03:31.620> quite<00:03:31.830> the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
little dirty and you've got quite the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.350 
little dirty and you've got quite the
resemblance<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> actual<00:03:33.090> movie

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
resemblance of the actual movie

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.870 
resemblance of the actual movie
character<00:03:33.780> which<00:03:34.020> is<00:03:34.050> really<00:03:34.500> really<00:03:35.340> nice

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
character which is really really nice

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.710 
character which is really really nice
so<00:03:36.690> when<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.900> watch<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.260> movie<00:03:37.500> you'll<00:03:37.650> see

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
so when you watch the movie you'll see

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.990 
so when you watch the movie you'll see
this<00:03:39.720> resembles<00:03:40.380> him<00:03:40.530> quite<00:03:40.860> well<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:44.000> other

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
this resembles him quite well but other

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.170 
this resembles him quite well but other
than<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.650> it's<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.709> cool<00:03:46.980> piece<00:03:47.430> kind<00:03:48.090> of

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
than that it's a cool piece kind of

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.770 
than that it's a cool piece kind of
boring

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
boring

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.979 
boring
like<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:49.050> said<00:03:49.459> they<00:03:50.459> need<00:03:50.640> some<00:03:50.910> more

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
like I said they need some more

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.259 
like I said they need some more
articulation<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.050> some<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.320> these<00:03:52.380> figures

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
articulation of some of these figures

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.070 
articulation of some of these figures
especially<00:03:54.269> at<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.480> waist<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:54.959> the

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
especially at the waist and that the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.350 
especially at the waist and that the
knees<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:56.040> they<00:03:56.400> should<00:03:56.760> start<00:03:56.970> considering

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
knees so they should start considering

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.150 
knees so they should start considering
that<00:03:57.630> other<00:03:58.320> than<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.590> it's<00:03:58.769> just<00:03:58.800> basically

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
that other than that it's just basically

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.060 
that other than that it's just basically
a<00:03:59.250> statue<00:03:59.989> which<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.140> fine<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.620> looks<00:04:01.800> cool
