joined sneeze sprained ankles are the
most<00:00:48.330> common<00:00:48.659> injuries<00:00:48.900> what<00:00:49.769> we've<00:00:49.979> done

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
most common injuries what we've done

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.590 
most common injuries what we've done
here<00:00:50.400> we've<00:00:50.640> tried<00:00:50.909> an<00:00:51.030> outdoor<00:00:51.390> environment

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
here we've tried an outdoor environment

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.899 
here we've tried an outdoor environment
but<00:00:52.440> more<00:00:52.650> importantly<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.400> put<00:00:53.580> safety

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
but more importantly we can put safety

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.759 
but more importantly we can put safety
procedures<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.659> place<00:00:54.900> with<00:00:55.199> matting

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
procedures in place with matting

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.579 
procedures in place with matting
safety<00:00:56.519> mats<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.510> allow<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.320> coach

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
safety mats and just allow them to coach

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.039 
safety mats and just allow them to coach
but<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.040> if<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.339> do<00:00:59.400> make<00:00:59.729> a<00:00:59.760> mistake<00:01:00.049> we

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
but then if they do make a mistake we

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.020 
but then if they do make a mistake we
take<00:01:01.290> away<00:01:01.470> that<00:01:01.620> risk<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:01.979> an<00:01:02.129> injury<00:01:02.400> which

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
take away that risk of an injury which

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.340 
take away that risk of an injury which
is<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.269> most<00:01:03.449> important<00:01:03.809> things<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.110> want<00:01:04.260> to

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
that just curating a lot more safety

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.900 
that just curating a lot more safety
having<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.139> foam<00:05:14.350> pit<00:05:14.530> we've<00:05:15.220> got<00:05:15.460> here<00:05:15.729> our
