00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.080
 Hello, Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.400
 we will share a local taste in this section 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 "Semirsek" Reviews, Hatay 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.560
 But as always before the materials 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 1 pack of ready-made baklava dumplings 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.960
 350 grams of medium fat minced meat 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 2 pieces of medium onion 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.560
 5 soup sunflower oil 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.120
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.640
 and half a teaspoon of black pepper 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.120
 to lubricate; 3 full tablespoons of butter 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.160
 we can start preparing this delicious pastry of our Hatay 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.560
 Firstly, we are trying to chop our onions finely. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.640
 now we can go to the stove to roast bulbs 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.840
 we put the pot on fire 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.600
 Now we are passing 5 tablespoons sunflower oil 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.960
 and adding our onion 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.520
 roast until the onion is transparent 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.680
 as you can see, the onions are transparent 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.160
 and its volume has shrunk 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.880
 now we add medium fat minced meat 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.360
 I ask you, turn the onion two and don't throw the meat 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.680
 because the raw smell does not give a nice flavor to the dishes 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.800
 we are now roasting eze eze 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.440
 as you can see now is very dark 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.160
 and the grain, we can add salt and black pepper 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.360
 black pepper, especially on the smell 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.960
 Let's mix a few rounds and close the fire now 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.960
 let us cool down 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 In the interior of the semen, we can shape it 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 we are opening ready baklava yufkasını 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.960
 I want to make a warning 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.960
 baklava 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.360
 let it be kept in nylon 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.240
 first we melt the surface of butter we are driving 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.640
 especially for the thin baklava yufkası preferred 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.920
 double 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.720
 then it's quadrupled 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.920
 a little more oil 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.680
 and we're dropping some of the ground beef 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.440
 before a triangle ... 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:06.440
 folding the triangle and giving the amulet shape 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.280
 that's what we're bending in. 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.000
 as you can see there was a nice brioche 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 we're going to put it on top 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.200
 we have placed us in the most useful way 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.920
 now we're running on them a little remaining butter 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.680
 Two trays, let's say that 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.640
 I mean, a pack of baklava yufkasinden such a tray ... 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.840
 There are 2 trays 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.680
 Now we give our 190 degrees to our oven. 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.800
 we cook until golden 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.800
 Semirsek came out of the oven, let's leave it on the serving plate 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.920
 serve with a nice buttermilk or tea 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.920
 and let's eat well 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.600
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.960
 We shared a delicious recipe from our Hatay region 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.600
 as you can see, it's easy to make 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.960
 and try to remember us as soon as possible 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.880
 goodbye...
