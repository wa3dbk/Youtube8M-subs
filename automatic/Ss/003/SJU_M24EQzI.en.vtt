klinsmann<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.979> spoke<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.420> very

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
klinsmann just spoke I think it's very

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.980 
klinsmann just spoke I think it's very
important<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:35.220> press<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:36.390> very

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
important for the press because very

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.030 
important for the press because very
often<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.710> feel<00:01:38.100> distant<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:40.040> especially

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
often we feel distant and especially

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.880 
often we feel distant and especially
when<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.150> whole<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:44.000> team<00:01:45.259> whole<00:01:46.259> country

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
when it's a whole of team whole country

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.450 
when it's a whole of team whole country
being<00:01:47.189> represented<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.509> fell<00:01:48.840> distant<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> we

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
being represented we fell distant and we

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.460 
being represented we fell distant and we
feel<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.329> guys<00:01:51.360> could<00:01:52.229> be

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
feel that you guys could be

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.020 
feel that you guys could be
unapproachable<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.530> is

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
unapproachable so I think that this is

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.420 
unapproachable so I think that this is
very<00:01:57.030> important<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.930> create<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.740> bonds<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
very important to create as bonds and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.649 
very important to create as bonds and
two<00:01:59.850> know<00:02:00.030> each<00:02:00.060> other<00:02:00.450> exchange<00:02:02.390> cards<00:02:03.390> and
