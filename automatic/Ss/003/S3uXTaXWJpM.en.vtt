00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.940 
here in this chaos so let's jump around
the<00:01:45.360> show<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> place<00:01:45.810> off<00:01:46.110> first<00:01:46.650> things

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the show this place off first things

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
the show this place off first things
first<00:01:47.090> there's<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.270> kinds<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> new<00:01:48.720> items

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
first there's all kinds of new items

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.499 
first there's all kinds of new items
here<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.229> I've<00:01:49.439> never<00:01:49.560> even<00:01:49.770> seen<00:01:49.920> um<00:01:50.509> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
here that I've never even seen um the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.350 
here that I've never even seen um the
first<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.470> tree<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.220> do<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.119> see

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
first one is this tree and do you see

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.359 
first one is this tree and do you see
how<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.720> lighter<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.650> side<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.159> then

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
how it's lighter on this side and then

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.700 
how it's lighter on this side and then
darker<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.210> side<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.720> it<00:01:58.409> has<00:01:58.560> this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
darker on this side so it has this

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.910 
darker on this side so it has this
really<00:01:58.799> cool<00:01:59.040> gradient<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.350> very<00:02:01.350> nice<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
really cool gradient to it very nice and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.219 
really cool gradient to it very nice and
then<00:02:02.490> look<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:02.759> these<00:02:02.939> man<00:02:03.299> there's<00:02:03.689> bushes

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
then look at these man there's bushes

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.760 
then look at these man there's bushes
that<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:05.009> behind<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.470> I<00:02:07.470> don't<00:02:07.649> know

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that you can go behind and I don't know

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.229 
that you can go behind and I don't know
if<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.009> was<00:02:08.159> like<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.489> previously<00:02:09.000> but

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
if it was like this previously but

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.149 
if it was like this previously but
there's<00:02:09.390> also<00:02:09.569> fences<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.559> you<00:02:10.859> can<00:02:11.039> go

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
there's also fences that you can go

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.750 
there's also fences that you can go
behind<00:02:11.519> like<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:11.969> rustic

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
behind like now the rustic

and the white picket fence both have a
mechanic<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.290> them<00:02:17.409> to<00:02:17.530> where<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.769> can<00:02:17.920> hide

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
mechanic to them to where you can hide

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.890 
mechanic to them to where you can hide
behind<00:02:18.430> them<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.329> don't<00:02:19.540> know<00:02:19.629> man<00:02:19.780> it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.649 
makes me want to make like a
hide-and-seek<00:02:21.040> map<00:02:21.489> which<00:02:22.180> has<00:02:22.299> already<00:02:22.450> been

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
hide-and-seek map which has already been

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.960 
hide-and-seek map which has already been
done<00:02:22.870> before<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:24.340> let's<00:02:24.489> jump<00:02:24.700> around<00:02:24.909> and

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970

right now I almost need to turn my
volume<00:02:47.140> down<00:02:47.940> okay<00:02:48.940> so<00:02:49.840> let's<00:02:50.019> head<00:02:50.200> up<00:02:50.349> top

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
volume down okay so let's head up top

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.759 
volume down okay so let's head up top
here<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:51.840> don't<00:02:52.840> know<00:02:52.959> if<00:02:53.079> this<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.260> completely

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
here I don't know if this is completely

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.119 
here I don't know if this is completely
true<00:02:54.099> or<00:02:54.250> not<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.730> look<00:02:55.420> at<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.629> trees<00:02:56.129> do

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
true or not but look at the trees do

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.789 
true or not but look at the trees do
they<00:02:57.340> have<00:02:57.639> like<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> random<00:02:58.690> aspect<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.650> them

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
they have like a random aspect to them

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.520 
they have like a random aspect to them
kind<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.579> like<00:03:00.730> trash<00:03:01.139> to<00:03:02.139> where<00:03:02.290> they're

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
kind of like trash to where they're

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.039 
kind of like trash to where they're
randomly<00:03:02.920> generated<00:03:03.639> because<00:03:04.420> i<00:03:04.629> think<00:03:04.870> these

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
randomly generated because i think these

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.899 
randomly generated because i think these
bushes<00:03:05.500> do<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:06.069> ones<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.549> can<00:03:06.730> hide

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
bushes do the ones that you can hide

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.920 
bushes do the ones that you can hide
behind<00:03:07.409> they<00:03:08.409> all<00:03:08.680> look<00:03:09.069> different<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.750> that's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
behind they all look different so that's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.599 
behind they all look different so that's
really<00:03:11.170> cool<00:03:11.379> that<00:03:11.590> that's<00:03:11.769> like<00:03:11.980> an<00:03:12.280> actual

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
really cool that that's like an actual

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.660 
really cool that that's like an actual
element<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.389> game<00:03:13.659> that<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.670> that

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
element of the game that the the that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.229 
element of the game that the the that
some<00:03:15.909> items<00:03:16.120> have<00:03:16.510> random<00:03:17.079> looks<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.799> them

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
some items have random looks to them

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.930 
some items have random looks to them
okay<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.299> i<00:03:19.449> think<00:03:19.569> i<00:03:19.750> need<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.959> job<00:03:20.199> or<00:03:20.819> who<00:03:21.819> i

okay so i think i need a job or who i

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.539 
okay so i think i need a job or who i
made<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.620> then<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:23.799> is<00:03:24.010> like<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.370> mini

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
made it and then this is like a mini

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.659 
made it and then this is like a mini
little<00:03:24.940> hangout<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:26.400> everyone's<00:03:27.400> just
