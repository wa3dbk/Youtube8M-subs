00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.799
 hello I am diane specialist of the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.780
 fabric painting and textile felt 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.320
 Creative also stencils and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.219
 kits for use on fabric 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.350
 today what am I going to invite you 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.000
 to realize it's a little bag all 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.980
 simple to store the pajamas of your 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.590
 children for example at the foot of the bed for 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.220
 this we need a pocket in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 cotton here I choose chocolate from a 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.840
 felt 1 textile painting of a 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.630
 sandpaper abecedary of a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.500
 rule of a pencil or 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 white pencil parchment paper and an iron 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.620
 to redo 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.930
 the first step is to go back 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.340
 in your sandpaper bag the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.140
 sandpaper will allow to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.989
 hold your fabric in place so that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.210
 you can work to work 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 on chocolate cotton we will use a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.050
 white pencil like that it's 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.969
 a colored pencil of your children in 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.010
 the kits you can use it on 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.140
 the fabric if you are on light fabric 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.140
 use a simple pencil 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.509
 then I will mark the locations 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.509
 of my texts 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.340
 to be able to work then I will 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.800
 use a stencil that presents 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.990
 letters and a textile paint pen 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.660
 which will enable us to achieve on 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.930
 background is a drawing of our choice I 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:41.540
 I'm going to draw in blue on my background 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.540
 chocolate with my textile photo 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.130
 so I finished writing with the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.070
 textile paint pens on my bag 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.590
 I'm going to fix the train fire thanks to the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.840
 parchment paper and especially iron to 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.570
 iron without steam temperature one 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.870
 that you simply apply on the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.870
 scriptures 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.800
 you know now how to achieve 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.990
 a bag to store the pajamas of course 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.610
 it can adapt to all topics you 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.100
 have seen it's easy from felt to 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.700
 textile a cotton object and you 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.700
 draw on it
