00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.980 
as a finger spinner your variations are
slightly<00:00:07.250> different<00:00:07.630> they're<00:00:08.630> going<00:00:08.750> to<00:00:08.840> come

the ball to spin a little bit bigger
you've<00:00:13.070> got<00:00:13.219> a<00:00:13.250> little<00:00:13.400> bit<00:00:13.490> lower<00:00:13.699> with<00:00:13.940> your

not<00:00:22.970> quite<00:00:23.150> spinning<00:00:23.600> but<00:00:24.350> some<00:00:24.620> will<00:00:24.740> call<00:00:24.890> it

natural<00:00:25.460> variation<00:00:26.030> that<00:00:26.180> you'll<00:00:26.270> heard

natural variation that you'll heard
quite<00:00:27.170> some<00:00:27.289> time<00:00:27.470> but<00:00:27.619> I'm<00:00:28.039> pretty<00:00:28.280> sure

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
quite some time but I'm pretty sure

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.590 
quite some time but I'm pretty sure
there<00:00:28.670> will<00:00:28.730> be<00:00:28.789> times<00:00:29.060> when<00:00:29.180> it<00:00:29.360> looks<00:00:29.480> the

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
there will be times when it looks the

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.570 
there will be times when it looks the
lower<00:00:29.810> ease<00:00:29.990> arm<00:00:30.170> ever<00:00:30.380> so<00:00:30.530> slightly<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.070> get

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
lower ease arm ever so slightly and get

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.250 
lower ease arm ever so slightly and get
that<00:00:31.760> ball<00:00:31.940> to<00:00:31.970> skid<00:00:32.300> I'm<00:00:32.419> in<00:00:32.570> theory<00:00:32.989> as<00:00:33.140> an

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
that ball to skid I'm in theory as an

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.350 
that ball to skid I'm in theory as an
osprey<00:00:33.530> you've<00:00:33.980> got<00:00:34.129> two<00:00:34.309> balls<00:00:34.579> but<00:00:34.789> there

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
osprey you've got two balls but there

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.840 
osprey you've got two balls but there
are<00:00:35.449> big<00:00:35.600> variations<00:00:36.379> in<00:00:37.190> that<00:00:37.249> off<00:00:37.550> spinner

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
are big variations in that off spinner

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.329 
are big variations in that off spinner
so<00:00:38.329> you<00:00:38.420> can<00:00:38.569> release<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:38.960> ball<00:00:39.140> over<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.129> top

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
so you can release the ball over the top

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.319 
so you can release the ball over the top
and<00:00:40.460> you're<00:00:40.579> gonna<00:00:40.670> get<00:00:40.789> more<00:00:40.940> of<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.089> top

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
and you're gonna get more of a top

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.410 
and you're gonna get more of a top
spinning<00:00:41.600> off<00:00:41.780> Bru<00:00:42.190> got<00:00:43.190> 45<00:00:43.940> degrees<00:00:44.300> you're

drift away in the air ever so slightly

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.770 
drift away in the air ever so slightly
probably<00:01:27.970> trying<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.270> loose<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.570> ball<00:01:28.750> a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
to come over the top if you see the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.090 
to come over the top if you see the
thumb<00:03:04.600> in<00:03:04.840> my<00:03:05.020> opinion<00:03:05.410> there's<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.950> good

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
thumb in my opinion there's a good

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.199 
thumb in my opinion there's a good
chance<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.489> could<00:03:06.670> be<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.850> do<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.150> the

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
chance of that could be the do for the

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.520 
chance of that could be the do for the
top<00:03:07.360> spinner<00:03:07.600> your<00:03:07.989> ball<00:03:08.200> they're<00:03:08.380> off

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
top spinner your ball they're off

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.720 
top spinner your ball they're off
spinner<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.070> they're<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:09.580> with<00:03:09.700> a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
spinner and they're do so with a

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.220 
spinner and they're do so with a
scramble<00:03:09.970> soon<00:03:10.300> because<00:03:10.600> it's<00:03:10.750> making<00:03:10.989> it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
scramble soon because it's making it

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.930 
scramble soon because it's making it
harder<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.860> pick<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.280> believe<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> lot

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
harder to pick I believe it is a lot

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.820 
harder to pick I believe it is a lot
easier<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.270> ball<00:03:13.540> from<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.840> more<00:03:14.050> open<00:03:14.440> position

this<00:03:16.780> wrist<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.590> have<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.770> come<00:03:17.950> around<00:03:18.040> and

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
this wrist you have to come around and

this wrist you have to come around and
it<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.000> ball<00:03:19.239> ball<00:03:19.420> from<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.690> wrist<00:03:19.870> not
