 hello to all dear subscribers and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.420
 channel viewers my name is sergey and we 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.990
 continue to do reviews for mods 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.510
 skyrim and today we will have a very a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.859
 parts of an unusual mod well let's tell 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.039
 more details be started as they say 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.830
 itself 3 nasty to today here 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.170
 we will be weapons and in fact it is usually 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.109
 mug no this weapon you nothing 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.850
 does not represent it as they say bad 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.989
 part but now the good part is this weapon 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.969
 very realistic author makes a weapon 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.460
 that is, this one, that is, knock 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.570
 just a sword but hiv and from real like 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.640
 says on the move an extra walker like 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.890
 The author relied on archaeological 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.980
 finds of any historians and so on 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.719
 who are addicted to all these are looking for running 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.039
 there are still swords in the old castle 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.000
 actually this drawing all the pictures 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.480
 there probably 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.390
 powers of swords he would have these pictures diol 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.680
 these are the seeds now 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.299
 actually the second itself is unusual 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.299
 realistic is the method of creation 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.299
 broken create from the chains you collect the sword 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.540
 piecemeal . 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.200
 here perhaps from cards now became 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.140
 it is necessary to create a guard separately here those 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.750
 perhaps did not I think you all know you 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.220
 find your audience again and play 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.829
 rather, he knows and now stands the sword 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.900
 just a lover of all tiger repaid love 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.229
 here loves loves loves with these whose 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:42.090
 stories so on so here's an apple 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.280
 if anyone knows, there are two types of I until 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.369
 an apple that will eat what? 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.250
 finally attached to the handle itself is not 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.290
 please confuse to steal we collect 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.909
 and fasten and just like we have the sword 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.090
 and just start with some simple 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.710
 materials well, and that's what about us 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.600
 you want to become and as a result too 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.520
 comes out most 1 3 hiv and of course here 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.229
 here is nothing unusual for their swords 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.570
 that is, okay, an unusual creature 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.380
 suppose alright suppose they 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.830
 unusual 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.780
 it's called green for real but how 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.580
 says it all use 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.140
 remaining the whole game us the usual sword itself 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.540
