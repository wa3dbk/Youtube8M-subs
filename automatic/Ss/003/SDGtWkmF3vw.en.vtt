Wexler<00:03:05.330> interesting<00:03:06.330> design<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.080> on<00:03:09.440> see<00:03:10.440> if

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
Wexler interesting design so on see if

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.980 
Wexler interesting design so on see if
we<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:11.010> power<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:12.600> don't<00:03:12.840> read

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
we can power this on I don't read

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.250 
we can power this on I don't read
Russian<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.300> maybe<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.480> little<00:03:15.810> bit<00:03:15.990> difficult

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
Russian so maybe a little bit difficult

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.640 
Russian so maybe a little bit difficult
to<00:03:19.490> power<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.610> on<00:03:20.700> it's<00:03:21.000> not<00:03:21.240> touch<00:03:21.540> screen<00:03:21.960> you

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
to power it on it's not touch screen you

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.780 
to power it on it's not touch screen you
do<00:03:22.830> have<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.070> d-pad<00:03:23.700> interface<00:03:24.300> here<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.670> it

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
do have the d-pad interface here so it

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.280 
do have the d-pad interface here so it
looks<00:03:26.970> like<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.300> doesn't<00:03:27.510> actually<00:03:27.780> come<00:03:28.230> with

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
looks like it doesn't actually come with

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.470 
looks like it doesn't actually come with
a<00:03:28.620> charge<00:03:31.100> or<00:03:32.100> maybe<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.209> power

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
a charge or maybe this is the power

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.449 
a charge or maybe this is the power
button<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:33.990> side<00:03:34.290> here<00:03:36.620> there<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.770> go<00:03:37.980> so

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
button on the side here there you go so

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.390 
button on the side here there you go so
power<00:03:39.120> button<00:03:39.540> on<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.660> side<00:03:39.990> here<00:03:40.410> huh<00:03:40.620> as<00:03:40.860> you

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
power button on the side here huh as you

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:50.750 
power button on the side here huh as you
see<00:03:48.290> looks<00:03:49.290> like<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.770> boot<00:03:50.010> up<00:03:50.160> was<00:03:50.370> fairly

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
see looks like the boot up was fairly

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:18.050 
see looks like the boot up was fairly
fast<00:03:51.180> it's<00:03:52.020> just<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.440> zoom<00:03:52.770> in<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.950> bit<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:53.310> this

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.960 

so<00:04:19.019> here<00:04:19.709> is<00:04:20.150> sort<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.180> an<00:04:21.359> indication<00:04:21.810> on<00:04:22.200> how

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
so here is sort of an indication on how

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:31.400 
so here is sort of an indication on how
the<00:04:23.970> text<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.510> everything<00:04:24.900> looks

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.910 

this<00:04:32.410> button<00:04:32.830> seems<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.610> be<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:35.440> home<00:04:35.650> button

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
this button seems to be the home button

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.640 
this button seems to be the home button
right<00:04:36.160> here

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:54.860 

doesn't<00:04:42.490> seem<00:04:42.820> too<00:04:43.530> terribly<00:04:44.530> responsive

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.560 

so<00:04:55.410> again<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.920> is<00:04:56.070> in<00:04:56.250> Russian<00:04:56.700> we'll<00:04:57.360> figure

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
so again it is in Russian we'll figure

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.600 
so again it is in Russian we'll figure
out<00:04:57.690> how<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.080> put<00:04:58.410> in<00:04:58.530> English<00:04:58.890> firmware<00:04:59.370> for

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
out how to put in English firmware for

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.940 
out how to put in English firmware for
our<00:04:59.700> full<00:04:59.970> review<00:05:00.210> but<00:05:00.930> again<00:05:01.110> this<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.740> the
