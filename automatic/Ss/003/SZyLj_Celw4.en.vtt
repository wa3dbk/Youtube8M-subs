silencing<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> rural<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.269> is

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
silencing for a rural so this I think is

this<00:01:08.580> works<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.299> impact<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.290> wood

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
this works because the impact of wood

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.219 
this works because the impact of wood
preservative<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.240> shown<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.810> copper

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
preservative we have shown that a copper

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.289 
preservative we have shown that a copper
nappin<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> wood<00:01:14.040> preservative<00:01:14.189> which<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.150> have

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
nappin a wood preservative which we have

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.520 
nappin a wood preservative which we have
formerly<00:01:16.220> recommended<00:01:18.140> itself<00:01:19.140> seems<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
formerly recommended itself seems to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.830 
formerly recommended itself seems to
have<00:01:19.619> some<00:01:19.920> problems<00:01:20.340> associated

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.550 

so<00:01:23.140> it's<00:01:23.289> slow<00:01:23.590> down<00:01:24.009> a<00:01:24.340> be<00:01:24.939> learning<00:01:25.570> ability

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
so it's slow down a be learning ability

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.429 
so it's slow down a be learning ability
there's<00:01:27.219> some<00:01:27.369> cognitive<00:01:27.609> costs<00:01:28.539> for<00:01:29.229> means

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
there's some cognitive costs for means

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.529 
there's some cognitive costs for means
that<00:01:29.710> live<00:01:29.890> in<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.130> environment<00:01:30.539> we've

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
that live in that environment we've

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.169 
that live in that environment we've
shown<00:01:31.840> some<00:01:32.170> impacts<00:01:32.979> on<00:01:33.310> honey<00:01:33.520> bee<00:01:33.670> learning

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
to say again is on what's what's the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.310 
to say again is on what's what's the
most<00:03:55.600> important<00:03:56.110> thing<00:03:56.140> on<00:03:56.470> this<00:03:56.560> picture<00:03:56.830> I

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
most important thing on this picture I

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.530 
most important thing on this picture I
think<00:03:59.320> we<00:03:59.470> all<00:03:59.620> agree<00:04:00.070> that<00:04:00.340> all<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:01.360> these

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
think we all agree that all of these

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.010 
think we all agree that all of these
things<00:04:01.840> are<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.740> part<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.760> problem<00:04:04.060> but

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
things are a part of the problem but

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.600 
things are a part of the problem but
what<00:04:05.200> we're<00:04:05.380> trying<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.710> get<00:04:05.860> out<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.070> this<00:04:06.340> is

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
what we're trying to get out of this is

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.080 
what we're trying to get out of this is
a<00:04:06.670> little<00:04:06.910> focus<00:04:07.480> okay<00:04:08.520> we're<00:04:09.520> trying<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.850> say

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
a little focus okay we're trying to say

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.310 
a little focus okay we're trying to say
yeah<00:04:10.570> all<00:04:11.020> these<00:04:11.350> things<00:04:11.410> are<00:04:11.740> a<00:04:11.800> problem<00:04:12.070> but

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
yeah all these things are a problem but

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.110 
yeah all these things are a problem but
this<00:04:14.320> this<00:04:15.960> really<00:04:17.010> causing<00:04:18.120> eighty-five

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
this this really causing eighty-five

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.270 
this this really causing eighty-five
percent<00:04:19.359> of<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.780> morbidity<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:20.590> we<00:04:20.680> see<00:04:20.980> I

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280
