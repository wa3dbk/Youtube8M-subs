00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.460
 hello everyone I bring the myth number 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.740
 94 black ops the zombies on the map 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.020
 shangrila and quite some time ago 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.180
 they said there were some symbols 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.120
 iluminatis goes in and had a 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.879
 good secret messages and in a few 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.800
 you know it rocks typical if 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.690
 my cousin that if my friend that the other thing what 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.339
 has seen that the other has told me about 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.290
 always in the mili a story is worth 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.329
 Well, well, it is totally 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.800
 true is a myth totally true as 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.989
 you are seeing if there are some symbols 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.899
 illuminati in principle well there are about 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.690
 symbols but if we look at the alphabet 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.730
 illuminati we realize that 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.100
 belongs to that alphabet is good and good 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.230
 we can decipher by good 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 photos of the internet and as we have done 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.430
 previously in other myths 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.430
 with the illuminated alphabet and then we can 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.310
 decipher what it is or what type 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.159
 of hidden message there is in this case in 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.050
 the kongs are not worth here do not see much 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.909
 in the above have a little more than 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.290
 light looks a little better on this stone 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.840
 because around the stone is not 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.670
 appreciates very well but they are also of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 made the same symbols the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.960
 same words 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.560
 well here I was deciphering it and in 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.030
 English puts big where the wrap of the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.430
 dragons fire forgive me for 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.000
 pronunciation because it's really bad but 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.100
 good what translating comes to say 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.860
 Beware of the wrath of fire 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.110
 of dragons really good the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.450
 translation is not exact but says have 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.330
 Beware of the wrath of the dragon fire 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.370
 or fire dragons is worth seeing 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.710
 in Spanish it would be the fire of the 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.360
 dragons okay I think it has something that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.220
 do with these stones here as 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.620
 As you can see, there are some dragons 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.360
 fire in these stones also in these 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.360
 same stones are also those same 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.750
 illuminati symbols and just those 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.550
 stones when we open them they are worth 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.290
 to not to this tunnel that is seeing now 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.120
 but the tunnels below that is by 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.570
 where the fire zombie has to pass 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.070
 ok and it goes away we said burning everything 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.050
 what gas pipes are 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.180
 when we do the internet I think that 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.130
 It has something to do with that, I'm not 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.440
 very sure why they put those 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.800
 words what you eat but good places 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.630
 that was the deciphered not of this one 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.910
 these Illuminati phrases that are in the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.620
 gomez and also on those stones so 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.380
 nothing is basically this the myth number 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.390
 94 is totally true to me as you have 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.690
 seen if there are some illuminatis symbols in 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.970
 you eat and there is a phrase hidden in what 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.200
 what was said in his day is worth so nothing 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.209
 basically this is I hope that I have 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.950
 liked to tell you how good I am going to 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.840
 continue with the series that I know you have had 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.190
 a time stop but well let's 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.670
 continue with the ideas and nothing I hope that 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.740
 you liked it, you liked to vote 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.040
 and see you in the next video greetings 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.040
 all 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.610
 but no
