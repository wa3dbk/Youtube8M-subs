quality<00:00:15.620> that<00:00:15.890> we<00:00:16.129> needed<00:00:16.340> but<00:00:17.240> it<00:00:17.359> wasn't

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
quality that we needed but it wasn't

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.710

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
advantages for the TC 300 is that you

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.510 
advantages for the TC 300 is that you
don't<00:04:35.810> have<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.200> drill<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.590> deep<00:04:36.770> hole<00:04:36.980> just<00:04:37.340> a

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
don't have to drill the deep hole just a

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.480 
don't have to drill the deep hole just a
little<00:04:37.790> short<00:04:38.090> one<00:04:38.270> and<00:04:39.010> see<00:04:40.010> if<00:04:40.070> we<00:04:40.190> cut<00:04:40.370> them

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
little short one and see if we cut them

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.940 
little short one and see if we cut them
spindles<00:04:40.940> on<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.150> TC<00:04:41.540> 300<00:04:42.080> you're<00:04:42.530> at<00:04:42.680> two

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
spindles on the TC 300 you're at two

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.670 
spindles on the TC 300 you're at two
cuts<00:04:43.340> per<00:04:43.700> minute<00:04:44.030> or<00:04:44.180> more<00:04:44.450> with<00:04:45.290> this<00:04:45.470> one

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
cuts per minute or more with this one

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.290 
cuts per minute or more with this one
it's<00:04:46.010> gonna<00:04:46.160> you<00:04:46.550> know<00:04:46.580> you're<00:04:47.000> gonna<00:04:47.120> be

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
it's gonna you know you're gonna be

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
it's gonna you know you're gonna be
about<00:04:47.480> a<00:04:47.540> minute<00:04:47.840> per<00:04:47.990> cut<00:04:49.060> so<00:04:50.060> this<00:04:50.210> one<00:04:50.419> takes

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
about a minute per cut so this one takes

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.080 
about a minute per cut so this one takes
a<00:04:51.440> little<00:04:51.590> bit<00:04:51.830> more<00:04:52.010> time<00:04:52.280> but<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.640> still<00:04:52.669> get

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
a little bit more time but you still get

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.150 
a little bit more time but you still get
the<00:04:53.240> accuracy<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.080> it's<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.380> minute<00:04:54.680> per<00:04:54.890> cut

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
the accuracy and it's a minute per cut

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.490 
the accuracy and it's a minute per cut
basically<00:04:55.700> if<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:56.360> consider<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.960> entire

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
the whole

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.110 
the whole
in<00:05:14.059> packs<00:05:14.389> right<00:05:14.659> here<00:05:14.960> okay<00:05:15.860> that's<00:05:16.279> winning

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
in packs right here okay that's winning

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.570 
in packs right here okay that's winning
and<00:05:17.330> then<00:05:17.599> you're<00:05:18.110> raising<00:05:18.559> or<00:05:18.860> lowering<00:05:18.889> ploy

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
and then you're raising or lowering ploy

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.279 
and then you're raising or lowering ploy
