um<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.830> have<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.810> really<00:03:25.810> enforce<00:03:26.560> your

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
um you have to really enforce your

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.380 
um you have to really enforce your
defenses<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.650> can<00:03:29.890> go<00:03:30.040> from<00:03:30.280> dark<00:03:30.850> monkeys

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
defenses you can go from dark monkeys

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.880 
defenses you can go from dark monkeys
which<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.780> most<00:03:31.900> basic<00:03:32.140> form<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.560> defense

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
which is the most basic form of defense

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.289 
which is the most basic form of defense
to<00:03:33.010> super<00:03:33.580> monkeys<00:03:33.970> which<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:34.690> elite<00:03:35.380> and

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
to super monkeys which is like elite and

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.030 
to super monkeys which is like elite and
epic<00:03:37.299> uber<00:03:38.290> some<00:03:38.769> may<00:03:38.950> say<00:03:40.290> but<00:03:41.290> as<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.010> game

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
epic uber some may say but as the game

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.460 
epic uber some may say but as the game
goes<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:42.579> I<00:03:42.910> see<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.570> think<00:03:43.959> at<00:03:44.110> this<00:03:44.260> level

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
goes on I see I think at this level

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.180 
goes on I see I think at this level
you'll<00:03:44.769> start<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.160> see<00:03:45.450> blue<00:03:46.450> balloons

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
you'll start to see blue balloons

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.509 
you'll start to see blue balloons
approaching<00:03:48.190> which<00:03:48.459> need<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.820> be<00:03:49.090> hit<00:03:49.780> twice

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
approaching which need to be hit twice

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.510 
approaching which need to be hit twice
in<00:03:51.519> order<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.060> pop<00:03:52.420> them<00:03:52.600> completely

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
in order to pop them completely

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.950 
in order to pop them completely
so<00:03:55.520> that's<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.850> nice<00:03:56.000> little<00:03:56.180> feature<00:03:56.390> of<00:03:56.630> its

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
so that's a nice little feature of its

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.440 
so that's a nice little feature of its
always<00:03:57.110> getting<00:03:57.500> harder<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:59.150> that's<00:03:59.360> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
always getting harder so that's the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.240 
always getting harder so that's the
basic<00:03:59.750> idea<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.230> can<00:04:00.410> also<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.010> middle<00:04:01.220> of

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
basic idea you can also in the middle of

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.100 
basic idea you can also in the middle of
a<00:04:01.340> level<00:04:01.460> if<00:04:01.670> you're<00:04:01.820> struggling<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.750> can<00:04:02.960> see

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
a level if you're struggling you can see

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.690 
a level if you're struggling you can see
some<00:04:03.350> Road<00:04:03.560> spokes<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.190> put<00:04:04.430> them<00:04:04.550> on<00:04:04.640> the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
some Road spokes and put them on the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.670 
some Road spokes and put them on the
road<00:04:05.000> which<00:04:05.390> will<00:04:05.570> stop<00:04:05.810> any<00:04:06.070> escaping<00:04:07.390> things

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.000 

getting<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:13.370> thee<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:13.940> if<00:04:14.900> they<00:04:15.230> escape<00:04:15.860> your

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
getting to thee and if they escape your

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.130 
getting to thee and if they escape your
defenses<00:04:18.910> why<00:04:19.910> don't<00:04:20.150> some<00:04:20.299> Canadian<00:04:20.810> at<00:04:20.959> the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
defenses why don't some Canadian at the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.860 
defenses why don't some Canadian at the
end<00:04:21.230> of<00:04:21.320> level<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.920> road<00:04:22.400> spikes<00:04:23.330> do<00:04:23.660> get

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
end of level the road spikes do get

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.190 
end of level the road spikes do get
wiped<00:04:24.050> out<00:04:24.230> so<00:04:24.470> don't<00:04:24.620> just<00:04:24.860> waste<00:04:25.070> in<00:04:26.200> but

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
wiped out so don't just waste in but

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.860 
wiped out so don't just waste in but
that<00:04:27.530> is<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.740> general<00:04:28.550> idea<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.180> bloons<00:04:29.600> tower

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
that is the general idea of bloons tower

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.950 
that is the general idea of bloons tower
defense<00:04:30.260> here<00:04:31.040> on<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.550> pause<00:04:31.820> menu<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.780> need

principle of bloons tower defense a

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.430 
principle of bloons tower defense a
really<00:05:01.220> nice<00:05:01.370> little<00:05:01.730> game<00:05:02.290> definitely<00:05:03.290> one

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
really nice little game definitely one

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.920 
really nice little game definitely one
to<00:05:03.470> go<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.860> check<00:05:04.010> out<00:05:04.250> its<00:05:04.580> it's<00:05:05.150> one<00:05:05.360> part<00:05:05.510> 79

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
to go and check out its it's one part 79

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.990 
to go and check out its it's one part 79
to<00:05:06.770> dot<00:05:06.980> 99<00:05:07.720> but<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:09.050> think<00:05:09.770> it's<00:05:10.370> worth<00:05:10.730> it

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
to dot 99 but I think it's worth it

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.820 
to dot 99 but I think it's worth it
because<00:05:11.450> it's<00:05:11.960> probably<00:05:12.140> one<00:05:12.440> of<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.620> best

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
because it's probably one of the best

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.950 
because it's probably one of the best
tower<00:05:13.100> defense<00:05:13.460> games<00:05:13.730> if<00:05:13.940> you<00:05:14.390> will<00:05:14.510> find<00:05:14.780> in

the<00:05:15.050> app<00:05:15.169> store<00:05:16.510> but<00:05:17.650> that's<00:05:18.650> really<00:05:19.060> all

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
the app store but that's really all

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.520 
the app store but that's really all
there<00:05:20.120> is<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.630> say<00:05:20.660> about<00:05:20.810> loose<00:05:21.230> tower

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.720 
there is to say about loose tower
defense<00:05:22.300> so<00:05:23.300> I'll<00:05:23.930> guess<00:05:24.260> I<00:05:24.620> better<00:05:25.430> say

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730
