00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.030
 more how much here has been damaged in the last six months 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.129
 That 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.019
 Empire 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.120
 it is all 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 people who 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.269
 in one go with the same status 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.050
 It is natural 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.329
 an upward trend in the game wilders took over the city at the end of last year 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.590
 regional transport in groningen and drenthe about from arriva the company got right away 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.590
 to endure 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.690
 Save the extreme winter weather, one third of the 350 suffered our damage 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.070
 Figures from the UWV stock market now show that there are in the first six months for such 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.410
 six tons of damage was driven on average, 100,000 euros per month 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.560
 the 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.900
 the oracle room 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.690
 wk and that will be quite a job because the internal memo also showed that there is 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.700
 no less than 45 percent of the cases the damage is not caused by the driver 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.389
 reported 

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.309
 CJO finds an unacceptably high percentage and many drivers also find it 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.909
 in that you state that is unfortunate then but then you must also stand it provisionally 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.499
 posthumus wants to remain a successful company then the damage amount must be the 

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:12.590
 down considerably in the coming months for the management to know and so in 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.850
 worked on a plan of action in consultation with the drivers 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.030
 for example in the form of extra driving skills training erik 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.360
 Amen 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.710
 there can just pick up again there can save the beds and that would according to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.050
 some older drivers in particular are not a superfluous luxury 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.130
 because the training level of vehicle control is no longer what it 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.230
 has been my opinion is that you are used to 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.350
 gerwen 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.590
 because the material must go 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.310
 to take with you 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.710
 yes you can get it 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.480
 the most disadvantage of the broadcasting rights of course 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.350
 but he is a tragedy said it will stay and emea if you body and 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.120
 then you get alone 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.400
 and that works yes or not to do so it also works cube comes to 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.200
 expected in September with an action plan 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.229
 in our province the city of groningen leads the list with a 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.159
 amount of damage of 180,000 euros followed by city canal with around 50,000 euros 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.619
