00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.370
 So far, the Arrow main street are the balance is Allianz but Harth 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.020
 In 1900 the entry of Weinzierl donated an immense sum donated for the construction 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.519
 an orphanage 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.789
 At the neck is a cancellation because it made sense to use the action vacancy 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.630
 Christoph Christoph launched more because «It accompanied an initiation 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.060
 an app for that 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.589
 the vacancy will 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.070
 an initiative from the Gängeviertel 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.410
 each vacancy can be entered there on an overview card 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.410
 A qualified overview is to be created 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.320
 Michael goal is because the Ziad should / on the net 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.490
 the many registered vacancies give a comprehensive overview 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.170
 unused buildings in Hamburg 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.490
 there are certainly other cities where these 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.700
 Who stamped parts are even larger but what is not noticeable is that 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.570
 Hamburg, which itself understands itself as a growing city, also in the innermost core 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.690
 to show a lot of vacant space has to increase at the same time 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.690
 Prices goose ahead especially in the living area 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.360
 also whole castle and Lexa 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.420
 like the former Saxon castle grounds have been empty for years 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.530
 in the city of his solo hits first time 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.020
 The first step is to do independent information for the first time 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.400
 Make available and know the discourses Aachen 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.920
 the landowners association Hamburg device owners in legal and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.510
 structural engineering 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.140
 Torsten Flomm is managing director of the association 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.020
 he doubts the effect of this platform i think that ones 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.659
 Leadership of such 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.399
 currently is very limited if you look Mellendorf a two 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.040
 three four enthusiasts have any homes they believe they are 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.990
 Being empty is enriched with ignorance of health and which 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.520
 Rumors and such publicity through his 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.310
 Website can be achieved to these limits can help anywhere 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.149
 Decision-making processes to advance discussion processes 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.200
 so I think the idea is not bad 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.560
 but you always have to be careful that you do not go over to now percent 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.810
 due to rumors and suspicions only individual property 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.389
 to put in the pillory 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.869
 a central source of information for the first edition did not exist so far 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.809
 the platform test tool that should create transparency 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:20.219
 thus public awareness could be directed to the situation 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.309
 become 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.439
 small successes were already achieved by the vacancy of men 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.789
 become 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.070
 we also had an object on St Pauli 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.210
 which has been empty for many years and many have been in the form of 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.200
 Comments asked what's going on there how incomprehensible that is and then has 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.590
 A construction community reported to the Havel just now finished soon 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.949
 want to start with the renovation work 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:44.239
 and so, at least in this case, the vacancy has several acquisitions 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.929
 also easy to explain why 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:50.989
 Is that the case or what happened there and then there was the direct 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.319
 Inquiry bright how can I contact you I did not feel like 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.589

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:58.949
 anyone can join 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:03.009
 so far, over 200 vacant buildings have been reported on the website 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:05.939
 like the old Hamburger Wasserwerke in the Süderstraße 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.590
 that has been empty for years
