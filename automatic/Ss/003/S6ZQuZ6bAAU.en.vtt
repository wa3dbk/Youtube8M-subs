00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the memory card and then you load the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.880 
the memory card and then you load the
memory<00:01:08.549> card<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:10.010> you<00:01:11.090> counsel<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.890> then

tried<00:02:01.150> it<00:02:01.300> in<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.540> other<00:02:02.190> hex<00:02:03.190> editor<00:02:03.640> which

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
tried it in the other hex editor which

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.560 
tried it in the other hex editor which
is<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:06.610> there

I didn't use it but I found the string
perfectly<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.709> hex<00:02:11.950> workshop<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:13.510> we're<00:02:13.720> just

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
perfectly in hex workshop so we're just

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.940 
perfectly in hex workshop so we're just
gonna<00:02:14.080> take<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.560> file<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.190> drag<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.270> drop<00:02:16.480> it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
line which would be that number there

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.330 
line which would be that number there
which<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.350> zero<00:02:26.740> zero<00:02:27.160> zero<00:02:27.360> one<00:02:28.360> nine<00:02:29.340> okay

raise these attributes up to as high as

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:28.589 
raise these attributes up to as high as
you<00:06:23.979> want<00:06:24.009> but<00:06:25.259> with<00:06:26.259> the<00:06:26.379> new<00:06:26.529> system<00:06:27.389> it<00:06:28.389> only

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 
you want but with the new system it only

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:31.049 
you want but with the new system it only
goes<00:06:28.869> up<00:06:29.019> to<00:06:29.079> 85<00:06:29.679> so<00:06:30.279> no<00:06:30.429> matter<00:06:30.610> what<00:06:30.879> his

00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:31.059 
goes up to 85 so no matter what his

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:33.179 
goes up to 85 so no matter what his
inside<00:06:31.449> shot<00:06:31.779> would<00:06:31.929> never<00:06:32.199> be<00:06:32.379> more<00:06:32.559> than<00:06:32.619> 85

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:33.189 
inside shot would never be more than 85

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:35.789 
inside shot would never be more than 85
that's<00:06:33.969> why<00:06:34.089> you<00:06:34.149> got<00:06:34.299> to<00:06:34.419> be<00:06:34.509> careful<00:06:34.779> he's<00:06:35.769> a

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:35.799 
that's why you got to be careful he's a

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:38.569 
that's why you got to be careful he's a
past<00:06:36.159> first<00:06:36.459> so<00:06:36.639> he's<00:06:36.789> not<00:06:36.909> really<00:06:36.969> a<00:06:37.209> scorer

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:38.579 
past first so he's not really a scorer

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:42.179 
past first so he's not really a scorer
so<00:06:39.579> even<00:06:39.909> in<00:06:40.089> the<00:06:40.179> close<00:06:40.709> what<00:06:41.709> they<00:06:41.829> go<00:06:42.009> up<00:06:42.159> to

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:42.189 
so even in the close what they go up to

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:46.139 
so even in the close what they go up to
90<00:06:42.789> see<00:06:43.059> so<00:06:44.039> anything<00:06:45.039> that<00:06:45.069> you<00:06:45.279> do<00:06:45.639> you<00:06:46.119> have

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.149 
90 see so anything that you do you have

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:55.709 
90 see so anything that you do you have
to<00:06:46.419> be<00:06:46.569> careful<00:06:48.089> shot<00:06:49.089> medium<00:06:54.360> there<00:06:55.360> you<00:06:55.509> have

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719 
to be careful shot medium there you have

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.569 
to be careful shot medium there you have
it<00:06:55.929> but<00:06:57.089> I'm<00:06:58.089> not<00:06:58.209> gonna<00:06:58.389> do<00:06:58.629> it<00:06:58.809> but<00:06:59.579> only

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:00.579 
it but I'm not gonna do it but only

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:03.619 
it but I'm not gonna do it but only
thing<00:07:00.759> you<00:07:00.879> really<00:07:01.059> need<00:07:01.209> for<00:07:01.659> any<00:07:01.959> position

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:03.629 
thing you really need for any position

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:06.659 
thing you really need for any position
so<00:07:04.629> you<00:07:04.689> name<00:07:04.899> went<00:07:05.110> up<00:07:05.199> to<00:07:05.289> 38<00:07:05.709> from<00:07:06.069> 37

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
so you name went up to 38 from 37

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:07.679 
so you name went up to 38 from 37

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:11.080 
enough

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090
