00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.250
 How dear friends are we here today 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.530
 to make some lentil burgers 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.350
 Here we have 400 grams of lentils 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.030
 cooked we are going to put in a bowl 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.030
 these are very easy 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.450
 let's put half a cup of the potato 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.860
 grated if they grab any potato and the 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.820
 reason 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.820
 ah 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.300
 Y 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.030
 here we have parsley sorry that we have 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.920
 basil and garlic chopped as parsley or 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 can be cilantro together with garlic if 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 you do not throw him 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.290
 or which one is used in powder 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.040
 If there is, you can usually put half 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.090
 chopped onion 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.700
 usually think 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.489
 a teaspoon of curry was discovered 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.860
 normal yellow if you do not have no passes 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.860
 nothing can throw cum for example 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.970
 and here we have some old loaves more or 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.970
 minus three or four slices of bread 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.759
 although we have more or less a cup of 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.509
 cubed bread and we throw it there if it's bread 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.509
 hard also the same 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.400
 i 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.710
 Salt 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.710
 in soy sauce we mix all this 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.840
 all always better with the hand 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.840
 burgers are made with death 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:13.800
 well what I'm going to download is a small 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.810
 potato or a medium potato here 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.790
 are actually two small potatoes or one 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.790
 medium potato I'm going to apply 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.819
 I'm going to adjust to have a juice of 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.420
 potatoes 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.870
 They can not equal with any blender 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.260
 or thermos mixed and tomlinson minipimer or what 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.260
 who want 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.180
 we are going to liquefy the potato until it is 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 a juice 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.330
 I'm going to take a little water right 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.569
 so I can beat the potato from Vienna 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.569
 A) Yes 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.950
 we are good all this 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.050
 and let's stand for about 10 minutes 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.700
 now let's put together the hamburgers 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.730
 you arm lan as you want 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.780
 if they can come out five or six small or 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.810
 four big 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.480
 we know so thick the dough is good 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.690
 soft but nothing happens because then 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.140
 when they start cooking they go to 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.140
 start to harden 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.950
 is a 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.760
 i 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.840
 when it's hot a little bit 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.350
 of oil a tablespoon of the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.350
 burgers 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.060
 remember that they are very soft 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.700
 it does not matter because when they cook 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.290
 hardens 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.620
 I can also inform you within the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.620
 same frying pan 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.830
 3 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.220
 and let's cook a few minutes covered 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.220
 two or three minutes 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.830
 well spent like five minutes three 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.240
 we are going to turn around carefully that 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.370
 do not break because they are still very 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.370
 blanditas vale 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.900
 and they disarm a little bit no matter if 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.630
 they are deformed they are not going to be disarmed but 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.960
 can be deformed we transform a 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.759
 bit 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:27.740
 and we cover it we cooked a couple of 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.740
 more minutes up to 5 more minutes 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.509
 let's take some pieces of cheese 

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:36.099
 Vegan cheese can of course see 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.619
 how to make them vegan cheese from our 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.399
 vegan cheese shop online in this 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:41.399
 youtube channel 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.670
 although when the cheese is melted 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.950
 we are going to start to take notice the 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.100
 known that they have already ready the 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.620
 secret of these burgers is that 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.590
 when they cool, they are very hard 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.990
 much richer so the best is 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:07.210
 let them cool or freeze and 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.210
 then heat them to make them 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.290
 before finishing I wanted to show you how 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.820
 the hamburgers are cold and that 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.730
 they are very hard so we can 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.800
 freeze and to eat them only you 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.570
 we give a touch of microwave oven or 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.940
 the iron a little touch nothing more and 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.150
 are ready to consume that has been 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.150
 all
