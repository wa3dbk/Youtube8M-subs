00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.680
 the people of youtube and we are in a 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.840
 new video from here on my channel and then 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.480
 I just wanted to comment on two things 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.840
 one of the first one of the first 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.419
 It would be that I apologize for not having 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.880
 I upload videos in a row but I have not 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.579
 had time been with so many things 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.320
 and also my channel was in mode I do not know 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.579
 if supervision or something like that but is that 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.129
 I had with my channel that I'm not going to say 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.980
 because x and such if you can not say what 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.079
 I'm saying then I hope I do not read it 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.300
 so I'm not going to say it and the 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.760
 next thing would be to teach them the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.320
 craft eos of the radio plugin that 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.550
 I know that nobody in almost anyone knows 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.550
 then I will teach you 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.019
 in a video each one is valid so that I do not 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.820
 read in the explanation of each one and it 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.909
 can explain them super well then 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.420
 to do this this we will do 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.790
 art that is up well it's a book it 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.520
 have to love in a book and that 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.610
 book will give you speed there is up to 1 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.470
 2 3 4 5 6 up to 6 only worth 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.110
 so I recommend that you join 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.840
 networks and do 6 or 5 because 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.960
 if it is that in 13 2 they will be 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.430
 a lot of food follow this food and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.820
 and they're not going to run almost anything 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.610
 So, yes, I recommend that you 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.130
 they wait for a few reals and they make the 6 or 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.290
 5 which is almost the same then for 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.340
 do them at 3 we need this that 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.820
 they would be cakes and pies as they say 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.140
 you speed positions here so 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.060
 fast and data of 1 and 30 in a pie and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.259
 the real ones I'm going to do in this 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.600
 case 6 I already have 5 done because then 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.360
 I did not want to mess up while doing everything 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.729
 this 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.110
 with waitress because here you can not 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.110
 use the chip to put them 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.000
 then once we have this going 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.130
 to give what would be the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.710
 component that is this are worth below says 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.240
 you fought then to make the book 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.780
 we just have to have the book 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.220
 five by these five networks 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.890
 already done and put the book and I do not know if 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.690
 so be it 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.330
 It's worth it then it works like that 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.960
 how do you see 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.590
 they just have to separate the chair 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.930
 say and they put us up to 6 then 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.510
 It's very simple here, they see you 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.010
 do every weird make up of aste 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.140
 they need four positions and four 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.660
 pies or cakes worth doing 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.630
 only one then to make five 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.110
 they need each one four and so it's worth 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.390
 so 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.060
 Well then here are some emilio and 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.430
 once having this book I'm going to 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.950
 put in mode 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.659
 because I'm on a server I'm going to put in 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.579
 mode your rival and how do you see the 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.920
 mods are going to attack me I'll be say 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.480
 that we are cast and as you can see they are 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.359
 attacking so they see that they have their 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.920
 rival and we click on the ground and as 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.609
 come I'm running here puts us 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.030
 26 seconds speed is worth 26 seconds and 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.650
 As you can see, I'm running like 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.500
 how does he do what 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.079
 if he runs a lot to 6 it's worth that yes 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.060
 I want to say that I run a lot and I 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.209
 can serve in that they can go to the forest 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.890
 do not give in to fight in fight they get 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.470
 in the ty with the sword and they give him hard 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.750
 hard drive and because it is almost impossible 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.790
 you are not worth it and you would give them 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.859
 more force because running like that 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.180
 they have more strength and it's painting the same or 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.790
 jumping is more better said vale then 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.810
 it is simply that it is very very short the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.879
 video but then that to another thing is of 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.269
 that as they see also put in creative 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.549
 original I like them as they see I do not have 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.440
 skin and what happens with my skin I do not know what 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.709
 past but I once entering the 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.709
 Minecraft 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.689
 like it closed like that out of nowhere and I 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.439
 imposed some skin I do not know enough 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:34.550
 English but if I defend myself and said that 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:38.120
 I had to renew my skin because I did not 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.400
 I did not have that much memory and what 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.159
 it's being the minecraft file or 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.710
 is how much ram you say but presumably 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.040
 I spend almost nothing of the bouquets in neither 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.020
 a giga 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.790
 to according to me I do not know maybe I'm 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.140
 wrong and you are saying 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.660
 but this is saying true 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.210
 I'm just saying something like that 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.689
 it looked and I was searching the internet and 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.189
 I found what 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:08.580
 with what my windows needed then 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:12.870
 erase and reinstall it because in 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.520
 as I had the default activation 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.919
 of the windows or that each one that came out 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.409
 a new renovation of the windows 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.229
 will notify and I will change it automatically 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:25.740
 it changed me and I without realizing 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:28.590
 then I lost my skin I had 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.780
 done so they do not tell me I took it 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.449
 of anything I had done it 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.840
 I took this time and then nothing 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:39.000
 I was looking for a skin and I put this one on 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.789
 of a chest only to not be with 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.240
 steve but above I'm going to change this 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.039
 skin ok I do not know what skin I have but I 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.740
 I'm going to change and I will change too 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.840
 what sells being the statistics of 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.389
 channel because it has my old skin the 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.699
 channel is worth then nothing nothing only 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.770
 I want to comment on that and the aste 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.169
 that already saw how it becomes super 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.360
 facilitated and on all servers that 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.400
 have the rar plugin item pointing to 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.289
 have ballast because this one is super good 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.340
 and they will never deactivate it 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:14.840
 so then nothing simply that and we 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.840
 we see until the next goodbye
