well<00:00:56.520> done

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.500 

unless<00:01:03.360> it<00:01:03.540> gets<00:01:03.660> me<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.920> does<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:06.210> I'm<00:01:06.360> very

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
unless it gets me it does and I'm very

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:16.640 
unless it gets me it does and I'm very
close<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.290> maybe<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.950> should<00:01:08.040> move<00:01:08.310> away

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.580 

oh<00:01:17.540> wow

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.580 

now<00:01:22.590> let's<00:01:22.800> get<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:23.460> science<00:01:23.940> in<00:01:24.120> here<00:01:24.590> but

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
now let's get up science in here but

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
now let's get up science in here but
using<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> space<00:01:26.340> saver<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.970> actually

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
using the space saver is actually

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.810 
using the space saver is actually
spinning<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.590> Diablo<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.550> diavel

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
spinning the Diablo and when the diavel

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.109 
spinning the Diablo and when the diavel
says<00:01:30.330> it's<00:01:31.020> actually<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.740> stable<00:01:35.119> nice

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
says it's actually more stable nice

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:53.670 
says it's actually more stable nice
catch

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.520 

Avery<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.520> guess<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.970> faster<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:55.780> spin<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.230> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
Avery I guess the faster you spin it the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.570 
Avery I guess the faster you spin it the
easier<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.370> do<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.610> trick<00:01:57.790> is<00:01:58.440> faster<00:01:59.440> oh<00:01:59.650> you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
easier to do the trick is faster oh you

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.550 
easier to do the trick is faster oh you
can<00:02:00.790> see<00:02:01.000> how<00:02:01.090> it's<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.390> little<00:02:01.420> wobbly<00:02:01.900> yeah

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
can see how it's a little wobbly yeah

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.710 
can see how it's a little wobbly yeah
you<00:02:02.800> get<00:02:02.980> it<00:02:03.070> going<00:02:03.340> festered<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.180> plate<00:02:04.450> it's

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
you get it going festered the plate it's

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.880 
you get it going festered the plate it's
much<00:02:04.960> smoother<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.610> can<00:02:08.250> longer<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.460> is

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
much smoother and you can longer it is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:25.130 
much smoother and you can longer it is
well<00:02:11.890> that's<00:02:12.130> called<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.459> gyroscopic<00:02:13.270> effect

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:41.490
