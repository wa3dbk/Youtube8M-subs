00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.800
 The change I thought I was investigating was changing suddenly 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.180
 You may 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.180
 Temperature will be close to minus 30 degrees 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.009
 Far from being a disadvantage on severe weather conditions 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.259
 You will be motivated 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.130
 But we are recording future growth 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.920
 The present area is 906 square kilometers 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.060
 As much as New York City 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.590
 It seems that we are going to our four cities and we have certain fruits 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.030
 Continue 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.030
 The eyes were long by December last year 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 76 cases have occurred since it was forgot to do it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.330
 If you go along the river that flows in slow motion 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.320
 Predict 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.590
 US-China-Russian nuclear experts 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.590
 Also traveller's diarrhea 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.530
 Put a mass of 2-4 cream on the plate 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.290
 I was heading out 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 I'm going to a hospital in London 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.850
 The money research team 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 I regularly check this kind of life 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 listener 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.310
 Positioning system using satellite 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.840
 We are transitioning early and add 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.560
 Indicates this position 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 If joint moves 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.620
 I understand this 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.990
 According to the police 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.450
 I am moving nearly 46 meters a year this week 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.640
 Currently stopped by growth global warming 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.920
 is 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.780
 But if the average temperature of the earth drops by 23 degrees in the future 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.590
 During the beginning of growth 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.590
 You will rush into the next lap 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.030
 Did you discover that the temperature rose 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.560
 Swiss geologist active in the 19th century 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.590
 Indicated at the same committee 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.000
 I surveyed the Alps in the 30s with voice only, but the fourth place was 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 I saw growing huge stones rolling 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.419
 How to protect a valley like a stone 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.419
 I will show you the way you are 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.579
 Why are you in that position with such four? 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.979
 The boy who had released 30 anime theme songs was in the Alps 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.489
 I made a hypothesis that it was crowded when it was flowing a lot 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.580
 The beginning of the hand cutting announcement 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.729
 To be a seed of laughing 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.289
 Evidence found that the extraterrestrial phase was in Japanese as a town 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.289
 Was recognized as rising 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.039
 There is evidence throughout the world
