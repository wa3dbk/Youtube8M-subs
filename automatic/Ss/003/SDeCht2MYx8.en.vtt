00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.447
[MUSIC - "ABIDE WITH ME"]
(SINGING) Abide with me!

00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:44.910
fast falls the eventide;
the darkness deepens.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.900

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.480
Lord, with me abide!

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.874

00:00:57.874 --> 00:01:14.806
When other helpers
fail and comforts flee,

00:01:14.806 --> 00:01:28.252
help of the helpless,
Lord, abide with me!

00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:47.176

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:59.128
Swift to its close ebbs
out life's little day.

00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:03.112

00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:14.972
Earth's joys grow dim;
its glories pass away.

00:02:14.972 --> 00:02:19.952

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:43.856
Change and decay in all around
I see; O thou who changest not,

00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:49.832
abide with me!

00:02:49.832 --> 00:03:01.784
I need thy presence
ev'ry passing hour.

00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:04.772

00:03:04.772 --> 00:03:16.724
What but thy grace can
foil the tempter's pow'r?

00:03:16.724 --> 00:03:21.206

00:03:21.206 --> 00:03:32.162
Who, like thyself, my
guide and stay can be?

00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:37.142

00:03:37.142 --> 00:03:50.090
Thru cloud and sunshine,
Lord, abide with me!

00:03:50.090 --> 00:04:02.540

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:31.390
Thru cloud and sunshine,
Lord, abide with me!

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:42.490

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:52.140
Abide with me!

00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:18.900
