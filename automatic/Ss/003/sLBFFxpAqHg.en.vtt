00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
no one is opening packs and it's just a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.560 
no one is opening packs and it's just a
little<00:01:01.949> great<00:01:02.100> opportunity<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.879> plays

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
little great opportunity for plays

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.600 
little great opportunity for plays
prices<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> rise<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.500> happened<00:01:04.860> literally<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
prices to rise it happened literally I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.490 
prices to rise it happened literally I
think<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> happen<00:01:06.180> last<00:01:06.420> year<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.200> did<00:01:07.380> make

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
think I happen last year and I did make

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
think I happen last year and I did make
about<00:01:07.650> 200<00:01:07.860> k<00:01:08.100> profit<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> its<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.299> really

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
about 200 k profit and its really really

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
about 200 k profit and its really really
easy<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.930> make<00:01:09.960> small<00:01:10.229> profits<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.710> well<00:01:10.890> but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
easy to make small profits as well but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.679 
easy to make small profits as well but
you<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.400> careful<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.909> sell<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.600> as

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you have to be careful and sell them as

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.899 
you have to be careful and sell them as
fast<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.140> possible<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.770> sometimes<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.700> works

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
fast as possible so sometimes it works

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.370 
fast as possible so sometimes it works
sometimes<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.509> does<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> depends<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.290> which

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
sometimes it does it depends on which

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.260 
sometimes it does it depends on which
player<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> were<00:01:16.890> doing<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.610> did<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
player you were doing it on I did it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
player you were doing it on I did it
with<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> bigger<00:01:18.570> place<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.140> Aguero<00:01:19.530> but

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
with a bigger place like Aguero but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.920 
with a bigger place like Aguero but
still<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:20.820> gonna<00:01:20.939> say<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.750> bigger

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
still all I'm gonna say is the bigger

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.660 
still all I'm gonna say is the bigger
players<00:01:22.259> prices<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.159> drop<00:01:23.369> loads

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
players prices are going to drop loads

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.210 
players prices are going to drop loads
for<00:01:24.090> example<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.560> bruh<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
for example like it bruh is going to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.550 
for example like it bruh is going to
drop<00:01:26.490> loads<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.030> about<00:01:27.210> 200<00:01:27.570> k<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.380> should

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
drop loads to about 200 k so it should

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.140 
drop loads to about 200 k so it should
be<00:01:28.590> easier<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.310> training<00:01:29.670> sales<00:01:29.820> road<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
be easier for my training sales road to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.060 
be easier for my training sales road to
another<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.689> he<00:01:30.990> should<00:01:31.020> drop<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.500> about<00:01:31.590> 1.5

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
another as he should drop to about 1.5

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.749 
another as he should drop to about 1.5
mil<00:01:32.520> which<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.000> great<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:34.759> another

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
mil which would be great and another

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.149 
mil which would be great and another
thing<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.540> small<00:01:36.930> players<00:01:37.200> are<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.650> 5k

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
thing is the small players are like 5k

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.830 
thing is the small players are like 5k
don't<00:01:38.640> really<00:01:38.880> need<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.060> worry<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.360> them<00:01:39.659> as

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
don't really need to worry about them as

builders<00:01:52.439> I've<00:01:52.799> been<00:01:53.070> doing<00:01:53.310> quite<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.520> few<00:01:53.790> of

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
builders I've been doing quite a few of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.959 
builders I've been doing quite a few of
them<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.210> they<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.570> help<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.259> only<00:01:55.350> 10k

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
them and they do help out there only 10k

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.280 
them and they do help out there only 10k
25k<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.450> won't<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.840> make<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.229> much

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
25k so you won't really make that much

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.160 
25k so you won't really make that much
of<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> loss<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> also<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.549> forms<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.600> their

of a loss and also in forms so their

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.170 
of a loss and also in forms so their
prices<00:02:01.590> will<00:02:01.950> drop<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.460> depending<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.909> who

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
prices will drop it depending on who

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.609

a very good player

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.510 
a very good player
and<00:02:13.830> his<00:02:14.790> like<00:02:15.330> price<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.320> informs<00:02:16.920> will<00:02:17.130> drop

and his like price for informs will drop

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.950 
and his like price for informs will drop
dramatically<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:18.510> you'll<00:02:18.630> be<00:02:18.690> able<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.840> pick

dramatically so you'll be able to pick
them<00:02:19.080> up<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> recommend<00:02:20.130> selling<00:02:20.520> all<00:02:20.760> the

that many informed because their prices

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.810 
that many informed because their prices
will<00:02:24.960> drop<00:02:24.990> as<00:02:25.380> well<00:02:25.560> unless<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.400> really
