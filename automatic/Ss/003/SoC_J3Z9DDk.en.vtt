00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.240
 with the mother 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.980
 wait that bounced I fall on top of the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.410
 thing this serves nothing nor tomorrow the best 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.630
 for guys you are here in this kind 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.130
 of acrobatics that looks like a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.600
 so complicated but since we 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.260
 we're going to pass it on because I'm the best 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:31.190
 of the world getting approval 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:33.170
 almost basic but really this is what 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.910
 that is uncle to see to see simply that 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.309
 do so we stick to the wall 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.989
 we bounce and take the loop and if you like 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.059
 assess is a bit complicated things 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.809
 As they are, it 's a bit complicated 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.830
 but now let's make it demanding that 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.670
 I get nervous then 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.260
 eye eye eye eye eye number 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.600
 also little by little there is there is 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.449
 there it is there it is there it is there it is there 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.070
 is 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.449
 there are two because they are falling from the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.089
 which one is the real one who's going 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.610
 first and another one is a lie because if 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.710
 I'm going second, it will be effective 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.880
 the one that is of the false and the one that is 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.799
 right there are black people who goes 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.820
 first to opera guys t 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.080
 thank you very much trees tree has me 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.870
 bounced the fall is good people good 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.860
 people we turn around better 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.690
 guys now we simply lack 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.400
 catch to feel if it fits in front which 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.600
 It will be a bit complicated but hey I 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.020
 I think we can get it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.780
 we highlight when the pine 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.009
 the average dump so something is 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.810
 something to look at the positive part of 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:35.439
 things guys always positive life 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.420
 mister kevin bar low 14 so 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.109
 comrades are going to catch those 33 points 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.130
 of control 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:47.619
 we got four points so I think that 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.500
 yes we can catch it so we're going to 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.670
 squeeze engines worth it we have it there 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.380
 as the type is the paper that will be 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.700
 complicated but since we live 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.420
 that because there are fruit stalls here 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.539
 my mother, that curve they call the curve 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.759
 the fruit shop curve the the letter shop 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.789
 would continue to call it the fruit shop curve or 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.049
 young the fruit shop curve is very good 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.099
 I love that my car bounces if it is pulled out 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.590
 the road is a detail that I 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.049
 it's on I think it's quite correct 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.380
 not a kid watch act is going to go back to the 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:20.500
 Mr. Kevin road has escaped no 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.599
 forgiveness kevin looks is able to eye that 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.040
 wanting it uncle's mouth has double 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.420
 vocal in the two vowels that have their 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.890
 name I do not know why it's as if I 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.170
 I put so and 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.190
 I did not have any kind of eye sense 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.020
 assault 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.930
 OK OK OK'm ahead could 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.760
 get new viable 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.620
 but for some project as well as 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.760
 for a little bit it's really what 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.959
 we have there in front and counting on that 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.970
 the one that goes first always more attentive than 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.530
 the second one because we 're supposed to go over 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.360
 fast time just the little thing to do is 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.280
 Do not shit if we do not have it 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.420
 I have time to catch you leave your bets 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.770
 for the comments to it in the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.790
 rockets that I said to put then I think 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.290
 that he's going to win and then I think he's going to 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.850
 lose leave it yes but not worth bis 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.320
 end of the video we are worth you have to 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.239
 put it right now without looking at 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.440
 end of the video you have to put or won or 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.300
 if I win if I lose so 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.570
 do your answers guys do your 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.340
 bets goes from 22 points to 33 the thing 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.040
 it gets a little ugly because the race 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.750
 it's ending ok I do not have to 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.250
 here to not reduce speed there 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.980
 we are come, come, come, come, come, come 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.840
 come on here come because he runs so much 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.800
 that man gave 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.800
 a jump is not effectively this 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.590
 eye eye 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:43.080
 turn round let's go to the quiet magical 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.930
 because we're going to remove the slipstream and this one 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.120
 let's catch the mate moment 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.560
 I listened when it would be missing or missing because 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.730
 if it can not be can not be can not 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.140
 be 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.310
 we hope here you have to try that the 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.480
 entrance is that so late you have to 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.980
 sue very little missing missing 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.379
 very much missing very few 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.900
 very few missing a lot but because 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.900
 with so much this fucking man fucking 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.239
 that says study that says extends 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.239
 because he has won new 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.410
 please 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.100
 for 80 thousandths 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.840
 I looked at the boy was taking four 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.300
 minutes and seconds and stop that does not come out 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.789
 today two hundred and two hundred world comes to 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.139
 take and I took 40 4 minutes 6 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:40.560
 seconds 281 thousandths per 187 thousandths 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.080
 tivo 80 thousandths samil thousandth is a 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.759
 second thousand is a second is to imagine 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.380
 a second of a thousand thousandths is 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.470
 imagine what they are 40 thousandths 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.349
 it's like less than one of a tenth of a 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.440
 second is very little time 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.660
 but a boy later this has been all 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.870
 finally you look for al but so an end 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.440
 there I go hallucinatingly intensely 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.440
 flippant 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.340
 years 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.080
 Y
