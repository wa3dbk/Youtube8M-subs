look<00:00:00.630> when<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:00.960> big<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.410> big<00:00:01.439> money<00:00:01.680> starts

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
look when the big the big money starts

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.990 
look when the big the big money starts
coming<00:00:01.949> you're<00:00:02.250> right<00:00:02.340> it's<00:00:02.460> already<00:00:02.639> started

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
coming you're right it's already started

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.370 
coming you're right it's already started
but<00:00:03.120> as<00:00:03.210> there's<00:00:03.360> big<00:00:03.510> money<00:00:03.540> sets<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.020> come<00:00:04.200> on

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
but as there's big money sets to come on

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.820 
but as there's big money sets to come on
they<00:00:04.740> will<00:00:05.279> move<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.759> price<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.500> it's<00:00:07.500> just

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
they will move the price and it's just

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.290 
they will move the price and it's just
not<00:00:07.919> liquid<00:00:08.340> enough<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:08.880> that<00:00:08.940> if<00:00:09.059> they<00:00:09.120> want

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
not liquid enough for that if they want

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.240 
not liquid enough for that if they want
to<00:00:09.360> make<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> very<00:00:09.750> quick<00:00:09.870> exit<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.889> liquidity

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
to make a very quick exit the liquidity

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.220 
to make a very quick exit the liquidity
is<00:00:11.490> not<00:00:11.610> necessary<00:00:12.000> not<00:00:12.210> necessarily<00:00:12.900> there

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
is not necessary not necessarily there

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.530 
is not necessary not necessarily there
for<00:00:13.530> them<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:13.830> their<00:00:14.040> ability<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.610> get<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.330> is

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
for them so their ability to get in is

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.510 
for them so their ability to get in is
proportional<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.350> their<00:00:16.529> ability<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.369> get

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
proportional to their ability to get

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.220 
proportional to their ability to get
back<00:00:17.730> out<00:00:17.940> from<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.420> risk<00:00:18.570> perspective<00:00:18.630> that

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
back out from a risk perspective that

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.410 
back out from a risk perspective that
they<00:00:19.410> will<00:00:19.529> take<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.830> stance<00:00:20.130> now<00:00:20.820> you

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
they will take that stance now you

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.090 
they will take that stance now you
that's<00:00:21.810> kind<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.410> terms<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.740> coming

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
that's kind of like in terms of coming

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.009 
that's kind of like in terms of coming
in<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.340> really<00:00:23.760> big<00:00:23.939> money<00:00:24.240> that's<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
in with really big money that's like a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
in with really big money that's like a
some<00:00:25.410> point<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.830> resistance<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.430> being<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
some point of resistance for being the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.790 
some point of resistance for being the
first<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> room<00:00:27.300> however<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.560> don't<00:00:28.619> want

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
first in the room however you don't want

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.290 
first in the room however you don't want
to<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> last<00:00:29.189> guy<00:00:29.550> either<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:30.060> after

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
to be the last guy either because after

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.730 
to be the last guy either because after
then<00:00:30.480> everyone's<00:00:30.990> already<00:00:31.140> driven<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> price

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
then everyone's already driven the price

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.200 
then everyone's already driven the price
up<00:00:31.920> now<00:00:32.130> you're<00:00:32.279> buying<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> art<00:00:32.940> was<00:00:33.030> very

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
up now you're buying at the art was very

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.400 
up now you're buying at the art was very
very<00:00:33.300> top<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.540> want<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.899> get<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.079> earlier

time price is going to go ballistic and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.100 
time price is going to go ballistic and
that's<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.239> my<00:00:51.390> expectation<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> don't

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that's kind of my expectation I don't

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.950 
that's kind of my expectation I don't
know<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.500> rings<00:00:53.070> true<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.579> at<00:00:53.730> all

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
million dollars of byes and no cells at

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.500 
million dollars of byes and no cells at
current<00:02:55.440> prices<00:02:55.650> right<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.670> mean<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.090> like

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
current prices right so I mean it like

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.300 
current prices right so I mean it like
this<00:02:57.720> whole<00:02:57.989> idea<00:02:58.379> of<00:02:58.409> price<00:02:58.680> discovery<00:02:59.099> I

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
this whole idea of price discovery I

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.559 
this whole idea of price discovery I
think<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.670> lot<00:02:59.849> of<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.060> comes<00:03:00.180> down<00:03:00.420> to

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
think a lot of it comes down to

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.660 
think a lot of it comes down to
asymmetric<00:03:00.959> information<00:03:03.019> you<00:03:04.019> know<00:03:04.109> people

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
asymmetric information you know people

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.780 
asymmetric information you know people
like<00:03:05.670> bitcoins<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:08.099> can<00:03:08.250> see<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.579> in<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
like bitcoins you you can see it in the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.460 
like bitcoins you you can see it in the
press<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.359> know<00:03:09.450> people<00:03:09.870> always<00:03:10.019> going<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.440> be
