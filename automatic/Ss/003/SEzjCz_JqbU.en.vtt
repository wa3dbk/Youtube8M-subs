00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
would think would be very difficult to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.340 
would think would be very difficult to
make<00:01:25.259> work<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.009> film<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.939> many<00:01:27.479> huger

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
make work in this film is so many huger

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.770

than<00:01:28.380> life<00:01:28.710> characters<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.210> movie<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
than life characters all in one movie I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.030 
than life characters all in one movie I
can<00:01:30.990> imagine<00:01:31.140> it'd<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.770> hard<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
can imagine it'd be really hard to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.499
