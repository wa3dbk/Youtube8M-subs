can<00:00:14.879> see<00:00:15.089> i'm<00:00:15.959> using<00:00:16.320> my<00:00:16.350> phone<00:00:16.650> camera

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
can see i'm using my phone camera

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.560 
can see i'm using my phone camera
because<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.519> web<00:00:17.730> my<00:00:17.970> webcam<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.449> my<00:00:18.480> computer

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
because the web my webcam on my computer

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.429 
because the web my webcam on my computer
is<00:00:19.109> acting<00:00:19.320> up<00:00:19.619> which<00:00:20.519> is<00:00:20.640> unfortunate<00:00:21.289> so<00:00:22.289> it

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
is acting up which is unfortunate so it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.169 
is acting up which is unfortunate so it
has<00:00:22.470> all<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.769> technologies<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.609> directx

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
has all the technologies like directx

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.259 
has all the technologies like directx
11.1<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.349> physics<00:00:25.910> obviously<00:00:26.910> directors

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
11.1 and physics obviously directors

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
11.1 and physics obviously directors
11.1<00:00:27.960> will<00:00:28.500> only<00:00:28.830> work<00:00:29.130> if<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.609> like

11.1 will only work if you have like
windows<00:00:30.179> 8<00:00:30.419> but<00:00:30.749> you<00:00:30.929> know<00:00:31.070> opengl<00:00:32.070> 4.2<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
windows 8 but you know opengl 4.2 and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.119 
windows 8 but you know opengl 4.2 and
let's<00:00:33.000> split<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.210> box<00:00:33.480> over<00:00:33.739> more<00:00:34.739> stuff<00:00:35.010> on

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
let's split the box over more stuff on

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.799 
let's split the box over more stuff on
the<00:00:35.250> back<00:00:35.460> but<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.000> know<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.149> tells<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the back but you know just tells you the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.170 
the back but you know just tells you the
entrance<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.520> tells<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> basic

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
entrance it just tells you the basic

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.080 
entrance it just tells you the basic
stuff<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.949> wearing<00:00:40.949> a<00:00:41.039> multimedia<00:00:41.520> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
stuff like wearing a multimedia and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
stuff like wearing a multimedia and
entry-level<00:00:42.420> gaming<00:00:43.020> us<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.320> car<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
entry-level gaming us with this car is

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.910 
entry-level gaming us with this car is
geared<00:00:43.890> towards<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.520> sort<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.920> wouldn't

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
geared towards it's sort of I wouldn't

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.770 
geared towards it's sort of I wouldn't
really<00:00:47.070> called<00:00:47.370> mid-range<00:00:47.940> I'd<00:00:48.210> call<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
really called mid-range I'd call it a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.119 
really called mid-range I'd call it a
it's<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:50.270> little<00:00:51.270> less<00:00:51.480> than<00:00:51.840> mid-range<00:00:52.320> but

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it's a little less than mid-range but

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889 
it's a little less than mid-range but
it's<00:00:53.309> enough<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.329> i<00:00:54.359> want<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.780> with

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it's enough for what i want to do with

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.369 
it's enough for what i want to do with
my<00:00:55.019> pc<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.910> 2<00:00:57.120> gigs<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.510> memory<00:00:57.780> should<00:00:58.170> help

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
my pc the 2 gigs of memory should help

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349 
my pc the 2 gigs of memory should help
with<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.039> dual<00:00:59.670> monitors<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
stuff are dual like maybe like three

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.030 
stuff are dual like maybe like three
monitors<00:01:02.899> at<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.199> most<00:01:04.440> as<00:01:04.650> computers

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
monitors at the very most as computers

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950 
monitors at the very most as computers
only<00:01:05.129> gonna<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.759> two<00:01:06.060> monitors<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.630> doubt

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
only gonna do like two monitors I doubt

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
only gonna do like two monitors I doubt
want<00:01:07.259> to<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> third<00:01:08.189> monitor<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.970> I'm

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
want to get a third monitor but I'm

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
want to get a third monitor but I'm
using<00:01:09.509> one<00:01:09.780> monitor<00:01:10.140> right<00:01:10.259> now<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.590> two<00:01:10.650> gigs

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
using one monitor right now so two gigs

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.289 
using one monitor right now so two gigs
is<00:01:11.340> enough<00:01:12.090> memory<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.590> this<00:01:13.670> this<00:01:14.670> system

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
is enough memory for this this system

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.569 
is enough memory for this this system
and<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:16.290> says<00:01:16.470> supports<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.920> before<00:01:17.220> displays

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
and it says supports it before displays

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
hdmi to DVI adapter in here but you know

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.200 
hdmi to DVI adapter in here but you know
that's<00:04:53.120> asking<00:04:53.300> too<00:04:53.539> much<00:04:54.310> nice<00:04:55.310> little<00:04:55.820> card

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
that's asking too much nice little card

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.029 
that's asking too much nice little card
right<00:04:56.450> here<00:04:56.479> is<00:04:56.750> actually<00:04:56.870> really<00:04:57.289> small<00:04:57.800> so

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
right here is actually really small so

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.430 
right here is actually really small so
now<00:04:58.760> can<00:04:58.940> fit<00:04:59.150> in<00:04:59.240> my<00:04:59.270> system<00:04:59.840> as<00:05:00.020> well<00:05:00.139> of<00:05:00.260> any

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
now can fit in my system as well of any

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.990 
now can fit in my system as well of any
other<00:05:01.120> bin<00:05:02.139> and<00:05:03.139> he'd<00:05:03.680> take<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:03.950> sprout<00:05:04.370> this

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
other bin and he'd take a sprout this

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.270 
other bin and he'd take a sprout this
actually<00:05:05.270> looks<00:05:05.599> very<00:05:06.229> similar<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.889> GT

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.610 
actually looks very similar to the GT
430<00:05:07.729> layout<00:05:08.090> they<00:05:08.240> keep<00:05:08.570> their<00:05:08.780> GT<00:05:09.320> series

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.400 
430 layout they keep their GT series
pretty<00:05:10.520> similar<00:05:11.030> as<00:05:11.330> far<00:05:11.780> as<00:05:11.810> like<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
pretty similar as far as like the

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.460 
pretty similar as far as like the
heatsink<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.190> fan<00:05:13.430> go<00:05:13.700> so<00:05:14.599> I<00:05:14.930> kind<00:05:15.410> of

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
heatsink and the fan go so I kind of

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.800 
heatsink and the fan go so I kind of
like<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:15.910> anyway<00:05:16.910> this<00:05:16.970> is<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.210> small<00:05:17.510> card

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
like that anyway this is a small card
