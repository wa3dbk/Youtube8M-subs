sounds like this yeah so it keeps
repeating<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> over<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.579> we<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.840> we<00:00:42.840> are

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
repeating that over so here we go we are

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.220 
repeating that over so here we go we are
all<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> g<00:00:44.489> string<00:00:44.520> way<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.660> Michael

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
all on the g string way to go Michael

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.010 
all on the g string way to go Michael
here<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.860> go<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> fourth<00:00:47.640> fret<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.120> we're

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
here we go on the fourth fret and we're

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.529 
here we go on the fourth fret and we're
sliding<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.010> sixth<00:00:50.760> prep<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.710> first

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
sliding up to sixth prep on the first

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.310 
sliding up to sixth prep on the first
then<00:00:54.539> come<00:00:54.660> back<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> fourth<00:00:55.590> fret

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
then come back down to the fourth fret

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.090 
then come back down to the fourth fret
then<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:59.280> second<00:00:59.789> fret<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.859> slide<00:01:01.859> back

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
then the second fret and then slide back

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.039 
then the second fret and then slide back
up<00:01:02.340> 46<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.840> let's<00:01:03.960> put<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.170> together<00:01:07.040> and

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
up 46 so let's put that together and

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.810 
up 46 so let's put that together and
that's<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.590> then<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:13.490> think<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.549> repeat<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that's it and then I think you repeat a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:24.590 
that's it and then I think you repeat a
three<00:01:15.030> times<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> last<00:01:24.240> time<00:01:24.450> he's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
three times so and the last time he's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.340 
three times so and the last time he's
going<00:01:27.380> he<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.770> repeats<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:33.350> so

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
going he just kind of repeats that so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.499 
going he just kind of repeats that so
he'll<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> fourth<00:01:36.030> time<00:01:36.119> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
he'll do that on the fourth time so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:47.020 
he'll do that on the fourth time so
let's<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:36.869> together<00:01:37.049> two<00:01:37.829> three<00:01:38.400> four<00:01:38.909> and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:02:01.160 

then<00:01:48.030> use<00:01:48.210> keep<00:01:48.450> repeating<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.439> night
