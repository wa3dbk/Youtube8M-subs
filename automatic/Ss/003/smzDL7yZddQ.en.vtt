00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.080
 this is the saving cold front of the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.660
 Fatherland because what rolls looks only 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.320
 here I have a print center 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.390
 Look who has 1026 for me and 28 here. 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.090
 also 24 for 26 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.910
 these atmospheric pressure values ​​are not 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.710
 they began to appear some more 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.019
 two days né a naná in the modeling of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 systems that we are seeing in these 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.780
 simulations what was not happening 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 before and it is from here that the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.800
 meteorologists began to observe the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.140
 Dad, we're going to start now. 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.930
 there is really talk about the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.190
 because if it was not 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.129
 I had to break 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.430
 This was not the idea here. 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.050
 see and how it will turn into hour 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.840
 this from here 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.280
 Just notice that it turns that way and suggest 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.379
 counter-clockwise 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.809
 here is a high pressure system and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.360
 you will begin to notice that in this 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.460
 region here on the south coast of brazil we 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.890
 Let's start having a spin. 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.430
 completely different from a working 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.979
 low pressure this is one this is one of the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.409
 indicative of the great change in time 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.049
 the great change in the atmosphere that is 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.420
 coming up're going and then I will 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.280
 there you go, look, look, look how 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.060
 turns on high 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.340
 It's there and it's going to start here. Look how 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.970
 begins to create a situation 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.130
 completely different here 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:44.009
 he starts to act like this from here he is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
 an area of ​​low atmospheric pressure and I 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.420
 I'm tall here I have a center 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.899
 low atmospheric pressure to mine 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.770
 my my high pressure center was 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.759
 although I already have a low center 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.390
 atmospheric pressure here and this is 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.030
 a great change a great deal and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.000
 this sense of low pressure I need 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.910
 let in here to apolar I need 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.680
 let it pass, I need to break this 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.450
 structure and it breaks 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.299
 not that this center would not even be 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.849
 forming right then it is from here 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.840
 that we will have this change in the 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.659
 this time and forming this center of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.879
 low pressure I'm going to start analyzing 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:36.510
 this unit again right the northern 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.000
 Brazil towards here the southern region to 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.870
 to form more rainfall areas to form 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.870
 also in the southeast
