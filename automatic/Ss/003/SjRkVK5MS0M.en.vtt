then<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:56.329> get<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.749> go<00:00:56.870> inside<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.010> soup

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
then to get it to go inside of the soup

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.450 
then to get it to go inside of the soup
cups<00:00:59.390> you're<00:01:00.260> going<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.739> need<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.039> cut<00:01:01.309> the

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
cups you're going to need to cut the

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.329 
cups you're going to need to cut the
both<00:01:02.000> sides<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.479> coaster<00:01:02.839> on<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.019> same

bottom line where the center hole is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.520 
bottom line where the center hole is
just<00:01:13.070> do<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.729> class<00:01:14.060> up-and-down<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.140> another

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
just do a class up-and-down and another

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.779 
just do a class up-and-down and another
one<00:01:15.799> like<00:01:16.520> this

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
one like this

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.620 
one like this
side-to-side<00:01:18.850> gonna<00:01:19.850> have<00:01:19.939> to<00:01:20.030> do<00:01:20.149> this<00:01:20.330> twice

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
side-to-side gonna have to do this twice

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.669 
side-to-side gonna have to do this twice
both<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.560> same<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.880> then<00:01:23.420> after<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:24.409> you're

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
both the same and then after that you're

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.410 
both the same and then after that you're
going<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.690> take<00:01:26.690> one<00:01:26.929> of<00:01:27.049> them<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:28.420> position

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
going to take one of them and position

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.419 
going to take one of them and position
them<00:01:29.630> where<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:30.409> outside<00:01:30.799> of<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:30.950> cup<00:01:31.190> is

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
them where the outside of the cup is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.449 
them where the outside of the cup is
facing<00:01:31.940> towards<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.860> when<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:34.220> push

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
facing towards you and when you push

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.899 
facing towards you and when you push
this<00:01:34.640> in<00:01:35.440> it<00:01:36.440> will<00:01:36.470> end<00:01:36.950> up<00:01:37.100> going<00:01:37.399> like<00:01:37.670> this

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
this in it will end up going like this

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.130 
this in it will end up going like this
and<00:01:38.860> then<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.009> phone<00:01:40.549> will<00:01:41.149> end<00:01:41.450> up<00:01:41.690> being<00:01:42.020> a

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
and then the phone will end up being a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.270 
and then the phone will end up being a
little<00:01:42.319> tilted<00:01:42.950> backwards<00:01:44.289> like<00:01:45.289> this<00:01:48.009> so<00:01:49.009> as

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
little tilted backwards like this so as

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.059 
little tilted backwards like this so as
you<00:01:49.490> hold<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:49.819> straight<00:01:50.380> but<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.560> rectangle

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
you hold it straight but the rectangle

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.980 
you hold it straight but the rectangle
has<00:01:52.189> to<00:01:52.459> be<00:01:52.610> moved<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.929> back<00:01:55.509> all<00:01:56.509> right

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
has to be moved to the back all right

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.950 
has to be moved to the back all right
straight

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.610 

depending<00:02:00.710> on<00:02:00.770> how<00:02:00.950> much<00:02:01.160> you<00:02:01.340> want<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:03.530> be

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
depending on how much you want it to be

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.310 
depending on how much you want it to be
such<00:02:03.860> as<00:02:04.010> back<00:02:04.190> or<00:02:04.370> forward<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.260> depending<00:02:06.260> on

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
such as back or forward and depending on

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.240 
such as back or forward and depending on
how<00:02:06.530> far<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.370> your<00:02:08.180> holes<00:02:08.420> need<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.810> be<00:02:08.960> it

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
how far and your holes need to be it

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.860 
how far and your holes need to be it
depends<00:02:10.250> on<00:02:10.399> how<00:02:10.550> big<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.790> triangles<00:02:11.390> are<00:02:11.570> and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
depends on how big the triangles are and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.980 
depends on how big the triangles are and
it's<00:02:12.020> usually<00:02:12.550> just<00:02:13.550> as<00:02:13.910> far<00:02:14.570> down<00:02:14.750> as<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
it's usually just as far down as the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.100 
it's usually just as far down as the
triangles<00:02:15.470> go<00:02:15.680> that's<00:02:16.550> how<00:02:16.760> far<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.210> your<00:02:17.510> tube

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
triangles go that's how far in your tube

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.600 
triangles go that's how far in your tube
goes<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.450> now<00:02:20.630> your<00:02:20.810> duct<00:02:21.020> taping<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.610> when

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
goes and now your duct taping it when

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.790 
goes and now your duct taping it when
you're<00:02:22.730> done<00:02:22.940> duct<00:02:23.120> taping<00:02:23.390> but<00:02:23.960> half<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> strip

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
you're done duct taping but half a strip

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.960 
you're done duct taping but half a strip
cutting<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.820> middle<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:27.020> this<00:02:27.170> link

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
cutting in the middle on this link

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.090 
cutting in the middle on this link
you're<00:02:28.970> going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.420> start<00:02:29.720> all<00:02:29.840> right<00:02:29.870> here<00:02:30.260> go

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
you're going to start all right here go

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.570 
you're going to start all right here go
around<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.050> over<00:02:33.050> back<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:34.010> do<00:02:34.430> that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
around it and over back and do that

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.199 
around it and over back and do that
twice<00:02:34.850> on<00:02:35.270> top<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.020> on<00:02:36.650> bottom<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:38.030> when<00:02:38.150> you

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
twice on top and on bottom and when you

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.699 
twice on top and on bottom and when you
take<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:38.690> you'll<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.110> exact<00:02:39.410> same<00:02:39.440> thing

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
take this you'll be the exact same thing

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.080 
take this you'll be the exact same thing
and<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:41.090> will<00:02:41.209> look<00:02:41.420> like<00:02:42.670> this

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
and it will look like this

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.120 
and it will look like this
once<00:02:44.990> you're<00:02:45.140> done<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.410> both<00:02:45.560> sides<00:02:45.890> you're

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
once you're done on both sides you're

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.810 
once you're done on both sides you're

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
going to get full strips one or two to

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.550 
going to get full strips one or two to
fill<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.390> whole<00:02:50.600> tube<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.170> it's<00:02:51.320> completely

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
fill the whole tube so it's completely

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.260 
fill the whole tube so it's completely
silver<00:02:52.190> at<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:54.230> point<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.800> have<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:55.340> go<00:02:56.090> back

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
silver at this point you have to go back

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.840 
silver at this point you have to go back
over<00:02:56.510> where<00:02:56.870> your<00:02:57.020> hole<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.740> cut<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.730> out

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
over where your hole is and cut it out

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.360 
over where your hole is and cut it out
with<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> exacto<00:02:59.660> knife<00:02:59.950> now<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.160> you've

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
with the exacto knife now that you've

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.600 
with the exacto knife now that you've
made<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.670> rectangle<00:03:02.420> back<00:03:02.630> in<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.590> might<00:03:04.430> not

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
made the rectangle back in it might not

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.940 
made the rectangle back in it might not
look<00:03:04.790> like<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.030> exactly<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:05.630> rectangle<00:03:06.290> but<00:03:06.769> when

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
look like a exactly a rectangle but when

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.080 
look like a exactly a rectangle but when
you<00:03:07.100> put<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.510> ISO<00:03:08.660> in<00:03:09.080> over<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.680> over<00:03:09.950> again

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
you put the ISO in over and over again

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.560 
you put the ISO in over and over again
it<00:03:11.090> will<00:03:11.269> get<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.080> shape<00:03:12.350> more<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:14.330> want

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
it will get to shape more and you want

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.780 
it will get to shape more and you want
it<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.870> be<00:03:15.019> really<00:03:15.230> tight<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.220> iPhone<00:03:16.610> will

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
it to be really tight so the iPhone will

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.060 
it to be really tight so the iPhone will
stay<00:03:17.030> up<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.570> not<00:03:17.840> sink<00:03:18.170> down<00:03:18.380> into<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.739> tube

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
stay up and not sink down into the tube

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.880 
stay up and not sink down into the tube
and<00:03:20.380> that's<00:03:21.380> pretty<00:03:21.560> much<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.610> building<00:03:23.150> a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
and that's pretty much it on building a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.420 
and that's pretty much it on building a
quick<00:03:24.890> simple<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.880> good
