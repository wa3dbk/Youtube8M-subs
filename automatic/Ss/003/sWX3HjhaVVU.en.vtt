well silicon make it a little easier

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.060 
well silicon make it a little easier
please<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.370> slide<00:00:48.670> out<00:00:50.490> this<00:00:51.490> is<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:53.070> stock

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
please to slide out this is the stock

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:05.450 
please to slide out this is the stock
system<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:54.640> place<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.440> way<00:00:59.770> out<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.130> back

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.700 

this<00:01:06.460> is<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.820> easiest<00:01:07.180> way<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.450> do<00:01:07.690> these<00:01:10.710> that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
this is the easiest way to do these that

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.020 
this is the easiest way to do these that
and<00:01:12.100> then<00:01:12.450> come<00:01:13.450> back<00:01:13.630> with<00:01:13.900> some<00:01:14.670> pliers<00:01:15.670> or

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
and then come back with some pliers or

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.760 
and then come back with some pliers or
something<00:01:16.390> or<00:01:16.510> something<00:01:16.990> else<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.530> get<00:01:17.680> them

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
something or something else to get them

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:32.850 
something or something else to get them
the<00:01:17.890> rest<00:01:18.070> away<00:01:31.350> they<00:01:32.350> actually<00:01:32.650> have<00:01:32.800> a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
the rest away they actually have a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.040 
the rest away they actually have a
special<00:01:32.950> tool<00:01:33.580> just<00:01:33.910> for<00:01:34.150> doing<00:01:34.390> this<00:01:37.050> yeah

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
special tool just for doing this yeah

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.430 
special tool just for doing this yeah
I'll<00:01:38.290> bet<00:01:38.440> they<00:01:38.590> do<00:01:39.630> you've<00:01:40.630> got<00:01:40.840> tools<00:01:41.110> for

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
I'll bet they do you've got tools for

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.810 
I'll bet they do you've got tools for
just<00:01:41.619> about<00:01:41.740> every<00:01:42.100> last<00:01:42.340> little<00:01:43.170> operation

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.980 

it's<00:01:48.820> kind<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.149> something<00:01:49.420> like<00:01:49.539> that<00:01:49.600> but

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
it's kind of something like that but

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.460 
it's kind of something like that but
bigger

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
bigger

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:04.200 
bigger
just<00:01:51.310> some<00:01:51.460> spreads<00:01:51.759> apart<00:01:57.179> 16

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:19.050 

a<00:02:09.450> little<00:02:10.450> hot<00:02:14.910> we've<00:02:15.910> already<00:02:16.120> removed<00:02:18.060> these

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
a little hot we've already removed these

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.020 
a little hot we've already removed these
two<00:02:19.330> hangers<00:02:19.720> we<00:02:19.990> have<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.780> rear<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:24.030> cell

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
two hangers we have the rear of the cell

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.290 
two hangers we have the rear of the cell

over<00:02:28.690> here

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:03:20.020 

and<00:02:40.870> it's<00:02:41.080> out

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.650 

we're<00:03:21.030> free<00:03:25.820> that's<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.970> reason<00:03:27.210> why<00:03:27.330> we<00:03:27.480> left

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
we're free that's the reason why we left

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:37.550 
we're free that's the reason why we left
these<00:03:28.350> front<00:03:28.740> ones<00:03:28.800> still<00:03:29.610> attached<00:03:36.560> we're

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
these front ones still attached we're

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.020 
these front ones still attached we're
going<00:03:37.710> to<00:03:37.800> drop<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.130> exhaust<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.850> could

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
going to drop the exhaust if you could

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:55.050 
going to drop the exhaust if you could
get<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:40.680> back<00:03:44.600> touch<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.780> see<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.110> top

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:40.439 

well<00:03:56.060> we're<00:03:56.450> gonna<00:03:56.629> take<00:03:56.900> off

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:50.080 

are<00:04:41.449> you<00:04:41.570> for<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.810> new<00:04:41.930> system<00:04:48.669> okay<00:04:49.669> so<00:04:49.729> now

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
are you for the new system okay so now

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.390 
are you for the new system okay so now
we're<00:04:50.210> gonna<00:04:53.800> get<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.949> fitting<00:04:55.250> our

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
we're gonna get to fitting our

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.010 
we're gonna get to fitting our
Quicksilver<00:04:56.180> exhaust<00:04:56.479> system<00:04:58.840> made<00:04:59.840> in<00:04:59.960> the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
Quicksilver exhaust system made in the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.390 
Quicksilver exhaust system made in the
UK<00:05:00.169> off<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.430> old<00:05:01.550> ones<00:05:01.789> now<00:05:03.130> these<00:05:04.130> look<00:05:04.340> a

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
UK off the old ones now these look a

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.839 
UK off the old ones now these look a
little<00:05:04.729> more<00:05:05.889> beauty<00:05:06.889> to<00:05:07.070> know<00:05:07.220> so<00:05:07.550> they<00:05:07.669> might

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
little more beauty to know so they might

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:18.969 
little more beauty to know so they might
be<00:05:07.880> harder<00:05:17.110> these<00:05:18.110> hangers<00:05:18.530> will<00:05:18.650> take<00:05:18.830> some

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
be harder these hangers will take some

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.600 
be harder these hangers will take some
muscling<00:05:19.340> because<00:05:19.639> the<00:05:21.340> hangers<00:05:22.340> that<00:05:22.490> are

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
muscling because the hangers that are

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.570 
muscling because the hangers that are
actually<00:05:23.030> on<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.770> Quicksilver<00:05:24.770> are<00:05:25.190> bigger

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
actually on the Quicksilver are bigger

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.719 
actually on the Quicksilver are bigger
than<00:05:25.789> they<00:05:25.940> are<00:05:25.970> on<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.300> stock<00:05:26.539> exhaust<00:05:27.729> more

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
than they are on the stock exhaust more

00:05:28.729 --> 00:06:19.210 
than they are on the stock exhaust more
robust

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.790 

so<00:06:20.220> we're<00:06:20.370> just<00:06:20.400> going<00:06:20.669> to<00:06:21.349> fit<00:06:22.349> the<00:06:22.470> second

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
so we're just going to fit the second

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.450 
so we're just going to fit the second
pipe<00:06:22.970> just<00:06:23.970> attach<00:06:24.270> this<00:06:24.449> with<00:06:24.569> a<00:06:24.630> clamp<00:06:24.900> here

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
pipe just attach this with a clamp here

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:33.400 
pipe just attach this with a clamp here
and<00:06:26.460> then<00:06:26.729> we're<00:06:26.819> going<00:06:26.909> to<00:06:27.000> put<00:06:27.120> on<00:06:30.650> okay

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
and then we're going to put on okay

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.160 
and then we're going to put on okay
here's<00:06:33.980> the<00:06:34.160> exhaust<00:06:34.460> system<00:06:34.900> whoo<00:06:35.900> all<00:06:36.080> we

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
here's the exhaust system whoo all we

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.940
