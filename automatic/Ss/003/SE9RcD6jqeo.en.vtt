hey<00:00:47.580> Stein<00:00:47.879> sawing<00:00:48.390> some<00:00:49.290> really<00:00:49.559> good

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
hey Stein sawing some really good

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.590 
hey Stein sawing some really good
patterns<00:00:50.129> gently<00:00:50.729> with<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.970> pin<00:00:51.120> big<00:00:51.360> swath

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
patterns gently with a pin big swath

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.880 
patterns gently with a pin big swath
happen<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.920> why<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> bass<00:00:53.309> books<00:00:53.549> are<00:00:53.729> boy

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
happen that's why the bass books are boy

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.340 
happen that's why the bass books are boy
so<00:00:56.449> become<00:00:57.449> across<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.739> an<00:00:58.860> T<00:00:59.010> collection

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
so become across it get an T collection

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.250 
so become across it get an T collection
anyway<00:01:01.489> it's<00:01:02.489> very<00:01:02.699> easy<00:01:02.970> flight<00:01:03.299> I<00:01:03.570> simple

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
anyway it's very easy flight I simple

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.950 
anyway it's very easy flight I simple
fly<00:01:04.440> very<00:01:05.190> effective<00:01:05.670> fly<00:01:05.880> using<00:01:06.570> one

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
fly very effective fly using one

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.000 
fly very effective fly using one
material<00:01:07.670> snowshoe<00:01:08.670> rabbit<00:01:08.900> that's<00:01:09.900> fit<00:01:10.320> an

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
material snowshoe rabbit that's fit an

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.090 
material snowshoe rabbit that's fit an
eagle<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> natural<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.799> it's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> pod

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
eagle that's a natural one it's a pod

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.420 
eagle that's a natural one it's a pod
there<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.110> new<00:01:16.260> unique<00:01:16.770> take<00:01:17.130> fiber

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
there so really new unique take fiber

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.039 
there so really new unique take fiber
that<00:01:18.030> tends<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.250> repel<00:01:20.250> snow<00:01:20.780> till<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.869> keeps

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that tends to repel snow till it keeps

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.069 
that tends to repel snow till it keeps
dry<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.189> obviously<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.820> way<00:01:24.270> why<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.840> used

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
dry so obviously I this way why is used

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.730 
dry so obviously I this way why is used
it<00:01:25.259> ideal<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.009> dry<00:01:26.250> flies<00:01:27.259> I've<00:01:28.259> used<00:01:28.530> these

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it ideal for dry flies I've used these

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
it ideal for dry flies I've used these
and<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.159> seem<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.399> just<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:30.210> forever

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and they seem to just going forever

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.620 
and they seem to just going forever
another<00:01:30.840> great<00:01:31.530> fly<00:01:31.880> but<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.299> said<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
another great fly but as I said the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.279 
another great fly but as I said the
material<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.859> be<00:01:34.890> used<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.340> wing<00:01:36.289> tail

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
material can be used in the wing tail

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.450 
material can be used in the wing tail
and<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> body

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and the body

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.279 
and the body
it's<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.119> great<00:01:39.359> Dobbin<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.929> an<00:01:40.020> excellent

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
it's a great Dobbin it's an excellent

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.179 
it's a great Dobbin it's an excellent
oven<00:01:40.679> don't<00:01:41.520> throw<00:01:41.729> will<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.890> best<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
oven don't throw will be the best you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.950 
oven don't throw will be the best you
cut<00:01:44.369> off<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.969> can<00:01:45.119> put<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.689> bag

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
cut off because you can put on your bag

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.109 
cut off because you can put on your bag
and<00:01:46.229> use<00:01:46.499> a<00:01:46.530> layout<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:46.859> a<00:01:47.039> double<00:01:47.310> coat

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and use a layout for a double coat

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.200 
and use a layout for a double coat
integrating<00:01:48.689> them's<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.640> hook<00:01:50.789> I'm<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.119> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
integrating them's the hook I'm going to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.050 
integrating them's the hook I'm going to
be<00:01:51.299> using<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.749> a<00:01:51.780> comma<00:01:52.079> Sun<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.499> 160<00:01:53.070> size<00:01:53.549> 14

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060

be using as a comma Sun be 160 size 14
now<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.439> actually<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:56.249> shank<00:01:56.579> length<00:01:56.729> of

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
now it's actually the shank length of

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.109 
now it's actually the shank length of
short<00:01:57.149> shank<00:01:57.499> that's<00:01:58.499> the<00:01:59.159> shank<00:01:59.729> length<00:01:59.880> is

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
short shank that's the shank length is

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.779 
short shank that's the shank length is
equivalent<00:02:00.569> to<00:02:00.600> say<00:02:00.869> 16<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.799> gape<00:02:02.130> is

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
equivalent to say 16 but the gape is

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.529 
equivalent to say 16 but the gape is
size<00:02:03.539> 14<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.259> me<00:02:05.249> it<00:02:05.369> suits<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.819> stale<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.210> fly

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
size 14 to me it suits a stale a fly

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.200 
size 14 to me it suits a stale a fly
really<00:02:07.140> well<00:02:07.610> it's<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.819> my<00:02:08.880> favorite

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
really well it's one of my favorite

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.550 
really well it's one of my favorite
hooks<00:02:09.390> when<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.630> comes<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.960> that's<00:02:10.110> tailored<00:02:10.440> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
hooks when it comes to that's tailored a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.700 
hooks when it comes to that's tailored a
