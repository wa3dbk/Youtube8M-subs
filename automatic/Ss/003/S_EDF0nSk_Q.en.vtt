Arizona<00:02:29.739> there<00:02:29.920> was<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.310> was<00:02:30.400> 30<00:02:30.640> second<00:02:31.000> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
Arizona there was it was 30 second the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.479 
Arizona there was it was 30 second the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
leak went to 12 for my first year when I

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.740 
leak went to 12 for my first year when I
went<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.730> Cal<00:02:33.910> they're<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.269> bottom<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
went to Cal they're in the bottom of the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.440 
went to Cal they're in the bottom of the
pack<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.470> then<00:02:35.560> went<00:02:35.739> to<00:02:35.769> versed<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.250> one<00:02:37.209> year

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
pack and then went to versed in one year

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.240 
pack and then went to versed in one year
and<00:02:37.810> we<00:02:38.349> led<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.590> conference<00:02:38.890> two<00:02:39.099> out<00:02:39.220> of

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and we led the conference two out of

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.280 
and we led the conference two out of
three<00:02:39.459> years<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.790> defense<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.660> think<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:41.230> a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
three years in defense so I think it's a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.259 
three years in defense so I think it's a
pretty<00:02:41.470> proven<00:02:41.860> scheme<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.819> just<00:02:43.060> looking

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
pretty proven scheme and I just looking

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.220 
pretty proven scheme and I just looking
forward<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.599> hitting<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.900> ground<00:02:44.049> running

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
forward to hitting the ground running

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.549 
forward to hitting the ground running
with<00:02:44.500> these<00:02:44.620> guys<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.010> getting<00:02:45.160> started
