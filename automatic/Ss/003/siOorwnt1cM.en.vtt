about them just two zombies and then our

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.740 
about them just two zombies and then our
last<00:03:12.989> zombie<00:03:13.379> here<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.129> using<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.300> Star<00:03:15.540> Wars

bounty hunter head he has green body for
the<00:03:20.750> camouflage<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.989> guess<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:22.620> then<00:03:22.739> just

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the camouflage I guess and then just

the camouflage I guess and then just
dark<00:03:23.900> legs<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.830> think<00:03:26.340> he's<00:03:26.519> pretty<00:03:26.940> cool
