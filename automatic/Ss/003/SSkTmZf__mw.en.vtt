you<00:01:07.250> can<00:01:07.400> do<00:01:07.520> three<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:07.790> think<00:01:07.880> 3<00:01:08.270> s<00:01:08.330> are<00:01:08.510> better

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
you can do three I think 3 s are better

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.690 
you can do three I think 3 s are better
anyway<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.380> can<00:01:09.560> just<00:01:09.740> split<00:01:09.980> the<00:01:10.250> design

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
anyway and you can just split the design

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.730 
anyway and you can just split the design
on<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.030> machine<00:01:11.300> so<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:11.960> would<00:01:12.290> start<00:01:12.530> with<00:01:12.560> the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
on the machine so I would start with the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.399 
on the machine so I would start with the
middle<00:01:13.070> one<00:01:13.100> right<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:14.630> bloated<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.020> first

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
middle one right it bloated that first

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.410 
middle one right it bloated that first
then<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.340> lay<00:01:16.610> out<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.970> other<00:01:17.180> two

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
then you lay out the other two

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.969 
then you lay out the other two
afterwards<00:01:17.810> on<00:01:18.170> either<00:01:18.290> side<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.620> it<00:01:18.830> so

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
afterwards on either side of it so

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.520 
afterwards on either side of it so
