00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.350
 In 1915, a column was built in the Utrecht neighborhood and a Dutch steel group was founded 

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:06.520
 opened 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.019
 four years later the company started collaborating with high incidentally 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.329
 in the direction 21 at the name of the company changes to k 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.089
 in the seventies things went worse and worse with the factory 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.089
 lead to the closure 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.880
 if it is up to me to work together 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.859
 very nice 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.729
 at least that the hit the collegiality 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.829
 the manager gets along really well 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.100
 I realized it was time for myself 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.610
 the less fun story 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.300
 godfather or sjaak b 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.300
 much is really because I can carry work 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.470
 we die that people thought 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.140
 the man was a very special company 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.240
 that's why those people had a pathetic one 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.190
 super poor dusty work 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.050
 so very unhealthy work 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.090
 safety wash ap robin abel 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.580
 that was also craftsmanship on the other hand, those people who are preparing that 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.400
 were very skilled people do what they were up to 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.330
 but due to the bad martens a lot of rain salmon will be quite large 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
 independence seconds a lot yourself 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.730
 the people were very busy in turn because of that independence 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.610
 to the product board what they made 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.140
 so therefore give a lot of pleasure to work despite all 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.750
 measures that are included 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.890
 so it was what she goes through is very often silk 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.130
 many of her children always enjoy going to work 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.950
 the good stories didn't last long 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.870
 the game cannot cope with problems and therefore suffered a serious decline 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.700
 but how is that possible? 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.850
 the two were also captured 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.560
 the senior management who says yes 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.710
 it has to do with the decreasing need thus arise the pitztal 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.040
 politics 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.610
 the kennedy have fought the closure that say they have let us aware 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.500
 bleed to death 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.810
 they no longer invested for us because the product board was made drinks 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.679
 trailers a high-quality product that was in demand 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.569
 but they simply have not invested for a number in themselves 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.949
 small puppy metal company has been purchased and the course of the seventies 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.879
 if some sort of change French would go worse with the economy 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.900
 and she delivered it at a time when an 80's crisis 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.899
 sheen that off but just wait 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.629
 There were also a lot of people who just couldn't believe who wanted that 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:36.829
 I believe 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.059
 that day of the earth will surely be a compass or something will fall from heaven 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.149
 then yes 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.699
 colombia you could grasp for euro on your fingers euro 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.439
 this of course never works out 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.860
 the steel company dwk in utrecht will close this year 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.250
 this is by the management of this high-rise subsidiary this afternoon 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.350
 communicated to the 270 employees 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.099
 according to the management, the closure is inevitable because the distribution is possible 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.499
 is no longer a future 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.499
 no not at all 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.850
 it is irresponsible 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.419
 because we don't 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.379
 the weather conditions 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.379
 the costs of 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.779
 the costs of aging 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.659
 soccer season inside 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.489
 No 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.489
 mr 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:30.609
 immediately a new one this year is no more than logical 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.249
 in your own country from twice yellow and once a day 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.039
 this year in the 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.999
 OK 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.539
 to halt 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:46.859
 we hold 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.249
 Are 400 characters 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:52.409
 then the feet hour also a laconic device and that was that on the other 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.309
 I wish you all the work of Trump 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:58.069
 freek the secretary the floor send us the cas change sleep mentally 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.839
 joop daalmeijer spring became jan wagon she becomes and luis already has us 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:03.949
 must become 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.819
 and then a piece broke loose 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.069
 at that time, time was ripe under the head of the culture action committee 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:16.989
 after the announcement of the closure on March 17 towards 83 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.359
 follows a 2-day occupation of the factory 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.790
 The employees do the actual everything to keep the factory open and therefore 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.510
 the director of the nk is being held by the workers on 2 June 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.270
 it is therefore clearly placed fifth in the newspaper 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.650
 Richard Knobper 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.650
 what bumps taken because it is not calculated in that it is not 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.860
 different interpretations it has been a big word hostage 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.210
 to actually smuggle 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.499
 the mother in law of 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:48.539
 You see it's something happens to you so if your hands go and the height just gets on 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.889
 reacted loudly from the other side 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.889
 he swung was a spontaneous action 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.110
 the 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.210
 Not everyone had times when people went home earlier and were there 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.210
 I think also people who are new that was going on 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.069
 the hostage situation finally went off with a hiss 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.129
 months later the staff will accept the closure 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.830
 two years later the demolition of the factory buildings began 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.830
 many employees were still in the unemployment law for years 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.589
 geert plowing has been unemployed for fifteen years 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:25.169
 he received 90 money from the den factory for six months 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:29.479
 stijnen half the place where ever stephen k stand 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.499
 also record the best time 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:33.940
 yes we will 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.940
 on his behalf 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.339
 the recession has 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.569
 it is actually a bit of a shame that the monument is not a small one 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:44.180
 piece of euro
