00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
this aspect of shooting we're basically

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.509 
this aspect of shooting we're basically
looking<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.170> power<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> lot<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.340> people

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
looking for power so a lot of people

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.880 
looking for power so a lot of people
like<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.639> call<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> power<00:00:15.150> shot<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:16.289> it's

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
like to call it the power shot but it's

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.680 
like to call it the power shot but it's
basically<00:00:17.190> striking<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> ball<00:00:18.390> nice<00:00:18.660> and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
basically striking the ball nice and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
basically striking the ball nice and
clean<00:00:19.109> we're<00:00:19.500> gonna<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.830> using<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.310> instep<00:00:20.850> of

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
clean we're gonna be using the instep of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.519 
clean we're gonna be using the instep of
our<00:00:21.180> foot<00:00:21.420> which<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.869> top<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.289> foot

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
our foot which is the top of the foot

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
our foot which is the top of the foot
which<00:00:22.920> could<00:00:23.070> be<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:23.460> difficult<00:00:23.730> part<00:00:24.210> for

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
which could be a very difficult part for

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019 
which could be a very difficult part for
some<00:00:24.840> people<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.289> kind<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.949> understand<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.580> lot

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
some people to kind of understand a lot

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
some people to kind of understand a lot
of<00:00:27.150> people<00:00:27.390> tend<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.660> think<00:00:27.920> when<00:00:28.920> we're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
of people tend to think when we're

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.250 
of people tend to think when we're
shooting<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> lot<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.480> power<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.960> all

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
shooting on with a lot of power that all

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.110 
shooting on with a lot of power that all
the<00:00:31.410> time<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.890> foot<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.520> straight<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the time the foot is just straight and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.990 
the time the foot is just straight and
we're<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.480> straight<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:35.000> not

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
we're going straight on like this not

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.209 
we're going straight on like this not
likely<00:00:36.450> most<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> time<00:00:37.050> most<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.040> time

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
likely most of the time most of the time

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.010 
likely most of the time most of the time
when<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.460> shooting<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.510> we're<00:00:39.780> trying<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
when we're shooting and we're trying to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.869 
when we're shooting and we're trying to
get<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> lot<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.350> power<00:00:40.559> behind<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.430> we're<00:00:41.610> using

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
get a lot of power behind it we're using

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.430 
get a lot of power behind it we're using
the<00:00:41.940> instep<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.989> we're<00:00:43.140> coming<00:00:43.410> through

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the instep what we're coming through

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.229 
the instep what we're coming through
we're<00:00:43.980> actually<00:00:44.160> coming<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> side<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
we're actually coming to the side a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.420 
we're actually coming to the side a
little<00:00:45.570> bit<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> our<00:00:46.410> foot<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.160> step

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
little bit and our foot as we step

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.340 
little bit and our foot as we step
through<00:00:47.460> we're<00:00:48.149> coming<00:00:48.450> through<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:49.050> force

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
through we're coming through a force

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.170 
through we're coming through a force
empower<00:00:49.649> our<00:00:50.160> foot<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> actually<00:00:50.760> gonna<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
empower our foot is actually gonna be a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
empower our foot is actually gonna be a
little<00:00:51.420> bit<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> side<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.770> gives<00:00:53.100> us

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
little bit to the side so that gives us

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.490 
little bit to the side so that gives us
a<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.489> bit<00:00:53.610> more<00:00:53.879> area<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> connect<00:00:54.960> with

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
a little bit more area to connect with

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500 
a little bit more area to connect with
the<00:00:55.620> ball<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> lot<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.000> power<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the ball and get a lot of power on it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.900 
the ball and get a lot of power on it
and<00:00:57.719> try<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> strike<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> cleanly<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.920> goal<00:00:59.250> all

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
and try to strike a cleanly on goal all

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.229 
and try to strike a cleanly on goal all
right

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
right

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.299 
right
so<00:01:00.780> simple<00:01:01.230> drill<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.590> we're<00:01:01.739> doing<00:01:01.920> here

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
so simple drill that we're doing here

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.520 
so simple drill that we're doing here
just<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> first<00:01:02.820> step<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.780> line<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.320> few

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
just the first step just line up a few

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.310 
just the first step just line up a few
balls<00:01:04.739> right<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> top<00:01:06.060> once<00:01:06.540> again<00:01:06.689> it's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
balls right on the top once again it's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.370 
balls right on the top once again it's
not<00:01:07.409> about<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:08.790> through<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.060> pace<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
not about going through with pace and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
not about going through with pace and
trying<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.650> fast<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.850> all

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
trying to go as fast as you can it's all

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.910 
trying to go as fast as you can it's all
about<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.360> trying<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.689> precision<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
about just trying to get precision on it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800 
about just trying to get precision on it
you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.520> try<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.820> place<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.600> little

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you can try to place it it's a little

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.630 
you can try to place it it's a little
bit<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.020> difficult<00:01:16.560> than<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.979> placement<00:01:17.400> shot

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
bit more difficult than a placement shot

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.399 
bit more difficult than a placement shot
to<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> do<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.229> try<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to get it but all you do is just try to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
to get it but all you do is just try to
line<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.650> up<00:01:19.860> keep<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.430> ready<00:01:20.689> probably<00:01:21.689> always

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
line it up keep it ready probably always

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.030 
line it up keep it ready probably always
want<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.049> ask<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> keepers<00:01:22.650> ready<00:01:22.830> before

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
want to ask if the keepers ready before

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.800 
want to ask if the keepers ready before
you<00:01:23.100> start<00:01:23.310> doing<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:24.240> step<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you start doing this just step up and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.730 
you start doing this just step up and
just<00:01:25.500> clean<00:01:26.460> strikes<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.259> back<00:01:28.470> up

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
just clean strikes and then back up

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.410 
just clean strikes and then back up
keepers<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.610> ready<00:01:29.790> we're<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.270> up

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
keepers got to be ready we're going up

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.730 
keepers got to be ready we're going up
don't<00:01:30.630> worry<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> balls<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.439> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
don't worry about the balls in that this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.179 
don't worry about the balls in that this
is<00:01:31.890> all<00:01:32.009> practice<00:01:32.430> we're<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.729> striking<00:01:37.189> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
is all practice we're just striking and
