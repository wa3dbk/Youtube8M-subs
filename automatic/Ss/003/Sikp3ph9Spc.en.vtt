a<00:01:57.360> very<00:01:57.840> very<00:01:58.020> good<00:01:58.320> player<00:01:58.649> who<00:01:59.369> could<00:01:59.549> play

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
a very very good player who could play

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.660

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
instead of Lucas I think he might be

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.130 
instead of Lucas I think he might be
even<00:02:02.820> better<00:02:03.060> than<00:02:03.360> Lucas<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.020> know

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
