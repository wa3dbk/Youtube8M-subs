00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.900

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.810
 firstly we have two options 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.110
 if you have swiss as tv you can 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.960
 use their own apps 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.259
 if you have another supplier you 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.920
 can use lib tv for this 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.430

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.100
 I will show you TV BTV because 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.219

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.120
