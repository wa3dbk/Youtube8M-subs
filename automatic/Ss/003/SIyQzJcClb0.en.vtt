00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 men - welcome plus no children 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.060
 rain analysis or IP8 but 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.280
 equipment that I congratulate our 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:13.380
 concept to decide so let's 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.059
 see this fantastic - fourth 8th merit 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.490
 to not expel plan to use the design 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.529
 handed the IP8 and at first glance is very 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.750
 similar with the equipment of the nail 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.240
 is expected mainly with c3 is 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.490
 comprises a total chassis and seek 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.439
 very effective visual at its edges has 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.390
 buy adobe transmit some almost 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.800
 its finishes but even so there is no 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.610
 most comfortable equipment I have 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.610
 on my hands 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.160
 It should be noted that it weighs 144 grams and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.899
 a thickness of only 6,400 Indians 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.700
 your rear camera is placed in the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.800
 upper left corner will make us 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.420
 some extra care do not touch the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.190
 with the government at the time of 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.989
 acquisition of cimpor was even 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.760
 the only physical buttons are 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.829
 placed on your right side where 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.649
 we find a flu button and the button 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.899
 power on this same side we still have the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.850
 votes for the sim and a micro sd but the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.590
 tension can also teach one more 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.899
 card 5 is an equipment with the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.519
 so the work will the Basque are not 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.970
 on the base of the equipment when 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.590
 sound wait ie are two curves 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.270
 of the whole structure we have three 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.360
 games every 16 gb of storage 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.640
 internal and a xodÃ³ that illuminates any 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.540
 led type or even pictures showed in 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.520
 any operation 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.610
 we are talking about the most republican of the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.810
 that go in its 930 version with a framework 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.820
 core 2gb and other four bodies or 1,550 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.890
 we arrived at your disposal and here it is not 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.560
 we found a 2-layer screen such as 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.229
 we see in the real is that it is but we have 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.860
 as waits for us and 31 on htc huawei and 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.960
 standard hd assumption with 424 popular 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.770
 which is exactly the same as thanked you 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.320
 the smallest 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.000
 despite not being a super currency I like 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.619
 enough of its colors and its 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.899
 quality in situations with little or no 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.149
 minimize and above all in one is craque 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.490
 Our instructions were very good. 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.770
 we are talking about a touchscreen 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.079
 capacitive and non- protected 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.869
 thrashed the iguaÃ§u in its version 3 and by 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.149
 to speak on commands is that huawei 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.789
 put the buttons on his own version 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.039
 change the exposure 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.870
 God in the functions of the device 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.740
 and to end this display area 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.840
 missing 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.970
 I said that its dimensions of the five 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.160
 points do not make a 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.930
 equipment and comfortable on hand due 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.620
 their dimensions in relation to their 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.720
 software 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.510
 we have android 50 to ibope with a 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.000
 customization of wacom name emotion and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.920
 user interface on this route 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 There are some things that I really like and 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.910
 one of them is to look universal throughout the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.040
 equipment that we just do a swype 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.110
 down in the middle of its features and how 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.600
 we already saw in the previous revision of the wii 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.460
 warner 6 is that we do not have a 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.860
 application drawer that is the same as 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.480
 To say everything is in one place. 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.210
 stop we have all google services 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.640
 in this with us anyway the brand 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.010
 decided to place applications with the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.710
 Hi, this is a logical calendar in the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.020
 foot and a few more and still is not stud 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.910
 we also have quick access to some 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.500
 features such as 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.090
 example is the flashlight with many 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.980
 Sometimes it works great. 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.350
 while pulling the other samba songs 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.900
 we find two sections when we have the 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.970
 notifications and comments for us 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.620
 I really like this presentation and 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.840
 division on the part of hi 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.970
 the model here analyze a version of 16 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.160
 giga smas of available space only 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.780
 have 10 gigabytes books but we have to 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.700
 suffering and can increase this 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.920
 capacity if we put a micro card 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.920
 sd and up to 120 old that will certainly 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.400
 illuminate all space problems in 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.350
 beef 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.810
 now the point you most enjoy analyzing the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.570
 future of the fia that we rely on the sensor 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.790
 3 megapixels and a 2.0- megapixel aperture 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.560
 rear camera with an influential 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.210
 image stabilization and is the first 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.940
 equipment with four primary colors 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.160
 on your sensor thus enable you to obtain 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.680
 much clearer recording in environments with 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.450
 ovate contrast thereby reducing noise 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.850
 which we are accustomed to seeing in 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.200
 night shots and to help too 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.780
 on some risks 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.940
 we are bored of the ego after 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.040
 some days if you can even room in 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.050
 nightlife is undoubtedly one of the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.600
 best right now is in height 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.060
 physical with a quality almost of a 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.310
 dslr your application is very simple and 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.770
 you can quickly control all the 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.580
 features since 88 without any 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.350
 difficulty 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.570
 for self we have a camera of 8 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.150
 megapixels that will not let you down 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.220
 their personal records and because each 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.720
 increasingly we have more tools 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.510
 hat 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.920
 our imagination away together some ways 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.470
 which will surely remain as per 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.850
 example at last the alex team 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.640
 another theme that before our greatest 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.380
 Today's dreams are over and here we have two 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.570
 one thousand six hundred thousand pieces 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.870
 are removable from its aluminum body 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.880
 since 88 as the standard authorization I go 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.860
 hold out for a full day without much 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.800
 concern about the treasury in the 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.650
 management of the applications we all know are 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.500
 the main responsible for the training 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.660
 of the battery for the Paulistas is that I can 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.380
 ensure you can not get p8 to 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.270
 everyday 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.680
 in my case at the end of the afternoon I was walking 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.390
 always with the concern of having a car 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.820
 walked close to me not to stay 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.040
 to help us with this 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.630
 issue of autonomy to eco with motorcycle 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.970
 energy saving that facilitates a 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.890
 few the less experienced is cut 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.910
 some features and even 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.919
 do the frizz 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.830
 in some applications and now the 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.510
 moment that lives at 88 is undoubtedly 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.610
 no great solution for anyone 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.110
 likes to consider how he will establish 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.240
 an equipment with an operating system 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.280
 Android also has all 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.130
 connectivity possibilities including 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.080
 nfc and all last wifi standards 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.000
 and as I said in this magazine 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.160
 has very positive points can 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.919
 even put without struggle with a few touches 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.470
 of year but this now has a lot of us 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.479
 we have our requirements in the 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.890
 choose our next smartphone 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.380
 I hope there has been another video 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:54.050
 all is well with Tim and left the course 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.700
 stage text video and all subscription if 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.590
 the first time you spend on the channel 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.510
 A big hug here on the ship for tim 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.510
 It looks good and until the next video
