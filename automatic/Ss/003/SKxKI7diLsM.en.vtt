00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.690

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.429
 other oil i am very good 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.820

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.770
 somewhere probably one since October the second with 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.470
 November I will tell 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.080
 let's probably start with clarence that's 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 their line is very well known 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.150
 On the Internet, the most talk about oil 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.929
 blue orchid me very then him and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.730
 The consultant tried to bite 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.280
 I assure that I do not have dry skin 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.770
 really not dry skin but here here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.809
 in the annotation as I later read clearly 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.600
 said for dry or prone to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.239
 skin reddening since i took it 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.270
 oil in the winter namely in the winter I often 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.010
 there are some irritations of redness 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.050
 I decided to take exactly 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.480
 I never regretted this tee 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.969
 really like the basis of all this 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.329
 rulers famous here these oils 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.219
 clarence lies base oil butter 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.100
 hazelnut anode and is such 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.939
 versatile it both moisturizes and nourishes and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.090
 protects 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.580
 suitable for different skin types if you 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.430
 look in the compositions then it goes everywhere 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.500
 in the first place and then added 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 olive oil essential oils extracts 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.869
 Depending on what kind of problems 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.939
 should fight means in particular here 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.700
 in this oil which is called sandalwood 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.759
 essential oils of sandalwood cardamom 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.909
 lavender parsley has she such 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.310
 it has such a tart with me for some reason 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.090
 I even remember chocolate or cinnamon 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.210
 something but my associations smell 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.860
 not caustic it doesnâ€™t beat me 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.200
 like that here are very selected 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.570
 correct essential oils in sandalwood 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.399
 oil it has such tranquility 7 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.950
 properties and help is considered as 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.960
 anti-roper and I read lavender somewhere 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.060
 too possessing such soothing 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.329
 properties that is, the composition is really 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.070
 thought through insert a photo you can 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.950
 read the composition short simple 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.409
 clear and obvious that there is harm there 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.410
 almost no now about the very 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.060
 my oil 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.030
 sensations suggest that she does not 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.850
 weighty super easy absorbed light 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.150
 lay down and I disagree with that 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.980
 butter is not easy 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.740
 fat and nutritious about 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.800
 anti redness scaling 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.440
 dry out in such a complex for our skin 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.630
 period like winter say that's it 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.260
 oil is straight work wonders I smeared 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.380
 everything is gone no I can not say this but 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.490
 with regular use 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.260
 really see the effect 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.960
 and generally on sensations when this 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.930
 you use even the smell 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.540
 it feels like this is not a luxury 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.630
 cheap product now move on to more 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.180
 budget funds this oil from l'oreal 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.150
 luxury food is the first thing that comes to me 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.910
 to mind as opposed to this oil here 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.610
 no specific promises that is 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.550
 it is more universal there feeds 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.190
 moisturizes but what is written on it 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.800
 but it is not intended to combat 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.770
 by some specific problems 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.950
 on the label they state that 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.020
 There are 8 essential oils 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.540
 many claimed essential oils go there 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.670
 at the very end even after 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.250
 odorants therefore also in concentration 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.610
 completely insignificant it firstly 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.920
 second I was a little embarrassed by the collections and 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.350
 these oils themselves and because some 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.520
 of them possess a little bit 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.830
 opposite properties that is here 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.680
 there is an oil that tones and at the same 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.450
 time there is oil that soothe 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.180
 this oil smells more intense than 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.510
 here are these smells honestly not all 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.180
 like here they usually say smells like herbs 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.250
 but it actually smells like essential oils 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.040
 now let's go through the texture 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.580
 this oil is much lighter here 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.220
 than butter from clarence that is it is easier 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.590
 distributed it absorbs faster and 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.709
 base oils that are selected here 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.020
 here goes on my jojoba oil on 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.870
 first place there is not even oil 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.510
 what are they called carp triglycerides 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.880
 selection of base oil oils 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.670
 very very successful manufacturer 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.100
 declares that three drops is enough for 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.160
 to apply on face and neck and zone 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.070
 neckline in my opinion so I am not quite 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.620
 I understand how 3 drops is very little even 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.050
 if you have a very small face all 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.640
 anyway you need at least 5 cap than 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.710
 she wins from the usual 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.380
 cosmetic oil from the pharmacy I already 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.810
 said that the texture is much more 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.660
 light pleasant and 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.340
 they enjoy it all the same I 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.380
 I will try to find a box from him 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.390
 focus photographing the composition 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.860
 insert video here for those who can 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.560
 unscramble the composition 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.390
 what could you look about too 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.030
 volume at first glance it seems that 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.520
 Clarence is a very small bottle on 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.850
 in fact, the volume here is the same for 30 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.160
 milliliters consumption of both oils well 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.210
 very economical you see it i 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.650
 I have been using for two or three months each and 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.740
 made to log butter worthy 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.890
 with the pipettes tightly curled up and 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.930
 I fell another and it turned out so 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.230
 on the road she was lying to me like this 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.440
 leaked packaging there and there ok i 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.170
 i i'm not sorry about this is not about this 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.480
 I know how useful this video was 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.250
 let me know if she's up 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.590
 you just liked me just me 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.960
 often asked my girlfriends who are not 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.940
 very well versed in essential oils 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.530
 oils here they ask what glad than 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.350
 it will be different if I go buy 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.400
 in the pharmacy that's how much I could 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.980
 explained what 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.800
 how does it differ you need it or not 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.720
 already decide certainly do thank you 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.720
 Much for your attention all bye
