and I had some PVC and hose so decided
to<00:00:19.050> build<00:00:19.230> my<00:00:19.380> own<00:00:19.410> for<00:00:19.770> about<00:00:19.980> 100<00:00:20.460> 120<00:00:21.180> bucks

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
to build my own for about 100 120 bucks

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.109 
to build my own for about 100 120 bucks
dependent<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.160> build<00:00:23.340> yours<00:00:23.580> too<00:00:23.820> so

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
dependent you can build yours too so

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.340 
dependent you can build yours too so
what<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.600> get<00:00:24.720> yourself<00:00:24.779> plastic

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
what you do is you get yourself plastic

for<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:28.859> hose<00:00:29.010> connection<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.750> may<00:00:30.750> put<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
for your hose connection I may put a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.250 
for your hose connection I may put a
elbow<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.800> simplify<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:33.630> scheme

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
elbow here and simplify the the scheme

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.819 
elbow here and simplify the the scheme
of<00:00:35.100> things<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:36.270> now<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.570> works<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
of things but for now this works so the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.510 
of things but for now this works so the
the<00:00:38.309> pump<00:00:38.579> will<00:00:39.059> $80<00:00:39.510> pump<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:39.899> Home<00:00:40.079> Depot

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
the pump will $80 pump from Home Depot

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.729

12-volt inverter that I had wasn't
enough<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.659> power<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> pump<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.060> got<00:01:12.570> this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
enough to power the pump so I got this

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.940
