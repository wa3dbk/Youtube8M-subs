side no water is trapped in the system I

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.020 
side no water is trapped in the system I
bet<00:01:14.159> that's<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.579> good<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> house

then<00:01:15.299> too<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> keep<00:01:15.719> it<00:01:15.869> healthy

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
then too to keep it healthy

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.319 
then too to keep it healthy
absolutely<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.549> gonna<00:01:17.670> give<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> entire

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
absolutely it's gonna give the entire

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.719 
absolutely it's gonna give the entire
wall<00:01:18.630> system<00:01:19.110> better<00:01:19.290> performance<00:01:19.890> excellent
