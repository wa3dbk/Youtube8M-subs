about the Berg house pop inna Gigli so a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.940 
about the Berg house pop inna Gigli so a
little<00:00:11.820> bit<00:00:11.969> about<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.420> first<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.290> all<00:00:13.440> it's

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
little bit about it first of all it's

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.390 
little bit about it first of all it's
got<00:00:14.190> hydro<00:00:14.910> down<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.330> which<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.340> case

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
got hydro down in which is in this case

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.010 
got hydro down in which is in this case
a<00:00:17.609> 600<00:00:18.390> fill<00:00:18.690> power<00:00:18.930> down<00:00:19.279> with<00:00:20.300> a<00:00:21.300> chemical

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
a 600 fill power down with a chemical

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.390 
a 600 fill power down with a chemical
that's<00:00:22.289> been<00:00:22.410> applied<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> down<00:00:23.130> that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that's been applied to the down that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.670 
that's been applied to the down that
stops<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.760> down<00:00:23.910> absorbing<00:00:24.449> water<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.470> if<00:00:25.590> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
stops the down absorbing water so if you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.019 
stops the down absorbing water so if you
were<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> get<00:00:26.039> caught<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> shower<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.910> this

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
were to get caught in the shower in this

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
were to get caught in the shower in this
it<00:00:27.539> would<00:00:27.689> absorb<00:00:27.810> very<00:00:28.230> little<00:00:28.500> water<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
it would absorb very little water and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.380 
it would absorb very little water and
then<00:00:29.220> once<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.609> shower<00:00:29.820> stopped<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> would

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
then once the shower stopped it would

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.150 
then once the shower stopped it would
dry<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.810> quickly<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> down<00:00:31.859> wouldn't

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
dry really quickly but the down wouldn't

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.479 
dry really quickly but the down wouldn't
collapse<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> really<00:00:33.840> nice<00:00:34.489> clever

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
collapse so it's a really nice clever

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.500 
collapse so it's a really nice clever
