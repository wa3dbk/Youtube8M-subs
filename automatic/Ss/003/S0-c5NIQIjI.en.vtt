 How are you friends? Raúl Treviño 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.290
 cartoonist and comic writer 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.090
 in my past video 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.920
 I commented that materials used to 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.920
 do my watercolors 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.350
 and well I was worried about 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.670
 to make this watercolor also record it 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.710
 on video so that you could 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.750
 appreciate what way I work and good 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.120
 so that it can be of benefit to 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.320
 all of you who is 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.870
 interested in doing watercolors is a blog 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.000
 of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.050
 from fabian 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.310
 Of the brand 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.140
 watercolor very good brand 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.140
 Obviously, it is better to buy a 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
 fold and make your size cuts 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.430
 I want your watercolors but well this 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.900
 not practical to some form of 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.190
 this side I have what are the watercolors 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.870
 that showed them the past video 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.130
 newton person 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.890
 water brothers brand stadler that out there 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.000
 he told me that you can get the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.830
 expose the city of mexico because who 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.030
 train I've seen them 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.140
 and well, my water container 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.140
 and to wash 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.530
 the brush when you have many excesses or 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:33.610
 I want to change color because what 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.160
 I clean it and also a red slang 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.040
 I use to remove excess water 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.550
 the excesses of paint 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.570
 he also used a paper to make some 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.340
 tests of the tones I want and good 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.429
 It is very convenient because it does not 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.280
 the color range is best planned as 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.600
 we want to drive 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.600
 in the queue 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.870
 here what I do is blur with water 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.830
 so that I do not stay on the line are 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.610
 so marked 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.610
 of the watercolor 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.860
 do not 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.390
 and 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.300
 for example here if you do not have 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.120
 like I do not know does not fade well the 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.450
 ink and this is where I was supporting 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.450
 plus 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.050
 then that happens if you do not have 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.050
 watch out 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.229
 when you put your hands on 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.080
 on paper in this part of here 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.780
 where they are made more like little balls is where 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.000
 has been more time the hand and is where 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.970
 deposits more fat then that's why it's 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.880
 important to try not to touch the 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.880
 paper and washing hands 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.460
 but hey sometimes it's inevitable they are 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.460
 things that happen 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.850
 and I do not say I do not know another way 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:05.310
 to prevent it and well what I sometimes do 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:09.300
 It is here to remove excess water as well 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:14.300
 continue or wet it 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:16.139
 wash the brush in this container 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.870
 quickly and remove the excess 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.710
 quickly here and to be able to do 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.830
 fading 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.730
 I've been doing this watercolor 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.730
 same time as 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.490
 I read the comments of the people 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.340
 who have commented on the previous video and 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:40.210
 some comment that in Monterrey there 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:43.870
 way to find this he these these 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.440
 brushes are the brushes this warner 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:50.950
 bros that call them and there's way to 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.030
 get them here in monterrey 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.860
 there is a place called arturo or something 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.980
 so never yo yo 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.980
 this place but 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.460
 It's a question of me looking for the 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.830
 true when I do not have the answers 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.480
 because I have been depending on 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.490
 these materials that I bought a long time ago 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.560
 time then I have not returned them to 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.160
 buy and if I buy them again you are 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.740
 when I go no longer and see them 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:24.310
 no no he did not visit frequently places 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.660
 to buy material here in mexico more 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.700
 that the lumen 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.770
 and well I have also been told that the 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.470
 boom at the least time they have there in 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.510
 the df then good would be a matter of 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.689
 They throw an eye on them because they are very very 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:41.419
 convenient and we finished this piece 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:45.199
 I'd love to keep making videos 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.279

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.449
