operation so we'll start by doing the
rounded<00:01:22.409> edges<00:01:23.330> with<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> CNC<00:01:24.780> mill<00:01:24.960> we're

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
rounded edges with the CNC mill we're

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.719 
rounded edges with the CNC mill we're
not<00:01:25.380> beholden<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.979> doing<00:01:26.220> things<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.610> the

on in the series when we start

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.870 
on in the series when we start

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
time when we cut the top out we selected

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.800 
time when we cut the top out we selected
the<00:01:44.040> entire<00:01:44.159> outline<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> part<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.540> use

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the entire outline of the part and use

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.679 
the entire outline of the part and use
that<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.320> make<00:01:46.470> our<00:01:46.619> round<00:01:46.950> over<00:01:47.189> cutting<00:01:47.460> file

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
that to make our round over cutting file

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.030 
that to make our round over cutting file
but<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.869> time<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.290> only<00:01:49.320> need<00:01:49.680> these<00:01:49.829> two

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
but this time we only need these two

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
but this time we only need these two
short<00:01:50.310> edges<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> side<00:01:51.149> I've<00:01:52.140> got<00:01:52.200> those

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
short edges on the side I've got those

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.840 
short edges on the side I've got those
drawn<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.070> separate<00:01:53.430> layer<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.759> the

let's talk about tool paths for a minute
because<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.479> something<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.840> might

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
because this is something that might

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.630 
because this is something that might
seem<00:02:07.290> intimidating<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> first-time<00:02:08.520> user

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.360 
seem intimidating to a first-time user
but<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:09.750> very<00:02:09.869> simple<00:02:10.280> when<00:02:11.280> we

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
but it's actually very simple when we

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.160 
but it's actually very simple when we
select<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.790> line<00:02:12.000> or<00:02:12.300> vector

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
is how deep do we want to cut so we

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.290 
is how deep do we want to cut so we
enter<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.010> amount<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.790> cutting<00:02:27.090> depth

show<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.260> little<00:03:04.470> tweaks<00:03:04.769> and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
show you the little tweaks and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.949 
show you the little tweaks and
modifications<00:03:05.850> we'll<00:03:05.970> make<00:03:06.150> as<00:03:06.299> your<00:03:06.840> needs

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
modifications we'll make as your needs

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.229 
modifications we'll make as your needs
in<00:03:07.140> skills<00:03:07.380> progress<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:08.819> now<00:03:08.940> we'll<00:03:09.120> get

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
in skills progress but for now we'll get

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:23.089 
in skills progress but for now we'll get
back<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.540> cutting

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.399 

after<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.150> round<00:03:24.269> overs<00:03:24.629> are<00:03:24.749> cut<00:03:24.930> we'll

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
after the round overs are cut we'll

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.080 
after the round overs are cut we'll
switch<00:03:25.620> back<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> straight<00:03:26.370> bit<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.849> then

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
switch back to a straight bit and then

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.879 
switch back to a straight bit and then
cut<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.359> outline<00:03:27.510> out<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.409> same<00:03:28.620> way<00:03:28.739> we

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
cut the outline out just the same way we

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.800 
cut the outline out just the same way we
did<00:03:29.040> with<00:03:29.219> the<00:03:29.370> top<00:03:29.549> E's<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.999> last<00:03:30.209> video

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.220 

then<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.109> demount<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.680> piece<00:03:36.049> get<00:03:37.049> rid

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
then we just demount the piece get rid

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.580 
then we just demount the piece get rid
of<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.409> tears<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.680> we're<00:03:40.859> good<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.069> go

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
of the tears and we're good to go

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.750 
of the tears and we're good to go
this<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.739> about<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.069> simplest<00:03:44.459> thing<00:03:44.609> we'll

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
this is about the simplest thing we'll

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.339 
this is about the simplest thing we'll
cut<00:03:44.879> in<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:45.120> project<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.870> I'll<00:03:46.049> make<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
cut in this project and I'll make the

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.410 
cut in this project and I'll make the
second<00:03:46.680> side<00:03:46.859> piece<00:03:47.099> off-camera<00:03:47.760> coming<00:03:48.329> up

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
second side piece off-camera coming up

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.940 
second side piece off-camera coming up
next<00:03:48.629> we've<00:03:48.930> got<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.169> cut<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.409> face<00:03:49.620> pieces

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
next we've got to cut the face pieces

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.770 
next we've got to cut the face pieces
which<00:03:50.430> are<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.579> bit<00:03:50.760> trickier<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.419> to<00:03:51.629> make

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
which are a bit trickier and to make

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.940 
which are a bit trickier and to make
them<00:03:51.989> we're<00:03:52.109> going<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.379> show<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.620> what's

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
them we're going to show you what's

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.269 
them we're going to show you what's
called<00:03:53.159> two-sided<00:03:53.969> machine
