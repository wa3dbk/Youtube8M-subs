contains organic surfactant and
peracetic<00:01:08.260> acid<00:01:08.260> which<00:01:08.830> is<00:01:08.950> essentially

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
peracetic acid which is essentially

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.370 
peracetic acid which is essentially
hydrogen<00:01:09.970> peroxide<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.810> vinegar

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.249 

and<00:01:16.369> it<00:01:16.969> goes<00:01:17.119> through<00:01:17.210> this<00:01:17.509> wash<00:01:17.780> tanks<00:01:18.170> it

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
and it goes through this wash tanks it

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.529 
and it goes through this wash tanks it
spent<00:01:18.500> several<00:01:18.770> minutes<00:01:19.070> tumbling<00:01:20.060> around<00:01:20.180> in

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
spent several minutes tumbling around in

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.840 
spent several minutes tumbling around in
this<00:01:20.630> wash<00:01:20.899> tank<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.560> then<00:01:21.950> travels<00:01:22.610> up<00:01:22.759> a

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
this wash tank and then travels up a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.399 
this wash tank and then travels up a
conveyor<00:01:23.210> belt<00:01:23.270> where<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:23.840> soap<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.320> the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
conveyor belt where the soap and the

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.460 
conveyor belt where the soap and the
peracetic<00:01:25.070> acid<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.700> rinsed<00:01:26.539> off<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:27.289> goes

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
peracetic acid is rinsed off it goes

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.370 
peracetic acid is rinsed off it goes
into<00:01:27.710> an<00:01:28.100> additional<00:01:29.060> tank<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.869> has<00:01:30.079> water

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
into an additional tank that has water

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.399 
into an additional tank that has water
jets<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.070> tumbles<00:01:31.429> around<00:01:31.789> and<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.929> that's

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
jets the tumbles around and and that's

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.609 
jets the tumbles around and and that's
essentially<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:34.210> second<00:01:35.210> rent<00:01:35.420> stage<00:01:35.720> then<00:01:36.439> it

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
essentially a second rent stage then it

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.410 
essentially a second rent stage then it
feeds<00:01:36.829> out<00:01:37.039> onto<00:01:37.399> a<00:01:37.460> conveyor<00:01:37.819> belt<00:01:37.939> with

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
feeds out onto a conveyor belt with

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.330 
feeds out onto a conveyor belt with
additional<00:01:38.929> rinse<00:01:39.170> nozzles<00:01:39.740> for<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.979> third

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
additional rinse nozzles for a third

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.490 
additional rinse nozzles for a third
Rance<00:01:40.700> phase<00:01:41.000> when<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.750> harvest<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.289> grass

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
Rance phase when you harvest the grass

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.249 
Rance phase when you harvest the grass
we<00:01:43.159> do<00:01:43.549> what<00:01:43.700> we<00:01:43.729> can<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.090> avoid<00:01:44.390> bruising<00:01:45.110> it

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
we do what we can to avoid bruising it

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.649 
we do what we can to avoid bruising it
and<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:46.189> even<00:01:46.549> though<00:01:46.640> our<00:01:46.670> system<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.450> looks

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
and so even though our system it looks

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.779 
and so even though our system it looks
big<00:01:47.899> in<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.319> the<00:01:48.920> grass<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.189> moving<00:01:49.759> through

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
big in and the grass is moving through

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.190 
big in and the grass is moving through
there<00:01:50.090> very<00:01:50.270> quickly<00:01:50.509> it's<00:01:50.840> actually<00:01:51.170> very

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
there very quickly it's actually very

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.320 
there very quickly it's actually very
carefully<00:01:51.830> designed<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.399> not<00:01:52.610> lose<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.119> grass

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
carefully designed to not lose the grass

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.210 
carefully designed to not lose the grass
and<00:01:53.689> so<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.200> we<00:01:54.289> can<00:01:54.470> keep<00:01:54.679> those<00:01:54.920> fresh

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
and so that we can keep those fresh

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.499 
and so that we can keep those fresh
qualities<00:01:55.759> as<00:01:55.970> much<00:01:56.119> as<00:01:56.270> possible<00:01:58.209> now<00:01:59.209> once

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
qualities as much as possible now once

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.919 
qualities as much as possible now once
we<00:01:59.720> crush<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.500> cells<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.099> we<00:02:01.189> juice<00:02:01.490> it

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
we crush the cells and we juice it

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.419 
we crush the cells and we juice it
nature<00:02:02.929> is<00:02:02.959> designed<00:02:03.500> for<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:03.920> juice<00:02:04.220> to

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
nature is designed for that juice to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.639 
nature is designed for that juice to
break<00:02:04.729> down<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.450> starts<00:02:05.869> digesting<00:02:06.500> itself

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
break down and starts digesting itself

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.969 
break down and starts digesting itself
because<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:07.640> has<00:02:07.909> all<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.179> live<00:02:08.479> enzymes<00:02:08.979> that

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
because it has all the live enzymes that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.550 
because it has all the live enzymes that
nature<00:02:10.759> has<00:02:10.880> provided<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.569> so<00:02:11.989> we<00:02:12.170> chill<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
nature has provided and so we chill the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
really a neat process seeing how barley

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.870 
really a neat process seeing how barley
max<00:04:47.050> was<00:04:47.290> made<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:47.740> had<00:04:48.040> no<00:04:48.280> idea<00:04:48.700> the

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
max was made I had no idea the

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.940 
max was made I had no idea the
intricacies<00:04:49.540> and<00:04:49.570> all<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.260> detail<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.740> takes

intricacies and all the detail it takes
to<00:04:51.220> create<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.700> barley<00:04:52.000> max<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.420> we<00:04:52.540> drink

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
to create the barley max that we drink

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.930 
to create the barley max that we drink
every<00:04:53.020> day<00:04:53.170> did<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:53.860> see<00:04:54.010> all<00:04:54.130> that<00:04:54.310> water<00:04:54.610> I

every day did you see all that water I
mean<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.140> cleaning<00:04:56.590> process<00:04:56.800> is<00:04:57.370> so

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
mean the the cleaning process is so

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.430 
mean the the cleaning process is so
thorough<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.750> know<00:04:58.840> not<00:04:58.990> only<00:04:59.050> is<00:04:59.350> it

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
thorough and you know not only is it

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.780 
thorough and you know not only is it
clean<00:04:59.680> but<00:04:59.830> then<00:04:59.980> it's<00:05:00.130> rinsed<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.640> then

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
product and throughout many of the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.640 
product and throughout many of the
processes<00:05:09.610> they<00:05:10.330> actually<00:05:10.780> take<00:05:10.960> samples<00:05:11.260> and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
processes they actually take samples and

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.010 
processes they actually take samples and
they<00:05:11.800> test<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.430> again<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:13.150> again<00:05:13.270> before<00:05:13.780> it

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
they test it again and again before it

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.810 
they test it again and again before it
finally<00:05:14.230> turns<00:05:14.530> into<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.950> powder<00:05:15.130> and

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
finally turns into the powder and

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.390 
finally turns into the powder and
they're<00:05:16.540> testing<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:16.960> for<00:05:17.140> not<00:05:17.320> not<00:05:17.860> only<00:05:18.100> are

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
they're testing it for not not only are

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.430 
they're testing it for not not only are
they<00:05:18.490> testing<00:05:18.670> it<00:05:18.910> for<00:05:19.150> like<00:05:19.660> chlorophyll<00:05:20.200> but

they're<00:05:20.530> also<00:05:20.680> testing<00:05:21.040> it<00:05:21.310> for<00:05:21.400> pathogens<00:05:21.970> to

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
they're also testing it for pathogens to

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.730 
they're also testing it for pathogens to
make<00:05:22.360> sure<00:05:22.540> that<00:05:22.720> nothing<00:05:23.200> is<00:05:23.560> getting

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
fields were incredibly rich in nutrient

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.400 
fields were incredibly rich in nutrient
dense<00:05:45.700> I<00:05:45.940> just<00:05:46.330> had<00:05:46.480> no<00:05:46.630> idea<00:05:46.990> that<00:05:47.200> that

dense I just had no idea that that

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.980 
dense I just had no idea that that
wasn't<00:05:47.860> alone<00:05:48.490> there's<00:05:48.910> so<00:05:49.120> many<00:05:49.300> other<00:05:49.600> steps
