traditional down rigging rods because
we're<00:02:52.409> using<00:02:52.969> why<00:02:53.969> your<00:02:54.180> line<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.659> this

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
we're using why your line on this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.229 
we're using why your line on this
particular<00:02:55.319> outfit<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.579> rod<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.909> a<00:02:56.939> little

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
particular outfit the rod is a little

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.599 
particular outfit the rod is a little
bit<00:02:57.359> stiffer<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.049> because<00:02:59.040> we've<00:02:59.189> got<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> lot

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
bit stiffer and because we've got a lot

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.640 
bit stiffer and because we've got a lot
of<00:02:59.790> wire<00:03:00.030> out<00:03:00.359> and<00:03:00.629> it's<00:03:00.780> actually<00:03:01.230> multi

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
of wire out and it's actually multi

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.050 
of wire out and it's actually multi
strand<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.129> think<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.459> seven<00:03:02.730> strand

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
strand I think it's seven strand

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.380 
strand I think it's seven strand
stainless<00:03:03.659> wire<00:03:04.340> we've<00:03:05.340> got<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.609> board<00:03:06.030> that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
stainless wire we've got a board that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.390 
stainless wire we've got a board that
you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.689> see<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.959> attached<00:03:07.319> permanently<00:03:07.769> to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
you can see is attached permanently to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.250 
you can see is attached permanently to
the<00:03:08.430> line<00:03:08.730> while<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.629> was<00:03:09.750> out<00:03:09.900> there<00:03:10.019> trolling

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
the line while it was out there trolling

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.649 
the line while it was out there trolling
when<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:10.709> get<00:03:10.859> it<00:03:10.980> close<00:03:11.280> we're<00:03:12.209> gonna<00:03:12.389> take

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
when we get it close we're gonna take

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.750 
when we get it close we're gonna take
the<00:03:12.840> board<00:03:13.079> off<00:03:13.290> although<00:03:13.980> how<00:03:14.129> much<00:03:14.280> line<00:03:14.579> is

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
the board off although how much line is

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.539 
the board off although how much line is
behind<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.209> board<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:16.470> one's<00:03:16.620> six<00:03:17.069> colors

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
behind the board that one's six colors

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.479 
behind the board that one's six colors
from<00:03:18.090> LEDs<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.930> 60<00:03:19.319> yards<00:03:19.680> plus<00:03:19.859> about<00:03:20.189> 100

foot leader okay so I'm going to take my
time<00:03:22.650> it's<00:03:22.980> out<00:03:23.129> there<00:03:23.340> yeah<00:03:23.669> you're<00:03:23.909> gonna<00:03:24.030> be

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
time it's out there yeah you're gonna be

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.780 
time it's out there yeah you're gonna be
there<00:03:24.419> true<00:03:24.720> yeah<00:03:25.139> that's<00:03:25.470> okay<00:03:25.829> once<00:03:26.549> we<00:03:26.669> get

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
there true yeah that's okay once we get

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.949 
there true yeah that's okay once we get
the<00:03:26.939> board<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.299> it'll<00:03:27.480> be<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.629> little<00:03:27.810> bit

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
the board and it'll be a little bit

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.289 
the board and it'll be a little bit
quicker<00:03:28.489> doesn't<00:03:29.489> feel<00:03:29.609> like<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.760> big<00:03:30.000> fish<00:03:30.269> but

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
quicker doesn't feel like a big fish but

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.539 
quicker doesn't feel like a big fish but
you<00:03:30.689> really<00:03:31.230> can't<00:03:31.470> tell<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:32.069> shoot<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> big

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
you really can't tell you shoot a big

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.729 
you really can't tell you shoot a big
fish<00:03:32.819> scream<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.629> give<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.409> a<00:03:34.439> lot<00:03:34.590> of

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
fish scream and give you a lot of

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.619 
fish scream and give you a lot of
resistance<00:03:35.150> you'll<00:03:36.150> see<00:03:36.299> what<00:03:36.419> i'm<00:03:36.510> doing

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
resistance you'll see what i'm doing

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.119 
resistance you'll see what i'm doing
here<00:03:36.750> i'm<00:03:36.959> actually<00:03:37.079> backing<00:03:37.680> up<00:03:37.799> as<00:03:37.980> I'm

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
here i'm actually backing up as I'm

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.789 
here i'm actually backing up as I'm
retrieving<00:03:38.730> which<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.180> good<00:03:39.389> idea<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.590> that

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
retrieving which is a good idea so that

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.250 
retrieving which is a good idea so that
the<00:03:40.950> board<00:03:41.220> doesn't<00:03:41.519> get<00:03:41.760> too<00:03:41.939> close<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:43.109> the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the board doesn't get too close to the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.490 
the board doesn't get too close to the
tip<00:03:43.439> of<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.680> rod<00:03:44.870> now<00:03:45.870> all<00:03:46.049> those<00:03:46.169> on<00:03:46.379> his

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
tip of the rod now all those on his

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.849 
tip of the rod now all those on his
tiptoes<00:03:47.599> releasing<00:03:48.599> it<00:03:48.750> he's<00:03:49.319> releasing<00:03:49.620> it

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
tiptoes releasing it he's releasing it

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.420 
tiptoes releasing it he's releasing it
nice<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.220> gently<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.609> there's<00:03:50.819> no<00:03:50.970> snap<00:03:52.430> which

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
nice and gently so there's no snap which

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.300 
nice and gently so there's no snap which
kind<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.120> helps<00:03:54.419> to<00:03:54.599> keep<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.930> fish<00:03:55.139> on<00:03:55.379> and

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
kind of helps to keep the fish on and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.369 
kind of helps to keep the fish on and
this<00:03:56.489> is<00:03:56.669> where<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.000> work<00:03:57.239> starts<00:03:57.750> if<00:03:58.169> you

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
this is where the work starts if you

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.750 
this is where the work starts if you
watch<00:03:58.560> this<00:03:58.799> real<00:03:59.069> it's<00:03:59.340> got<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> lot<00:03:59.729> of

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
almost like pop-can material so these

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.210 
almost like pop-can material so these
spoons<00:06:11.780> are<00:06:11.930> not<00:06:12.080> designed<00:06:12.470> for<00:06:12.560> casting

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
even jet divers and so on so the idea of

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.980 
even jet divers and so on so the idea of
using<00:06:25.130> a<00:06:25.370> light<00:06:25.520> spoon<00:06:25.850> is<00:06:26.060> that<00:06:26.300> you're<00:06:26.840> not

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
using a light spoon is that you're not

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.870 
using a light spoon is that you're not
using<00:06:27.230> the<00:06:27.440> spoon<00:06:27.680> itself<00:06:28.100> to<00:06:28.250> get<00:06:28.400> down<00:06:28.610> deep

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
using the spoon itself to get down deep

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.400 
using the spoon itself to get down deep
you're<00:06:29.330> using<00:06:29.480> something<00:06:29.810> else<00:06:29.990> to<00:06:30.140> get<00:06:30.320> the

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
you're using something else to get the

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.930 
you're using something else to get the
spoon<00:06:30.650> there<00:06:30.860> and<00:06:31.040> you<00:06:31.130> want<00:06:31.310> the<00:06:31.430> spoon<00:06:31.670> to
