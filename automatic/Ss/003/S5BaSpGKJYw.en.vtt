another<00:01:59.730> program<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:01.280> smart<00:02:02.280> RAM<00:02:02.460> which<00:02:02.940> comes

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
another program is smart RAM which comes

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.200 
another program is smart RAM which comes
with<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.770> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> use<00:02:04.980> deep<00:02:05.370> Clank<00:02:05.670> deep

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210

ccleaner<00:05:27.360> than<00:05:27.720> what<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:27.900> usually<00:05:27.960> do<00:05:28.380> is<00:05:28.410> this

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
ccleaner than what I usually do is this

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.300 
ccleaner than what I usually do is this
defragment<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:30.479> C<00:05:30.630> Drive<00:05:30.780> it's<00:05:31.770> basically

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
defragment the C Drive it's basically

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.740 
defragment the C Drive it's basically
the<00:05:32.840> hard<00:05:33.840> drive<00:05:34.020> is<00:05:34.050> like<00:05:34.289> peeing<00:05:34.740> disk<00:05:35.100> and

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
the hard drive is like peeing disk and

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.680 
the hard drive is like peeing disk and
the<00:05:36.750> more<00:05:37.080> fragmented<00:05:38.039> it<00:05:38.370> is<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:39.330> slower

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
the more fragmented it is the slower

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.890 
the more fragmented it is the slower
it's<00:05:40.169> processing<00:05:40.889> will<00:05:41.100> be<00:05:41.280> so<00:05:42.210> what<00:05:42.660> you<00:05:42.750> want
