00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
okay something I've got to show you this

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.700 
okay something I've got to show you this
this<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.240> new<00:00:03.540> portal<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.110> power<00:00:04.350> we've

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
this is the new portal of power we've

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.280 
this is the new portal of power we've
got<00:00:04.740> much<00:00:05.190> wider<00:00:05.490> base<00:00:05.819> here<00:00:06.210> I'm<00:00:06.960> guessing<00:00:07.109> it

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
got much wider base here I'm guessing it

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.379 
got much wider base here I'm guessing it
lights<00:00:07.470> up<00:00:07.589> more<00:00:07.830> because<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.610> area<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.090> much

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
lights up more because the area is much

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.299 
lights up more because the area is much
more<00:00:09.630> widely<00:00:09.870> I'll<00:00:10.200> see<00:00:10.469> probably<00:00:10.950> lying<00:00:11.099> for

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
more widely I'll see probably lying for

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.709 
more widely I'll see probably lying for
more<00:00:11.490> space<00:00:11.790> if<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.120> figures<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:12.540> there

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
more space if the figures on there

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.320 
more space if the figures on there
you've<00:00:13.469> got<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.400> archways<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
above the plug point if I had my way I'd

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.950 
above the plug point if I had my way I'd
have<00:00:32.579> had<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> front<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.690> can't

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
batteries this is a great improvement

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.760 
batteries this is a great improvement
because<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.840> always<00:00:39.989> go<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.260> batteries<00:00:40.710> like

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
because I always go for batteries like

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.660 
because I always go for batteries like
nobody's<00:00:41.280> business

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
nobody's business

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.260 
nobody's business
now<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.480> much<00:00:42.660> best<00:00:42.989> rated<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.500> USB<00:00:43.890> port

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
now this is much best rated to USB port

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
now this is much best rated to USB port
drawing<00:00:45.270> direct<00:00:45.629> path<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:46.079> your<00:00:46.289> ps3<00:00:46.739> no
