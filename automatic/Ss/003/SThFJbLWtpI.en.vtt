 Hello I start prolema Statement 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.920
 did before that I demonstrated my 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.130
 sharpener smith hacking game pro 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.570
 it means I will give some nuances and here 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.600
 took another similar means what than 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.859
 different from the previous material in 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.010
 these cases are made old cool 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.590
 means here that's specifically made it 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.960
 walking this node below the horizontal 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.120
 guide made with a little tightness 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.579
 for what it's done, I 'll show you now 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.180
 there is here a fixation goes who exactly 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.160
 quietly then spinning but now for 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.390
 give an example to know it that gives 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.670
 horizontal guides which pluses 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.969
 in comparison with vertical 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.969
 resistant 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:05.120
 called means sharpened knife 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 try 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.280
 would choose nothing specifically show husband 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.120
 when will such a knife mean pin for 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.220
 Opening it non-removable can Chinese 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.750
 you do not know there but it is branded 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.630
 twists here it does not unscrew 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.000
 when he riveted and sharpening 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.180
 I'll show you if we put on 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.200
 the middle to keep the same there with a knife 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:48.440
 try to sharpen that is we are lit 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:54.619
 separate court of sudan 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:57.200
 do not crawl a piece rests on this pin 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.530
 means that our can be done in this 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.530
 case 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.330
 now we look you calmly stroke 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.970
 this is the heels 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.560
 Well, can of course do take such 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.720
 groove cut the stone to gently 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.510
 do not suffer my this case show 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.209
 strongly wants to do when . i always do 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.160
 groove nothing wise this part 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.300
 the blades no when practically not working 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.660
 it is more convenient to sharpen edit but if you donâ€™t 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:40.519
 want to mean grind show how you can 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.350
 what does it mean we can stroke a servant 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.740
 I'm there now left the knife in I 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.910
 picked up in advance so as not to 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:59.400
 speech naschedu we do here we are heel points 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:03:02.520
 bat grind further we'll be on 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.790
 this part means what we do else as 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.740
 select does show fast you had 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.500
 one width means we find 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.480
 the location of this node means for. 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.150
 of this rounded part and the tip 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.750
 will depend on the position let's say 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.450
 on a straight line here in this case 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.770
 we do so to eat here 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.620
 he passed the participant know clearly 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.150
 to publics then we go to 1 as 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.080
 just dragged that part up to about 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.590
 mid move this node court and 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.570
 literally what we really chamfer 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.730
 it turns out one width any 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.730
 There are no transitions to sharpen and man 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.460
 clearly , atmavit them 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:15.030
 the knife was on the workbench 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:16.850
 here he looked to us I do not know all this is not 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:25.260
 running through 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:35.340
 we turn over and we similarly grind 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:42.480
 services start of course here 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:46.970
 narrow bar to apply but also accurately 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.970
 also reported move back 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:15.449
 I think it is clear why it gives the center 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:23.310
 I will hide 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:25.470
 well , not only clarity by the way yes 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.720
 it definitely didn't show you calmly 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.509
 put here in the middle drag it not 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.840
 moves when sharpening does not move when 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.940
 wish quickly moved forward 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.330
 caught angle let's say chamfer width chamfer 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.389
 caught on the rounded ends found 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.190
 the place of gaiety will stand then when 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.409
 when going to the other side just 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.599
 symmetrically about moving vessels and 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:55.740
 points the other side you all will 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:58.020
 beautiful if you let you move 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.930
 to the end here and so chamfer width 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.659
 chamfer signs at the tip of the knife 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.969
 it turns out outdoor in about it especially there 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:09.360
 you can deliver the bottom and always 9 all the way 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:12.539
 that is, run here or here to here 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.500
 will not catch on will be at a distance by eye 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:18.300
 almost imperceptibly if you're there a little 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.779
 millimeter there millimeter trial everything is exactly 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:25.650
 clearly important at the end of the last stone 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:29.009
 there is provision here is whether tango passes 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.639
 the smallest brain which is sharp 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:34.620
 it turns out the devil shook when 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.169
 a one-sided coup always 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:40.279
 it is desirable to put some one place 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.279
 as accurately as possible
