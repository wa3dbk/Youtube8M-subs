00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
learn hovers okay everybody loves to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.290 
learn hovers okay everybody loves to
hover<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.370> probably<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.970> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.150> most

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
hover it's probably one of the most

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.590 
hover it's probably one of the most
impressive<00:00:39.659> 3d<00:00:40.050> maneuver<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.239> let's<00:00:42.480> see

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
impressive 3d maneuver and so let's see

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.950 
impressive 3d maneuver and so let's see
what<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.839> can<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:44.089> ideally<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.690> ideal

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
what we can do ideally the ideal

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.770 
what we can do ideally the ideal
condition<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> hover<00:00:46.620> would<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.690> just<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
condition the hover would be just a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.020 
condition the hover would be just a
touch<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> win<00:00:49.260> 0<00:00:49.800> about<00:00:50.040> 5<00:00:50.309> miles<00:00:50.519> an<00:00:50.670> hour<00:00:50.790> or

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
touch a win 0 about 5 miles an hour or

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.290 
touch a win 0 about 5 miles an hour or
less<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:52.050> definitely<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.739> gusty<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.940> 10

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
less but definitely not gusty and not 10

less but definitely not gusty and not 10
to<00:00:54.390> 15<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:55.019> what<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> right<00:00:55.710> now<00:00:55.920> but

to 15 like what this is right now but

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
to 15 like what this is right now but
this<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.359> have<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.929> is<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.170> day

off<00:00:58.350> so<00:01:00.079> it<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> let's<00:01:02.070> give<00:01:02.280> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
off so it is what it is let's give that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.010 
off so it is what it is let's give that
a<00:01:02.519> try<00:01:02.960> okay<00:01:03.960> let's<00:01:04.289> spray<00:01:04.890> flight<00:01:05.160> routine

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
a try okay let's spray flight routine

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.160 
a try okay let's spray flight routine
everything's<00:01:07.020> working<00:01:07.380> fine<00:01:07.410> and<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:10.110> go<00:01:10.289> whoo

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
everything's working fine and we go whoo

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.790 
everything's working fine and we go whoo
okay<00:01:15.140> there<00:01:16.140> are<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> couple<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.500> different

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
okay there are a couple of different

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.130 
okay there are a couple of different
ways<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.070> enter<00:01:17.250> hover<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.729> could<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.149> start

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
ways to enter hover you could just start

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.700 
ways to enter hover you could just start
to<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:20.100> into<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.550> vertical<00:01:21.270> position<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.929> plop

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
to go into a vertical position and plop

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.999 
to go into a vertical position and plop
around<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.369> work<00:01:23.940> at<00:01:24.149> it<00:01:24.300> like<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
around and work at it like that I

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.229 
around and work at it like that I
personally<00:01:26.009> would<00:01:26.190> rather<00:01:26.220> think<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.000> hover

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:27.239 
personally would rather think of a hover

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:33.469 
personally would rather think of a hover
as<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:28.970> very<00:01:29.970> high<00:01:30.179> alpha<00:01:31.099> area<00:01:32.239> okay<00:01:33.239> whether

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
as a very high alpha area okay whether

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.320 
as a very high alpha area okay whether
its<00:01:33.750> upright<00:01:34.140> inverted<00:01:34.890> or<00:01:35.160> knife<00:01:35.819> edge<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
its upright inverted or knife edge and

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.180 
its upright inverted or knife edge and
so<00:01:36.569> when<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.899> learn<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.349> from<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.830> kind<00:01:38.069> of

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
so when you learn it from that kind of

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.300 
so when you learn it from that kind of
position<00:01:38.569> learn<00:01:39.569> all<00:01:39.929> you<00:01:40.619> got<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.039> do<00:01:41.160> is<00:01:41.280> just

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
position learn all you got to do is just

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.240 
position learn all you got to do is just
increase<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.239> angle<00:01:42.929> of<00:01:43.229> attack<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.069> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
increase the angle of attack and as you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.309 
increase the angle of attack and as you
increase<00:01:44.489> the<00:01:44.700> angle<00:01:44.789> of<00:01:44.970> attack<00:01:45.119> also<00:01:45.539> you

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
increase the angle of attack also you

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.400 
increase the angle of attack also you
are<00:01:46.440> going<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:47.009> need<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.970> increase<00:01:48.959> the<00:01:49.020> amount

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
are going to need to increase the amount

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.729 
are going to need to increase the amount
of<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:49.739> aileron<00:01:50.039> you<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.590> there<00:01:52.590> you

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:52.739 
of right aileron you you have there you

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:54.830 
of right aileron you you have there you
go<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.160> you<00:01:53.970> know<00:01:54.179> technically<00:01:54.599> we're<00:01:54.810> not

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
go see you know technically we're not

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.570 
go see you know technically we're not
hovering

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.510 

all<00:01:59.090> i<00:01:59.150> have<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.510> do<00:01:59.750> really<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.950> change<00:02:01.250> from

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
all i have to do really to change from

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.090 
all i have to do really to change from
this<00:02:01.730> kind<00:02:01.910> of<00:02:02.060> thing<00:02:02.240> into<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.780> cover<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.410> is<00:02:03.830> to

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
this kind of thing into a cover it is to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.370 
this kind of thing into a cover it is to
just<00:02:04.250> increase<00:02:04.550> Bertha<00:02:05.270> throttle<00:02:05.600> increase

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
just increase Bertha throttle increase

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.560 
just increase Bertha throttle increase
the<00:02:06.530> angle<00:02:06.620> of<00:02:06.770> attack<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.250> best<00:02:07.970> that's<00:02:08.450> a

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
the angle of attack and best that's a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.899 
the angle of attack and best that's a
hover<00:02:08.750> right<00:02:08.960> there<00:02:09.399> okay

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
hover right there okay

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:18.300 
hover right there okay
remember

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:35.220 

that's<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.550> way<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:20.290> exit<00:02:21.290> from<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.590> hover

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230

again

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.310 

the<00:02:40.580> simplest<00:02:40.940> way<00:02:41.210> to<00:02:41.240> learn<00:02:42.460> this<00:02:44.320> through

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
the simplest way to learn this through

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.570 
the simplest way to learn this through
hover<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.800> canopy<00:02:46.190> facing<00:02:46.790> you

with<00:03:14.640> inverted<00:03:15.180> Harrier<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.490> something

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
with inverted Harrier this is something

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.890 
with inverted Harrier this is something
that<00:03:17.910> I've<00:03:22.640> discovered<00:03:23.640> lately<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.690> it's

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
that I've discovered lately is that it's

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.090 
that I've discovered lately is that it's
actually<00:03:25.370> more<00:03:26.370> stable<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.720> hover<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.100> the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
actually more stable to hover in the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.150 
actually more stable to hover in the
attitude<00:03:29.550> of<00:03:29.670> an<00:03:29.790> inverted<00:03:30.300> harrier<00:03:31.010> in<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
attitude of an inverted harrier in the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.070 
attitude of an inverted harrier in the
same<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.700> same<00:03:32.880> reason<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.510> inverted

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
same for the same reason that inverted

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.710 
same for the same reason that inverted
Harriers<00:03:34.730> tend<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.820> be<00:03:35.940> more<00:03:36.090> stable<00:03:36.390> and

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
Harriers tend to be more stable and

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.390 
Harriers tend to be more stable and
upright<00:03:37.620> Harrier<00:03:38.570> in<00:03:39.570> all<00:03:39.780> condition<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
upright Harrier in all condition the

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.040 
upright Harrier in all condition the
only<00:03:41.610> thing<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.270> rudder<00:03:42.450> input<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:43.020> a

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
only thing is that the rudder input is a

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.320 
only thing is that the rudder input is a
little<00:03:43.380> bit<00:03:43.500> reverse<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.150> might<00:03:45.300> be

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
little bit reverse and so so it might be

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:54.150 
little bit reverse and so so it might be
disorienting<00:03:45.930> for<00:03:46.200> some

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.140 

I<00:03:54.220> could<00:03:54.910> just<00:03:55.090> almost<00:03:55.390> catch<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.080> right<00:03:56.260> now

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
I could just almost catch it right now

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.390 
I could just almost catch it right now
one<00:03:58.720> cool<00:03:58.930> exit<00:03:59.290> maneuver<00:03:59.680> that<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.250> I've

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
one cool exit maneuver that that I've

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.300

to stay in hover hover very long but

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.600 
to stay in hover hover very long but
