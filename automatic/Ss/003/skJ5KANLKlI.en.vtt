00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
okay this is part two no two part series

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.610 
okay this is part two no two part series
of<00:00:02.570> working<00:00:03.570> with<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.840> Naza<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.380> failsafe

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
of working with the Naza and failsafe

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.160 
of working with the Naza and failsafe
mode<00:00:05.100> now<00:00:05.879> once<00:00:06.089> again<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.779> with<00:00:06.990> your

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
mode now once again this is with your

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.370 
mode now once again this is with your
Naza<00:00:07.610> without<00:00:08.610> GPS<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.570> if<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:09.990> watch<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
Naza without GPS and if you watch the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.990 
Naza without GPS and if you watch the
first<00:00:10.620> part<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.070> showed<00:00:11.309> how<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> kind<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.790> use

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
first part I showed how to kind of use

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.250 
first part I showed how to kind of use
this<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.480> gear<00:00:13.410> switch<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:13.980> my<00:00:14.070> turnigy<00:00:14.549> 9x<00:00:15.260> to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
this a gear switch on my turnigy 9x to

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.859 
this a gear switch on my turnigy 9x to
toggle<00:00:16.550> manually<00:00:17.550> into<00:00:17.820> failsafe<00:00:18.240> mode<00:00:18.510> now

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
toggle manually into failsafe mode now

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.890 
toggle manually into failsafe mode now
you<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.199> watch<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.369> assistant<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.660> I

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
you can watch in the assistant as I

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.259 
you can watch in the assistant as I
toggle<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.410> switch<00:00:24.710> we<00:00:25.710> go<00:00:25.859> from<00:00:26.039> attitude<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
toggle the switch we go from attitude to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.500 
toggle the switch we go from attitude to
failsafe<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:29.670> I'll<00:00:29.760> demonstrate<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
failsafe so what I'll demonstrate is the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.049 
failsafe so what I'll demonstrate is the
setup<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.260> my<00:00:31.470> free<00:00:32.009> sky<00:00:32.989> receiver<00:00:34.309> to<00:00:35.309> enable

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
setup of my free sky receiver to enable

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.819 
setup of my free sky receiver to enable
failsafe<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> Naza<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.649> actually

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
failsafe with the Naza and I actually

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.729 
failsafe with the Naza and I actually
just<00:00:38.309> posted<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:39.050> previous<00:00:40.050> video<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.500> shows

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
just posted a previous video that shows

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.680 
just posted a previous video that shows
how<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.980> set<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.309> your<00:00:41.550> turnigy<00:00:41.969> 9x<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
how to set up your turnigy 9x with the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.650 
how to set up your turnigy 9x with the
free<00:00:42.930> sky<00:00:43.340> transmitter<00:00:44.340> module<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.030> receiver

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
free sky transmitter module and receiver

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.690 
free sky transmitter module and receiver
so<00:00:46.020> check<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> haven't<00:00:47.219> seen<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
so check that out if you haven't seen it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.720 
so check that out if you haven't seen it
already<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.829> receiver<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.670> are

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
already so with this receiver there are

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.869 
already so with this receiver there are
actually<00:00:51.120> two<00:00:51.960> sorts<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.559> failsafe<00:00:52.879> options

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
actually two sorts of failsafe options

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.229 
actually two sorts of failsafe options
the<00:00:54.840> first<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.500> default<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.190> when<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.000> guy

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the first the default is when this guy

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.130 
the first the default is when this guy
loses<00:00:58.309> signal<00:00:59.309> from<00:00:59.850> your<00:01:00.000> transmitter<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
loses signal from your transmitter it

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.460 
loses signal from your transmitter it
will<00:01:01.320> basically<00:01:01.609> maintain<00:01:02.719> all<00:01:03.719> input

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
will basically maintain all input

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
will basically maintain all input
positions<00:01:05.100> before<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> signal<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.420> lost

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
positions before the signal was lost

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.840 
positions before the signal was lost
that's<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> default<00:01:07.650> mode<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> I'll<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.700> do

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that's the default mode and I'll just do

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.539 
that's the default mode and I'll just do
a<00:01:08.880> simple<00:01:09.720> demonstration<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:11.070> hover

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
a simple demonstration of that in hover

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.090 
a simple demonstration of that in hover
mode<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.619> since<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:13.710> doing<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
mode not since I'm doing it in the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.399 
mode not since I'm doing it in the
garage<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.520> don't<00:01:14.670> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.990> know<00:01:16.110> pitch

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
garage I don't want to you know pitch

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.390 
garage I don't want to you know pitch
right<00:01:16.729> turn<00:01:17.729> off<00:01:17.850> my<00:01:17.880> transmitter<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.049> then

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
right turn off my transmitter and then

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
right turn off my transmitter and then
send<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> quad<00:01:20.640> into<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> wall<00:01:21.270> okay<00:01:22.110> let<00:01:22.409> me

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
send the quad into the wall okay let me

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440 
send the quad into the wall okay let me
demonstrate<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> default<00:01:23.759> failsafe

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
demonstrate the the default failsafe

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.840 
demonstrate the the default failsafe
option<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.409> what<00:01:25.560> I'll<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.860> I'll<00:01:26.400> take<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
option so what I'll do is I'll take it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.929 
option so what I'll do is I'll take it
up<00:01:26.970> hover<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.220> new<00:01:29.220> free

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
up hover it and then with my new free

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.800 
up hover it and then with my new free
sky<00:01:30.150> set<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.820> turnigy<00:01:33.180> 9x<00:01:33.210> I'll

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
sky set up in the turnigy 9x I'll

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.380 
sky set up in the turnigy 9x I'll
actually<00:01:33.990> cut<00:01:34.590> power<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.880> transmitter

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
actually cut power to the transmitter

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
actually cut power to the transmitter
and<00:01:36.600> you'll<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> quad<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:37.829> just

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and you'll see that the quad will just

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.460 
and you'll see that the quad will just
maintain<00:01:38.850> its<00:01:39.299> position<00:01:39.479> let<00:01:39.960> me<00:01:40.049> also<00:01:40.200> point

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
maintain its position let me also point

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.420 
maintain its position let me also point
out<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.650> tried<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.299> similar<00:01:42.299> test<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.780> my

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
out I tried this similar test with my

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.630 
out I tried this similar test with my
turnigy<00:01:44.430> 9x<00:01:44.840> standard<00:01:45.840> module<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:47.399> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
turnigy 9x standard module and in that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.030 
turnigy 9x standard module and in that
case<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.240> doesn't<00:01:48.600> support<00:01:48.869> failsafe<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.770> no

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
case it doesn't support failsafe so no

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.359 
case it doesn't support failsafe so no
signal<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.670> maintained<00:01:51.350> when<00:01:52.350> signal<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.159> lost

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
signal is maintained when signal is lost

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.389 
signal is maintained when signal is lost
the<00:01:54.240> receiver<00:01:54.630> level<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.290> your<00:01:55.920> quad<00:01:56.130> pretty

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the receiver level so your quad pretty

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.490 
the receiver level so your quad pretty
much<00:01:56.579> will<00:01:56.759> fall<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> sky<00:01:57.540> okay<00:01:58.439> so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
much will fall out of the sky okay so

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:09.550 
much will fall out of the sky okay so
let's<00:01:58.740> take<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.040> up<00:01:59.130> forever

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:18.150 

get<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.890> nice<00:02:10.129> hover<00:02:11.140> hopefully

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.950 

and<00:02:18.490> here<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.730> just<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.120> second<00:02:19.510> I'll<00:02:19.600> cut<00:02:19.810> power

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
and here in just a second I'll cut power

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.270 
and here in just a second I'll cut power
to<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.260> transmitter

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.000 

bringing<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.910> little<00:02:23.940> closer

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.460 

how<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.320> notice<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:38.980> as<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:40.120> gave<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.540> after<00:02:41.410> I

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
how to notice that as I gave it after I

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.470 
how to notice that as I gave it after I
brought<00:02:41.620> signal<00:02:42.040> back<00:02:42.220> after<00:02:43.120> cutting<00:02:43.390> the

brought signal back after cutting the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.450 
brought signal back after cutting the
transmitter<00:02:44.020> there<00:02:44.650> was<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.770> little<00:02:45.040> bit<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.310> a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
transmitter there was a little bit of a

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.020 
transmitter there was a little bit of a
jitter<00:02:46.270> or<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.570> pulse<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.440> quad<00:02:47.770> but<00:02:48.100> you

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
jitter or a pulse to the quad but you

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.920 
jitter or a pulse to the quad but you
know<00:02:49.120> definitely<00:02:49.330> something<00:02:49.840> that's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
know definitely something that's

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.140 
know definitely something that's
manageable<00:02:50.140> if<00:02:50.710> you're<00:02:50.860> hovering<00:02:51.100> but<00:02:51.850> like<00:02:52.000> I

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
manageable if you're hovering but like I

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.270 
manageable if you're hovering but like I
said<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:53.230> know<00:02:53.350> most<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.920> time<00:02:54.100> we're<00:02:54.250> not

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
said you know most of the time we're not

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.560 
said you know most of the time we're not
just<00:02:54.520> hovering<00:02:54.880> around<00:02:55.000> when<00:02:55.330> we<00:02:55.420> lose

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
just hovering around when we lose

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.980 
just hovering around when we lose
signals<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.590> want<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.400> show<00:02:57.550> you<00:02:57.610> guys

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
signals so I want to show you guys

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.890 
signals so I want to show you guys
option<00:02:58.990> number<00:02:59.170> two<00:02:59.940> for<00:03:00.940> our<00:03:00.970> failsafe<00:03:01.240> setup

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
option number two for our failsafe setup

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.710 
option number two for our failsafe setup
and<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.500> what<00:03:02.710> we'll<00:03:02.830> do<00:03:02.980> now<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.460> we<00:03:04.420> basically

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
and so what we'll do now is we basically

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.370 
and so what we'll do now is we basically
want<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.440> receiver<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.250> emulate<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.930> switch

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
want the receiver to emulate that switch

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.880 
want the receiver to emulate that switch
just<00:03:08.890> like<00:03:09.130> that<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:10.170> we'll<00:03:11.170> go<00:03:11.290> ahead<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.710> put

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
just like that so we'll go ahead and put

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.860 
just like that so we'll go ahead and put
this<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.460> appropriate<00:03:13.060> position<00:03:13.540> or

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
this in the appropriate position or

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.070 
this in the appropriate position or
program<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.680> receiver<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.400> send<00:03:16.080> this

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
program the receiver to send this

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.970 
program the receiver to send this
failsafe<00:03:17.650> command<00:03:18.190> when<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.500> signal<00:03:20.500> from

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
failsafe command when the signal from

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.950 
failsafe command when the signal from
the<00:03:21.100> transmitter<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.790> lost<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:22.450> when<00:03:22.600> we<00:03:22.690> set

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
the transmitter is lost so when we set

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.350 
the transmitter is lost so when we set
that<00:03:23.140> up<00:03:23.170> once<00:03:24.100> again<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.550> don't<00:03:24.790> have<00:03:25.000> an<00:03:25.180> aza

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
that up once again I don't have an aza

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.980 
that up once again I don't have an aza
with<00:03:25.630> GPS<00:03:26.080> with<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:27.100> we'll<00:03:27.220> just<00:03:27.460> do<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.780> hover

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
with GPS with it we'll just do the hover

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.150 
with GPS with it we'll just do the hover
and<00:03:29.320> land<00:03:29.880> while<00:03:30.880> as<00:03:31.150> if<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.960> have<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.290> GPS<00:03:32.830> I

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
and land while as if you have the GPS I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.930 
and land while as if you have the GPS I
believe<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:33.940> would<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:35.760> return<00:03:36.760> to

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
believe you would have the return to

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.210 
believe you would have the return to
launch<00:03:37.120> capability<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.230> enhanced<00:03:38.710> failsafe

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
launch capability the enhanced failsafe

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.930 
launch capability the enhanced failsafe
that<00:03:39.670> once<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:41.080> signal<00:03:41.440> was<00:03:41.590> lost<00:03:41.890> your<00:03:42.700> Naza

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
that once the signal was lost your Naza

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.190 
that once the signal was lost your Naza
would<00:03:43.240> return<00:03:43.630> home

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
would return home

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.550 
would return home
so<00:03:44.320> hopefully<00:03:44.709> for<00:03:45.070> those<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.490> with<00:03:45.760> GPS

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
so hopefully for those of you with GPS

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.110 
so hopefully for those of you with GPS
you<00:03:47.560> could<00:03:47.740> run<00:03:48.070> this<00:03:48.220> test<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.910> then<00:03:49.090> uh

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
you could run this test and then uh

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.350 
you could run this test and then uh
validate<00:03:50.110> or<00:03:50.320> let<00:03:50.500> me<00:03:50.620> know<00:03:50.770> if<00:03:51.070> that's<00:03:51.790> what

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
validate or let me know if that's what

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.800 
validate or let me know if that's what
you<00:03:52.510> see<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.890> what<00:03:54.220> we'll<00:03:54.459> do<00:03:54.550> now<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:54.810> program

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
you see and what we'll do now is program

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.400 
you see and what we'll do now is program
our<00:03:56.140> receiver<00:03:56.620> for<00:03:57.400> failsafe<00:03:57.640> mode<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:58.720> I'll

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
our receiver for failsafe mode so I'll

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.730 
our receiver for failsafe mode so I'll
go<00:03:59.560> ahead<00:03:59.680> and<00:04:00.070> toggle<00:04:01.060> failsafe<00:04:01.600> and<00:04:01.900> just

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
go ahead and toggle failsafe and just

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.470 
go ahead and toggle failsafe and just
for<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:02.980> sake<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.220> me<00:04:03.459> showing<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:03.850> this<00:04:04.120> real

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
for the sake of me showing you this real

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.170 
for the sake of me showing you this real
quick<00:04:04.690> I'll<00:04:04.840> go<00:04:04.959> ahead<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:05.290> pitch<00:04:05.530> up<00:04:06.180> about

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
quick I'll go ahead and pitch up about

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.790 
quick I'll go ahead and pitch up about
75%<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.739> then<00:04:09.370> I'll<00:04:09.489> just<00:04:10.320> press<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.470> FS

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
75% and then I'll just press the FS

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.010 
75% and then I'll just press the FS
switch<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:13.830> now<00:04:14.830> our<00:04:15.690> receiver<00:04:16.690> is

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
switch and now our receiver is

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.690 
switch and now our receiver is
programmed<00:04:17.620> okay<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.250> let<00:04:18.489> me<00:04:18.580> demonstrate

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
programmed okay so let me demonstrate

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.340 
programmed okay so let me demonstrate
that<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.950> once<00:04:20.950> again<00:04:21.450> we<00:04:22.450> pitched<00:04:22.720> up<00:04:22.960> you

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
that to you once again we pitched up you

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.690 
that to you once again we pitched up you
know<00:04:23.440> 75<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:24.010> 100%<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:25.440> what's<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.560> failsafe<00:04:26.800> so

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
know 75 to 100% and what's a failsafe so

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.800 
know 75 to 100% and what's a failsafe so
what<00:04:27.850> I'm<00:04:27.940> going<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.090> do<00:04:28.240> next<00:04:28.419> is<00:04:28.690> I'm

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
what I'm going to do next is I'm

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.710 
what I'm going to do next is I'm
actually<00:04:28.960> going<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:30.330> turn<00:04:31.330> off<00:04:31.540> the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
actually going to turn off the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.860 
actually going to turn off the
transmitter<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:33.040> we'll<00:04:33.310> watch<00:04:33.870> the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
transmitter and we'll watch the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.090 
transmitter and we'll watch the
appropriate<00:04:35.970> sliders<00:04:36.970> move<00:04:37.410> when<00:04:38.410> we<00:04:38.500> cut<00:04:38.740> cut

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
appropriate sliders move when we cut cut

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.320 
appropriate sliders move when we cut cut
the<00:04:39.220> signal<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:40.060> here<00:04:40.210> we<00:04:40.300> go<00:04:40.450> I'll<00:04:40.600> cut<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:40.870> off

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
the signal so here we go I'll cut it off

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.450 
the signal so here we go I'll cut it off
okay<00:04:43.350> so<00:04:44.350> it's<00:04:44.470> been<00:04:44.650> cut<00:04:44.860> off<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.160> can<00:04:45.310> see

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
okay so it's been cut off you can see

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.650 
okay so it's been cut off you can see
failsafe<00:04:45.940> has<00:04:46.120> come<00:04:46.270> on

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
failsafe has come on

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.730 
failsafe has come on
and<00:04:46.979> our<00:04:47.979> pitch<00:04:48.789> has<00:04:49.210> gone<00:04:49.450> up<00:04:49.660> so<00:04:50.410> let<00:04:50.560> me<00:04:50.650> go

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
and our pitch has gone up so let me go

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.439 
and our pitch has gone up so let me go
ahead<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.010> turn

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
ahead and turn

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.640 
ahead and turn
on<00:04:51.689> the<00:04:52.499> transmitter<00:04:53.719> and<00:04:54.719> you<00:04:55.139> can<00:04:55.409> kind<00:04:55.590> of

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
on the transmitter and you can kind of

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.010 
on the transmitter and you can kind of
see<00:04:55.800> if<00:04:55.919> everything<00:04:56.400> goes<00:04:56.580> back<00:04:56.819> to<00:04:57.020> the

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
see if everything goes back to the

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.170 
see if everything goes back to the
current<00:04:58.349> position<00:04:58.529> okay<00:04:59.520> so<00:04:59.580> I'd<00:04:59.789> like<00:04:59.909> to<00:04:59.969> do

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
current position okay so I'd like to do

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.570 
current position okay so I'd like to do
a<00:05:00.210> live<00:05:00.479> test<00:05:00.779> and<00:05:01.259> ultimately<00:05:02.129> I<00:05:02.219> don't<00:05:02.309> want

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
a live test and ultimately I don't want

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.839 
a live test and ultimately I don't want
that<00:05:02.930> pitch<00:05:03.930> forward<00:05:04.319> signal<00:05:05.009> to<00:05:05.129> be<00:05:05.249> sent<00:05:05.520> so

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
that pitch forward signal to be sent so

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.189 
that pitch forward signal to be sent so
I'm<00:05:05.939> going<00:05:06.089> to<00:05:06.199> reprogram<00:05:07.199> our<00:05:07.740> receiver<00:05:09.199> just

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
I'm going to reprogram our receiver just

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.760 
I'm going to reprogram our receiver just
to<00:05:10.379> have<00:05:10.529> failsafe<00:05:11.069> and<00:05:12.289> go<00:05:13.289> ahead<00:05:13.439> and<00:05:13.589> press

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
to have failsafe and go ahead and press

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.070 
to have failsafe and go ahead and press
the<00:05:13.919> FS<00:05:14.219> button

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
the FS button

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.510 
the FS button
okay<00:05:16.080> so<00:05:16.139> we're<00:05:16.439> programmed<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.189> right<00:05:17.339> now

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
okay so we're programmed and right now

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.700 
okay so we're programmed and right now
all<00:05:17.550> we're<00:05:17.969> gonna<00:05:18.059> do<00:05:18.330> when<00:05:19.199> transmitter

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
all we're gonna do when transmitter

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.730 
all we're gonna do when transmitter
signal<00:05:20.099> is<00:05:20.249> lost<00:05:20.460> is<00:05:20.879> send<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.990> failsafe

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
signal is lost is send the failsafe

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.079 
signal is lost is send the failsafe
command<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:23.719> let's<00:05:24.719> give<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:24.930> a<00:05:25.020> test<00:05:25.999> okay<00:05:26.999> if

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.089 
command and let's give it a test okay if

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.700 
command and let's give it a test okay if
you<00:05:27.180> recall<00:05:27.509> my<00:05:27.689> previous<00:05:28.139> video<00:05:28.439> of<00:05:28.529> the

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
you recall my previous video of the

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.850 
you recall my previous video of the
manual<00:05:29.400> failsafe<00:05:30.199> I'm<00:05:31.199> flipping<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.740> switch

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
manual failsafe I'm flipping the switch

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.369 
manual failsafe I'm flipping the switch
and<00:05:32.159> it<00:05:32.249> goes<00:05:32.400> into<00:05:32.639> failsafe<00:05:33.120> mode<00:05:33.419> so<00:05:34.229> in

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
and it goes into failsafe mode so in

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.499 
and it goes into failsafe mode so in
this<00:05:34.529> case<00:05:34.830> I'm<00:05:35.699> actually<00:05:35.939> going<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.330> cut

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
this case I'm actually going to cut

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.010 
this case I'm actually going to cut
power<00:05:36.749> and<00:05:37.939> so<00:05:38.939> now<00:05:39.060> my<00:05:39.210> transmitter<00:05:39.659> is<00:05:39.839> off

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
power and so now my transmitter is off

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.369 
power and so now my transmitter is off
and<00:05:40.349> you<00:05:41.129> see<00:05:41.400> that<00:05:41.729> with<00:05:42.629> the<00:05:42.719> fast<00:05:43.169> blinking

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
and you see that with the fast blinking

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.909 
and you see that with the fast blinking
LED<00:05:43.949> that<00:05:44.909> failsafe<00:05:45.419> is<00:05:45.689> enabled<00:05:46.289> so<00:05:46.860> I'll

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
LED that failsafe is enabled so I'll

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.019 
LED that failsafe is enabled so I'll
turn<00:05:47.159> back<00:05:47.189> on<00:05:47.580> transmitter<00:05:49.399> okay<00:05:50.399> signal<00:05:50.909> is

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
turn back on transmitter okay signal is

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.299 
turn back on transmitter okay signal is
back<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.449> normal<00:05:51.839> and<00:05:52.020> so<00:05:52.620> we'll<00:05:52.740> actually<00:05:52.919> do

00:05:53.299 --> 00:05:53.309 
back to normal and so we'll actually do

00:05:53.309 --> 00:06:05.980 
back to normal and so we'll actually do
a<00:05:53.339> just<00:05:54.270> a<00:05:54.360> quick<00:05:54.599> test<00:05:54.809> of<00:05:54.990> that

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:13.299 

I'm<00:06:06.410> gonna<00:06:06.560> cut<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.890> transmitter

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:13.309 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:16.749 

the<00:06:13.639> transmitters<00:06:14.299> dead<00:06:15.279> bring<00:06:16.279> it<00:06:16.369> back<00:06:16.549> on

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
the transmitters dead bring it back on

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.459 
the transmitters dead bring it back on
and<00:06:17.149> it's<00:06:17.389> actually<00:06:17.659> going<00:06:17.779> to<00:06:17.869> return<00:06:17.989> to<00:06:18.349> its

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
and it's actually going to return to its

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:29.369 
and it's actually going to return to its
previous<00:06:18.679> location

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:29.379 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.909 

so<00:06:30.379> that<00:06:30.529> was<00:06:30.709> a<00:06:30.739> demonstration<00:06:31.729> of<00:06:32.389> the

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
so that was a demonstration of the

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.820 
so that was a demonstration of the
program<00:06:33.919> to<00:06:34.159> failsafe<00:06:34.669> with<00:06:34.969> the<00:06:35.119> frsky<00:06:35.830> setup

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
program to failsafe with the frsky setup

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.279 
program to failsafe with the frsky setup
now<00:06:37.489> in<00:06:37.759> the<00:06:37.879> video<00:06:37.999> in<00:06:38.479> this<00:06:38.689> video<00:06:38.989> I<00:06:39.050> made<00:06:39.259> a

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.289 
now in the video in this video I made a

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:40.659 
now in the video in this video I made a
few<00:06:39.529> assumptions<00:06:39.889> one<00:06:40.279> that<00:06:40.459> you've

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
few assumptions one that you've

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.589 
few assumptions one that you've
previously<00:06:41.360> set<00:06:41.989> up<00:06:42.139> your<00:06:42.909> Naza<00:06:43.909> and<00:06:44.209> receiver

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
previously set up your Naza and receiver

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:49.389 
previously set up your Naza and receiver
you<00:06:45.399> support<00:06:46.399> failsafe<00:06:46.999> and<00:06:47.389> that<00:06:47.629> also<00:06:48.399> you

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:49.399 
you support failsafe and that also you

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:51.850 
you support failsafe and that also you
have<00:06:49.550> a<00:06:49.580> free<00:06:50.029> sky<00:06:50.300> transmitter<00:06:51.139> receiver<00:06:51.319> set

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
have a free sky transmitter receiver set

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.589 
have a free sky transmitter receiver set
up<00:06:52.039> and<00:06:52.309> I<00:06:52.399> have<00:06:52.429> I'll<00:06:52.819> post<00:06:53.059> links<00:06:53.209> to<00:06:53.509> the

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 
up and I have I'll post links to the

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.589 
up and I have I'll post links to the
videos<00:06:53.929> for<00:06:54.349> those<00:06:54.559> and<00:06:54.889> this<00:06:55.099> is<00:06:55.279> a

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 
videos for those and this is a

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.209 
videos for those and this is a
incredibly<00:06:56.599> useful<00:06:56.839> feature<00:06:57.289> very<00:06:57.679> simple<00:06:58.099> to

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.219 
incredibly useful feature very simple to

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:01.540 
incredibly useful feature very simple to
setup<00:06:58.929> took<00:06:59.929> some<00:07:00.229> you<00:07:00.949> know<00:07:01.039> learning<00:07:01.369> just

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
setup took some you know learning just

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.100 
setup took some you know learning just
to<00:07:01.669> figure<00:07:01.879> out<00:07:01.999> how<00:07:02.089> to<00:07:02.119> do<00:07:02.360> it<00:07:02.539> but<00:07:02.719> once<00:07:02.899> you

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
to figure out how to do it but once you

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.759 
to figure out how to do it but once you
know<00:07:03.139> how

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:03.769 
know how

00:07:03.769 --> 00:07:05.679 
know how
of<00:07:04.099> course<00:07:04.369> it's<00:07:04.639> it's<00:07:05.360> pretty

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:05.689 
of course it's it's pretty

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:08.639 
of course it's it's pretty
straightforward<00:07:05.989> and<00:07:06.559> if<00:07:06.649> you're<00:07:06.829> a<00:07:06.860> GPS<00:07:07.539> Naza

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:08.649 
straightforward and if you're a GPS Naza

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:11.949 
straightforward and if you're a GPS Naza
guy<00:07:09.649> then<00:07:10.009> I<00:07:10.239> don't<00:07:11.239> think<00:07:11.419> you<00:07:11.509> have<00:07:11.659> too<00:07:11.839> many

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:11.959 
guy then I don't think you have too many

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:13.449 
guy then I don't think you have too many
