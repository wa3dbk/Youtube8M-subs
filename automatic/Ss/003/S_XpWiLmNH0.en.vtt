00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.490
 let's see how you can try the 

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:08.000
 RGB LEDs to change color 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.870
 automatically using the CD 40 17 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.220
 thousand 555 we can also make a 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.060
 sequence of LEDs that changes the 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.060
 color of the nails 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.289
 making sequences with different 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.470
 colors 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.470
 blue red and green 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.780
 yes 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.950
 to be able to make the control circuit 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.440
 of the rgb LEDs it is necessary that first 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.930
 see the previous video where he teaches how 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.090
 connect the led rgb local I leave the 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.590
 link to the information of this video in 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.100
 the next video that you should see that is 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.770
 compulsory is the one of led sequence with 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.080
 555 and 4017 in this video you will learn to 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.739
 wire the 555 which is the generator of 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.480
 pulses and the c of 40-17 that is a 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.460
 decimal counter which is going 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.129
 generating a sequence we must mount 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.080
 all the same except the connection to the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.240
 LEDs then we will connect the LEDs 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.040
 rgb in the following way for this case 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.899
 let's connect three then remember 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.670
 that the second leg is the common then 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.460
 with these three cables we bring it is the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.250
 common and the other three legs that are 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.440
 the first the third and the fourth we're going 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.720
 to draw three resistors of one k to 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.910
 each of them three for the first 3 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.350
 for the second and 3 for the third so 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.090
 that if I connect to the first leg 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.130
 I turn on red if I 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.740
 I connect to the third lights color 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.570
 green and if you connect the positive to the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.920
 fourth mention of blue color what 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.420
 let's do now it's programming by 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.610
 wiring something similar to what we did 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.890
 in the circuit 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.960
 as we have 10 outputs we take the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.550
 first and it comes out by part 3 that 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.740
 we connect the first led to the output 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.690
 red layer is reaching the pulse in the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.820
 next led we are going also to the exit 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.800
 red and we connect it to the second exit 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.050
 which coincides with number 2 then in the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.690
 third led ends the red exit the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.400
 we connect to leg 4 we have 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.050
 our red color sequence now 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.060
 we are going to generate that the second sequence 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.580
 is done with the green color of the first one 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.280
 we connect leg 3 and connect it to 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.959
 the output of 7 of 40 and 17 here we see 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.670
 that begins to light the green of 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.890
 second led green exit the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.470
 we connect to leg 10 of the third led 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.180
 the green exit we go to leg 1 here 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.980
 we see that the red sequence passes 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.540
 then pass the green sequence with the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.280
 potentiometer we can follow 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.380
 increasing or decreasing the speed does not 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.080
 the blue color sequence is missing 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.480
 then the first led to leg 4 we go 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.220
 connect it to junction 5 and begins 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.410
 blue sequence we go for the second led 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.690
 the last leg to the 6th floor of the 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.480
 integrated and finally leg 4 of the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.920
 last led rgb goes to 9 the circuit 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.500
 integrated in this way we have already done 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.300
 in its first control circuit 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.890
 green and blue 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.890
 and we can vary the speed 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.640
 let's do a second way of 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.500
 control and that is that a single led changes the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.239
 three colors and then the next one happens 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.060
 like all the wiring logic then 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.310
 We remove all the cables and start 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.930
 speak then red to the first in the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.849
 first part of the first law the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.379
 we connect to 3 we do not go to 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.569
 next led but we keep on 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.609
 that and we're going to wire the blair leg 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.500
 would go to leg 2 of the integral she see 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.180
 which is green red transition let's go 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.879
 for the blue that would go to silver 4 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.560
 let's see that it already does red green blue and 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.269
 we do the same for the next led 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.819
 the red one would go the next part of the 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.459
 sequence that would be the output of the leg 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.590
 7 then the green would go to 10 the blue 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.900
 the second would go to 1 we go to the 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.180
 last red the leg 5 that next the 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.379
 leg 6 the limit the imagination we can 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.090
 do all the combinations that 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.829
 We want to go changing colors if 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.599
 we want we can try more colors 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.189
 lighting two colors in one 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.689
 it gives you the same time remember to support 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.340
