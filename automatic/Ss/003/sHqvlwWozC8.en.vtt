00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 and it is the people who spoke Peter the Marian and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:12.240
 today guys I came back to you that there is a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.019
 time and there without touching but taking this 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.540
 all 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.859
 xuxa nÃ© in a game today as you 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:27.090
 can see is strong needy playing nor was it 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:28.619
 expelled before recently and such day 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.250
 November 1 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.500
 I only got him now she is 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.450
 available at the source for those who want 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.250
 buy for $ 99 and this one asked that it goes 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 be a kind of not producing a sound and such 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.410
 because as I'm very fan of the series 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.140
 need for speed many more more 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:55.890
 I really enjoyed this game 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.449
 I already played so I'll make a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.090
 new saga ae 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.600
 Son of a bitch, the boy now comes a cop. 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:13.320
 back in there I miss that I had the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:16.320
 police behind me that I liked 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.030
 a lot and I'll also make a new series 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.700
 of games because playing live here 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:28.189
 will deforest at first because it I 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.259
 I liked the difficulty of physics and such 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.640
 I'll talk about inspiring figure of the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:42.619
 awesome game 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 I thought they were going to weigh me down but 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.970
 compensates with the beauty and for who it is and there 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.299
 You're getting the tweezers, right? 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.240
 in the list that in the exciting old 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:04.189
 it was black trash 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:09.709
 here is a boy, any accident 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:11.420
 so no daycare center in your car and 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.420
 It has a very cool way 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.390
 Let's show you how to do it. 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.580
 reconverter car that is passing in 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:27.709
 and will see if more ahead in the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:30.049
 video and graphics about it is the 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:45.019
 gameplay, I really liked the game. 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:46.940
 gameplay what speed and I liked it 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.380
 much of this part of a game of 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:56.000
 abiliity 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:03:00.680
 I just thought that the command commands 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.620
 which I found necessary by 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.380
 example that business you are 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.120
 watching left in the dark and doc business in 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.920
 top left corner you are seeing 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.190
 ali and joyce 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:19.190
 that there also you have access to 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.010
 racing events to their cars but 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.120
 I'm not going to talk about cars too. 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.400
 your cars 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.829
 customize your cars or talk 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.690
 about that too 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:36.530
 other video personalization speaks in this 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.480
 and has access to other things there 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.110
 also 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.010
 And look at a car there and then a 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.470
 aspect of the footprint will try to have it 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.010
 it's just does not solve the king in the stop 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.000
 she paid euro gave it today it was not let 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.620
 run away run away today 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.280
 Then I came here to get you. 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:37.229
 born in the middle and the link asking the fans 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:39.699
 that hurts to practice and hurts is the gameplay 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:45.880
 graphic 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:54.340
 it was a good contrast it is out of 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:56.560
 hand and a video and gameplay graphics o 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.970
 car I'll leave it to the next system 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:06.669
 of cars and customization of the galley 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.889
 So that's what you liked about it. 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.240
 video every day here on the channel 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.240
 sorry for this 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.240
 so he has an extreme gambiarra 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.599
 and sometimes there is a day that I can not 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.980
 record of this extreme gambiarra that 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.470
 sometimes they stop working too 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.760
 I was lucky that until then the bug will not go 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.220
 to function 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.110
 but sometimes I do not have time to record 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.870
 so then I hope you 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.540
 understand but even so at least one 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.580
 video per week have a good material 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.980
 quality here for you 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.320
 so this is nice if you like 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.570
 River gives a gem down a favorite to 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.860
 help in disclosure who comments on what 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:57.920
 you think you are expecting 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:06:00.620
 to overcome this game is down there just not 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.810
 come and give me a right favor, comment with 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.100
 constructive argument please 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.960
 so if you 're not here in the 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.600
 channel also subscribe to your 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:19.160
 next video and posted well for you and it's 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.810
 school and champion and stay in history 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.290
 so this is it people take a look at 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.870
 channel also has other videos then and 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:30.680
 managed to take care now only to escape the 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:34.850
 guys , I'll talk later about that. 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:39.820
 this also because that the mother saw 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.820
 So, these people, bye, bye.
