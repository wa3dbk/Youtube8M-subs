all you can see that I've got we got

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.319 
all you can see that I've got we got
hands<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:38.760> something<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.180> do

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
hands which is not something you can do

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
hands which is not something you can do
with<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> oculus<00:00:39.660> rift<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:41.100> another

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
with the oculus rift but another

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.920 
with the oculus rift but another
challenge<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> oculus<00:00:42.300> rift<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
challenge of the oculus rift is it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.080 
challenge of the oculus rift is it
generally<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:43.800> look<00:00:44.129> left<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:45.030> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
generally you can look left you know you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.880 
generally you can look left you know you
can<00:00:45.210> look<00:00:45.329> right<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.870> look<00:00:45.989> up<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.860> can

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
can look right you can look up you can

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.290 
can look right you can look up you can
look<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:47.850> tracking<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
look down but it's not tracking the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.580 
look down but it's not tracking the
position<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.750> your<00:00:48.840> head<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.379> wanted

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
position of your head so if you wanted

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500 
position of your head so if you wanted
to<00:00:49.649> lean<00:00:49.800> forward<00:00:50.239> can't<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
to lean forward can't really do that

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.760 
to lean forward can't really do that
which<00:00:51.809> kind<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.199> takes<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
which kind of takes you on to the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.290 
which kind of takes you on to the
immersion<00:00:53.190> takes<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.270> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
immersion takes you out of that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.150 
immersion takes you out of that
environment<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.350> were<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> look<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.890> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
environment but if I were to look up in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.610 
environment but if I were to look up in
this<00:00:56.579> fireplace<00:00:57.120> here<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:58.379> I've<00:00:58.500> got

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
this fireplace here because I've got

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.290 
this fireplace here because I've got
this<00:00:58.770> controller<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.489> dropped<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.969> my<00:01:00.030> head<00:01:00.180> up

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
this controller is dropped in my head up

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.420 
this controller is dropped in my head up
here<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.949> know<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.280> go

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
here I can do that you know I can go

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.939 
here I can do that you know I can go
over<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.699> window<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:04.350> look<00:01:04.799> around

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
over to this window I can look around

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.580 
over to this window I can look around
corners<00:01:05.840> as<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:07.110> move<00:01:07.260> forward<00:01:07.380> they're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
corners as they move forward they're

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.690 
corners as they move forward they're
going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> kind<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.100> shrink<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.490> guy<00:01:08.640> down

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
going to kind of shrink this guy down

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
going to kind of shrink this guy down
it's<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.060> gonna<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> controller<00:01:09.780> strapped

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
it's not gonna be a controller strapped

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.690 
it's not gonna be a controller strapped
to<00:01:10.590> my<00:01:10.680> head<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:10.890> gonna<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.159> smaller<00:01:11.400> box

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to my head it's gonna be a smaller box

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.030 
to my head it's gonna be a smaller box
but<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.409> touch<00:01:13.560> things<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
but then you can you can touch things so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.370 
but then you can you can touch things so
as<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.490> touched<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.790> wall<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.240> UH<00:01:15.380> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
as I touched this wall the UH the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
as I touched this wall the UH the
controller's<00:01:16.740> actually<00:01:16.950> vibrating<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.610> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
controller's actually vibrating and it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.219 
controller's actually vibrating and it
really<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.210> adds<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> immersion<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
really just adds to the immersion of it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.140 
really just adds to the immersion of it

3d<00:01:28.439> printed<00:01:28.740> prototype<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.610> sixth

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
3d printed prototype of what the sixth

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.640 
3d printed prototype of what the sixth
sense<00:01:30.000> will<00:01:30.150> look<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.570> end<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
sense will look like in the end the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
sense will look like in the end the
sixth<00:01:31.920> sense<00:01:32.100> uses<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.610> space<00:01:32.820> station<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
sixth sense uses this space station to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
sixth sense uses this space station to
generate<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.780> electromagnetic<00:01:34.170> play<00:01:34.770> field

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
generate an electromagnetic play field

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.350 
generate an electromagnetic play field
that<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.310> detect<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.820> position<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
that can detect the position and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.539 
that can detect the position and
orientation<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> five<00:01:37.439> sensors<00:01:37.829> these

all of the devices okay so the next
thing<00:01:49.680> we're<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.040> show<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> four

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
thing we're going to show you is a four

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.969 
thing we're going to show you is a four
point<00:01:51.689> tracking<00:01:51.840> demo<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.710> I'm<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:52.950> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
point tracking demo so I'm going to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.310 
point tracking demo so I'm going to
stick<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.180> trackers<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.689> my<00:01:54.840> feet<00:01:55.049> on

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
stick to more trackers on my feet on

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.370 
stick to more trackers on my feet on
each<00:01:55.500> foot<00:01:55.969> like<00:01:56.969> when<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> look<00:01:57.270> down<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.290> know

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
each foot like when I look down you know

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.730 
each foot like when I look down you know
I've<00:01:58.469> got<00:01:59.689> you<00:02:00.689> know<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> foot<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.439> match

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
I've got you know a foot that can match

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.030 
I've got you know a foot that can match
my<00:02:02.040> articulation<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.899> feet<00:02:04.500> actually<00:02:04.740> have

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
my articulation the feet actually have

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.530 
my articulation the feet actually have
some<00:02:05.250> physics<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.880> kind<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> go<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.390> here

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
some physics so I can kind of go in here

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.040 
some physics so I can kind of go in here
and<00:02:06.570> kick<00:02:07.530> things<00:02:07.710> around<00:02:08.720> every<00:02:09.720> little

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and kick things around every little

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.420 
and kick things around every little
object<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.739> physics<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.190> here<00:02:11.340> you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
object that we have physics in here you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.590 
object that we have physics in here you
can<00:02:11.550> mess<00:02:11.670> around<00:02:11.700> with

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
can mess around with

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.960 
can mess around with
so<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.260> can<00:02:13.380> really<00:02:13.470> get<00:02:13.650> an<00:02:13.740> idea<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:14.070> like<00:02:14.190> it

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
so you can really get an idea of like it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.400 
so you can really get an idea of like it
just<00:02:15.210> adds<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.540> extra<00:02:15.750> level<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.230> immersion

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
just adds that extra level of immersion

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.970 
just adds that extra level of immersion
too<00:02:17.270> but<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> big<00:02:18.750> ones<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.650> take

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
too but the big ones that really take

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430 
too but the big ones that really take
advantage<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.270> motion<00:02:21.720> capture<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.350> we

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
advantage of the motion capture that we

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.730 
advantage of the motion capture that we
do<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.880> one<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.600> one<00:02:24.840> they<00:02:25.140> wake<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.530> that

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
do is the one to one they wake on that

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.400 
do is the one to one they wake on that
so<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.910> would<00:02:27.270> be<00:02:27.300> like<00:02:27.660> if<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:27.990> get<00:02:28.050> out<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
so that would be like if I get out the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.800 
so that would be like if I get out the
sword<00:02:28.680> here<00:02:29.130> hold<00:02:29.790> down<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:29.970> trigger<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.600> use

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
sword here hold down the trigger to use

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.790 
sword here hold down the trigger to use
it<00:02:31.020> now<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.430> control<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.480> view<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.530> dual

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
it now I control the view like a dual

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800 
it now I control the view like a dual
analog<00:02:35.040> style<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.180> path<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.570> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
analog style and the path of the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.320 
analog style and the path of the
controller<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:37.920> my<00:02:38.010> hand<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.520> being<00:02:39.090> reflected

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
controller in my hand is being reflected

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.890 
controller in my hand is being reflected
in<00:02:39.780> true<00:02:40.200> one<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.940> as<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.150> move<00:02:42.360> around<00:02:42.510> it's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
in true one to one as I move around it's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.420 
in true one to one as I move around it's
going<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.080> fall<00:02:43.260> exactly<00:02:43.470> what's<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.130> on<00:02:44.340> in

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
going to fall exactly what's going on in

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.550 
going to fall exactly what's going on in
the<00:02:44.550> screen<00:02:44.850> does<00:02:45.540> interact<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.380> would

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the screen does interact as you would

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.180 
the screen does interact as you would
expect<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.400> can<00:02:48.060> swing<00:02:48.270> high<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:49.040> get<00:02:50.040> it's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
expect it I can swing high and get it's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.060 
expect it I can swing high and get it's
a<00:02:50.280> capitation<00:02:50.730> or<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:52.050> get<00:02:52.590> another<00:02:52.800> zombie

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
a capitation or if I get another zombie

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.470 
a capitation or if I get another zombie
I<00:02:53.580> can<00:02:54.030> swing<00:02:54.360> low<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.820> take<00:02:56.970> off<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.270> legs

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
I can swing low and take off the legs

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.740 
I can swing low and take off the legs
it's<00:02:58.440> basically<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.820> know<00:02:59.910> integrated<00:03:00.510> into

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
it's basically you know integrated into

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.960 
it's basically you know integrated into
the<00:03:00.900> physics<00:03:01.260> engine<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.830> game<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.460> it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the physics engine of the game so it's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.030 
the physics engine of the game so it's
going<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.240> behave<00:03:03.900> as<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.350> was<00:03:04.470> expected<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
going to behave as I was expected to

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.530 
going to behave as I was expected to
alright<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.280> was<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.550> Six<00:03:08.910> Senses<00:03:09.060> new

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
alright so that was a Six Senses new

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.170 
alright so that was a Six Senses new
stem<00:03:09.960> motion<00:03:10.530> tracking<00:03:10.770> system<00:03:11.250> we<00:03:11.970> got<00:03:12.090> to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
stem motion tracking system we got to

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.000 
stem motion tracking system we got to
see<00:03:12.300> their<00:03:12.450> five<00:03:13.050> point<00:03:13.410> tracking<00:03:13.620> where<00:03:13.950> you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
see their five point tracking where you
