00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
devices within ten-second app so I'm

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.450 
devices within ten-second app so I'm
going<00:00:23.050> to<00:00:23.080> close<00:00:23.289> the<00:00:23.470> application<00:00:23.590> I<00:00:24.130> have<00:00:24.160> to

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
going to close the application I have to

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.570 
going to close the application I have to
wait<00:00:24.840> 10<00:00:25.840> seconds<00:00:26.320> before<00:00:26.560> I<00:00:26.830> open<00:00:27.460> the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
wait 10 seconds before I open the

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.710 
wait 10 seconds before I open the
application<00:00:27.700> on<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:29.250> iPad<00:00:30.250> in<00:00:31.119> order<00:00:31.210> for<00:00:31.600> it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
application on the iPad in order for it

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.200 
application on the iPad in order for it
to<00:00:31.900> allow<00:00:32.829> for<00:00:33.100> switching<00:00:33.460> so<00:00:33.640> it's<00:00:33.879> just<00:00:34.030> one

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
to allow for switching so it's just one

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.459 
to allow for switching so it's just one
of<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.360> rules<00:00:34.510> we've<00:00:34.690> put<00:00:34.870> in<00:00:34.989> place<00:00:35.020> here<00:00:35.440> so

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
of the rules we've put in place here so

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:36.800 
of the rules we've put in place here so
we've<00:00:35.739> got<00:00:35.949> the<00:00:36.100> DSTV

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
we've got the DSTV

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.210 
we've got the DSTV
okay<00:00:37.810> so<00:00:37.870> it's<00:00:38.140> connected<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.500> a<00:00:38.620> different<00:00:39.040> to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
okay so it's connected to a different to

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.400 
okay so it's connected to a different to
drift<00:00:39.579> it<00:00:39.760> give<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:40.510> a<00:00:40.630> couple<00:00:40.810> of<00:00:40.930> seconds<00:00:41.320> and

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
drift it give it a couple of seconds and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.870 
drift it give it a couple of seconds and
it'll<00:00:41.680> ask<00:00:41.770> me<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:42.070> connect<00:00:42.340> to<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.550> correct

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
it'll ask me to connect to the correct

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:53.120 
it'll ask me to connect to the correct
one<00:00:46.260> canvas<00:00:47.260> is<00:00:47.559> 2<00:00:47.800> 2

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:00.959 

quickly<00:00:54.130> pick<00:00:54.310> up<00:00:54.430> a<00:00:54.460> defect

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.459 

okay<00:01:01.270> so<00:01:01.539> now<00:01:01.690> we're<00:01:01.840> connecting<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.379> this

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
okay so now we're connecting to this

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:10.230 
okay so now we're connecting to this
device<00:01:07.619> we'll<00:01:08.619> put<00:01:08.830> all<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.280> channels<00:01:09.880> as<00:01:10.090> we
