00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.300
 if you did 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.890
 people become exactly 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.149
 manufacturers 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.939
 quantity 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.429
 corporations will be able to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.429
 and also consists of 11 people 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 I am sure that this is the car 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.689
 let it be so 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.499
 Charlize was passing 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.239
 nature's desire is in us 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.499
 strive for the best 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.010
 think for yourself 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.520
 we freeze and tame 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.450
 we were weak and invented tools 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.830
 encountering obstacles on our way we 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.560
 found a way to overcome it 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.210
 cycle is inevitable 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.980
 but is the result always 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 OK 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.740
 over the past few months to me 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.830
 had a chance to go past the feet 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.720
 but not too often 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.900
 take into account the moral side of the issue 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.440
 so as not to hurt your actions 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.890
 other 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.640
 now and again had to 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.050
 resist the desire to 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.180
 reinforce strength and resources 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.180
 for the sake of quickly achieving the goal 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.189
 we had to compensate 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.090
 own weakness and albeit fast 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.720
 solutions 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.060
 as it turned out nothing more 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 I think we will have to obey 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.480
 if the recipient should marry 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.060
 with more than a hundred 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
 commenting on high values 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 he said that we have the opportunity 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.370
 refuse it 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.310
 stop capitals in the future 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.680
 people technology biology merge into 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.690
 single whole 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.460
 Igor Vlasenko 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.460
 give up your essence 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
 no doubt the path will be a direct consequence 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.129
 but no one can quickly 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.129
 angered dreamed of Moscow 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.349
 we can become partners who 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.349
 always wanted to win 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.879
 maybe even cope with
