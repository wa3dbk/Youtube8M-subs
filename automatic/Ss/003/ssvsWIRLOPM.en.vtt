00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
well enough you can change OpenGL

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.839 
well enough you can change OpenGL
there's<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.760> couple<00:04:09.940> different<00:04:10.060> options<00:04:11.849> fast

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
there's a couple different options fast

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.809 
there's a couple different options fast
will<00:04:13.239> only<00:04:13.750> only<00:04:14.680> bother<00:04:15.099> rendering<00:04:15.669> things

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
will only only bother rendering things

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.719 
will only only bother rendering things
you<00:04:16.000> can<00:04:16.150> actually<00:04:16.450> see<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:18.190> have<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> bunch<00:04:18.639> of

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
you can actually see you have a bunch of

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.849 
you can actually see you have a bunch of
different<00:04:18.880> performance<00:04:19.599> options<00:04:20.590> now<00:04:20.799> you

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
different performance options now you

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.610 
different performance options now you
can<00:04:21.250> lazy<00:04:22.060> chunk<00:04:22.479> load<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:22.930> can<00:04:23.110> set<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.590> to

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
can lazy chunk load you can set it to

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.690 
can lazy chunk load you can set it to
upload<00:04:23.950> of<00:04:24.639> update<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.539> bunch<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:25.900> chunks<00:04:26.700> every

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
upload of update a bunch of chunks every

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.940 
upload of update a bunch of chunks every
time<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.389> can<00:04:28.570> set<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.930> update<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.560> lot<00:04:29.770> more

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
time you can set it to update a lot more

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.320 
time you can set it to update a lot more
chunks<00:04:30.310> when<00:04:30.430> you're<00:04:30.550> just<00:04:30.669> standing<00:04:30.880> still

you<00:04:31.570> can<00:04:31.720> set<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.080> even<00:04:32.229> preload<00:04:32.800> chunks<00:04:33.220> so

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
you can set it to even preload chunks so

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.760 
you can set it to even preload chunks so
if<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.520> never<00:04:33.820> go<00:04:34.330> outside<00:04:34.719> of<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:35.080> certain

if you see stray from your base you also

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.950 
if you see stray from your base you also
have<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.949> couple<00:04:48.099> other<00:04:48.400> things<00:04:48.460> like<00:04:48.939> the<00:04:49.689> laga

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
have a couple other things like the laga

you<00:04:53.020> can<00:04:53.199> play<00:04:54.099> around<00:04:54.310> with<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:55.090> lagging

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
you can play around with the lagging

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.570 
you can play around with the lagging
meters<00:04:55.719> actually<00:04:55.960> if<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:56.349> hit<00:04:56.530> f3<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:57.430> can

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
meters actually if you hit f3 you can

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.980 
meters actually if you hit f3 you can
see<00:04:57.729> the<00:04:57.849> thing<00:04:58.060> down<00:04:58.210> in<00:04:58.389> the<00:04:58.479> bottom<00:04:58.810> left

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
see the thing down in the bottom left

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.529 
see the thing down in the bottom left
corner<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.770> my<00:04:59.889> screen<00:04:59.949> and<00:05:00.340> that's<00:05:01.120> showing

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
corner of my screen and that's showing

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.490 
corner of my screen and that's showing
the<00:05:01.689> overall<00:05:02.400> CPU<00:05:03.400> process<00:05:04.110> I'm<00:05:05.110> running<00:05:05.439> a

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
the overall CPU process I'm running a

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.980 
the overall CPU process I'm running a
bunch<00:05:05.620> of<00:05:05.830> different<00:05:06.099> things<00:05:06.810> behind<00:05:07.810> the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
bunch of different things behind the

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.809 
bunch of different things behind the
scenes<00:05:08.229> here<00:05:08.500> so<00:05:08.919> that's<00:05:09.219> why<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.460> looks<00:05:09.520> so

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
scenes here so that's why it looks so

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.339 
scenes here so that's why it looks so
horrible<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.449> I'm<00:05:11.169> having<00:05:11.409> a<00:05:11.500> problem<00:05:11.770> with

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
horrible and I'm having a problem with

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.980 
horrible and I'm having a problem with
mcedit<00:05:14.349> replaced<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:15.159> bunch<00:05:15.729> of<00:05:15.849> ore<00:05:16.120> in<00:05:16.569> our

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
mcedit replaced a bunch of ore in our

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.050 
mcedit replaced a bunch of ore in our
world<00:05:17.229> with<00:05:17.530> Turtles<00:05:18.009> so<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.280> lot<00:05:18.610> of<00:05:18.639> that<00:05:18.849> is

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
world with Turtles so a lot of that is

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.469 
world with Turtles so a lot of that is
the<00:05:19.300> computer<00:05:19.629> trying<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.729> analyze<00:05:21.729> and<00:05:22.210> run<00:05:22.449> a

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
the computer trying to analyze and run a

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.140 
the computer trying to analyze and run a
bunch<00:05:22.750> of<00:05:22.870> different<00:05:22.930> turtles<00:05:23.379> but<00:05:24.150> Optifine

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
bunch of different turtles but Optifine

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.719 
bunch of different turtles but Optifine
adds<00:05:25.360> a<00:05:25.479> ton<00:05:25.659> of<00:05:25.690> different<00:05:25.870> things<00:05:26.729> it's

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
adds a ton of different things it's

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.180 
adds a ton of different things it's
really<00:05:28.150> like<00:05:28.750> you<00:05:28.780> really<00:05:28.960> can't<00:05:29.469> play<00:05:29.889> well

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
really like you really can't play well

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.269 
really like you really can't play well
without<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:31.289> you<00:05:32.289> can<00:05:32.500> oh<00:05:32.710> there's<00:05:33.190> another

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
without it you can oh there's another

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.670 
without it you can oh there's another
cool<00:05:33.610> thing<00:05:33.639> called<00:05:34.150> connected<00:05:34.930> textures<00:05:35.469> and

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
cool thing called connected textures and

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.580 
cool thing called connected textures and
I<00:05:36.340> think<00:05:37.090> there's<00:05:37.270> some<00:05:37.629> visible<00:05:38.020> here<00:05:38.259> okay

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
I think there's some visible here okay

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.209 
I think there's some visible here okay
so<00:05:38.650> if<00:05:38.800> we<00:05:38.919> look<00:05:39.120> see<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:40.300> glass<00:05:40.629> if<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:42.039> have

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
so if we look see this glass if you have

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:43.740 
so if we look see this glass if you have
connected<00:05:42.550> textures<00:05:43.060> on<00:05:43.240> it'll<00:05:43.599> actually

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
connected textures on it'll actually

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.749 
connected textures on it'll actually
make<00:05:43.960> it<00:05:44.289> look<00:05:44.319> all<00:05:44.800> like<00:05:45.190> one<00:05:45.460> giant

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 
make it look all like one giant

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.730 
make it look all like one giant
windowpane<00:05:46.389> if<00:05:46.569> we<00:05:46.690> turn<00:05:46.900> it<00:05:47.020> off<00:05:47.169> you<00:05:47.409> can<00:05:47.560> see

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
windowpane if we turn it off you can see

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:57.839 
windowpane if we turn it off you can see
the<00:05:47.860> difference<00:05:56.279> see<00:05:57.279> that's<00:05:57.460> what<00:05:57.610> it<00:05:57.699> looks

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
the difference see that's what it looks

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:58.190 
the difference see that's what it looks
like

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
like

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.660 
like
only<00:05:58.440> if<00:05:58.530> you<00:05:58.650> do<00:05:58.830> not<00:05:58.980> have<00:05:59.220> connected

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
only if you do not have connected

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.360 
only if you do not have connected
textures<00:06:00.090> on<00:06:00.560> but<00:06:01.560> if<00:06:01.650> we<00:06:01.770> turn<00:06:01.980> them<00:06:02.160> off<00:06:02.340> and

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
textures on but if we turn them off and

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.370 
textures on but if we turn them off and
you<00:06:02.670> can<00:06:02.820> even<00:06:03.030> turn<00:06:03.180> them<00:06:03.360> on<00:06:03.420> fast<00:06:03.840> and<00:06:04.230> it

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
you can even turn them on fast and it

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.930 
you can even turn them on fast and it
still<00:06:04.650> works<00:06:04.860> still<00:06:05.730> works<00:06:05.910> fine<00:06:07.190> and<00:06:08.190> it

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
still works still works fine and it

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.670 
still works still works fine and it
looks<00:06:09.150> cool<00:06:09.390> like<00:06:09.630> you<00:06:09.750> can<00:06:09.900> see<00:06:10.110> it<00:06:10.200> you<00:06:10.530> can

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
looks cool like you can see it you can

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.470 
looks cool like you can see it you can
see<00:06:10.860> straight<00:06:11.100> through<00:06:11.190> glass<00:06:12.060> which<00:06:12.330> is<00:06:12.450> a
