we're<00:00:16.309> going<00:00:16.400> to<00:00:16.490> be<00:00:16.610> talking<00:00:16.910> a<00:00:17.090> little<00:00:17.210> bit

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
we're going to be talking a little bit

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:33.030 
we're going to be talking a little bit
about<00:00:17.480> charging<00:00:18.170> batteries

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.100 

so<00:00:34.040> instead<00:00:34.850> of<00:00:34.940> going<00:00:35.150> down<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.480> our<00:00:35.600> lab<00:00:35.810> and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
so instead of going down to our lab and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.900 
so instead of going down to our lab and
asking<00:00:36.440> of<00:00:36.530> what<00:00:36.739> they<00:00:36.890> use<00:00:37.160> for<00:00:37.190> charging

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
asking of what they use for charging

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.060 
asking of what they use for charging
batteries<00:00:38.360> I<00:00:38.540> called<00:00:39.410> up<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.620> couple<00:00:39.800> buddies

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
batteries I called up a couple buddies

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.040 
batteries I called up a couple buddies
and<00:00:40.400> said<00:00:40.610> go<00:00:41.180> through<00:00:41.390> your<00:00:41.510> garage<00:00:41.630> and

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
and said go through your garage and

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.380 
and said go through your garage and
bring<00:00:42.350> what<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.559> got<00:00:42.830> so<00:00:43.640> I've<00:00:43.850> got<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.030> pretty

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
bring what you got so I've got a pretty

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.140 
bring what you got so I've got a pretty
wide<00:00:45.350> selection<00:00:46.040> here<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.370> different<00:00:46.730> battery

however all of them attempt to do the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.979 
however all of them attempt to do the
same<00:00:54.620> thing<00:00:54.860> that's<00:00:55.190> recharge<00:00:55.780> 12<00:00:56.780> volt

automotive<00:00:57.739> batteries<00:00:58.190> what<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.760> want<00:00:58.970> to

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
automotive batteries what you want to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.240 
automotive batteries what you want to
make<00:00:59.540> sure<00:00:59.780> of<00:00:59.960> is<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.170> if<00:01:00.650> your<00:01:00.830> battery

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
make sure of is that if your battery

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.030 
make sure of is that if your battery
ever<00:01:01.489> gets<00:01:02.180> discharged<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.320> get<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.890> it

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
ever gets discharged that you get to it

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.370 
ever gets discharged that you get to it
quickly<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.729> then<00:01:05.330> recharge<00:01:05.870> it<00:01:06.110> quickly

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
quickly and then recharge it quickly

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.350 
quickly and then recharge it quickly
because<00:01:06.860> if<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.190> leave<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.640> in<00:01:07.760> a<00:01:07.850> discharged

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
because if you leave it in a discharged

because if you leave it in a discharged
state<00:01:09.729> sulfation<00:01:10.729> sets<00:01:11.210> in<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.540> battery<00:01:12.020> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
state sulfation sets in to a battery and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.730 
state sulfation sets in to a battery and
what<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.520> electrolyte<00:01:13.940> actually

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
what that is is the electrolyte actually

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.060 
what that is is the electrolyte actually
crystallizes<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.750> forms<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.470> crystals<00:01:18.920> that

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
crystallizes and forms the crystals that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.770 
crystallizes and forms the crystals that
make<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.400> very<00:01:19.430> difficult<00:01:19.940> for<00:01:20.360> your<00:01:20.420> battery

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
make it very difficult for your battery

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.690 
make it very difficult for your battery
to<00:01:20.930> be<00:01:20.960> recharged<00:01:21.710> if<00:01:22.159> you've<00:01:22.310> ever<00:01:22.430> noticed

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
to be recharged if you've ever noticed

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.149 
to be recharged if you've ever noticed
that<00:01:23.119> your<00:01:23.810> battery<00:01:24.140> seems<00:01:24.440> to<00:01:24.590> work<00:01:24.890> well

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
that your battery seems to work well

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.219 
that your battery seems to work well
after<00:01:25.580> it's<00:01:25.729> charged<00:01:26.090> but<00:01:26.360> after<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:27.110> know

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
after it's charged but after you know

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.830 
after it's charged but after you know
even<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:27.890> short<00:01:28.130> period<00:01:28.400> of<00:01:28.549> time<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.820> day<00:01:29.150> or<00:01:29.420> two

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
even a short period of time a day or two

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.050 
even a short period of time a day or two
the<00:01:30.320> battery<00:01:30.710> discharges<00:01:31.280> at<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.610> fast<00:01:31.880> rate

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
the battery discharges at a fast rate

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.110 
the battery discharges at a fast rate
that<00:01:32.990> can<00:01:33.350> be<00:01:33.560> caused<00:01:33.800> by<00:01:34.070> sulfation<00:01:34.580> so

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
that can be caused by sulfation so

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.430 
that can be caused by sulfation so
almost<00:01:35.900> any<00:01:36.640> battery<00:01:37.640> charger<00:01:38.240> works<00:01:38.870> well

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
almost any battery charger works well

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.440 
almost any battery charger works well
some<00:01:39.950> work<00:01:40.160> better<00:01:40.370> than<00:01:40.610> others<00:01:40.880> for<00:01:40.910> certain

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
some work better than others for certain

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.010 
some work better than others for certain
technologies<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.860> people<00:01:43.730> ask<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:44.360> lot<00:01:44.450> lay<00:01:44.900> on

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
technologies so people ask a lot lay on

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.000 
technologies so people ask a lot lay on
what<00:01:45.290> brand<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:45.860> charger<00:01:46.370> do<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.580> buy<00:01:48.010> what

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
what brand of charger do I buy what

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.280 
what brand of charger do I buy what
what's<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.000> right<00:01:50.210> charger<00:01:50.750> for<00:01:50.960> certain

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
what's the right charger for certain

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.670 
what's the right charger for certain
technologies<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:53.210> typically<00:01:53.660> recommend<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:54.410> 10

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
technologies we typically recommend a 10

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.850 
technologies we typically recommend a 10
amp<00:01:54.860> charger<00:01:55.490> or<00:01:55.700> something<00:01:56.690> in<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:56.930> range<00:01:57.380> 8

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
amp charger or something in that range 8

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.480 
amp charger or something in that range 8
amp<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:59.060> 15<00:01:59.510> amps<00:01:59.960> that's<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.320> good<00:02:00.560> charge<00:02:01.190> rate

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
amp to 15 amps that's a good charge rate

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.630 
amp to 15 amps that's a good charge rate
for<00:02:01.940> most<00:02:02.090> batteries<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:04.130> reason<00:02:04.370> why<00:02:04.490> we

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
for most batteries and the reason why we

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.160 
for most batteries and the reason why we
choose<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.240> because<00:02:05.510> you<00:02:05.630> can<00:02:05.750> hook<00:02:05.930> up<00:02:06.080> a

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
choose that is because you can hook up a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.810 
choose that is because you can hook up a
charger<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.770> completely<00:02:07.340> discharged

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
charger to a completely discharged

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.330 
charger to a completely discharged
battery<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.959> will<00:02:09.080> charge<00:02:09.319> overnight<00:02:09.979> if

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
battery and it will charge overnight if

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.800 
battery and it will charge overnight if
you<00:02:10.580> are<00:02:10.640> using<00:02:10.970> your<00:02:11.120> alternator<00:02:11.720> to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
you are using your alternator to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.869 
you are using your alternator to
recharge<00:02:12.379> a<00:02:12.560> deeply<00:02:12.920> discharged<00:02:13.400> battery

time and time again you're gonna find

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.800 
time and time again you're gonna find
that<00:02:16.430> your<00:02:16.610> alternator<00:02:17.090> will<00:02:17.300> eventually
