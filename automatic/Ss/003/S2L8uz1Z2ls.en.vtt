00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
the resistance okay the five reasons not

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.949 
the resistance okay the five reasons not
to<00:03:42.470> get<00:03:42.709> surgery<00:03:43.549> five<00:03:44.150> reasons<00:03:44.420> against

to get surgery five reasons against

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.430 
to get surgery five reasons against
weight<00:03:45.140> loss<00:03:45.379> surgery<00:03:46.930> obviously<00:03:47.930> it's

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
weight loss surgery obviously it's

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.210 
weight loss surgery obviously it's
dangerous<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:49.840> could<00:03:50.840> die<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:52.040> got<00:03:52.190> to

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
dangerous you could die and you got to

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.069 
dangerous you could die and you got to
think<00:03:52.459> about<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.299> that's<00:03:53.720> why<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:53.900> think

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
think about that so that's why I think

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.119 
think about that so that's why I think
it<00:03:54.799> should<00:03:55.340> be<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.459> last<00:03:55.730> resort<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.829> let<00:03:58.069> me

of stuff about the erosion zand the
slipping<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.669> everything<00:04:38.389> but<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:38.599> spent

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
slipping and everything but I spent

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.430 
slipping and everything but I spent
months<00:04:39.380> during<00:04:40.010> research<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:42.110> with<00:04:42.320> the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
months during research and with the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.360 
months during research and with the
newer<00:04:42.710> bands<00:04:43.039> with<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.910> low<00:04:44.150> pressure<00:04:44.450> bands

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
newer bands with the low pressure bands

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.890 
newer bands with the low pressure bands
and<00:04:46.370> now<00:04:46.700> with<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.090> new<00:04:47.120> method<00:04:47.720> that<00:04:47.840> they

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
and now with the new method that they

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.110 
and now with the new method that they
have<00:04:48.349> to<00:04:48.530> insert<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.580> chances<00:04:50.090> of

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
have to insert it the chances of

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.080 
have to insert it the chances of
slipping<00:04:50.720> or<00:04:50.930> eroding<00:04:51.560> or<00:04:51.830> some<00:04:52.280> problems<00:04:52.910> are

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
slipping or eroding or some problems are

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.950 
slipping or eroding or some problems are
are<00:04:53.900> very<00:04:54.380> low<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:55.539> but<00:04:56.539> that's<00:04:56.720> another

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
are very low so but that's another

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.040 
are very low so but that's another
reason<00:04:57.199> against<00:04:57.770> weight<00:04:58.039> loss<00:04:58.220> surgery<00:04:59.050> those

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
reason against weight loss surgery those

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.939 
reason against weight loss surgery those
are<00:05:00.289> like<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.440> medical<00:05:01.250> reasons<00:05:01.669> another

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
are like the medical reasons another

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.969 
are like the medical reasons another
reason<00:05:03.949> against<00:05:04.550> it<00:05:04.760> is<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:06.169> cost<00:05:06.470> because

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
reason against it is the cost because

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.670 
reason against it is the cost because
I'm<00:05:07.190> self-pay<00:05:07.699> and<00:05:08.330> you<00:05:09.139> got<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.380> spend<00:05:09.470> this

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
I'm self-pay and you got to spend this

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.490 
I'm self-pay and you got to spend this
money<00:05:09.949> but<00:05:10.610> honestly<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:12.020> can't<00:05:12.229> think<00:05:12.380> of

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
money but honestly I can't think of

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.700 
money but honestly I can't think of
anything<00:05:12.710> better<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:14.030> spend<00:05:14.210> my<00:05:14.360> money<00:05:14.510> on

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
anything better to spend my money on

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.260 
anything better to spend my money on
then<00:05:16.419> getting<00:05:17.419> thin<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:18.620> that's<00:05:19.550> okay<00:05:19.820> that's

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
then getting thin so that's okay that's

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.140 
then getting thin so that's okay that's
not<00:05:20.389> really<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.660> problem<00:05:20.690> oh<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:22.610> two<00:05:22.849> other

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
not really a problem oh the two other

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.670 
not really a problem oh the two other
things<00:05:23.510> though<00:05:23.720> are<00:05:24.280> like

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
things though are like

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.740 
things though are like
failure<00:05:26.680> because<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.430> think<00:05:27.910> when<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.390> decide

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
failure because I think when you decide

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.300 
failure because I think when you decide
that<00:05:28.780> you<00:05:29.260> when<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.650> finally<00:05:29.890> recent

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
that you when you finally recent

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.650 
that you when you finally recent
inclusions<00:05:30.850> that<00:05:31.800> weight-loss<00:05:32.800> surgery<00:05:33.660> it's

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
inclusions that weight-loss surgery it's

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
inclusions that weight-loss surgery it's
something<00:05:34.990> that<00:05:35.080> you're<00:05:35.230> going<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.380> have<00:05:35.530> to

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
something that you're going to have to

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.660 
something that you're going to have to
do<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:37.470> have<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.770> come<00:05:38.980> face<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.250> face<00:05:39.430> with

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
do you have to come face to face with

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.000 
do you have to come face to face with
the<00:05:40.330> feeling<00:05:40.750> of<00:05:40.810> being<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.170> failure<00:05:41.380> you're

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
the feeling of being a failure you're

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.940 
the feeling of being a failure you're
not<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.220> failure<00:05:43.260> assess<00:05:44.260> if<00:05:44.410> you<00:05:44.530> know<00:05:44.740> that

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
not a failure assess if you know that

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.710 
not a failure assess if you know that
you've<00:05:45.100> done<00:05:45.370> everything<00:05:45.760> you<00:05:45.970> can<00:05:46.090> if<00:05:46.570> you

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
you've done everything you can if you

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.670 
you've done everything you can if you
haven't<00:05:47.230> do<00:05:47.710> it<00:05:47.920> I<00:05:48.160> think<00:05:48.600> Virginia<00:05:49.600> and<00:05:50.020> put

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
haven't do it I think Virginia and put

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.800 
haven't do it I think Virginia and put
up<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:50.920> video<00:05:51.130> last<00:05:51.490> night<00:05:51.700> that<00:05:52.270> says<00:05:52.510> people

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
up a video last night that says people

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.990 
up a video last night that says people
try<00:05:53.290> to<00:05:53.320> do<00:05:53.560> everything<00:05:53.800> you<00:05:54.010> can<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:54.520> I

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
try to do everything you can and I

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.240 
try to do everything you can and I
cannot<00:05:55.450> agree<00:05:55.690> more<00:05:55.900> because<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.770> think<00:05:56.980> the

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
cannot agree more because I think the

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.830 
cannot agree more because I think the
worst<00:05:57.490> thing<00:05:57.640> to<00:05:57.790> happen<00:05:57.940> is<00:05:58.360> to<00:05:58.390> have<00:05:58.510> the

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
worst thing to happen is to have the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.050 
worst thing to happen is to have the
surgery<00:05:59.260> something<00:05:59.680> go<00:05:59.860> wrong<00:06:00.100> or<00:06:00.670> you<00:06:00.970> just

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
I should have just died in an exercise
