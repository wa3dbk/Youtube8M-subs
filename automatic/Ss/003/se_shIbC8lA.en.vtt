 Hello everyone today, I want to do 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.300
 third part of the video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.010
 best tweaks for ios version 7 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.269
 so well let's start i think you 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.800
 will be more clearly seen because 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.020
 I write from the screen . 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.050
 frauds it from my yes as well as I drive 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 finger on the screen here and there well here still 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.969
 such cursor which will indicate 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.020
 I click here I wanted to do a long time review 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.980
 on tvigle.ru 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:44.070
 he is very cool that is, he changes 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:47.780
 turning over the animation is not possible 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.510
 such it is possible such 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.090
 well there is very 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.649
 there are different types of animation but still 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.680
 very cool app 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:06.900
 I personally use this 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.590
 as you do not like also such 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.590
 very cool 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:22.259
 that was baron 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.229
 but this one was worth 2 dollars 99 cents 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.270
 Side officially but I will show you how 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.869
 install for free that is we go 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.869
 in cydia 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.950
 sitting around just a little bit 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:49.010
 so management resources and we should have 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:52.010
 here are brothers apple here are ripa batya at apple 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.930

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.380
 adds but there is someone who does not know normally 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.560
 i did it and write this link there and 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.030
 need on this source after you 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:11.870
 added this repository we need 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:15.610
 will score in searching so little 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.610
 rain now sitting there something loads 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:31.180
 a little stuck here are some updates 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:36.400
 did they come so we enter the baron 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.000
 Here is the official boron worth 2 bucks 99 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.790
 cents but you can see for yourself this bar with 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.040
 so apple green that is 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.940
 which one if i have free yes 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:53.710
 you download the interface is the same 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:58.270
 I take further functions of this five 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.460
 aykyn dog for a vessel in well too 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.980
 cool that is to say the name you know 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.100
 English then she adds the fifth icon 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.960
 there was something like that 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.500
 there were 5 icons added but 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.630
 these icons would be dropping each 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.120
 friend it didnâ€™t look very neat 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.950
 ugly just if you too 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.340
 put indulge but you broke her 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.450
 team 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:33.850
 then we must go in the side again so 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:37.180
 write take five 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.760
 oh kondak 7 should we written 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:46.080
 I have this repository of which 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:49.480
 added byte it. no that's right 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.690
 delete this icon well looks cool 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:04:02.769
 more or less decent so the next tweak 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:07.030
 i show classic switcher more often 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:11.250
 This is generally a separate topic, that is, this 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.440
 the view helps us regain control as 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.109
 like the sixth version of rs 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.720
 and so here are a few such huge 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.310
 windows sheet feast wait until we stop 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:29.380
 and then just close right away 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:38.449
 support and close like this 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:40.510
 so very cool helped slept thread 6 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.470
 ios version 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.479
 well , I donâ€™t think what it is like 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.190
 talk about 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:53.139
 lock screen customization on here 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.139
 everything is simple here you can enter text 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:06.770
 let's hide the clock hide the inscription 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:11.780
 unlock and so on that is possible 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:20.020
 write your text even write differently 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:20.020
 let's say youtube is the most primitive 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:30.910
 they are not something a little else in us was 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.910
 fit in here 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.460
 garbage but it in my mouth for some reason does not work 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.580
 now it does not seem and is better to remove because 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.550
 that she's like to spend a little charging 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.060
 but so on this all with you was steve i 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.030
 I think I told you everything in detail 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.210
 oh yeah if you don't know what's called 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.190
 The theme that I see on the screen is 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.510
 the main screen as well as the theme 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:07.510
 I'll show you the name now and she 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:11.650
 free and download and use here 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:14.320
 This solstic I do not know Well, in general, write 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.940
 so search engine you will find very 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.180
 I liked the design 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.880
 well, somehow a little different 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.920
 similar to symbian than 8 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.160
 version of the future 8 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.360
 okay, once again, I say goodbye to you 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.070
