00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
anymore the way this works is really

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.970 
anymore the way this works is really
simple<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> Redstone

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
simple this is all of the Redstone

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.880 
simple this is all of the Redstone
actually<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:56.390> inside<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.690> block<00:00:57.989> there

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
actually and inside of this block there

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.540 
actually and inside of this block there
is<00:00:59.160> an<00:00:59.460> item<00:00:59.879> hopper<00:01:00.180> mine<00:01:00.390> cart<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:02.250> if

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
is an item hopper mine cart and so if

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.840 
is an item hopper mine cart and so if
you<00:01:02.789> throw<00:01:03.149> an<00:01:03.449> item<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.260> top<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.549> block

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
you throw an item on top of this block

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.330 
you throw an item on top of this block
of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.840> dirt<00:01:07.020> block<00:01:07.260> we're<00:01:07.830> at<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> mine<00:01:08.189> cart

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
of the dirt block we're at the mine cart

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.020 
of the dirt block we're at the mine cart
is<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:10.670> item<00:01:11.670> gets<00:01:11.820> sucked<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
is in and the item gets sucked in and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.300 
put to this item hopper with all of the
Whomper<00:01:17.369> fruit<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:19.860> compared<00:01:20.189> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
Whomper fruit and this compared to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
Whomper fruit and this compared to
outputs<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:21.090> signal<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.909> 18<00:01:23.909> 19<00:01:24.150> 20

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
outputs one signal if you have 18 19 20

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.390 
outputs one signal if you have 18 19 20
I'm<00:01:24.900> gently<00:01:25.560> 21<00:01:26.280> /<00:01:26.430> fruit<00:01:26.640> down<00:01:27.030> there<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.400> if

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I'm gently 21 / fruit down there and if

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.380 
I'm gently 21 / fruit down there and if
you<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.740> one<00:01:31.740> more<00:01:32.040> womper<00:01:32.549> food<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.150> gets

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
you have one more womper food that gets

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.069 
you have one more womper food that gets
and<00:01:33.860> that<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.130> hopper<00:01:35.430> gets<00:01:35.610> by<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.119> mine

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and that this hopper gets by the mine

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
hopper to open the chest this chest is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.199 
hopper to open the chest this chest is
not<00:02:05.969> open<00:02:06.299> about<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.170> UM<00:02:08.209> because

not open about because of the UM because

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.600 
not open about because of the UM because
of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.509> third<00:02:09.720> block<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.410> retracts<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.280> dirt

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
of the third block it retracts the dirt

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.440 
of the third block it retracts the dirt
block<00:02:11.910> so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
block so

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.600 
block so
hopper<00:02:13.690> can<00:02:14.050> give<00:02:14.290> his<00:02:14.530> stuff<00:02:14.800> into<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.220> chest

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
hopper can give his stuff into the chest

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.850 
hopper can give his stuff into the chest
and<00:02:16.980> there<00:02:17.980> then<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.970> puts<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.420> one<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.140> want<00:02:20.769> a

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
and there then it puts the one I want a

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.250 
and there then it puts the one I want a
fruit<00:02:21.010> there<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:24.180> everyone<00:02:25.180> /<00:02:25.269> food<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.690> put

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
fruit there so everyone / food you put

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.720 
fruit there so everyone / food you put
and<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.910> throw<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:29.019> ground<00:02:29.489> creates<00:02:30.489> a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
and you throw on the ground creates a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.720 
and you throw on the ground creates a
new<00:02:30.940> tree<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.420> puts<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.500> fruit<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.550> this

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
new tree and puts the fruit in this

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.500 
new tree and puts the fruit in this
chest<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.230> if<00:02:35.650> we<00:02:35.920> would<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:37.230> get<00:02:38.230> an<00:02:38.530> apple

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
chest so if we would just get an apple

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.600 
chest so if we would just get an apple
for<00:02:40.510> example<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.110> normal<00:02:41.440> apple<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:42.280> wouldn't

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
for example a normal apple this wouldn't

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.259 
for example a normal apple this wouldn't
work<00:02:42.640> because<00:02:44.099> this<00:02:45.099> hopper<00:02:45.310> does<00:02:45.730> not<00:02:45.910> accept

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
work because this hopper does not accept

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.690 
work because this hopper does not accept
apples<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.170> Apple<00:02:48.069> would<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.430> get

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
apples and the Apple would just get

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.280 
apples and the Apple would just get
stuck<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.180> mine<00:02:49.989> cart<00:02:50.200> but<00:02:51.010> if<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:51.790> have<00:02:52.780> a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
stuck in the mine cart but if I have a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.839 
stuck in the mine cart but if I have a
womp<00:02:54.280> fruit<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:56.430> everything<00:02:57.430> just<00:02:57.549> works

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
womp fruit and everything just works
