00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.300 
side-by-side to see how well mega bloks
did<00:00:24.960> compared<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> Hot<00:00:25.650> Wheels<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
did compared to the Hot Wheels so the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.740 
did compared to the Hot Wheels so the
first<00:00:26.519> one<00:00:26.640> we'll<00:00:26.789> look<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> called

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
first one we'll look at this is called

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.910 
first one we'll look at this is called
twin<00:00:28.080> mill<00:00:28.320> 3<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> mega<00:00:31.619> bloks

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
twin mill 3 so this is the mega bloks

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.490 
twin mill 3 so this is the mega bloks
version<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> actual<00:00:33.750> diecast

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
version and this is the actual diecast

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.610 
version and this is the actual diecast
car<00:00:35.000> now<00:00:36.000> unfortunately<00:00:36.390> i<00:00:36.780> don't<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
car now unfortunately i don't have the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
car now unfortunately i don't have the
diecast<00:00:38.040> car<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.180> same<00:00:39.450> color<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:40.079> mega

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
diecast car in the same color as mega

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.520 
diecast car in the same color as mega
bloks<00:00:41.239> made<00:00:42.239> them<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.690> i'm<00:00:42.870> sure<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.379> this

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
bloks made them but i'm sure that this

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
bloks made them but i'm sure that this
car<00:00:43.829> was<00:00:44.040> released<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.760> color<00:00:45.000> red<00:00:45.329> at

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
car was released in this color red at

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.970 
car was released in this color red at
one<00:00:45.600> point<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.170> don't<00:00:46.320> happen<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.739> it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
one point I just don't happen to have it

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
one point I just don't happen to have it
so<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.789> did<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> pretty<00:00:48.329> good<00:00:48.570> job<00:00:48.629> as

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
so I think they did a pretty good job as

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.479 
so I think they did a pretty good job as
far<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.539> making<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.930> buildable<00:00:52.770> model<00:00:53.250> look

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
far as making the buildable model look

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.560 
far as making the buildable model look
very<00:00:53.789> similar<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.530> diecast<00:00:56.399> car<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.239> twin

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
very similar to the diecast car so twin

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.020 
very similar to the diecast car so twin
mill<00:00:57.750> 3<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.800> next<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> called<00:00:59.699> twin

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
mill 3 the next one this is called twin

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.910 
mill 3 the next one this is called twin
induction<00:01:02.539> and<00:01:03.539> again<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> think<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.650> did<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
induction and again I think they did a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.320 
induction and again I think they did a
fantastic<00:01:05.339> job<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.479> far<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.439> making<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
fantastic job as far as making the the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810 
fantastic job as far as making the the
buildable<00:01:09.750> model<00:01:10.229> look<00:01:10.439> very<00:01:10.680> similar<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
buildable model look very similar to the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
buildable model look very similar to the
diecast<00:01:12.210> car<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:15.650> think<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:16.740> did<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> fantastic

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
diecast car I think they did a fantastic

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.289 
diecast car I think they did a fantastic
job<00:01:18.710> but<00:01:19.710> unfortunately<00:01:19.890> i<00:01:20.369> don't<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
job but unfortunately i don't have the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.140 
job but unfortunately i don't have the
dye<00:01:21.450> cashed<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> same<00:01:22.290> color<00:01:22.530> blue<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
dye cashed in the same color blue and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.670 
dye cashed in the same color blue and
the<00:01:24.150> last<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.990> called<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.380> bone

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the last one here is called the bone

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.800 
the last one here is called the bone
shaker

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.270 

so<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:34.840> think<00:01:34.960> they<00:01:35.289> did<00:01:35.469> a<00:01:35.500> really<00:01:36.009> good<00:01:36.219> job

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
so I think they did a really good job

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.190 
so I think they did a really good job
with<00:01:36.670> this<00:01:36.820> now<00:01:37.000> this<00:01:37.179> one<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.689> Baja

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
with this now this one is the Baja

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.679 
with this now this one is the Baja
boneshaker<00:01:38.799> not<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.579> hot<00:01:39.820> rod<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.270> is<00:01:40.479> the

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
boneshaker not the hot rod this is the

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.120 
boneshaker not the hot rod this is the
mega<00:01:40.869> bloks<00:01:41.170> one<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.500> more<00:01:41.649> of<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.890> hotrod

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
mega bloks one is more of a hotrod

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.609 
mega bloks one is more of a hotrod
version<00:01:42.789> whereas<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.509> is<00:01:43.689> more<00:01:43.899> of<00:01:44.049> a<00:01:44.200> is

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
off-road or a jeep type version but they

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.569 
off-road or a jeep type version but they
are<00:01:49.329> still<00:01:49.600> a<00:01:49.869> very<00:01:50.500> good<00:01:50.740> rendition<00:01:50.979> of<00:01:51.399> one

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
are still a very good rendition of one

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.870 
are still a very good rendition of one
another<00:01:52.289> so<00:01:53.289> anyway<00:01:53.920> guys<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:54.399> is<00:01:54.549> just<00:01:54.789> a

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
another so anyway guys this is just a

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.179 
another so anyway guys this is just a
way<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.060> show<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:55.539> that<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.079> buildable<00:01:56.500> mega

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
way to show you that the buildable mega

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.130 
way to show you that the buildable mega
bloks<00:01:57.490> Hot<00:01:57.759> Wheels<00:01:58.000> cars<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.719> came<00:01:58.899> out<00:01:59.110> just

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
bloks Hot Wheels cars that came out just

bloks Hot Wheels cars that came out just
this<00:01:59.560> summer<00:01:59.829> are<00:02:00.130> indeed<00:02:00.819> very<00:02:00.850> very<00:02:01.329> similar

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
this summer are indeed very very similar

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.080 
this summer are indeed very very similar
to<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.289> actual<00:02:02.679> Hot<00:02:02.979> Wheel<00:02:03.219> diecast<00:02:03.789> cars
