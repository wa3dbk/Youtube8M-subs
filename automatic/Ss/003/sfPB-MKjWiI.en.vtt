00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
know what that is its basic just getting

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.390 
know what that is its basic just getting
five<00:01:18.720> kills<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> row<00:01:19.290> without<00:01:19.590> dying<00:01:20.009> you're

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
five kills in a row without dying you're

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.980 
five kills in a row without dying you're
using<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.030> vector<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> particular

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
using the vector in this particular

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.780 
using the vector in this particular
instance<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.560> yeah<00:01:25.830> those<00:01:26.100> are<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> pretty

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
instance so yeah those are the pretty

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.609 
instance so yeah those are the pretty
much<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> challenges<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> want

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
much the challenges I know what I want

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.440 
much the challenges I know what I want
to<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> sort<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.430> video<00:01:29.759> series<00:01:30.060> it's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
to do as a sort of a video series it's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.870 
to do as a sort of a video series it's
actually<00:01:30.750> get<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> guys<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.500> suggest<00:01:32.040> what
