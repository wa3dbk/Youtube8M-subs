00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.599
 Hello dear kept custom gasoline from intec professionals and that's a whole now 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.640
 short message and slava has updated the macbook pro so surrendered 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.489
 19 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.759
 and I bet I show it a bit now I'm up here 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.829
 the Apple page in the Apple Store and you see it like the MacBook Pro should be new 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.420
 that means that time has changed and something is needed again 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.820
 inaccurate to learn 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.570
 what has changed since then 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.710
 we see here directly 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.920
 the percent the 13 counter grows higher by processors performance 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.320
 have now starting second time 4 gigahertz and ending with 2 kor 6 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 gigahertz 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.420
 The entry-level model now also has four league-split main memory 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
 and a 250 gigabyte hard drive 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.140
 still to come 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.480
 That attracts a battery life of up to ten hours 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.290
 which were less before 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.420
 us a new graphics card 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.310
 it was like you 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 the Force 320 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.409
 The starting price is at a gate of his 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.620
 40 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.080
 Lauber I'm not sure you can rule it then in the Comments 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 That was the old entry price 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 because not her the new song at 1049 you have not done anything 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.960
 here 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.359
 but has done something in the 15-inch MacBook Pros in the price 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:44.540
 in fact 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.640
 is missing here so or the entry level model 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.310
 is now as expensive as the middle model 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.040
 the last time was and 2007 has 49 euros one that is just because 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.810
 that a new processor has been installed and now that of the 5 and 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.280
 in the top model also Tel the sevens so the RIAA he installed the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.659
 new Intel processors no longer Intel Core 2 Duo but 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.559
 coha the 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:11.719
 and 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.849
 Here we have Gigabyte of memory water throughout 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.219
 before that was the case 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.219
 and allow Rainer Traber to hold 20 gigawatts of fixed space 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.949
 I'm not sure but I think that was not the case before that 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.290
 started with a 20 because I have the middle Mac Book on that had 320 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:33.799
 I think that smaller had 2 0 50 but I'm not quite as I said 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:34.300
 for sure 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.940
 here also a longer acute duration is given now 8 to 9 hours 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.180
 For me the year should be seven hours meanwhile it is mostly 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.970
 already far from the seven hours for hand 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.419
 but as you said you can do a longer battery life 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.140
 seers 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.839
 for good and we have here now 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.319
 two graphics cards and two Intel HD graphics 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.169
 So, as they have from this trend, they are like the protector to the way 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.030
 last Intel HD graphics 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.030
 and then here have one more percent of DIHK holds itself 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.660
 Percent graphic Schippe and again in g-force as gt 330 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.549
 here in the first two models we see once for the sixth 50 MB 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.290
 and here the biggest model has a five times 12 NB 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.280
 graphic 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.679
 Cards memory 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.680
 the price I have what I have done there, I already mentioned 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.960
 we see here are percent ready to ship this is the first model in four 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.390
 Some of them are modern, even in 14 hours 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.430
 the middle first five business figures 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.629
 well let's go here a bit 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.629
 to more Ryan and just want to look at us 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.940
 Here Apple then writes about the new processors 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.780
 and 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.659
 the percent of course the new graphic 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.119
 and here we want to read something 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.199
 Apple has to say 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.309
 Next gas quickly with faster processors and faster graphics cards 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:02.759
 The new MacBook pro does it all in record time 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:03.839
 have here 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:05.949
 New Year 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.929
 Here are the then such a small benchmarking listed animals with the 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:10.940
 comparison value 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.210
 somehow it's not all that transparent but the refurbishment was over 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.639
 up to 1 4 5 times faster now with the new processors 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.559
 not bad 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:26.789
 Royer here that he is also performance oriented clocks the CPU 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.529
 from 2006 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.699
 up to 3 Commander Series 3 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.430
 Giga heart 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.499
 Hyper Threading have the 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.229
 the sevens 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.689
 I thought the IV 5 will get me in Dortmund 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.770
 well 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.139
 Maybe maybe I am wrong 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.539
 Goetschel 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.199
 that's not all that interesting but now new fast processors 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.199
 here now 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.280
 actually what you find pretty cool coming 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.280
 and what I actually wanted for my MacBook 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.139
 was us 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.280
 switching this performance oriented graphics card so that MacBook pro has 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.889
 they had two graphics cards in it before and that was once the 9400 and the 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.529
 9600 and you had to know we all probably always so silly and 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:19.539
 switch between the cards so you have to 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.550
 to lure oneself out 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.370
 now again to order so that you could switch in between 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.370
 and that is no longer necessary now because they are now performance-oriented 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.180
 switched 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.509
 and you do not have to worry about that anymore and of course you can 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.250
 also in favor of the battery life of one 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.830
 really only the video card is always used when you really get it 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.069
 need 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.089
 Dan percent 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.210
 Of course, a longer battery life I do not know now 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.000
 how this works very well even with cards at the same time still running 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.710
 which was not the case before 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.729
 you could either turn in one or the other I do not know maybe 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.780
 maybe even often both will even know if they can 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.930
 Pretty cool 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.139
 but then they will probably still their one 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.779
 to see over time 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:02.869
 and 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.990
 yes, here is another such small benchmarking listed in which 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.069
 in the games like Prem 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.949
 MacBook Pro 13 inch that also tweeted a new video card iKratos 200 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:14.289
 m 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.770
 As you can see that already percent a significant percent 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.430
 No advantage has brought the new graphics card 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.730
 So the Mac Book 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.169
 Broder's little i find to be really important now 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.169
 So with the processor, the fleet is already trolling processors 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.199
 still no one but still 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.830
 four gigabytes of RAM standard under price a fixed price it also quite real 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.990
 I agree 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.169
 a good thing 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:44.069
 j that was it so far he covers it so briefly 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.039
 to the fact that we got something new out unfortunately we do not know anything new what iPad 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.189
 but well, let's see how it develops 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.330
 I'm really professionals now and I hope I can help a bit 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.280
 a proletarian from it approx
