heatsink<00:02:42.580> now<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.120> next<00:02:43.270> thing<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.630> do<00:02:43.780> is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
heatsink now the next thing to do is

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:52.650 
heatsink now the next thing to do is
just<00:02:44.260> slip<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:45.430> heat<00:02:45.820> pipe<00:02:50.820> in<00:02:51.820> like<00:02:52.150> sewing

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
just slip this heat pipe in like sewing

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.510 
just slip this heat pipe in like sewing
to<00:02:53.020> be<00:02:53.140> careful<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.620> need<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.890> line<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.310> up

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
to be careful you need to line this up

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.740 
to be careful you need to line this up
on<00:02:54.790> both<00:02:55.090> sides<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.930> goes<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.320> correctly

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
on both sides so it goes in correctly

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:06.330 
on both sides so it goes in correctly
like<00:02:58.750> so<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:01.800> next<00:03:03.630> just<00:03:04.630> place<00:03:05.070> this<00:03:06.070> heat

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
like so and next just place this heat

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.440 
like so and next just place this heat
sink<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:06.870> top<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.670> then<00:03:09.670> use<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.030> two<00:03:10.209> bolts

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
sink on top and then use the two bolts

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.020 
sink on top and then use the two bolts
to<00:03:10.900> screw<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.290> down<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.830> do<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.310> same<00:03:12.550> for<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
to screw it down and do the same for the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.880 
to screw it down and do the same for the
back<00:03:13.240> base<00:03:13.510> assembly<00:03:13.900> go<00:03:14.200> ahead<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.709> spread
