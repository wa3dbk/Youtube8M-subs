00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.070
 Hi I'm all of me the trade policy he would like now 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.899
 times the 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.979
 Compare headphones and Monster Cable 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.689
 it seems there is 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.619
 Some human questions rock off a youtube video 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.769
 Natal came 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
 to my son Ole Video why 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.050
 we are too small Â»I heard that when bigger so there are several beats 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.820
 by Dirk the Gray 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.580
 these are for example the solo ones 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.760
 happy end 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.270
 so a little smaller 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.300
 compact lightweight 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.059
 Of course, they can quickly wrinkle and then fall into the bag and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.710
 take immediately 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.640
 So those are great for traveling so if the bus cable 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.860
 the meadows have almost nothing but a super sound 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.800
 act limited 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.480
 CNOOC come namely the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.540
 SPU deodorant 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.540
 These are probably the best known of all 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.570
 this natural bit bigger than we have here too 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.470
 battery 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.910
 something with him 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 SU has indeed the case 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.880
 even the chambers hold the battery compartment avaya we active noise canceling 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.850
 so it is perfect for flying so I'm always there 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.440
 I 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.030
 in the airplane seats 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.150
 because the noise from the flier song steamed her bit 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.350
 which is nice 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.000
 if we compare the whole time 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.610
 Of course they are a bit bigger so while they are here on the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.980
 Rest your ear 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.800
 Of course, this is completely covered with here 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.930
 The Sauber team is also a bit stronger than Dr 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.030
 Solo has it goes very clearly says lure bit bigger 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.770
 and that's the biggest model of the time 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.080
 Here are the Beats Rok 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.100
 You can see that too easily 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.710
 high quality are installed so 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.799
 Mittal 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.329
 Of course they can be folded as well, it hums more easily 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.329
 to be able to transport 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.930
 also how big so if you do not have to compare why 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.739
 there the solos seem possible 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.739
 so z 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.430
 that's more for the idea is the case so just Einstein here 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.909
 fold in the other listening 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.709
 That's why we have 2 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.300
 Inputs to Cordula can also be done by looping, so you can write something 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.559
 very cool 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:48.269
 that's the professional model "I already have many members with it 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.269
 see and seen 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.759
 more Porta Auer than the studio or solo 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:01.609
 and those were the ones currently available 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.439
 Earphones in front and monsters from the BIS is said Brie series 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.209
 I hope I have a few now 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.849
 Inconsistencies clarified there are three different ones so do not be surprised if 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.719
 now the Solon bit small sense because there are also the others
