00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
freedom from President Nixon there are

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.910 
freedom from President Nixon there are
three<00:01:43.759> reasons<00:01:43.970> why<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.570> was<00:01:44.810> important<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.440> go

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
three reasons why it was important to go

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.100 
three reasons why it was important to go
to<00:01:45.979> move<00:01:46.310> one<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.149> we<00:01:47.300> could<00:01:47.479> prove<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:48.080> was

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
to move one so we could prove it was

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.020 
to move one so we could prove it was
possible<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:48.740> go<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.310> moon<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.670> return

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
possible to go to the moon and return

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.749 
possible to go to the moon and return
safely<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.500> we<00:01:51.619> could<00:01:51.860> learn<00:01:52.070> more<00:01:52.640> about

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
safely to so we could learn more about

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.779 
safely to so we could learn more about
