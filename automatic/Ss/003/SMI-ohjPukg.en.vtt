son goal zero is broken up into three
different<00:00:54.570> segments<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.500> basically<00:00:55.949> collect

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
different segments we basically collect

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.680 
different segments we basically collect
the<00:00:56.550> Sun<00:00:56.790> through<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> different<00:00:57.420> solar

the Sun through the different solar
panels<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.739> store<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.430> an<00:00:59.550> array<00:00:59.820> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
panels we store it in an array of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.759 
panels we store it in an array of
batteries<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.720> then<00:01:01.110> we<00:01:01.229> can<00:01:01.440> use<00:01:01.470> that

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
batteries and then we can use that

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.119 
batteries and then we can use that
stored<00:01:02.399> power<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:03.120> lights<00:01:04.080> charging<00:01:04.979> any

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
other instruments that we're using this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.570 
other instruments that we're using this
is<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> Nomad<00:01:08.600> 27<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.979> I'll<00:01:11.100> show<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.310> really

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
is the Nomad 27 and I'll show you really

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.400 
is the Nomad 27 and I'll show you really
quickly<00:01:11.910> how<00:01:12.060> these<00:01:12.420> open<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.899> they<00:01:13.110> store

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
quickly how these open up they store

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.279 
quickly how these open up they store
very<00:01:13.740> compact<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.030> they're<00:01:15.869> lightweight

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
very compact and they're lightweight

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.900 
very compact and they're lightweight
compared<00:01:17.039> to<00:01:17.130> most<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.490> stuff<00:01:17.700> that's

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
compared to most of the stuff that's

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.910 
compared to most of the stuff that's
actually<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.450> market<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.500> they

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
actually on the market and they

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.120 
actually on the market and they
basically<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.550> fold<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.509> such<00:01:22.130> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
basically just fold out as such this

basically just fold out as such this
Nomad<00:01:23.550> 27<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.720> what<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.080> use<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.380> power<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.039> 120

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
Nomad 27 is what we use to power the 120

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.200 
Nomad 27 is what we use to power the 120
watt<00:01:27.210> hours<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.070> it's<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.550> of<00:01:29.670> our<00:01:29.789> larger

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
watt hours and it's one of our larger

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.790 
watt hours and it's one of our larger
panels<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:30.990> connect<00:01:31.440> directly

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
panels that can also connect directly

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.950 
panels that can also connect directly
into<00:01:32.280> our<00:01:32.310> 50<00:01:32.850> watt<00:01:33.000> battery<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
into our 50 watt battery which is the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.740 
into our 50 watt battery which is the
Nomad<00:01:34.380> fit<00:01:34.679> this<00:01:35.190> is<00:01:35.340> what<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.610> call<00:01:35.819> our<00:01:35.970> light

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
Nomad fit this is what we call our light

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.930 
Nomad fit this is what we call our light
of<00:01:36.899> light<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.709> more<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.069> lantern<00:01:38.610> type

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
of light this is more of a lantern type

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.900 
of light this is more of a lantern type
fill<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.780> draws<00:01:40.080> just<00:01:40.410> over<00:01:40.679> 3<00:01:40.979> watt<00:01:41.310> hours<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
fill it draws just over 3 watt hours and

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.300 
fill it draws just over 3 watt hours and
these<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.539> all<00:01:42.569> like<00:01:43.229> most<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.800> our<00:01:43.890> products
