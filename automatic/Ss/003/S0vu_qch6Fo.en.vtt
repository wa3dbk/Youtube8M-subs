that<00:01:56.549> truly<00:01:57.060> show<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.659> Mexican<00:01:58.110> cuisine

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.560 

when<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> originally<00:02:02.280> first<00:02:02.880> started<00:02:03.300> doing

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
when I originally first started doing

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.210 
when I originally first started doing
the<00:02:03.690> banana<00:02:03.960> split<00:02:04.260> though<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.710> using<00:02:05.100> your

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
the banana split though I was using your

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.430 
the banana split though I was using your
regular<00:02:05.370> size<00:02:05.790> plantains<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.260> are

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
regular size plantains but they are

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.410 
regular size plantains but they are
quite<00:02:07.740> fibrous<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.580> they<00:02:08.640> don't<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.180> very

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
quite fibrous and they don't have very

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.070 
quite fibrous and they don't have very
much<00:02:09.780> sweetness<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:11.009> them<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.660> decided

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
much sweetness to them and so I decided

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.350 
much sweetness to them and so I decided
to<00:02:13.500> switch<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.790> baby

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
to switch it up and go to the baby

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.320 
to switch it up and go to the baby
plantains<00:02:16.020> which<00:02:16.800> are<00:02:16.950> called<00:02:17.130> dominicos<00:02:17.880> and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
plantains which are called dominicos and

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.750 
plantains which are called dominicos and
I<00:02:19.170> think<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.950> just<00:02:20.130> makes<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.580> whole

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
I think it really just makes the whole

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.060 
I think it really just makes the whole
package<00:02:21.150> perfect<00:02:21.630> definitely<00:02:22.560> prefer<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
package perfect definitely prefer the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.590 
package perfect definitely prefer the
plantains<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.060> tell<00:02:24.270> it's<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
plantains you can tell it's just a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.360 
plantains you can tell it's just a
little<00:02:24.780> bit<00:02:24.870> exotic<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> things<00:02:26.190> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
little bit exotic one of the things that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.430 
little bit exotic one of the things that
I<00:02:26.400> wanted<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.970> do<00:02:27.150> was<00:02:27.360> banana<00:02:27.780> foster<00:02:28.320> the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
plantains and rather than using rums I

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.400 
plantains and rather than using rums I
decided<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.280> use<00:02:32.430> tequila<00:02:33.030> because<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:34.200> are<00:02:34.380> a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
need of some sort of a crunch factor I

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.350 
need of some sort of a crunch factor I
thought<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.130> would<00:03:08.250> be<00:03:08.370> great<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.820> do<00:03:09.030> a
