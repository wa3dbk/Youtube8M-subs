with<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.290> circle<00:01:54.890> inside<00:01:56.140> okay<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.380> then<00:01:57.680> this

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
with a circle inside okay and then this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.770 
with a circle inside okay and then this
might<00:01:58.759> seem<00:01:58.939> a<00:01:59.000> little<00:01:59.149> tricky<00:01:59.540> but<00:01:59.659> we're

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
might seem a little tricky but we're

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.819 
might seem a little tricky but we're
gonna<00:01:59.869> go<00:02:00.049> slow<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.350> you're<00:02:00.470> gonna<00:02:00.560> be<00:02:00.740> able

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
gonna go slow and you're gonna be able

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.560 
gonna go slow and you're gonna be able
to<00:02:00.920> do<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.189> because<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.729> are<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.180> great<00:02:02.450> artist

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
to do it because you are a great artist

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.980 
to do it because you are a great artist
I<00:02:03.200> want<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.950> draw<00:02:04.189> two<00:02:05.119> short<00:02:05.509> lines<00:02:05.719> like

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
I want you to draw two short lines like

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.340 
I want you to draw two short lines like
this<00:02:07.720> now<00:02:08.720> we're<00:02:08.899> gonna<00:02:08.989> draw<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.619> curved<00:02:10.340> line

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
this now we're gonna draw a curved line

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.539 
this now we're gonna draw a curved line
that's<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.560> cannon<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.100> now<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.310> have<00:02:13.459> to

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
that's the cannon but now we have to

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:14.890 
that's the cannon but now we have to
draw<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.730> window<00:02:14.090> that's<00:02:14.239> sticking<00:02:14.630> out<00:02:14.780> of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
draw the window that's sticking out of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.330 
draw the window that's sticking out of
and<00:02:15.130> another<00:02:16.130> curved<00:02:16.760> line<00:02:17.000> like<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:18.340> okay

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
and another curved line like that okay

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.040 
and another curved line like that okay
that's<00:02:19.640> where<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:19.970> cannon<00:02:20.330> sticks<00:02:20.569> out<00:02:20.750> let's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
that's where the cannon sticks out let's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.480 
that's where the cannon sticks out let's
try<00:02:21.349> that<00:02:21.590> again<00:02:21.860> let's

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
try that again let's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.050 
try that again let's
draw<00:02:22.640> one<00:02:22.850> more<00:02:22.880> curved<00:02:23.240> line<00:02:23.420> here<00:02:24.820> okay<00:02:25.820> and

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
draw one more curved line here okay and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.390 
draw one more curved line here okay and
I'm<00:02:26.240> gonna<00:02:26.390> draw<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:27.020> little<00:02:27.470> bit<00:02:27.590> more<00:02:27.860> like

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
I'm gonna draw a little bit more like

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.280 
I'm gonna draw a little bit more like
that<00:02:28.610> okay<00:02:29.120> now<00:02:29.240> it<00:02:29.360> really<00:02:29.600> looks<00:02:29.810> like<00:02:30.140> it's

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
that okay now it really looks like it's

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.840 
that okay now it really looks like it's
sticking<00:02:30.470> out<00:02:30.680> let's<00:02:31.130> try<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.460> again<00:02:31.520> right

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
sticking out let's try that again right

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.420 
sticking out let's try that again right
here<00:02:32.060> we're<00:02:32.300> gonna<00:02:32.390> do<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.630> three<00:02:32.840> times<00:02:32.870> a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
here we're gonna do it three times a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.520 
here we're gonna do it three times a
circle<00:02:34.960> another<00:02:35.960> circle<00:02:36.470> inside<00:02:37.810> two<00:02:38.810> short

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
circle another circle inside two short

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.620 
circle another circle inside two short
lines<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:41.050> curved<00:02:42.050> line<00:02:42.910> we're<00:02:43.910> gonna<00:02:44.000> draw<00:02:44.330> our

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
lines a curved line we're gonna draw our

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.160 
lines a curved line we're gonna draw our
window<00:02:45.110> circle<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.030> one<00:02:47.030> more<00:02:47.330> window<00:02:47.540> circle

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
window circle and one more window circle

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.550 
window circle and one more window circle
and<00:02:49.000> then<00:02:50.000> draw<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.390> cannon<00:02:50.810> back<00:02:51.020> into<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
and then draw that cannon back into the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.230 
and then draw that cannon back into the
boat<00:02:51.710> a<00:02:51.740> little<00:02:51.890> further<00:02:52.310> okay<00:02:52.850> let's<00:02:53.030> do<00:02:53.210> it

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
boat a little further okay let's do it

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.280 
boat a little further okay let's do it
one<00:02:53.390> less<00:02:53.570> time<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.810> bet<00:02:54.020> you're<00:02:54.200> getting

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
one less time I bet you're getting

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.970 
one less time I bet you're getting
really<00:02:54.710> good<00:02:55.100> at<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> now<00:02:56.380> Circle<00:02:57.970> Circle

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
really good at it now Circle Circle

straight line straight line curve around

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.200 
straight line straight line curve around
now<00:03:05.150> let's<00:03:05.390> do<00:03:05.540> our<00:03:05.600> window<00:03:06.820> two<00:03:07.960> circles<00:03:08.960> and

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
now let's do our window two circles and

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.020 
now let's do our window two circles and
two<00:03:11.210> more<00:03:11.510> straight<00:03:11.930> lines<00:03:12.430> okay<00:03:13.430> now<00:03:13.640> we<00:03:13.700> have

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
two more straight lines okay now we have

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.270 
two more straight lines okay now we have
cannons<00:03:14.660> coming<00:03:15.080> out<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.350> our<00:03:15.410> ship<00:03:15.680> now

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
cannons coming out of our ship now

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.010 
cannons coming out of our ship now
pirate<00:03:16.880> ships<00:03:17.090> were<00:03:17.210> made<00:03:17.330> out<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.510> wood<00:03:17.600> so

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
pirate ships were made out of wood so

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.540 
pirate ships were made out of wood so
let<00:03:18.170> me<00:03:18.230> show<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.560> trick<00:03:18.830> on<00:03:18.950> how<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.220> do

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
let me show you a trick on how to do

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.280 
let me show you a trick on how to do
wood<00:03:20.000> we're<00:03:20.480> just<00:03:20.630> gonna<00:03:20.720> draw<00:03:20.960> a<00:03:20.990> bunch<00:03:21.200> of

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
wood we're just gonna draw a bunch of

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.140 
wood we're just gonna draw a bunch of
straight<00:03:21.680> lines<00:03:21.950> across<00:03:22.340> we<00:03:22.610> want<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.910> try<00:03:23.120> to

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
straight lines across we want to try to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.120 
straight lines across we want to try to
make<00:03:23.420> them<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:24.140> same<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:24.740> as<00:03:24.950> we're<00:03:25.100> going

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
make them the same so as we're going

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.240 
make them the same so as we're going
across<00:03:25.540> pretend<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.960> it<00:03:27.080> keeps<00:03:27.320> going<00:03:27.620> and

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
across pretend that it keeps going and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.820 
across pretend that it keeps going and
then<00:03:28.820> pick<00:03:29.060> up<00:03:29.090> right<00:03:29.360> here<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:30.290> side<00:03:30.620> goes<00:03:30.800> a

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
then pick up right here this side goes a

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.730 
then pick up right here this side goes a
little<00:03:31.010> higher<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:32.270> we<00:03:32.390> need<00:03:32.570> just<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.840> few<00:03:32.870> more

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
little higher so we need just a few more

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.560 
little higher so we need just a few more
lines<00:03:34.070> okay<00:03:34.610> now<00:03:34.820> again<00:03:34.970> we're<00:03:35.180> gonna<00:03:35.300> come

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
lines okay now again we're gonna come

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.770 
lines okay now again we're gonna come
here<00:03:36.230> we're<00:03:36.710> just<00:03:36.830> gonna<00:03:36.950> pretend<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:38.150> then

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
here we're just gonna pretend and then

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.990 
here we're just gonna pretend and then
pick<00:03:38.990> up<00:03:39.020> here<00:03:39.440> all<00:03:40.430> right<00:03:40.610> we're<00:03:40.790> just<00:03:40.820> gonna

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
pick up here all right we're just gonna

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.410 
pick up here all right we're just gonna
so<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.600> almost<00:03:41.750> like<00:03:41.930> we're<00:03:42.170> making<00:03:42.290> stripes

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
so it's almost like we're making stripes

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.390 
so it's almost like we're making stripes
these<00:03:44.420> are<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.780> planks<00:03:45.320> of<00:03:45.500> wood<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:46.250> the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
these are the planks of wood that the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.820 
these are the planks of wood that the
ship<00:03:46.670> is<00:03:46.850> made<00:03:47.060> out<00:03:47.240> of<00:03:50.140> okay<00:03:51.140> remember<00:03:51.560> to

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
ship is made out of okay remember to

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.350 
ship is made out of okay remember to
just<00:03:52.010> go<00:03:52.190> right<00:03:52.400> through<00:03:52.460> this<00:03:52.880> pretend<00:03:53.270> it

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
just go right through this pretend it

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.850 
just go right through this pretend it
goes<00:03:53.510> right<00:03:53.690> through<00:03:53.990> if<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.230> meet<00:03:54.410> something

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
goes right through if you meet something

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.420 
goes right through if you meet something
and<00:03:56.230> but<00:03:57.230> don't<00:03:57.500> draw<00:03:57.770> over<00:03:58.160> what<00:03:58.280> you've

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
and but don't draw over what you've

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
already drawn okay now this boat looks

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.840 
already drawn okay now this boat looks
like<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.740> has<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:00.860> striped<00:04:01.160> t-shirt<00:04:01.340> on<00:04:01.610> so<00:04:01.730> now

we<00:04:01.910> have<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.180> make<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.420> look<00:04:02.570> like<00:04:02.720> wood<00:04:02.960> we're

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
we have to make it look like wood we're

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.780 
we have to make it look like wood we're
just<00:04:03.560> gonna<00:04:03.680> do<00:04:03.860> some<00:04:03.890> straight<00:04:04.340> lines<00:04:04.550> and

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
them just don't do them right on top of

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.020 
them just don't do them right on top of
each<00:04:09.530> other<00:04:09.770> you<00:04:10.010> want<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.430> kind<00:04:10.580> of<00:04:10.640> spread

each other you want to kind of spread

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.480 
each other you want to kind of spread
them<00:04:11.180> out<00:04:11.380> so<00:04:12.380> that<00:04:12.410> they're<00:04:12.710> not<00:04:12.860> touching

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
them out so that they're not touching

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.099 
them out so that they're not touching
another<00:04:13.790> line<00:04:14.150> on<00:04:14.420> one<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.720> your<00:04:14.900> stripes<00:04:17.109> so

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
another line on one of your stripes so

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.320 
another line on one of your stripes so
you<00:04:18.170> just<00:04:18.410> kind<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:18.709> can<00:04:18.859> pick<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.970> put<00:04:20.180> them

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
one maybe needs another one okay now

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.750 
one maybe needs another one okay now
we're<00:04:26.720> just<00:04:26.750> gonna<00:04:26.930> do<00:04:27.200> dots<00:04:27.470> for<00:04:27.830> nails<00:04:28.100> and

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
we're just gonna do dots for nails and

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.040 
we're just gonna do dots for nails and
this<00:04:28.880> really<00:04:29.180> helps<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:29.540> look<00:04:29.630> like<00:04:29.840> wood

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
this really helps it look like wood

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.650 
this really helps it look like wood
we're<00:04:30.830> just<00:04:31.040> going<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.220> draw<00:04:31.400> two<00:04:31.729> dots<00:04:31.970> and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
we're just going to draw two dots and

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.930 
we're just going to draw two dots and
you<00:04:33.320> can<00:04:33.500> pick<00:04:33.650> whichever<00:04:33.979> side<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.700> line

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
you can pick whichever side of the line

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.270 
you can pick whichever side of the line
you<00:04:35.510> want<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.900> be<00:04:36.020> on<00:04:36.110> it

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
you want it to be on it

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.250 
you want it to be on it
doesn't<00:04:36.610> matter<00:04:36.760> but<00:04:37.450> then<00:04:37.600> it'll<00:04:37.750> look<00:04:37.960> like

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
doesn't matter but then it'll look like

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:49.260 
doesn't matter but then it'll look like
the<00:04:38.830> wood<00:04:39.070> is<00:04:39.340> nailed<00:04:39.639> together<00:04:46.110> okay<00:04:48.270> all

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
the wood is nailed together okay all

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.360 
the wood is nailed together okay all
right<00:04:49.540> now<00:04:49.810> we're<00:04:50.260> ready<00:04:50.440> for<00:04:50.530> pirate<00:04:51.100> sails

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
right now we're ready for pirate sails

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.680 
right now we're ready for pirate sails
they<00:04:51.520> look<00:04:51.700> a<00:04:51.790> little<00:04:51.880> different<00:04:52.030> than<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.389> sail

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
they look a little different than a sail

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.780 
they look a little different than a sail
boat<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.560> we're<00:04:53.680> gonna<00:04:53.800> draw<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.310> retic

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
boat that we're gonna draw a retic

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.760 
boat that we're gonna draw a retic
rectangle<00:04:55.660> but<00:04:55.930> it's<00:04:56.050> gonna<00:04:56.139> have<00:04:56.380> curved

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
rectangle but it's gonna have curved

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.850 
rectangle but it's gonna have curved
sides<00:04:57.220> so<00:04:57.870> let's<00:04:58.870> start<00:04:59.200> off<00:04:59.320> right<00:04:59.590> here

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
sides so let's start off right here

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.920 
sides so let's start off right here
we're<00:05:00.400> gonna<00:05:00.460> drop<00:05:00.820> this<00:05:01.300> straight<00:05:01.720> line<00:05:01.750> on

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
we're gonna drop this straight line on

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.000 
we're gonna drop this straight line on
top<00:05:02.260> and<00:05:02.710> on<00:05:03.610> bottom<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:04.740> then<00:05:05.740> we're<00:05:05.919> gonna

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
top and on bottom and then we're gonna

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.120 
top and on bottom and then we're gonna
draw<00:05:06.370> a<00:05:06.639> curved<00:05:07.330> line<00:05:07.510> connecting<00:05:08.350> those<00:05:08.500> like

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
draw a curved line connecting those like

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.980 
draw a curved line connecting those like
that<00:05:09.160> that<00:05:09.790> way<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.090> looks<00:05:10.240> like<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.510> wind<00:05:10.780> is

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
that that way it looks like the wind is

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.990 
that that way it looks like the wind is
in<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.260> sail<00:05:11.500> now<00:05:11.980> let's<00:05:12.190> try<00:05:12.430> another<00:05:12.550> one

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
in the sail now let's try another one

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.520 
in the sail now let's try another one
we're<00:05:13.720> gonna<00:05:13.810> have<00:05:13.930> another<00:05:14.169> one<00:05:14.320> right<00:05:14.350> here

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
we're gonna have another one right here

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.860 
we're gonna have another one right here
and<00:05:15.220> it's<00:05:15.820> just<00:05:15.970> going<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:16.150> be<00:05:16.270> behind<00:05:16.419> this

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
and it's just going to be behind this

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.030 
and it's just going to be behind this
one<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.169> we<00:05:17.260> don't<00:05:17.380> have<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.590> draw<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.800> top

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
one so we don't have to draw the top

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.110 
one so we don't have to draw the top
line<00:05:18.540> curved<00:05:19.540> and<00:05:20.100> curved<00:05:21.100> let's<00:05:21.880> draw<00:05:22.090> a

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
line curved and curved let's draw a

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.200 
line curved and curved let's draw a
couple<00:05:22.210> more<00:05:22.630> here<00:05:22.950> straight<00:05:24.690> straight

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
couple more here straight straight

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.909 
couple more here straight straight
curved<00:05:28.560> curved<00:05:30.090> straight<00:05:31.650> straight<00:05:33.389> curved

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
curved curved straight straight curved

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.100 
curved curved straight straight curved
curved<00:05:35.919> like<00:05:36.310> that<00:05:36.550> okay<00:05:37.450> now<00:05:37.600> these<00:05:37.750> sails

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
curved like that okay now these sails

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.510 
curved like that okay now these sails
have<00:05:38.290> to<00:05:38.410> be<00:05:38.500> hooked<00:05:38.650> onto<00:05:38.860> something<00:05:39.310> so<00:05:39.430> we

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
have to be hooked onto something so we

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.280 
have to be hooked onto something so we
have<00:05:39.639> to<00:05:39.729> draw<00:05:39.910> a<00:05:39.940> couple<00:05:40.120> maths<00:05:40.510> we're<00:05:41.200> gonna

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
have to draw a couple maths we're gonna

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.920 
have to draw a couple maths we're gonna
draw<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.830> circle<00:05:42.520> and<00:05:42.850> then<00:05:43.570> we're<00:05:43.690> gonna<00:05:43.780> draw

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
draw a circle and then we're gonna draw

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.600 
draw a circle and then we're gonna draw
a<00:05:43.960> straight<00:05:44.260> line<00:05:44.290> but<00:05:44.830> we're<00:05:44.950> gonna<00:05:45.040> stop<00:05:45.430> at

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
a straight line but we're gonna stop at

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.900 
a straight line but we're gonna stop at
our<00:05:45.640> sails<00:05:46.560> we're<00:05:47.560> gonna<00:05:47.650> pretend<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.790> goes

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
our sails we're gonna pretend it goes

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.820 
our sails we're gonna pretend it goes
right<00:05:49.210> through<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.510> sails<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:50.140> draw<00:05:50.500> right

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
right through the sails and draw right

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.800 
right through the sails and draw right
where<00:05:51.070> it<00:05:51.190> would<00:05:51.370> go<00:05:51.580> because<00:05:52.210> it's<00:05:52.479> behind

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
where it would go because it's behind

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.790 
where it would go because it's behind
and<00:05:53.680> then<00:05:54.100> bring<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.370> all<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:54.580> way<00:05:55.030> down<00:05:55.800> okay

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
and then bring it all the way down okay

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.190 
and then bring it all the way down okay
same<00:05:57.310> with<00:05:57.490> this<00:05:57.610> one<00:05:57.669> let's<00:05:58.330> draw<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.600> circle

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
same with this one let's draw a circle

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.750 
same with this one let's draw a circle
and<00:05:59.410> a<00:06:00.370> straight<00:06:00.760> line<00:06:01.140> all<00:06:02.140> the<00:06:02.740> way<00:06:02.770> down

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
and a straight line all the way down

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.450 
and a straight line all the way down
okay<00:06:04.539> now<00:06:05.200> over<00:06:05.350> here<00:06:05.650> sometimes<00:06:06.039> there's<00:06:06.220> one

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
okay now over here sometimes there's one

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.450 
okay now over here sometimes there's one
more<00:06:06.640> sail<00:06:07.000> that's<00:06:07.539> kind<00:06:07.870> of<00:06:07.930> curved<00:06:08.320> so<00:06:08.979> let's

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
more sail that's kind of curved so let's

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.430 
more sail that's kind of curved so let's
go<00:06:09.789> let's<00:06:10.180> just<00:06:10.419> do<00:06:10.539> a<00:06:10.570> curved<00:06:11.910> triangle<00:06:13.440> right

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
go let's just do a curved triangle right

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.270 
go let's just do a curved triangle right
through<00:06:15.130> here<00:06:15.760> okay<00:06:16.200> now<00:06:17.200> all<00:06:17.680> we<00:06:17.919> need<00:06:18.039> to<00:06:18.130> do

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
through here okay now all we need to do

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.430 
through here okay now all we need to do
is<00:06:18.520> some<00:06:18.910> details<00:06:19.330> we<00:06:19.750> need<00:06:19.780> to<00:06:19.990> add<00:06:20.110> some

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
is some details we need to add some

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.529 
is some details we need to add some
water<00:06:20.470> so<00:06:21.039> let's<00:06:21.880> put<00:06:22.150> some<00:06:22.390> waves<00:06:22.690> down<00:06:23.050> here

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
water so let's put some waves down here

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.719 
water so let's put some waves down here
make<00:06:25.539> our<00:06:25.720> curved<00:06:26.050> wine<00:06:26.410> and<00:06:27.039> it's<00:06:27.220> okay<00:06:27.490> if<00:06:27.520> it

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
make our curved wine and it's okay if it

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.790 
make our curved wine and it's okay if it
goes<00:06:27.940> over<00:06:28.780> that<00:06:29.080> boat<00:06:29.229> and<00:06:29.410> I<00:06:29.470> want<00:06:29.710> them

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
goes over that boat and I want them

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.350 
goes over that boat and I want them
behind<00:06:30.100> to<00:06:30.310> so<00:06:30.669> that<00:06:30.789> it<00:06:30.880> looks<00:06:31.060> like<00:06:31.210> it's

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
behind to so that it looks like it's

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.150 
behind to so that it looks like it's
kind<00:06:31.510> of<00:06:31.630> sunk<00:06:31.840> in<00:06:32.050> so<00:06:32.590> let's<00:06:32.800> draw<00:06:33.070> a<00:06:33.100> couple

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
kind of sunk in so let's draw a couple

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.719 
kind of sunk in so let's draw a couple
more<00:06:33.640> wavy<00:06:34.030> lines<00:06:36.390> and<00:06:38.220> of<00:06:39.220> course<00:06:39.490> you're

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
more wavy lines and of course you're

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.580 
more wavy lines and of course you're
gonna<00:06:39.789> want<00:06:40.060> to<00:06:40.150> put<00:06:40.330> a<00:06:40.510> skull<00:06:40.870> and<00:06:41.110> crossbones

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
gonna want to put a skull and crossbones

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.529 
gonna want to put a skull and crossbones
on<00:06:41.800> right<00:06:42.100> on<00:06:42.340> one<00:06:42.820> of<00:06:42.850> the<00:06:43.030> sails<00:06:43.270> so<00:06:43.419> that

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
on right on one of the sails so that

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:44.670 
on right on one of the sails so that
people<00:06:43.750> know<00:06:43.870> it's<00:06:43.990> a<00:06:44.050> pirate<00:06:44.289> ship<00:06:44.349> and<00:06:44.620> to

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
people know it's a pirate ship and to

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.860 
people know it's a pirate ship and to
stay<00:06:44.860> away<00:06:44.950> so<00:06:45.580> we're<00:06:45.760> gonna<00:06:45.820> draw<00:06:46.210> a<00:06:46.450> circular

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
stay away so we're gonna draw a circular

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.630 
stay away so we're gonna draw a circular
shape<00:06:47.409> like<00:06:47.680> that<00:06:47.710> but<00:06:48.099> not<00:06:48.220> all<00:06:48.280> the<00:06:48.610> way

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
shape like that but not all the way

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.770 
shape like that but not all the way
closed

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
of a square shape two circles for eyes

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.220 
of a square shape two circles for eyes
some<00:06:58.660> lines<00:06:58.990> for<00:06:59.740> teeth<00:07:00.460> and<00:07:00.990> then<00:07:01.990> we're

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.230

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.530 
some lines for teeth and then we're
gonna<00:07:02.320> draw<00:07:02.740> this<00:07:03.640> is<00:07:03.820> gonna<00:07:03.940> seem<00:07:04.210> kind<00:07:04.450> of

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
kind of a heart shape okay we're gonna

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.850 
kind of a heart shape okay we're gonna
go<00:07:08.230> curved<00:07:08.860> curved<00:07:09.460> and<00:07:09.870> then<00:07:10.870> draw<00:07:11.260> a<00:07:11.560> line

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
go curved curved and then draw a line

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.380 
go curved curved and then draw a line
that's<00:07:12.760> like<00:07:13.120> the<00:07:13.240> end<00:07:13.270> of<00:07:13.600> a<00:07:13.720> bone<00:07:13.900> and<00:07:15.390> curved

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.390 
that's like the end of a bone and curved

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.170 
that's like the end of a bone and curved
curve<00:07:17.080> all<00:07:17.950> right<00:07:18.100> and<00:07:18.280> on<00:07:18.400> this<00:07:18.580> side<00:07:18.910> just

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
curve all right and on this side just

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.580 
curve all right and on this side just
like<00:07:19.360> we<00:07:19.420> did<00:07:19.690> with<00:07:19.810> the<00:07:19.870> mass<00:07:20.170> we're<00:07:20.470> gonna

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
like we did with the mass we're gonna

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.460 
like we did with the mass we're gonna
stop<00:07:21.040> right<00:07:21.390> there<00:07:22.390> so<00:07:22.810> we<00:07:22.900> don't<00:07:22.990> go<00:07:23.200> through

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
stop right there so we don't go through

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.120 
stop right there so we don't go through
it<00:07:23.500> and<00:07:25.080> then<00:07:26.080> just<00:07:26.260> draw<00:07:26.440> our<00:07:26.500> curved<00:07:26.800> lines

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
it and then just draw our curved lines

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.970 
it and then just draw our curved lines
and<00:07:27.520> our<00:07:28.180> curved<00:07:28.480> lines<00:07:28.750> the<00:07:29.440> pirate<00:07:29.770> ships

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:29.980 
and our curved lines the pirate ships

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.710 
and our curved lines the pirate ships
have<00:07:30.100> a<00:07:30.130> couple<00:07:30.460> other<00:07:30.640> flags<00:07:30.940> too<00:07:31.210> so<00:07:31.480> let's

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 
have a couple other flags too so let's

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.080 
have a couple other flags too so let's
do<00:07:31.990> a<00:07:32.230> curve<00:07:32.830> and<00:07:33.330> a<00:07:34.330> wavy<00:07:34.650> triangle<00:07:35.880> one<00:07:36.880> more

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
do a curve and a wavy triangle one more

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:42.659 
do a curve and a wavy triangle one more
curve<00:07:37.690> and<00:07:38.020> a<00:07:38.140> wavy<00:07:38.560> triangle<00:07:39.460> and<00:07:41.460> you've<00:07:42.460> got

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:42.669 
curve and a wavy triangle and you've got

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:44.700 
curve and a wavy triangle and you've got
a<00:07:42.880> pirate<00:07:43.150> ship<00:07:43.360> okay<00:07:44.260> I<00:07:44.290> hope<00:07:44.440> you<00:07:44.590> had<00:07:44.680> fun
