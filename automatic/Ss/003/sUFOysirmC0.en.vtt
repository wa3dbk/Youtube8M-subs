flashlight<00:00:18.449> yeah<00:00:19.230> that's<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.770> mouthful<00:00:21.380> this

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
flashlight yeah that's a mouthful this

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.189 
flashlight yeah that's a mouthful this
flashlight<00:00:22.740> however<00:00:23.400> packs<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.240> lot<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.660> lumens

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
flashlight however packs a lot of lumens

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.519 
flashlight however packs a lot of lumens
for<00:00:25.769> such<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> small<00:00:26.340> size<00:00:27.289> this<00:00:28.289> light

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
for such a small size this light

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.650 
for such a small size this light
features<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> major<00:00:29.429> innovation<00:00:29.760> from<00:00:30.449> four

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
features a major innovation from four

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.440 
features a major innovation from four
sevens<00:00:31.109> called<00:00:31.470> burst<00:00:31.800> mode

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
sevens called burst mode

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
sevens called burst mode
what<00:00:33.450> burst<00:00:33.719> mode<00:00:34.050> does<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:35.130> runs<00:00:35.430> your

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
what burst mode does is it runs your

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.130 
what burst mode does is it runs your
light<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.090> full<00:00:36.390> power<00:00:37.100> 780<00:00:38.100> lumens<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:39.140> 60

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
light at full power 780 lumens for 60

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.479 
light at full power 780 lumens for 60
seconds<00:00:40.590> then<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.430> ramps<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.969> power<00:00:42.180> down<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
seconds then it ramps the power down to

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
seconds then it ramps the power down to
390<00:00:44.489> lumens<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> normal<00:00:45.809> maximum

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
390 lumens which is the normal maximum

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.380 
390 lumens which is the normal maximum
output<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.010> light

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
output for this light

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.569 
output for this light
a<00:00:48.450> nice<00:00:49.170> thing<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:49.800> kept<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
a nice thing is they kept all of the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
a nice thing is they kept all of the
same<00:00:50.850> other<00:00:51.030> modes<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.079> moonlight<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.860> get

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
same other modes so in moonlight you get

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.880 
same other modes so in moonlight you get
half<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.090> lumen<00:00:54.450> and<00:00:54.629> it'll<00:00:54.960> give<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.200> about<00:00:55.350> 25

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
half a lumen and it'll give you about 25

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.580 
half a lumen and it'll give you about 25

compact light at a similar price range

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.490 
compact light at a similar price range
from<00:01:47.009> other<00:01:47.250> competitors<00:01:47.940> it's<00:01:48.660> just<00:01:49.110> too

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
from other competitors it's just too

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.700

good<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.160> deal<00:01:50.429> so<00:01:50.869> let's<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:52.320> how<00:01:52.470> this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
good of a deal so let's see how this

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.149 
good of a deal so let's see how this
performs<00:01:55.490> so<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.850> burst<00:01:57.240> mode<00:01:57.390> at<00:01:57.780> 780<00:01:58.710> lumens

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
face this is what it's going to look

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:23.340 
face this is what it's going to look
like

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:32.620 

this<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.340> what<00:02:24.580> 390<00:02:25.510> lumen<00:02:25.840> strobe<00:02:26.290> looks<00:02:26.590> like

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.420 

and<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:33.320> is<00:02:33.500> what<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.740> looks<00:02:33.950> like<00:02:34.220> if
