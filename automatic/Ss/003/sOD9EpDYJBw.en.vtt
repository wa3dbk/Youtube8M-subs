obviously a lot vehicles just in a
little<00:00:20.970> 360<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.689> guy<00:00:21.869> well<00:00:22.380> 180<00:00:22.740> ready

little 360 on that guy well 180 ready

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.330 
little 360 on that guy well 180 ready
and<00:00:23.840> okay<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:24.900> i'm<00:00:25.109> laying<00:00:25.320> down<00:00:25.619> mines<00:00:25.890> i<00:00:26.099> laid

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
and okay so i'm laying down mines i laid

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.250 
and okay so i'm laying down mines i laid
one<00:00:26.699> down<00:00:26.970> between<00:00:27.269> because<00:00:27.840> often<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.080> get

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
one down between because often you get

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290 
one down between because often you get
jeeps<00:00:28.529> come<00:00:28.769> between<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:30.179> i'm

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
jeeps come between there and then i'm

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.970 
jeeps come between there and then i'm
laying<00:00:30.539> some<00:00:30.779> more<00:00:30.960> across<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.470> creating<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
laying some more across here creating a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.860 
laying some more across here creating a
line<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.759> protecting<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> back<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
line just protecting the back of the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.330 
line just protecting the back of the
base<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.260> don't<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.469> any<00:00:34.620> jeeps<00:00:34.890> tanks

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
base so we don't have any jeeps tanks

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370 
base so we don't have any jeeps tanks
and<00:00:35.489> stuff<00:00:35.550> come<00:00:35.850> flying<00:00:36.270> around<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:37.170> attack

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and stuff come flying around to attack

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
and stuff come flying around to attack
the<00:00:37.829> rear<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> base<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> little

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the rear of the base so a little

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.660 
the rear of the base so a little
battlefield<00:00:40.050> map<00:00:40.500> knowledge<00:00:40.950> required<00:00:41.489> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
battlefield map knowledge required to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.400 
battlefield map knowledge required to
understand<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.629> begin<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.050> that's<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
understand to begin with so that's the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.389 
understand to begin with so that's the
first<00:00:43.559> thing<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.829> want<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.190> aware

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
first thing you want to do is be aware

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.130 
first thing you want to do is be aware
of<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.730> map<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.450> next<00:00:45.690> thing<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> want

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
of your map the next thing is you want

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840 
of your map the next thing is you want
to<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> nice<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:46.739> flexible<00:00:47.309> class<00:00:47.550> okay

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
to have a nice good flexible class okay

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
to have a nice good flexible class okay
and<00:00:48.180> something<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.870> suits<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.469> map<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and something that suits the map you

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
and something that suits the map you
shouldn't<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.550> make<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.210> class<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
shouldn't just make a class that you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.110 
shouldn't just make a class that you
like<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.140> should<00:00:52.500> tailor<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:52.980> classes<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
like you should tailor your classes to

like you should tailor your classes to
suit<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> map<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.989> you're<00:00:55.140> playing<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.219> I've

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
suit the map that you're playing so I've

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880 
suit the map that you're playing so I've
got<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.789> javelin<00:00:57.329> I've<00:00:57.660> got<00:00:57.870> mines<00:00:58.230> I've<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.800> my

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
scar h with a heavy bowel so that's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.420 
scar h with a heavy bowel so that's
going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> give<00:01:01.260> me<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.500> good<00:01:01.800> range<00:01:02.100> but

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
going to give me some good range but

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490 
going to give me some good range but
it's<00:01:02.609> also<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.149> powerful<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.170> medium

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
it's also you know powerful for medium

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.140 
it's also you know powerful for medium
range<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.920> well<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.369> that's<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> map

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
range as well and that's the kind of map

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.219 
range as well and that's the kind of map
that<00:01:06.330> we're<00:01:06.420> playing<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.780> we've<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> lot<00:01:07.200> of

want to talk about today though is the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.870 
want to talk about today though is the
distance<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.920> spend<00:01:17.250> from<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> base

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
distance that you spend from the base

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.359 
distance that you spend from the base
and<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> lot<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> people<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:20.040> stay

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and you know a lot of people can stay

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.190 
and you know a lot of people can stay
too<00:01:20.430> close<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> base<00:01:21.509> or<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.960> stay

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
too close to the base or they can stay

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
too close to the base or they can stay
too<00:01:22.259> far<00:01:22.740> away<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.159> there's<00:01:23.280> something<00:01:23.460> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
too far away and there's something I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149 
too far away and there's something I
want<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> illustrate<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.960> later<00:01:25.259> video<00:01:25.830> as

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
want to illustrate in a later video as

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.460 
want to illustrate in a later video as
well<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.780> gun<00:01:28.049> handling

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
well now you can see this gun handling

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.990 
well now you can see this gun handling
pretty<00:01:28.770> well<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.369> kind<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> medium

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
pretty well at that kind of medium

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.060 
pretty well at that kind of medium
almost<00:01:30.329> long<00:01:30.570> range<00:01:30.840> there<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.950> know

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
almost long range there and you know

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
almost long range there and you know
we're<00:01:32.220> picking<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.579> some<00:01:32.790> good<00:01:33.200> good<00:01:34.200> clips<00:01:34.530> on

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710

we're picking up some good good clips on
these<00:01:34.829> guys<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.689> this<00:01:36.689> guy<00:01:36.869> did<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
these guys here this guy did the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.080 
these guys here this guy did the
sensible<00:01:37.290> thing<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.860> prone<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
sensible thing of going prone and I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.039 
sensible thing of going prone and I
could<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.390> probably<00:01:39.479> killed<00:01:39.750> am<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> bit

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
could have probably killed am a bit

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.359 
could have probably killed am a bit
quicker<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.560> had<00:01:40.650> actually<00:01:40.770> been<00:01:41.009> aiming<00:01:41.220> at

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
quicker if I had actually been aiming at

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.460 
quicker if I had actually been aiming at
him<00:01:41.570> now<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:42.990> they've<00:01:43.229> managed

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
him now you can see that they've managed

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
him now you can see that they've managed
to<00:01:43.530> get<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> B<00:01:43.950> arm<00:01:44.130> over<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:44.579> now<00:01:44.909> I've<00:01:45.090> been

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to get a B arm over there now I've been

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.910 
to get a B arm over there now I've been
kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> covering<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> route<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.470> don't

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
kind of covering the route to a I don't

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.620 
kind of covering the route to a I don't
know<00:01:47.100> exactly<00:01:47.579> what's<00:01:47.850> been<00:01:48.000> happening<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.479> B

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
know exactly what's been happening at B

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
know exactly what's been happening at B
this<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.110> half<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> issue<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.009> playing<00:01:50.280> with

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
this is half the issue of playing with

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.550 
this is half the issue of playing with
teams<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.939> randomly<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.840> can't<00:01:52.170> do

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
teams just randomly you can't do

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.260 
teams just randomly you can't do
everything<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.460> struggle<00:01:53.909> with<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.090> all

everything and I struggle with this all

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.999 
everything and I struggle with this all
the<00:01:54.390> time<00:01:54.420> where<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.439> can't<00:01:55.710> cover

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the time where you can't cover

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.249 
the time where you can't cover
everything<00:01:56.369> okay<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.210> try<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.780> sort

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
everything okay you have to try and sort

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.959 
everything okay you have to try and sort
of<00:01:58.290> dedicate<00:01:58.920> something<00:01:59.430> especially<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.909> a

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
of dedicate something especially on a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.969 
of dedicate something especially on a
base<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.450> site<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:01.710> they've

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
base of this site so now they've

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.709 
base of this site so now they've
infiltrated<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.270> wanted<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
making a little scout through the base

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.020 
making a little scout through the base
I'm<00:02:07.380> trying<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> assess<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.399> know<00:02:08.550> what's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
want to be now look about how far I am

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.690 
want to be now look about how far I am
away<00:02:30.390> from<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.080> target<00:02:31.290> here<00:02:31.650> okay<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.520> am<00:02:32.580> i

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
away from the target here okay what am i

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.980 
away from the target here okay what am i
doing<00:02:32.970> right<00:02:33.090> here<00:02:33.150> I'm<00:02:33.900> planning<00:02:34.200> team<00:02:34.470> charm

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
doing right here I'm planning team charm

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.750 
doing right here I'm planning team charm
I'm<00:02:36.990> staying<00:02:37.560> kind<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.340> within<00:02:38.520> running

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
I'm staying kind of within running

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.870 
I'm staying kind of within running
distance<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.810> need<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.140> stay<00:02:40.500> at<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.880> range

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
distance you need to stay at a range

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.510 
distance you need to stay at a range
that<00:02:42.330> allows<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:43.800> back<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> base

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
that allows you to get back to the base

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.850 
that allows you to get back to the base
so<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:44.970> see<00:02:45.330> where<00:02:45.480> I'm<00:02:45.600> right<00:02:45.780> now<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.680> is

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
so you see where I'm right now this is

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.550 
so you see where I'm right now this is
my<00:02:47.040> max<00:02:47.280> range<00:02:47.640> okay<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.630> don't<00:02:49.020> really<00:02:49.290> want<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
my max range okay I don't really want to

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.470 
my max range okay I don't really want to
go<00:02:49.710> any<00:02:49.980> further<00:02:50.310> forward<00:02:50.760> than<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.030> now

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
go any further forward than that now

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.420 
go any further forward than that now
that's<00:02:51.660> not<00:02:51.870> because<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.530> want<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.250> see

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that's not because I want it you see

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.980 
that's not because I want it you see
this<00:02:53.520> wall<00:02:53.820> here<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.240> is<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> great<00:02:54.720> distance

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
this wall here this is a great distance

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.560 
this wall here this is a great distance
to<00:02:55.260> be<00:02:55.470> out<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.580> not<00:02:56.820> because<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.510> don't

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
to be out and it's not because I don't

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.240 
to be out and it's not because I don't
want<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.959> go<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.140> get<00:02:58.200> involved<00:02:58.620> it's<00:02:58.770> because

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
want to go and get involved it's because

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.460 
want to go and get involved it's because
you<00:02:59.610> need<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.880> have<00:03:00.000> enough<00:03:00.270> time<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.900> be<00:03:01.290> able

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you need to have enough time to be able

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.770 
you need to have enough time to be able
to<00:03:01.590> run<00:03:01.800> back<00:03:02.100> actually<00:03:02.820> deal<00:03:03.570> with<00:03:03.600> a

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
to run back actually deal with a

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.350 
to run back actually deal with a
situation<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.560> then<00:03:05.010> disarm<00:03:05.490> as<00:03:05.670> well<00:03:05.880> okay

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
situation and then disarm as well okay

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.180 
situation and then disarm as well okay
so<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.959> need<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.290> estimate<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:08.010> perhaps

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
so you need to estimate that perhaps

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.760 
so you need to estimate that perhaps
maybe<00:03:08.610> they'll<00:03:08.850> be<00:03:08.910> 12<00:03:09.450> people<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:09.959> if<00:03:10.230> a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
maybe they'll be 12 people here if a

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.470 
maybe they'll be 12 people here if a
target<00:03:11.100> our<00:03:11.190> time<00:03:11.280> right<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:11.520> I<00:03:11.940> could<00:03:12.300> get

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
target our time right now I could get

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.180 
target our time right now I could get
back<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.870> may<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.320> about<00:03:13.590> two<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.160> three

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
back I may have about two to three

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.490 
back I may have about two to three
seconds<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.090> eliminate<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> target<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.170> then

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
seconds to eliminate a target and then

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.320 
seconds to eliminate a target and then
get<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.739> disarm<00:03:17.190> that's<00:03:17.610> kind<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.120> tight

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
get a disarm that's kind of a tight

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.660 
get a disarm that's kind of a tight
window<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.080> need<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.380> manage<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.310> time

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
window but you need to manage the time

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.150 
window but you need to manage the time
that<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:20.910> will<00:03:21.060> take<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.660> get<00:03:21.810> back<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.350> deal

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
that it will take to get back and deal

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.670 
that it will take to get back and deal
with<00:03:23.310> an<00:03:23.400> issue<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.690> need<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.230> stack<00:03:25.500> that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
with an issue and you need to stack that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.590 
with an issue and you need to stack that
up<00:03:25.739> versus<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.610> know<00:03:26.670> how<00:03:27.030> much<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.480> move

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
up versus you know how much can you move

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.780 
up versus you know how much can you move
around<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.440> stay<00:03:28.680> clue<00:03:28.920> too<00:03:29.310> close<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
around if you stay clue too close to the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.070 
around if you stay clue too close to the
target<00:03:29.970> that's<00:03:30.540> not<00:03:30.690> going<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.870> be<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.959> good

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
target that's not going to be a good

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.870 
target that's not going to be a good
thing<00:03:31.140> either<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.890> need<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.519> be<00:03:32.670> willing

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
thing either so you need to be willing

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.090 
thing either so you need to be willing
to<00:03:33.180> kind<00:03:33.300> of<00:03:33.390> move<00:03:33.540> up<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.840> little<00:03:33.989> bit<00:03:34.320> okay<00:03:34.890> if

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
to kind of move up a little bit okay if

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.160 
to kind of move up a little bit okay if
you<00:03:35.459> stay<00:03:35.730> way<00:03:36.150> too<00:03:36.209> close<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.959> target

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
you stay way too close to the target

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.020 
you stay way too close to the target
what<00:03:37.620> will<00:03:37.830> happen<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.280> eventually<00:03:38.610> they<00:03:38.910> will
