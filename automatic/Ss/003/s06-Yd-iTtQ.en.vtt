00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
when you shut off the engine they're

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.750

tips of these fuel injectors gum up we

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.410 
tips of these fuel injectors gum up we
get<00:01:12.720> carbon<00:01:13.170> buildup<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:14.189> stop<00:01:14.670> sealing

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
get carbon buildup and they stop sealing

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
get carbon buildup and they stop sealing
in<00:01:15.570> fact<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.020> lot<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.200> times<00:01:16.350> we'll<00:01:16.770> put<00:01:16.950> these

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
in fact a lot of times we'll put these

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.010 
in fact a lot of times we'll put these
on<00:01:17.280> our<00:01:17.310> testers<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.000> they'll<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.299> squirting

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
on our testers and they'll be squirting

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
on our testers and they'll be squirting
and<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.740> won't<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.040> spraying<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.909> they

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and they won't be spraying and they

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.550 
and they won't be spraying and they
won't<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.330> coming<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> right<00:01:22.259> pressure

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
won't be coming up to the right pressure

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.609 
won't be coming up to the right pressure
and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.360> stop<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.200> testing

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
and then you you stop the testing

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
and then you you stop the testing
process<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.880> pressure<00:01:27.180> leaks<00:01:27.540> down

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
process and the the pressure leaks down

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.630 
process and the the pressure leaks down
and<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.350> drip<00:01:28.619> drip<00:01:28.979> drip<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.280> like

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and you see drip drip drip just like

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.940 
and you see drip drip drip just like
here<00:01:29.880> look<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.420> him<00:01:31.110> see<00:01:31.439> how<00:01:31.560> badly

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
here look at this see him see how badly

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.999 
here look at this see him see how badly
this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> scoring<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:34.049> dripping

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
this is scoring and it's just dripping

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
this is scoring and it's just dripping
and<00:01:35.400> dripping<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.060> dripping<00:01:36.299> well<00:01:36.600> that's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and dripping and dripping well that's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.600 
and dripping and dripping well that's
typical<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.650> what<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.280> lot<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
typical of what you see on a lot of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.980 
typical of what you see on a lot of
these<00:01:38.820> injectors<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.450> engines<00:01:39.780> over<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
these injectors with engines over a

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
these injectors with engines over a
hundred<00:01:40.229> thousand<00:01:40.560> miles<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:41.310> few

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
hundred thousand miles because very few

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.649 
hundred thousand miles because very few
people<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.360> even<00:01:42.960> shops<00:01:43.729> will<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:45.210> anything

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
people or even shops will do anything

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.910 
people or even shops will do anything
with<00:01:45.840> these<00:01:45.960> film<00:01:46.200> sectors<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> might

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
with these film sectors and you might

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560 
with these film sectors and you might
say<00:01:47.070> well<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.340> engines<00:01:47.640> running<00:01:47.820> fine<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.390> why

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
say well my engines running fine so why

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.139 
say well my engines running fine so why
bother<00:01:48.780> how<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.670> how<00:01:50.670> well<00:01:50.970> it's

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
bother how do you know how well it's

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.460 
bother how do you know how well it's
running<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.540> maybe<00:01:51.689> you've<00:01:51.899> noticed<00:01:52.350> that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
running and maybe you've noticed that

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.789 
running and maybe you've noticed that
that<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.689> should<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> say<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.290> fuel<00:01:55.530> economy

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that the should I say the fuel economy

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.730 
that the should I say the fuel economy
has<00:01:56.579> declined<00:01:57.060> gradually<00:01:57.719> over<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> longer

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
has declined gradually over a longer

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.280 
has declined gradually over a longer
period<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.189> time<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.700> back<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> reason<00:02:01.259> why

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
period of time so back to the reason why

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.850 
period of time so back to the reason why
it<00:02:01.469> might<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.130> hot<00:02:02.520> start<00:02:02.909> issue<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it might be a hot start issue so you you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.459 
it might be a hot start issue so you you

you're going to come back 15 minutes

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.910 
you're going to come back 15 minutes
later<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.700> engine<00:02:11.910> won't<00:02:12.000> start

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
later and the engine won't start

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.070 
later and the engine won't start
or<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.550> will<00:02:13.640> start<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.210> kind<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.569> pop<00:02:14.840> and

or it will start and kind of pop and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.000 
or it will start and kind of pop and
bang<00:02:15.490> well<00:02:16.490> in<00:02:16.790> some<00:02:17.180> cases<00:02:17.530> when<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.680> shut

that engine off all that fuel built up

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.070 
that engine off all that fuel built up
inside<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.580> injector<00:02:22.940> will<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.360> leak<00:02:23.660> right

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
inside the injector will just leak right

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.490 
inside the injector will just leak right
down<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.680> here<00:02:25.040> into<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.790> right<00:02:26.480> at<00:02:27.140> the

opening to the intake valves and when
you<00:02:30.740> go<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.459> restart<00:02:32.030> right<00:02:32.630> away<00:02:32.950> you're

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
you go to restart right away you're

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.740 
you go to restart right away you're
going<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.280> either<00:02:34.430> experience<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.240> flooded

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
going to either experience a flooded

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.650 
going to either experience a flooded
problem<00:02:36.200> or<00:02:36.760> possible<00:02:37.760> vapor<00:02:38.120> lock<00:02:38.390> problem

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
problem or possible vapor lock problem

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.750 
problem or possible vapor lock problem
because<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.590> excess<00:02:40.040> fuel<00:02:40.250> in<00:02:40.459> excess

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
because you have excess fuel in excess

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.330 
because you have excess fuel in excess
vapor<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.380> therefore<00:02:42.380> you're<00:02:42.560> not<00:02:42.830> going<00:02:43.220> to

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
vapor and therefore you're not going to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.420 
vapor and therefore you're not going to
get<00:02:43.489> ignition<00:02:44.239> in<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:45.530> combustion<00:02:45.890> chambers

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
get ignition in the combustion chambers

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.120 
get ignition in the combustion chambers
so<00:02:46.730> if<00:02:47.030> you're<00:02:47.780> chasing<00:02:48.140> hard<00:02:48.650> starting

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
so if you're chasing hard starting

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.270 
so if you're chasing hard starting
issues<00:02:49.489> now<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.870> other<00:02:51.019> issue<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:52.040> may

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
issues now the other issue is it may

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.720 
issues now the other issue is it may
start<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:53.690> may<00:02:53.930> start<00:02:54.320> when<00:02:55.070> it's<00:02:55.190> cold<00:02:55.430> and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
start it may start when it's cold and

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.259 
start it may start when it's cold and
then<00:02:55.910> quit<00:02:56.800> well<00:02:57.800> that's<00:02:58.070> probably<00:02:58.459> also

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
then quit well that's probably also

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.240 
then quit well that's probably also
indicative<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.320> pressure<00:03:00.650> leaking<00:03:01.100> off

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
indicative of the pressure leaking off

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.490 
indicative of the pressure leaking off
the<00:03:01.459> fuel<00:03:01.670> leaking<00:03:01.910> out<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.420> injectors<00:03:02.870> so

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
the fuel leaking out of the injectors so

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.690 
the fuel leaking out of the injectors so
when<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.739> go<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.920> start<00:03:04.220> if<00:03:04.310> there's<00:03:04.550> enough

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
when you go to start if there's enough

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.460 
when you go to start if there's enough
fuel<00:03:05.300> vapor<00:03:05.540> in<00:03:05.720> there<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.959> get<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.140> engine<00:03:06.410> to

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
fuel vapor in there to get the engine to

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.440 
fuel vapor in there to get the engine to
fire<00:03:06.680> but<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:06.950> immediately<00:03:07.220> quits<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.940> then

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
fire but it immediately quits and then

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.790 
fire but it immediately quits and then
you<00:03:08.570> got<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.870> try<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.080> start<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.470> again

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
you got to try to start it again

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.370 
you got to try to start it again
so<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.310> just<00:03:11.239> wanted<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.630> share<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:11.870> with<00:03:12.080> you
