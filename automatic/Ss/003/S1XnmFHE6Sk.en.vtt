 Australian cuisine that has undergone 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.349
 British influence is increasingly 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.309
 international ethnic- oriented

 then carlo a quick and easy recipe 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.910
 to test everyone first we have 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.850
 some chicken breast here and we cut it to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.080
 cubes we say not too big 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.080
 small but not too big 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.720
 we take the risolo we wash under water 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.030
 cold to remove starch and impurities 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 we calculate for a glass of rice two 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.320
 glasses of water cold water 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.630
 we bring boiling when the water 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.399
 bubbles we put the fire to a minimum and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.960
 we cover with a lid and leave 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.610
 cook until completely absorbed 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 rice when the water absorbed the rice is 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.890
 ready now to prepare our curry 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.450
 let's start with the coconut cream that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.030
 we have separated from the liquid part 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.250
 from the coconut milk can that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.069
 base to create curry in style 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.840
 Thai and take a part one 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.659
 sufficient quantity to be able to 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.560
 mix our pasta with 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.560
 green carrie 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.850
 now that our coconut cream is you 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.680
 a little loose we can add the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:08.780
 curry the stand we perish in and gradually 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:12.830
 step by step we will add the remaining la 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.170
 remaining coconut cream seen in 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.120
 kitchen must be operational and then 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.280
 we also put on our apron 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.200
 made things right and arrived 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.710
 time to add the chicken so 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.400
 boil and brown, then add the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.400
 coconut milk 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.250

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.159
 add the leaves of fish sauce 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.290
 purely decorative airline coffee e 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.360
 these are not mamini peas 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.150
 Thai eggplants in the absence of 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.730
 these you can use other types of 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.590
 eggplant because we remember the kitchen 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.439
 Thai involves the use of the four 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.230
 sweet and salty contrasting flavors 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.840
 spicy and sour we are left with 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.500

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:05.230

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.370
 fresh coriander leaves o 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.590
 historically the basil would go 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.790
 Thai which is actually very similar 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.560
