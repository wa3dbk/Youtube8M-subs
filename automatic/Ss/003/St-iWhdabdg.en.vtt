 the animals are guilty 26 heroes of 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.500
 war we admire people who 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.900
 they fight in conflicts defending us 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.669
 but we forget that behind his 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.039
 value is the suffering of their 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.210
 families nobody remembers

 Giants as gods we decide 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.139
 what animals deserve to live and what deserves 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:22.060
 dying we adopt a role that does not 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.250
 belongs 28 the time against by

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.810
 times over our 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.810
 possibilities to buy things that 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.610
 we really do not need things that with 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.440
 its economic value would feed 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.490
 families that would not be able to 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.699
 understand what we do 31 contrast 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.370
 a wedding an event of waste 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.890
 meals suit 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.690
 guests and luxury in this metaphor joins 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.880
 for the rice the celebration of some 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.960
 against the forced slavery before the 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.780
 work of others to survive 32 the 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.450
 pieces of war the people are the 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.460
 pawns of wars units for

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:34.270
 interests of those who are up without 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:37.210
 more 33 a world built on 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.220
 lies behind the majorities of the 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.400
 political decisions of history 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.170
 there have always been personal interests 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.750
 how they wanted to tell us is another 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:51.280
 very different thing 34 creative kitchen 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.130
 It really is so important or it's just 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.290
 a bubble a slope defends that 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.890
 it's a kitchen that does not serve to satiate 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:01.660
 but part of an experience 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:05.500
 others say do that with food 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:08.200
 it is unfair 35 the system error 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.870
 educational forced to absorb 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:15.340
 information to release it suddenly and not 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:18.699
 turn to agree to her anymore 36 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:21.010
 we play what a game for some is 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:27.070
 the only way to make a living for 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:29.050
 another 37 crisis that is luxury according to 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.449
 resources of the people from whom 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.690
 let's talk about what luxury is for some is 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:36.490
 very different from what it is for others 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.580
 families live forced to distribute what 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:42.280
 little they have throughout their days 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.320
