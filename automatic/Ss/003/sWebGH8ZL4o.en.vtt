today I'm going to teach you how to tie

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.420 
today I'm going to teach you how to tie
a<00:00:15.170> trout<00:00:15.559> line<00:00:17.470> here<00:00:18.470> we<00:00:18.680> got<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:18.920> line<00:00:19.130> in<00:00:19.340> the

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
a trout line here we got the line in the

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.810 
a trout line here we got the line in the
hook<00:00:19.610> and<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:22.010> hole<00:00:22.189> there<00:00:22.430> on<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:22.640> end<00:00:22.730> of

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
hook and the hole there on the end of

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.100 
hook and the hole there on the end of
the<00:00:22.910> hook<00:00:23.090> you're<00:00:23.270> going<00:00:23.390> to<00:00:23.480> loop<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.930> line

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
the hook you're going to loop the line

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.490 
the hook you're going to loop the line
through<00:00:26.050> pull<00:00:27.050> it<00:00:27.080> out<00:00:27.320> just<00:00:27.619> like<00:00:28.190> that<00:00:28.250> and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
through pull it out just like that and

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.900 
through pull it out just like that and
take<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:30.590> short<00:00:30.860> end<00:00:31.039> loop<00:00:31.250> it<00:00:31.369> around<00:00:31.400> at

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
take the short end loop it around at

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.490 
take the short end loop it around at
least<00:00:32.300> nine<00:00:32.480> times<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:33.800> can<00:00:33.949> do<00:00:34.040> fewer<00:00:34.370> but

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
least nine times you can do fewer but

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.720 
least nine times you can do fewer but
it's<00:00:36.500> not<00:00:36.680> as<00:00:36.800> strong<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:38.800> seven<00:00:40.510> eight<00:00:42.730> nine

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
it's not as strong so seven eight nine

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.200 
it's not as strong so seven eight nine
now<00:00:44.540> they<00:00:44.600> have<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:44.899> looped<00:00:45.170> around<00:00:46.090> find<00:00:47.090> a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
now they have it looped around find a

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.350 
now they have it looped around find a
loop<00:00:47.450> in<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:47.750> end<00:00:47.780> there<00:00:49.120> between<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.780> hook

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
loop in the end there between the hook

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.020 
loop in the end there between the hook
and<00:00:53.360> there<00:00:53.540> and<00:00:54.309> see<00:00:55.309> little<00:00:55.489> hole<00:00:55.730> there<00:00:55.910> on

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
and there and see little hole there on

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.150 
and there and see little hole there on
the<00:00:56.149> end<00:00:57.340> and<00:00:58.340> then<00:00:58.460> take<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.730> line<00:01:00.160> just

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
the end and then take the line just

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:12.700 
the end and then take the line just
tough<00:01:01.430> parts<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:01.850> can<00:01:02.000> hardly<00:01:02.300> see<00:01:02.539> it<00:01:11.710> just

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
tough parts you can hardly see it just

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.449 
tough parts you can hardly see it just
like<00:01:12.860> that

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:15.459 

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:18.090 

now<00:01:16.459> it's<00:01:16.670> hanging<00:01:16.880> there<00:01:17.000> loosely<00:01:17.539> you<00:01:17.780> pull

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
now it's hanging there loosely you pull

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.090 
now it's hanging there loosely you pull
tighten<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:20.289> cut<00:01:21.289> off<00:01:21.410> that<00:01:21.440> little<00:01:21.649> extra

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
tighten it and cut off that little extra

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.800 
tighten it and cut off that little extra
bit<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.610> end<00:01:22.729> there<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.330> you'll<00:01:23.509> be<00:01:23.630> good

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
bit on the end there and you'll be good

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.279 
bit on the end there and you'll be good
your<00:01:24.110> line<00:01:24.289> will<00:01:24.440> be<00:01:24.530> done<00:01:25.840> next<00:01:26.840> I'm<00:01:27.080> going<00:01:27.200> to

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
your line will be done next I'm going to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.020 
your line will be done next I'm going to
do<00:01:27.349> and<00:01:27.470> I<00:01:27.530> put<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.740> weights<00:01:27.920> on<00:01:28.130> here<00:01:28.459> they

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
do and I put the weights on here they

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.130 
do and I put the weights on here they
have<00:01:29.179> little<00:01:29.390> grooves<00:01:29.690> in<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.869> end<00:01:29.990> there

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
have little grooves in the end there

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.130 
have little grooves in the end there
that<00:01:30.170> will<00:01:30.380> go<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.709> line<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:32.050> matters<00:01:33.050> how

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
that will go on the line and matters how

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.779 
that will go on the line and matters how
deep<00:01:33.349> the<00:01:33.470> water<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.740> help<00:01:34.039> what<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:34.520> wanted

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
deep the water is help what you wanted

to float above the above the bottom the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.740 
to float above the above the bottom the
water<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.160> about<00:01:40.429> a<00:01:40.459> foot<00:01:40.789> deep<00:01:40.849> you'll

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
water is about a foot deep you'll

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.900 
water is about a foot deep you'll
probably<00:01:41.929> put<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.259> six<00:01:42.470> inches<00:01:42.830> it's<00:01:43.250> deeper<00:01:43.700> I

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
probably put it six inches it's deeper I

I'm<00:01:45.319> going<00:01:45.440> to<00:01:45.500> put<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.649> foot<00:01:45.979> up<00:01:46.069> the<00:01:46.160> line

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
I'm going to put a foot up the line

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:54.100 
I'm going to put a foot up the line
there's<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.270> hook<00:01:47.450> foot<00:01:48.410> line<00:01:52.840> there's<00:01:53.840> the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
there's the hook foot line there's the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.880 
there's the hook foot line there's the
weight<00:01:54.259> on<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.560> end<00:01:54.679> there<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:57.590> line

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.380 

next<00:02:00.890> comes<00:02:01.160> your<00:02:01.399> bobber<00:02:01.610> for<00:02:01.759> floating

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
next comes your bobber for floating

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.760 
next comes your bobber for floating
there's<00:02:02.690> two<00:02:02.810> hooks<00:02:02.989> nan<00:02:03.200> there's<00:02:03.410> one<00:02:03.590> hook

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
there's two hooks nan there's one hook

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.410 
there's two hooks nan there's one hook
there<00:02:04.179> and<00:02:05.349> another<00:02:06.349> hook<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.800> top<00:02:06.830> and

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
there and another hook on the top and

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.089 
there and another hook on the top and
you're<00:02:08.420> going<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.599> hook<00:02:08.660> each<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.229> those<00:02:09.349> onto

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
you're going to hook each of those onto

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.920 
you're going to hook each of those onto
the<00:02:10.190> line<00:02:13.120> get<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.420> in<00:02:14.599> hook<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.440> in

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
the line get one in hook it in

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.280 
the line get one in hook it in
take<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.050> other<00:02:18.200> end<00:02:19.480> hook<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.569> in<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.019> loop

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
take the other end hook it in and loop

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.470 
take the other end hook it in and loop
it<00:02:21.440> around<00:02:21.500> twice<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.190> keep<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.519> so<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.239> doesn't

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
it around twice to keep it so it doesn't

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.070 
it around twice to keep it so it doesn't
drag<00:02:23.690> across<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.200> line<00:02:24.409> and<00:02:25.360> they're<00:02:26.360> beset

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.720 

so<00:02:30.080> if<00:02:30.440> you're<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.650> sequence<00:02:31.069> goes<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
so if you're the sequence goes the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.940 
so if you're the sequence goes the
baller<00:02:32.890> put<00:02:33.890> down<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.340> weights<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:36.879> finally

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
baller put down the weights and finally

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.020 
baller put down the weights and finally
the<00:02:39.950> hook<00:02:41.980> now<00:02:42.980> I'm<00:02:43.099> going<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.310> use<00:02:43.340> power<00:02:43.700> bait

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
the hook now I'm going to use power bait

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.880 
the hook now I'm going to use power bait
because<00:02:44.420> these<00:02:44.810> picture<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.290> stalk<00:02:45.620> and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
because these picture to stalk and

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.880 
because these picture to stalk and
