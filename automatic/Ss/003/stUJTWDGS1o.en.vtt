new foundation it's a BB cream from ELF
it<00:01:49.040> was<00:01:49.160> literally<00:01:49.520> twenty<00:01:49.940> dollars<00:01:50.210> at

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
it was literally twenty dollars at

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330 
it was literally twenty dollars at
target<00:01:50.690> it<00:01:51.110> has<00:01:51.290> sunscreen<00:01:51.620> in<00:01:51.980> it<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.250> it's

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
target it has sunscreen in it and it's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.460 
target it has sunscreen in it and it's
super<00:01:52.790> light<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.210> it's<00:01:53.360> like<00:01:53.510> full<00:01:54.050> coverage

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
super light so it's like full coverage

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.440 
super light so it's like full coverage
foundation<00:01:54.590> but<00:01:55.580> it<00:01:55.670> feels<00:01:55.910> as<00:01:56.180> though<00:01:56.300> you're

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
foundation but it feels as though you're

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.270 
foundation but it feels as though you're
just<00:01:56.480> putting<00:01:56.780> sunscreen<00:01:57.170> on<00:01:57.470> your<00:01:57.620> face<00:01:57.830> so

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
just putting sunscreen on your face so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.670 
just putting sunscreen on your face so
as<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:58.700> imagine<00:01:58.760> it<00:01:59.330> completely<00:02:00.020> helps

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
as you can imagine it completely helps

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.469 
as you can imagine it completely helps
you<00:02:00.770> from<00:02:00.979> breaking<00:02:01.250> out<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:02.060> not<00:02:02.300> as

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
you from breaking out and it's not as

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.320 
you from breaking out and it's not as
heavy<00:02:02.950> then<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.070> used<00:02:04.250> my<00:02:04.310> tart<00:02:04.670> concealer<00:02:05.150> and
