go through one of these holes in the

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.900 
go through one of these holes in the
handle<00:03:38.890> give<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.069> nice<00:03:40.340> twist

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.080 

it's<00:03:46.450> relatively<00:03:46.840> secure<00:03:47.410> as<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.880> nice

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
it's relatively secure as it is the nice

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.400 
it's relatively secure as it is the nice
thing<00:03:49.330> is<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.630> can<00:03:49.810> just<00:03:49.990> sort<00:03:50.020> of<00:03:50.200> mash

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
thing is that I can just sort of mash

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.250 
thing is that I can just sort of mash
the<00:03:50.650> sides<00:03:51.090> sort<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.180> into<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.690> contours<00:03:53.170> of

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
the sides sort of into the contours of

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.180 
the sides sort of into the contours of
the<00:03:53.410> cup<00:03:54.870> holds<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.930> shape<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.620> holds<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.070> that

the cup holds a shape and holds it that
much<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.400> little<00:03:57.640> bit<00:03:57.730> more<00:03:57.880> secure<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:59.290> I

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
much a little bit more secure and I

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.720 
much a little bit more secure and I
think<00:03:59.590> for<00:03:59.770> these<00:03:59.890> sides<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.430> want<00:04:00.550> to<00:04:00.610> say

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
think for these sides I want to say

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.470 
think for these sides I want to say
these<00:04:00.880> are<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.090> 12<00:04:01.420> inch<00:04:01.890> lengths<00:04:02.890> and

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
these are the 12 inch lengths and

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.760 
these are the 12 inch lengths and
