00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
with people next is average just think

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.779 
with people next is average just think
about<00:01:26.929> the<00:01:27.110> most<00:01:27.259> average<00:01:28.360> team<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.569> all<00:01:29.719> time

probably<00:01:31.789> couldn't<00:01:32.030> think<00:01:32.149> of<00:01:32.299> one<00:01:32.799> because

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
probably couldn't think of one because

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.359 
probably couldn't think of one because
there's<00:01:33.950> been<00:01:34.100> millions<00:01:34.369> of<00:01:34.729> average<00:01:35.030> teams

there's been millions of average teams

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.039 
there's been millions of average teams
it<00:01:37.369> just<00:01:37.610> they<00:01:37.759> conform<00:01:38.209> to<00:01:38.450> one<00:01:38.569> another

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
it just they conform to one another

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.199 
it just they conform to one another
they're<00:01:39.229> like<00:01:39.380> amoebas<00:01:39.789> just<00:01:40.789> kind<00:01:40.939> of<00:01:40.969> bump

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
they're like amoebas just kind of bump

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.279 
they're like amoebas just kind of bump
into<00:01:41.390> one<00:01:41.450> another<00:01:41.689> then<00:01:41.869> it<00:01:41.959> kind<00:01:42.079> of<00:01:42.140> just

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
into one another then it kind of just

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.389 
into one another then it kind of just
forms<00:01:42.560> something<00:01:42.890> else<00:01:44.979> they<00:01:45.979> just<00:01:46.189> kind<00:01:46.340> of

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
forms something else they just kind of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.520 
forms something else they just kind of
go<00:01:46.549> with<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.849> wind<00:01:47.060> they'd<00:01:47.689> be<00:01:47.840> opposite<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.470> a
