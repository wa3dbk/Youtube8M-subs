blockers I fight them off and i'll go
ahead<00:02:09.070> and<00:02:09.340> i<00:02:09.520> make<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.910> hit<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:11.170> know<00:02:11.320> I'm

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
ahead and i make the hit you know I'm

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.620 
ahead and i make the hit you know I'm
saying<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.459> mean<00:02:12.640> thing<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:13.060> now<00:02:13.300> what's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
saying and I mean thing is now what's

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.220 
saying and I mean thing is now what's
the<00:02:13.780> blocking<00:02:14.290> perfect<00:02:14.830> no<00:02:15.450> am<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.720> saying<00:02:17.050> that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the blocking perfect no am I saying that

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.550 
the blocking perfect no am I saying that
backbreaker<00:02:17.830> has<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.310> perfect<00:02:18.760> no<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:19.560> it

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
backbreaker has it perfect no but it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.860 
backbreaker has it perfect no but it
gives<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.520> most<00:02:21.730> unique<00:02:22.180> form<00:02:22.600> in

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
gives it in the most unique form in

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.580 
gives it in the most unique form in
terms<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.410> respective<00:02:24.100> physics<00:02:24.550> because

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
terms of the respective physics because

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.220

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
man dies on the ground dives on the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.550 
man dies on the ground dives on the
ground<00:03:49.090> he<00:03:49.689> gets<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:51.659> then<00:03:52.659> I<00:03:52.930> go<00:03:53.109> ahead<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.470> I

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
ground he gets it then I go ahead and I

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.030 
ground he gets it then I go ahead and I
switch<00:03:53.949> to<00:03:53.979> the<00:03:54.370> player<00:03:54.930> he's<00:03:55.930> able<00:03:56.139> to<00:03:56.379> get<00:03:56.590> up

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.689 

turn<00:04:00.040> around<00:04:00.159> him<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.090> then<00:04:01.359> in<00:04:01.659> the<00:04:01.810> scrum

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
turn around him and then in the scrum

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.750 
turn around him and then in the scrum
now<00:04:03.699> I<00:04:03.729> like<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.389> there<00:04:04.900> was<00:04:05.079> no<00:04:05.290> true<00:04:06.250> tackle

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
now I like this there was no true tackle

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.550 
now I like this there was no true tackle
me<00:04:06.940> even<00:04:07.479> though<00:04:07.569> there's<00:04:07.780> some<00:04:07.989> morphine<00:04:08.379> air

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
me even though there's some morphine air

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.649 
me even though there's some morphine air
with<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.829> legs<00:04:09.099> there<00:04:09.400> was<00:04:09.549> morphine<00:04:10.120> you

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
with the legs there was morphine you

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.520 
with the legs there was morphine you
know<00:04:10.810> but<00:04:11.409> um<00:04:12.540> nevertheless<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:14.109> would<00:04:14.290> like<00:04:14.500> to

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
know but um nevertheless I would like to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.920 
know but um nevertheless I would like to
see<00:04:14.919> that<00:04:15.159> players<00:04:15.579> just<00:04:15.849> don't<00:04:16.120> fall<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.810> the

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
see that players just don't fall to the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.149 
see that players just don't fall to the
ground<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.919> know<00:04:18.180> like<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:20.560> second<00:04:21.039> they

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
ground you know like the second they

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.920 
ground you know like the second they
make<00:04:21.370> some<00:04:21.609> contact<00:04:22.150> with<00:04:22.270> either<00:04:22.570> their
