step2<00:00:01.380> we're<00:00:01.560> creating<00:00:02.190> that<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.850> role<00:00:03.330> or

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
step2 we're creating that the role or

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.920 
step2 we're creating that the role or
the<00:00:03.799> this<00:00:04.799> kind<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.700> lump<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.299> pasta<00:00:06.750> dough

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
the this kind of a lump of pasta dough

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.230 
the this kind of a lump of pasta dough
and<00:00:07.770> we're<00:00:07.919> just<00:00:08.040> basically<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.820> all

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
and we're just basically this is all

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.749 
and we're just basically this is all
with<00:00:09.840> your<00:00:09.929> hands<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.380> your<00:00:10.500> fingers<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:10.980> of

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
with your hands and your fingers so of

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.070 
with your hands and your fingers so of
course<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.179> would<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.360> washed<00:00:12.780> your<00:00:12.900> hands

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
course you would have washed your hands

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.289 
course you would have washed your hands
before<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.530> started<00:00:13.920> drop<00:00:14.730> all<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
before we started drop all this in the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.960 
before we started drop all this in the
center<00:00:15.770> just<00:00:16.770> get<00:00:16.920> rid<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.310> any<00:00:17.609> excess

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
center just get rid of the any excess

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.210 
center just get rid of the any excess
and<00:00:18.869> we're<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.230> attacking<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:19.980> our

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and we're just attacking it with our

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.269 
and we're just attacking it with our
fingers<00:00:20.699> they<00:00:21.240> will<00:00:21.420> feel<00:00:21.710> pretty<00:00:22.710> weird<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
fingers they will feel pretty weird and

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.550 
fingers they will feel pretty weird and
nasty<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.269> wet<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.859> begin<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.420> and

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
nasty and wet really to begin with and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.019 
nasty and wet really to begin with and
then<00:00:28.560> we're<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.640> really

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
then we're just going to do this really

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.520 
then we're just going to do this really
just<00:00:31.019> mixing<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.969> throwing<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.059> around<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.750> so

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
just mixing it throwing it around and so

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190 
just mixing it throwing it around and so
gradually<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.399> wetness<00:00:35.760> disappears<00:00:36.540> now

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
gradually the wetness disappears now

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.220 
gradually the wetness disappears now
this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> very<00:00:38.969> wet<00:00:39.360> still<00:00:39.660> at<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.809> moment<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
this is very wet still at the moment and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.650 
this is very wet still at the moment and
we're<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> flour<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.300> remember

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
we're out of flour here but you remember

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.410 
we're out of flour here but you remember
we<00:00:42.750> put<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.170> some<00:00:43.829> pasta<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.430> sorry<00:00:45.180> some

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
we put some some pasta to the sorry some

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.779 
we put some some pasta to the sorry some
flour<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.110> side<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.250> keep<00:00:47.460> throwing

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
flour to the side so we keep throwing

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.569 
flour to the side so we keep throwing
some<00:00:48.059> flour<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> keep<00:00:48.960> keep<00:00:49.829> keep<00:00:50.070> mixing

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
some flour on and keep keep keep mixing

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.209 
some flour on and keep keep keep mixing
this<00:00:50.879> all<00:00:51.059> together<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:52.219> squelching

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
this all together just really squelching

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.029 
this all together just really squelching
it<00:00:53.309> around<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.030> hand<00:00:54.770> if<00:00:55.770> it's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
it around with your hand if it's

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.560 
it around with your hand if it's
sticking<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.610> your<00:00:56.789> hands<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.210> obviously

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
sticking to your hands then obviously

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.590 
sticking to your hands then obviously
it's<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.289> bit<00:00:58.469> too<00:00:58.710> wet<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.309> we'll<00:01:00.059> keep<00:01:00.239> adding

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it's a bit too wet so we'll keep adding

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.770 
it's a bit too wet so we'll keep adding
some<00:01:01.050> extra<00:01:01.800> flour<00:01:04.489> there<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.600> can

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
some extra flour there we go if you can

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.270 
some extra flour there we go if you can
start<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> put<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> ball<00:01:07.830> without<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
start to put it in a ball without it

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250 
start to put it in a ball without it
sticking<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.420> hands<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:09.990> getting

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
sticking to your hands then it's getting

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.620 
sticking to your hands then it's getting
a<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:10.950> bit<00:01:11.070> drier<00:01:11.460> which<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> what

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
a bit a little bit drier which is what

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.480 
a bit a little bit drier which is what
we're<00:01:12.750> looking<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.159> careful<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
we're looking for just be careful you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.880 
we're looking for just be careful you
don't<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:15.420> go<00:01:15.630> overboard<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> flour

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
don't really go overboard on the flour

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.490 
don't really go overboard on the flour
and<00:01:17.220> turn<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> into<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.360> complete<00:01:18.570> dry<00:01:19.259> mess

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
and turn it into a complete dry mess

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.450 
and turn it into a complete dry mess
just<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.070> little<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> time<00:01:22.040> now<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.430> go

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
just a little at a time now here we go

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
just a little at a time now here we go
it's<00:01:23.820> beginning<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> beginning<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.080> stick

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it's beginning to beginning just stick

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.760 
it's beginning to beginning just stick
together<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.770> bit<00:01:26.009> better<00:01:27.229> when<00:01:28.229> you've<00:01:28.350> got<00:01:28.500> it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
together a bit better when you've got it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.039 
together a bit better when you've got it
roughly<00:01:29.220> sticking<00:01:29.700> together<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.420> we

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
roughly sticking together like this we

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
roughly sticking together like this we
can<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:31.320> move<00:01:31.530> into<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.159> folding

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
can really move into the kind of folding

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.440 
can really move into the kind of folding
part<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.829> step<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.909> second

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
part of this the this step this second

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.469 
part of this the this step this second
creating<00:01:37.439> pasta<00:01:37.890> dough<00:01:38.070> step<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.850> as

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
creating pasta dough step which is as

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.050 
creating pasta dough step which is as
you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.310> folding<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.520> half

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you can see it's folding it in half

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.480 
you can see it's folding it in half
you<00:01:42.270> trap<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.750> air<00:01:42.960> inside<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.619> giving<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you trap some air inside there giving it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.960 
you trap some air inside there giving it
an<00:01:44.939> air<00:01:45.090> strong<00:01:45.420> press<00:01:45.780> down<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.790> it's

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
an air strong press down and it's

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
an air strong press down and it's
gradually<00:01:48.299> mixing<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.320> pasta<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
gradually mixing all that pasta and the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.740 
gradually mixing all that pasta and the
flour<00:01:51.170> this<00:01:52.170> step<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.590> want<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:53.750> actually

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
flour this step you want to do actually

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.050 
flour this step you want to do actually
this<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.049> probably<00:01:55.259> take<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.979> would<00:01:56.909> say

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
this will probably take you I would say

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840 
this will probably take you I would say
three<00:01:57.390> five<00:01:57.780> minutes<00:01:58.229> maybe<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:59.610> will<00:01:59.700> get

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
three five minutes maybe it will get

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.880 
three five minutes maybe it will get
harder<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.299> harder<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.990> how<00:02:01.530> does<00:02:01.590> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
harder and harder to do this how does it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.520 
harder and harder to do this how does it
get<00:02:02.070> thicker<00:02:03.020> stuck<00:02:04.020> together<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.619> bowl

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
get thicker stuck together in a bowl

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.469 
get thicker stuck together in a bowl
but<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.580> really<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:06.909> indian<00:02:07.390> pot<00:02:07.659> phase

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
but this is really the indian pot phase

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.710 
but this is really the indian pot phase
so<00:02:10.479> keep<00:02:10.720> keep<00:02:11.080> pressing<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.770> down<00:02:11.800> keep

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
so keep keep pressing it down keep

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.880 
so keep keep pressing it down keep
really<00:02:13.720> folding<00:02:14.110> over<00:02:14.260> look<00:02:14.530> at<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.709> look

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
really folding over look at that look

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.449 
really folding over look at that look
how<00:02:14.920> thick<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.490> just<00:02:16.450> fold<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.870> over

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
how thick it is just fold it over

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.510 
how thick it is just fold it over
wellif<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.550> down<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:19.300> really<00:02:19.510> take<00:02:19.840> out<00:02:20.020> your

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
wellif it down you really take out your

frustrations on this piece of plaster if

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.840 
frustrations on this piece of plaster if
it<00:02:26.260> sticks<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.800> surface<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.400> just<00:02:27.670> grab

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
it sticks to the surface just just grab

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.850 
it sticks to the surface just just grab
a<00:02:27.880> bit<00:02:28.180> more<00:02:28.330> flour<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:29.200> don't<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.770> don't

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
a bit more flour you don't you don't

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.890 
a bit more flour you don't you don't
really<00:02:30.100> want<00:02:30.340> pasta<00:02:31.030> stuck<00:02:31.450> all<00:02:31.569> over<00:02:31.600> your

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
really want pasta stuck all over your

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.199 
really want pasta stuck all over your
surface<00:02:32.319> unless<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.860> have<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.130> get<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> knife

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
surface unless you have to get a knife

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.770 
surface unless you have to get a knife
and<00:02:34.510> take<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.959> off<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.110> have<00:02:35.410> this<00:02:35.560> hard<00:02:36.280> work

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and take it off and have this hard work

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.690 
and take it off and have this hard work
but<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.959> section<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.769> really<00:02:39.519> pretty

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
but this section this is really pretty

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.390 
but this section this is really pretty
easy<00:02:39.820> you're<00:02:40.209> just<00:02:40.390> folding<00:02:40.870> over<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:42.190> over

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
easy you're just folding over and over

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.699 
easy you're just folding over and over
again<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.790> really<00:02:42.970> pack<00:02:43.300> pack<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.290> pasta

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
again to really pack pack this pasta

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.860 
again to really pack pack this pasta
together<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.670> some<00:02:45.850> air<00:02:46.120> in<00:02:46.360> there<00:02:46.390> give<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.780> a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
together get some air in there give it a

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.530 
together get some air in there give it a
nice<00:02:46.989> little<00:02:47.290> bubbles<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.610> that's<00:02:51.850> that's

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
nice little bubbles and that's that's

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.259 
nice little bubbles and that's that's
pretty<00:02:52.810> much<00:02:53.019> it<00:02:53.230> for<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:53.530> second<00:02:53.920> step

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
pretty much it for this second step

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.660 
pretty much it for this second step
we'll<00:02:55.269> just<00:02:55.450> do<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.569> few<00:02:55.840> more<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.080> then<00:02:56.670> we'll

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
we'll just do a few more and then we'll

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.570 
we'll just do a few more and then we'll
cover<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.150> turn<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:58.989> into<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.230> ball<00:02:59.500> shape<00:02:59.580> cover

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
cover it turn it into a ball shape cover

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.540 
cover it turn it into a ball shape cover
it<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.970> flour<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.810> we'll<00:03:02.620> just<00:03:02.950> pull<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.400> to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
it in flour and we'll just pull it to

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.220 
it in flour and we'll just pull it to
one<00:03:03.580> side<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.120> let's<00:03:04.540> try<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.840> get<00:03:04.900> this<00:03:04.989> in<00:03:05.140> a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
one side so let's try and get this in a

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.479 
one side so let's try and get this in a
ball<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:08.709> want<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:08.950> make<00:03:09.069> sure<00:03:09.100> it's<00:03:09.370> not

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
ball you want to make sure it's not

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.330 
ball you want to make sure it's not
completely<00:03:09.970> falling<00:03:10.450> about<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:10.870> can<00:03:11.340> probably

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
completely falling about we can probably

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.820 
completely falling about we can probably
give<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.820> bit<00:03:12.970> more<00:03:13.440> bit<00:03:14.440> more<00:03:14.620> pressing

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.380 

and<00:03:18.830> when<00:03:18.980> its<00:03:19.100> beginning<00:03:19.610> how<00:03:20.030> do<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.210> tell

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
and when its beginning how do you tell

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.560 
and when its beginning how do you tell
when<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:20.630> ready<00:03:21.050> -<00:03:21.290> for<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:21.980> next<00:03:22.100> step

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
when it's ready - for the next step

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.830 
when it's ready - for the next step
you'll<00:03:23.570> begin<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:24.020> see<00:03:24.230> some<00:03:24.910> slight<00:03:25.910> holes<00:03:26.390> in

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
you'll begin to see some slight holes in

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.320 
you'll begin to see some slight holes in
here<00:03:27.260> tiny<00:03:27.830> tiny<00:03:28.220> little<00:03:28.340> air<00:03:28.670> holes<00:03:28.940> looking

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
here tiny tiny little air holes looking

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.350 
here tiny tiny little air holes looking
for<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.810> nice<00:03:30.350> Chex<00:03:30.740> text<00:03:31.310> -<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.430> very<00:03:31.730> very<00:03:31.880> tiny

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
for a nice Chex text - a very very tiny

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.760 
for a nice Chex text - a very very tiny
holes<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:35.510> then<00:03:35.690> we're<00:03:35.840> going<00:03:36.020> to<00:03:36.050> just<00:03:36.560> make

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
holes and then we're going to just make

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.230 
holes and then we're going to just make
it<00:03:36.800> into<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.130> circle<00:03:37.610> after<00:03:37.730> about<00:03:37.940> five

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
it into a circle after about five

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.230 
it into a circle after about five
minutes<00:03:39.130> don't<00:03:40.130> know<00:03:40.250> if<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.459> can<00:03:40.640> see<00:03:40.880> you

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
minutes don't know if you can see you

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.810 
minutes don't know if you can see you
can<00:03:41.390> see<00:03:41.600> just<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:42.080> little<00:03:42.310> dimple<00:03:43.310> II<00:03:43.400> kind<00:03:43.730> of

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.780 
can see just a little dimple II kind of
effect<00:03:44.500> that's<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.620> kind<00:03:45.800> of<00:03:45.920> consistency

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790

effect that's the kind of consistency
we're<00:03:47.030> looking<00:03:47.300> for<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.540> think<00:03:48.910> that's<00:03:49.910> what
