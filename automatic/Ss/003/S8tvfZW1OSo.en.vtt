00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
talking about cracking as I'm to believe

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.110 
talking about cracking as I'm to believe
that<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.920> propane<00:02:41.730> tank<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:44.120> you

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
that that is the propane tank so you

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.180 
that that is the propane tank so you
know<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.660> ain't<00:02:46.110> sure<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:46.829> pretty<00:02:46.860> sure

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
know I ain't sure but I'm pretty sure

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.369 
know I ain't sure but I'm pretty sure
that's<00:02:47.579> what<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.030> actually<00:02:48.660> preferring

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
that's what that's actually preferring

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.130 
that's what that's actually preferring
to<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.920> let's<00:02:50.430> listen<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.060> again<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.599> this
