00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that for that for ages and that was a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.090 
that for that for ages and that was a
crazy<00:00:47.850> bank<00:00:48.300> shot<00:00:48.390> thing<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.140> bank<00:00:50.010> shot

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
crazy bank shot thing there bank shot

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.510 
crazy bank shot thing there bank shot
like<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.430> box<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:53.070> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
like a box so as you can see here you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.619 
like a box so as you can see here you
are<00:00:53.670> not<00:00:53.910> currently<00:00:54.770> hi<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:57.030> gameplay<00:00:57.239> has

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
are not currently hi the gameplay has

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
are not currently hi the gameplay has
been<00:00:57.899> super-speeded<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.340> array<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
been super-speeded because array is a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
been super-speeded because array is a
very<00:01:00.030> big<00:01:00.210> map<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.379> gameplay<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:01.800> slow

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
very big map and the gameplay was slow

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.759 
very big map and the gameplay was slow
so<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.699> super<00:01:03.000> fast<00:01:03.149> mode<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.870> that's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so like super fast mode and that's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.000 
so like super fast mode and that's
exactly<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.549> got<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.299> so

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
exactly what we got going on here so

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.179 
exactly what we got going on here so
this<00:01:08.010> gameplay<00:01:09.049> basically<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.650> analogy<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
this gameplay basically the analogy I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.530 
this gameplay basically the analogy I
gave<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.700> an<00:01:11.790> allergy<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> don't<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
gave it an allergy I don't know the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.960 
gave it an allergy I don't know the
breakdown<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.229> described<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.670> none

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
breakdown I described it with but none

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.539 
breakdown I described it with but none
of<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.090> made<00:01:15.299> any<00:01:15.330> sense<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.740> was

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of that made any sense what it was was

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.710 
of that made any sense what it was was
when<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.759> was<00:01:17.850> live<00:01:18.030> streaming<00:01:18.330> i<00:01:18.420> said<00:01:18.570> this

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
when I was live streaming i said this

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289 
when I was live streaming i said this
myself<00:01:19.259> i'm<00:01:19.530> picking<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> kills<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.180> my

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
myself i'm picking up the kills but my

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.440 
myself i'm picking up the kills but my
accuracy<00:01:21.630> was<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.259> not<00:01:22.439> they're<00:01:22.740> not

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
accuracy was really not they're not

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.670 
accuracy was really not they're not
entirely<00:01:24.450> sure<00:01:24.630> why<00:01:24.990> i'm<00:01:25.229> probably<00:01:25.409> playing

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
entirely sure why i'm probably playing

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.410 
entirely sure why i'm probably playing
on<00:01:25.830> cue<00:01:26.040> higher<00:01:26.220> sensitivity<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.090> i<00:01:27.150> can't<00:01:27.360> be

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
on cue higher sensitivity but i can't be

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.700 
on cue higher sensitivity but i can't be
bothered<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> change<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.350> i'm<00:01:28.530> doing

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
bothered to change it because i'm doing

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.210 
bothered to change it because i'm doing
those<00:01:28.829> trick<00:01:29.130> shot<00:01:29.369> stuff<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.829> yeah<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> kills

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
those trick shot stuff so yeah the kills

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.350 
those trick shot stuff so yeah the kills
were<00:01:32.369> there<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> accuracy<00:01:32.970> wasn't<00:01:33.240> there

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
were there the accuracy wasn't there

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.630 
were there the accuracy wasn't there
that's<00:01:33.540> why<00:01:33.689> always<00:01:33.930> pays<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.130> warlord

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that's why always pays to have warlord

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
that's why always pays to have warlord
pro<00:01:35.759> getting<00:01:36.150> those<00:01:36.240> two<00:01:36.390> tomahawks<00:01:36.829> should

save your life most times so if you're

save your life most times so if you're
looking<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.220> from<00:01:41.640> kind<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.329> breaking

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
looking at this from kind of a breaking

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.719 
looking at this from kind of a breaking
a<00:01:42.750> Down<00:01:42.960> point<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.500> view<00:01:43.770> you'll<00:01:44.310> notice<00:01:44.549> that

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a Down point of view you'll notice that

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.030 
a Down point of view you'll notice that
a<00:01:44.939> lot<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> time<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.810> am<00:01:46.020> flanking<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
a lot of the time I am flanking and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.100 
a lot of the time I am flanking and
that's<00:01:47.460> simply<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:47.850> arrays<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.360> huge<00:01:48.810> map

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
that's simply because arrays a huge map

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.980 
that's simply because arrays a huge map
and<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.610> run<00:01:50.820> straight<00:01:51.299> at<00:01:51.450> them<00:01:51.630> they'll

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and if you run straight at them they'll

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.480 
and if you run straight at them they'll
mow<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.439> down<00:01:52.560> before<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.130> even<00:01:53.220> get

my<00:02:56.610> god<00:02:56.819> WTF<00:02:57.150> BBQ<00:02:57.660> sauce<00:02:58.080> what<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:59.569> that<00:03:00.569> you

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
my god WTF BBQ sauce what so that you

my god WTF BBQ sauce what so that you
always<00:03:00.900> find<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.260> they<00:03:01.350> kind<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.560> take<00:03:01.709> a

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
always find that they kind of take a

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.620 
always find that they kind of take a
curve<00:03:02.069> towards<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.580> end<00:03:02.730> in<00:03:03.030> being<00:03:03.269> much<00:03:03.450> more

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
curve towards the end in being much more

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.229 
curve towards the end in being much more
defensive<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:05.489> makes<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.819> really<00:03:06.060> hard

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
defensive and that makes it really hard

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.500 
defensive and that makes it really hard
to<00:03:06.540> play<00:03:07.110> against<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.549> wasn't<00:03:09.000> having<00:03:09.209> too

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
to play against so I wasn't having too

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.699 
to play against so I wasn't having too
much<00:03:09.660> trouble<00:03:09.900> with<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.170> but<00:03:10.319> my<00:03:10.410> team

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
much trouble with that but my team

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.710 
much trouble with that but my team
really<00:03:11.130> was<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.819> once<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.239> start<00:03:12.480> losing

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
really was and once you start losing

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.600 
really was and once you start losing
those<00:03:13.110> UAVs<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.799> they<00:03:13.980> start<00:03:14.250> getting<00:03:14.519> those

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
those UAVs and they start getting those

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.319 
those UAVs and they start getting those
UAVs<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.060> other<00:03:15.360> killstreaks<00:03:16.070> continuing<00:03:17.070> a

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
decent level is is so so hard that was

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.630 
decent level is is so so hard that was
