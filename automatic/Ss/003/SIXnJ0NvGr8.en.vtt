00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.510
 hello how about friends today 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.230
 learn the basics of how to use the 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.810
 machine 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.510
 today many do not know how 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.290
 this machine works first things first 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:36.410
 at level 10 the mps gives us a test and as 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.870
 reward gives us these ingredients or 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.330
 If you have already passed that level and it does not exist 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.420
 the bucket no problem just go to the 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.820
 npc and in the third option that extends 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.090
 We can buy a variety of 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.090
 articles 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.120
 like a machine today poy portable in case 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.790
 is not close to the npc in the second 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.390
 tab we will have the recipes at the moment 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.880
 we can only buy the level 1 in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.350
 the third repeats a list of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 recipes since we learned the skill 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.970
 we buy a recipe from the first list 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 I recommend only the first one which 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.310
 will be in our inventory they also give 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.000
 the recipe as a reward for the mission 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.900
 above we click on the recipe 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.990
 will disappear and be added 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.960
 automatically to the machine today in case 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.180
 we do not have the fourth tab 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.140
 we will have to go shopping with the mps of 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.140
 the city left 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.500
 not with the one in the cities 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.740
 of each race already being today 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.530
 we talk with snpc and we'll see what we have 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.360
 with a fourth tab, click on amos and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.880
 We will have a great variety of 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.459
 ingredients we will only buy the 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.459
 necessary those who ask us for the recipe 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.400
 we will see all the recipes we buy 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.739
 In the future, the first recipe is the one 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.080
 the mission asks us to see the 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.110
 ingredients at the beginning will be 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.599
 dark if we have the ingredients 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.530
 we look in the inventory we give them a 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.810
 click 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.000
 after clicking on the box it 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.000
 will begin to fill the bar below 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.909
 if we press the space bar in the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.340
 just the moment the result will change and 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.459
 We will have more experience to climb 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.459
 level 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.620
 if those skulls come out it means that 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.620
 we failed the preparation of the food 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.520
 the yang rose one level 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.520
 it's up to level 14 that we can only create 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.970
 food and beverages from level 15 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.370
 we can create weapons if we reach the level 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.810
 15 first we must learn the 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.290
 specific skill 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.630
 and ready in our inventory will appear 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.870
 the food as a result of mixing 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.870
 the ingredients 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.830
 well that's all I hope it serves 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.520
 Of something 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.520
 join the guide 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.810
 see you later
