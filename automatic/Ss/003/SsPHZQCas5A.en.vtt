00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello friends today we will see in this video to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.639
 how to share or transfer the internet 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.530
 from our PC or laptop to our 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.469
 Android device by means of the cable 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.040
 usb whether we have a smartphone or 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.040
 Android tablet 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.050
 good to start this procedure 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 we must have two applications the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.680
 which I will leave in the description of 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.359
 the video under one of these 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.019
 applications will be to run it in the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.220
 pc and the other application will serve to 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.090
 transfer it and install it in our 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.520
 Android mobile device 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.620
 In addition, a fundamental requirement is that 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.120
 our android device is surrounded 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.460
 or have permits to 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.290
 superuser boot 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.969
 If your cell phone 'not taking into account 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.430
 these permissions at this time is going to 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.070
 appear a link to one of our 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.769
 videos where it was previously explained 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.820
 what food and the advantages you have 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.239
 be a food user 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.690
 or else below a link appears 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.450
 where we show you in a video how 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.120
 root any smartphone or tablet 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.040
 Android using a very simple method 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.560
 good then having these requirements 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.130
 we can start with the tutorial 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.079
 then we first download the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.140
 two applications which I will leave in 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.470
 the description of the video 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.350
 when downloading the file that will be 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.140
 compressed 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.140
 we unzip it on our desk 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.960
 bring in our desk 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.410
 which is for this folder 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.300
 in this folder we will find several 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.690
 Elements or multiple files 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.830
 which only two will be of 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.830
 utility for the process 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.950
 then the android thor will be this 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.910
 application to run it on our pc 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.770
 and the service transceiver will be this 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.090
 application to transfer it from our 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.090
 Android mobile device 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.319
 good in my case the application after 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.560
 hÃ©ctor services punto apk i have it 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.150
 transferred on my android phone what 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.659
 which is simply what I should look for 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.659
 install 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.620
 we proceed to install 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.770
 and then in April 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.450
 well then before connecting with 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.450
 the pc by means of the usb cable 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.020
 we must 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.790
 to the yp tablets section so that we 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.290
 make superuser permission the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.900
 request for superuser permissions 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.900
 we must give them in allow 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.959
 Well, there is no message that has been 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.959
 got permission in superuser 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.900
 then like the android tool application 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.900
 is already executed in our pc 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.290
 and the application for android too 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.390
 is executed we have it open 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.230
 we proceed to connect it with the pc by 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.230
 medium with a cd 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.630
 and we do something optional about traffic 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.640
 of data 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.980
 if we want to access all the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.650
 applications like google play 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.920
 or whatsapp those applications that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.330
 they require a connection to the network 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.849
 then we must activate the traffic of 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.459
 data but if we only want to access 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.659
 to internet through a browser 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.489
 then it would not be necessary to activate the 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.500
 Data traffic also takes into account 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.319
 that said that by activating the traffic of 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.600
 data can consume your balance or your 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.370
 data package 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.310
 then if you want to access all the 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.210
 applications would activate is only 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.210
 the data traffic 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.630
 well now on the pc we will click on 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.630
 refresh 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.569
 until a series of code comes out 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.550
 of our android device and below 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:44.520
 we click on 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.790
 ns we will see one that after those 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.530
 codes 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.430
 and then finally we click on 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.430
 connect 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.940
 will appear at the end of all these 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.460
 black letters some blue lines 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.560
 which means that until that moment 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.390
 there is a good connection this would come to 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.760
 be a sign that we would be 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.690
 connected to the internet from our 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.690
 Android device 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.729
 then we can verify in our 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.439
 Android phone that we already have internet 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.439
 we can enter from any browser 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.129
 well that would be all for this video not 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:50.509

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.909
