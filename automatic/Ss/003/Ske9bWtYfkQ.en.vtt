t-rex<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.710> metal<00:04:45.070> charging<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:45.790> every<00:04:46.150> human

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
t-rex is metal charging so every human

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.880 
t-rex is metal charging so every human
will<00:04:46.720> be<00:04:46.900> focused<00:04:47.500> on<00:04:47.620> him<00:04:47.880> see<00:04:49.530> I'm<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.590> little

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
will be focused on him see I'm a little

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.130 
will be focused on him see I'm a little
scrapper<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.490> can<00:04:51.669> shoot<00:04:51.850> me<00:04:51.910> easily<00:04:52.540> but

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140
