00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.230
 very good to all guys welcome 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.450
 once again to the channel we go with one of 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 the following lists in the comments 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.619
 from another 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.390
 let's go with varus good to tell you first 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.850
 that is worth right now is not one of the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.760
 carts that are playing the most because 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.340
 there are others that have more damage or more 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.870
 bours or more good range let's start 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.640
 with the web what we are going to buy 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.980
 just start the game will be 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.720
 a long sword three portions of life 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.250
 and the yellow ratchet and the wii that we 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.160
 we will be this and in the next 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.199
 order is to start with the saber of 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.040
 stagnant waters to have the leaf of the 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:04.190
 King as quickly as possible we will 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.350
 the drops of attack grace and in addition 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.990
 forward the avaricious sword to 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.369
 finish it on the static dagger because 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.680
 we make the avaricious sword first 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.030
 because for every minion that we kill for 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.140
 every kilo we do and for every minute 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.570
 that we have bought it will give us gold 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.780
 we go on the 29 with a bloodthirsty 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 later we will buy the broadsword for 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.790
 finish it on the infinite edge like this 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.060
 our dagger of static the passive that 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.520
 deals 100 points of damage will 250 already 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.130
 defense mode a guardian angel the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.009
 rune that we will use in this to carry 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.560
 They are the basic Cardin to the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.500
 fifth we take one of damage and two of 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.180
 life robbery the reds all of damage and 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.550
 one of critical probability 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.200
 Yellow and blue armor 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.970
 magic resistance can already be for 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.520
 level or flat I personally prefer 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.800
 the silver since now the ap 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.539
 support the mastery that 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.570
 let's use are a 21 90 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.330
 enhancing the damage and the critical you can 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.340
 stop the video and see them as tips 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.470
 I can tell you to always try 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.450
 you can give three basic to an enemy 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.880
 to put the passive and later 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.250
 access a skill about him 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.010
 so you will do the additional damage of the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.110
 passive of the w I have to tell you that the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.170
 cv is the one that you will have to maximize 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.690
 to do much harm either because 'no 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.140
 from far away or in a one against one already 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.480
 What do they do 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.840
 a lot of damage, even if it's not in the range 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.090
 maximum before lasting fight tried 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.880
 to spend with the q since it has a range 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.160
 quite large, although it spends a lot 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.380
