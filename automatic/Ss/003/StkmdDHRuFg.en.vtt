00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
of these lands up really trick is to

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.220 
of these lands up really trick is to
sketch<00:00:40.379> quite<00:00:40.710> quick<00:00:41.010> anywhere<00:00:41.600> in<00:00:42.600> master

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
sketch quite quick anywhere in master

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.729 
sketch quite quick anywhere in master
your<00:00:43.350> joins<00:00:44.539> there<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.750> arm<00:00:45.899> sketching<00:00:46.530> cuz

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
your joins there the arm sketching cuz

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.130 
your joins there the arm sketching cuz
the<00:00:49.739> quicker<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.160> draw<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.300> more<00:00:51.510> ideas<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the quicker you draw the more ideas you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.229 
the quicker you draw the more ideas you
can<00:00:52.320> draw

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.410 

let's<00:01:02.239> try<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:02.570> basic<00:01:04.299> around<00:01:05.299> their<00:01:07.420> data

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
let's try the basic around their data

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.140 
let's try the basic around their data
try<00:01:08.750> vlans<00:01:12.130> obviously<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.400> just<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.790> tie

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
try vlans obviously this is just a tie

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.820 
try vlans obviously this is just a tie
oid<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.810> mean<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:15.050> can<00:01:15.200> clean<00:01:15.409> it<00:01:15.440> up<00:01:15.619> on<00:01:15.740> the

late<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.450> draw<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:55.290> type<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.590> thing<00:02:57.560> as<00:02:58.560> most

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
late to draw this type of thing as most

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.380 
late to draw this type of thing as most
of<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.040> guys<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.520> don't<00:02:59.790> know<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.209> might

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
of you guys and I don't know you might

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.259 
of you guys and I don't know you might
just<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:00.690> looking<00:03:00.959> at<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.350> type<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.620> thing

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
just like looking at that type of thing

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.630 
just like looking at that type of thing
and<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:03.450> there's<00:03:03.690> our<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.989> quick<00:03:04.470> design<00:03:05.310> like

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
and so there's our a quick design like

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.060 
and so there's our a quick design like
lamb<00:03:05.970> whack<00:03:06.269> will<00:03:07.080> probably<00:03:07.440> come<00:03:07.590> back<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.950> it

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
lamb whack will probably come back to it

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.280 
lamb whack will probably come back to it
and<00:03:08.790> probably<00:03:09.000> probably<00:03:09.390> had<00:03:09.570> some<00:03:09.750> darker

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and probably probably had some darker

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.340 
and probably probably had some darker
stuff<00:03:11.220> with<00:03:11.430> my<00:03:11.550> sharpie<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.269> it's<00:03:13.170> like<00:03:13.320> a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
stuff with my sharpie and it's like a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.520 
stuff with my sharpie and it's like a
fan<00:03:13.650> point<00:03:13.950> Makka<00:03:14.220> pen<00:03:14.570> which<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.690> used<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.140> you

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
fan point Makka pen which I used to you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.800
