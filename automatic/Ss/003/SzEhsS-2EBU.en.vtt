00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.849 

okay<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.760> quick<00:00:03.240> little<00:00:04.430> petal<00:00:05.430> still<00:00:05.700> demo<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
okay a quick little petal still demo the

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.680 
okay a quick little petal still demo the
little<00:00:07.859> spaceship<00:00:08.370> rig<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.730> have<00:00:08.910> over<00:00:09.269> here<00:00:09.450> so

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
little spaceship rig I have over here so

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.999 
little spaceship rig I have over here so
right<00:00:09.840> now<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.019> just<00:00:10.080> have<00:00:12.380> so<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.679> no

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
right now I just have so this is no

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.840 
right now I just have so this is no
effects

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.760 

all<00:00:19.850> right<00:00:20.150> first<00:00:20.510> thing<00:00:21.020> it<00:00:21.170> goes<00:00:21.289> into<00:00:21.619> is

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
all right first thing it goes into is

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.400 
all right first thing it goes into is
the<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.400> MuRF<00:00:22.720> which<00:00:23.720> is<00:00:23.900> it's<00:00:24.110> hard<00:00:24.289> to

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
the the MuRF which is it's hard to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.240 
the the MuRF which is it's hard to
explain<00:00:24.650> it's<00:00:24.980> kind<00:00:25.099> of<00:00:25.160> like<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.599> frequency

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
explain it's kind of like a frequency

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.429 
explain it's kind of like a frequency
step<00:00:28.250> thing<00:00:28.669> but<00:00:29.060> if<00:00:29.419> I<00:00:29.540> kick<00:00:29.750> it<00:00:29.869> on<00:00:30.020> what<00:00:30.349> it

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
step thing but if I kick it on what it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.749 
step thing but if I kick it on what it
does<00:00:30.590> it<00:00:30.740> cycles<00:00:31.220> through<00:00:31.279> different

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
does it cycles through different

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.150 
does it cycles through different
frequencies<00:00:32.239> and<00:00:32.900> then<00:00:33.050> changes<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:33.650> here's

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
frequencies and then changes so here's

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.380 
frequencies and then changes so here's
kind<00:00:34.340> of<00:00:34.370> what<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.580> sounds<00:00:34.850> like<00:00:37.330> okay<00:00:38.330> because

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
kind of what it sounds like okay because

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.030 
kind of what it sounds like okay because
if<00:00:38.629> that<00:00:38.720> pulse<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:39.530> could<00:00:39.739> pull<00:00:39.890> different

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
if that pulse I could pull different

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.619 
if that pulse I could pull different
frequencies<00:00:40.580> out<00:00:40.820> it'll<00:00:41.360> sound<00:00:41.449> like<00:00:41.600> a

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
frequencies out it'll sound like a

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:54.939 
frequencies out it'll sound like a
stepper<00:00:51.250> it's<00:00:52.250> kind<00:00:52.460> of<00:00:52.519> fun<00:00:53.019> then<00:00:54.019> goes<00:00:54.650> into

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
stepper it's kind of fun then goes into

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.469 
stepper it's kind of fun then goes into
an<00:00:55.100> earth<00:00:55.370> Drive<00:00:55.760> which<00:00:55.970> is<00:00:56.119> essentially<00:00:56.420> like

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
an earth Drive which is essentially like

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:08.920 
an earth Drive which is essentially like
an<00:00:56.600> overdrive<00:00:57.229> or<00:00:57.500> unit

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.010 

alright<00:01:09.930> Earth<00:01:10.290> Drive<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> goes<00:01:11.460> into

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
alright Earth Drive then it goes into

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.330 
alright Earth Drive then it goes into
pitch<00:01:13.020> shifter<00:01:13.350> delay<00:01:13.590> which<00:01:13.799> kind<00:01:14.009> of<00:01:14.100> gives

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
pitch shifter delay which kind of gives

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:25.270 
pitch shifter delay which kind of gives
us<00:01:14.430> cascade<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.240> organ<00:01:15.659> organ<00:01:16.229> sort<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.590> thing

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.999 

is<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.460> little<00:01:26.670> higher

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
is that little higher

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
is that little higher
overtone<00:01:29.009> when<00:01:30.000> used<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.539> Murph<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.229> mean

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
overtone when used with the Murph I mean

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.130 
overtone when used with the Murph I mean
it<00:01:32.369> can't<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.700> Slyke<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> organ<00:01:33.479> sort<00:01:33.690> of

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.180 

little<00:01:37.140> bit<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.319> shimmer<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:39.229> then<00:01:40.229> goes

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
little bit of shimmer on it then goes

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.570 
little bit of shimmer on it then goes
into<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> tuner<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.539> volume<00:01:42.960> pedal<00:01:43.580> then

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
into the tuner to the volume pedal then

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.070 
into the tuner to the volume pedal then
into<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.350> buffer<00:01:46.550> into<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.580> Flint<00:01:48.090> reverb<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
into a buffer into a Flint reverb so you

00:01:49.080 --> 00:02:00.680 
into a buffer into a Flint reverb so you
can<00:01:49.200> kick<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:55.640> dry<00:01:59.000> has<00:02:00.000> tremolo<00:02:00.539> on

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
can kick that on just dry has tremolo on

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.760 
can kick that on just dry has tremolo on
it<00:02:00.810> too<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.380> tremolo<00:02:06.470> kick<00:02:07.470> them<00:02:07.619> all

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it too if I want tremolo kick them all

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:26.520 
it too if I want tremolo kick them all
together<00:02:14.690> just<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.870> crazy<00:02:16.200> sounds

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.900 

so<00:02:27.530> saris<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> little<00:02:28.129> hard<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.340> play<00:02:28.670> well

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so saris a little hard to play well

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.470 
so saris a little hard to play well
holding<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.390> camera<00:02:29.720> at<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.840> same<00:02:29.989> time<00:02:30.230> but
