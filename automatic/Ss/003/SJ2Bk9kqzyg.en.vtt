give you increase the amplitude a little

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.130

thing<00:04:55.850> I<00:04:55.910> might<00:04:56.060> do<00:04:56.240> is<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.510> scale<00:04:56.750> down<00:04:56.780> the

thing I might do is to scale down the

down 1.3 21.1 across the board that

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.200 
down 1.3 21.1 across the board that
should<00:05:04.039> give<00:05:04.190> me<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.310> nice<00:05:04.460> thin<00:05:04.729> layer<00:05:05.000> to
