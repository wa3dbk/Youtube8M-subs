 figure may seem small on 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.020
 today but thanks to the high 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.970
 quality sensor produces an excellent picture 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.820

 times faster than its predecessor 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.180
 this computational element allowed 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.460
 achieve staggering rate of fire 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.740

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.750

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.980
 baht and here are excerpts long 4 thousandths 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.720
 seconds and it works but it's very quiet 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.150
 so you may not even notice 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.220
 took a picture or not because 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.959
 the camera instantly processes and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.709
 saves photo thanks to powerful 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.140
 the processor 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.900
 screen diagonal where 16 is 3 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.820
 inches with a resolution of 908 2000 points 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.459
 what is a typical indicator for 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.530
 top soapboxes its viewing angles are excellent 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.450
 detailing is high enough but at 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.400
 he really lacks oleophobic 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.200
 cover the optical viewfinder and 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.150
 is an analogue of the peephole 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.520
 which means itâ€™s not particularly convenient 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.260
 different its coverage area is clearly 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.000
 less than 100 percent when shooting 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.920
 against the sun he goes blind and catches the glare 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.510
 so use the viewfinder with 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.910
 I advise only to increase the time 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.800
 battery life camera camera 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.870
 powered by complete battery capacity 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.110
 920 milliamper hours with which you have 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.820
 It will make about 350 shots with 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.700
 using the viewfinder for that number 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.840
 will rise to 600 second in importance 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.470
 component of the camera and is it 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.870
 optics 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.360
 g16 is equipped with a lens covering 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.370
 focal length range from 28 to 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.100
 140 millimeters with changing 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.560
 light power from f-18 to 2 and 8 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.390
 data indicators in 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.400
 wonderful because thanks to them you 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.239
 can shoot not only any landscape or 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.030
 architecture 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.870
 a and portrait at the level of pictures taken 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.430
 professional photographic equipment 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.860
 shooting will be the only problem 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.660
 interiors for which 28 millimeters on 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.370
 the short end is obviously a bit much 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.050
 objectively suffers from optical 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.000
 distortions like distortion or 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.590
 chromatic aberrations but noticeably 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.530
 loses contrast when shooting against the sun 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.150
 and thanks to a scheme consisting of 11 lenses 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.680
 Excellent catch glare that you can 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.750
 use artistic purposes 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.669
 the lens aperture consists of six not 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.620
 rounded petals which contributes 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.240
 getting circles in the tank only when 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.760
 maximum aperture values 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.680
 thanks to the presence of Wi-Fi DPS modules you 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.479
 you can always keep friends in the know 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.940

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.070

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.520
 video shooting in full hd resolution with 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.960
 at 60 frames per second besides 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.910
 the camera possesses and those of all and 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.100
 stabilization due to which shaking hands 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.169
 in no way affect the quality in 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.240
 your videos when shooting without 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.370
 tripod workman is even second 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.050

 canon user soapbox 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.740
 for users of SLR cameras 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.270
 will be a somewhat unusual whole 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.950
 the camera was very, very 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.110
 good as it lets you feel 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.120

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.470
 despite some flaws i can 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.510
 recommend same 16 as a replacement 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.490
 amateur DSLR but only 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.650
 If the photo for you is not more 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.570
 what a hobby it is and for work it is not 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.700
 best choice cost camera on 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.650
 is 550 dollars or four 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.289
 400 thousand hryvnia, which is a bit cheaper 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.120
 competitor in the face of nikon d7000 800 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.240
 which however has a noticeably smaller 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.950
 aperture f4 on the f-28 on the long 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.080
 late full-size photo examples 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.669
 made with this camera as well 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.550

 I can not say for speed 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:26.740
 the interface would n't 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:29.080
 and it works so very quietly so that you 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.379
 may not even notice made a sec or 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.379

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.990
 i will 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:46.849
 In general, the camera turned out very much and 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.409
 very good as it allows 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:51.110
 feel like a real photographer 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:54.229
 not burdening the choice of interchangeable optics and not
