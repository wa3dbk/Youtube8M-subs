00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
the 20 I think the bigger sizes are more

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.919 
the 20 I think the bigger sizes are more
online<00:01:42.130> in<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.850> store<00:01:43.179> they<00:01:43.420> may<00:01:43.539> be<00:01:43.600> getting

online in the store they may be getting

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.719 
online in the store they may be getting
in<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.140> stores<00:01:44.440> starting<00:01:45.039> in<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.310> new<00:01:45.459> year

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.510 
in the stores starting in the new year
I'm<00:01:46.090> not<00:01:46.270> sure<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.560> what<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:47.770> would<00:01:47.890> suggest<00:01:48.100> is

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
I'm not sure but what I would suggest is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.029 
I'm not sure but what I would suggest is
going<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.630> store<00:01:49.929> and<00:01:50.170> trying<00:01:50.649> on<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.920> pair

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
going in a store and trying on a pair

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.960 
going in a store and trying on a pair
and<00:01:51.729> seeing<00:01:52.330> what<00:01:53.319> type<00:01:53.619> that<00:01:53.950> fits<00:01:54.429> your<00:01:54.670> body

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
and seeing what type that fits your body

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.820 
and seeing what type that fits your body
well<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.599> then<00:01:55.810> or<00:01:56.050> online<00:01:56.470> from<00:01:56.679> there

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
well and then or online from there

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.249 
well and then or online from there
because<00:01:57.009> I<00:01:57.069> have<00:01:57.220> a<00:01:57.250> bigger<00:01:57.459> selection<00:01:57.849> I<00:01:58.330> will

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
because I have a bigger selection I will

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.740 
because I have a bigger selection I will
say<00:01:59.590> that<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:02.140> jeans<00:02:02.410> I<00:02:02.619> don't<00:02:02.890> have

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
say that the jeans I don't have

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.029

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.330 
spandex you should go up a size or two
I'm<00:02:41.950> not<00:02:42.220> sure<00:02:42.430> but<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.950> always<00:02:44.950> try<00:02:45.159> to<00:02:45.190> look

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
I'm not sure but I always try to look

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.399 
I'm not sure but I always try to look
for<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.580> ones<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.209> 2%<00:02:46.750> spandex<00:02:47.080> because

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
for the ones like the 2% spandex because

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.960 
for the ones like the 2% spandex because
those<00:02:47.769> fit<00:02:48.069> well<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.640> then<00:02:49.420> also

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
those fit well and then also

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.200 
those fit well and then also
most<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:52.020> June<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.290> how<00:02:52.440> are<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:53.430> skin<00:02:53.820> tight

leggins<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.380> don't<00:02:55.620> think<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.040> see<00:02:56.220> that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430

leggins I don't think you can see that
I'm<00:02:56.910> not<00:02:57.090> sure<00:02:57.240> but<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.230> clips<00:02:58.880> after<00:02:59.880> this

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
I'm not sure but in the clips after this

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.140 
I'm not sure but in the clips after this
segment<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.560> video<00:03:01.710> you<00:03:02.400> actually<00:03:02.790> see<00:03:02.970> me

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
segment of the video you actually see me

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.330 
segment of the video you actually see me
try<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.450> goons<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.650> what<00:03:04.920> they<00:03:05.100> look<00:03:05.310> like

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
try the goons on and what they look like

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.580 
try the goons on and what they look like
but<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.500> would<00:03:07.500> definitely<00:03:07.650> um<00:03:08.810> if<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:10.230> see<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
but I would definitely um if I see the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.380 
but I would definitely um if I see the
jeans<00:03:10.860> on<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.400> website<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.850> would<00:03:12.060> definitely

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
jeans on the website I would definitely

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.210

put<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.630> link<00:03:12.810> below<00:03:12.960> so<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.440> can<00:03:13.530> go<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.860> one

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050
