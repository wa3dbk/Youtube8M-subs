and it won't go away and of course it's
right<00:01:07.759> where<00:01:07.910> I<00:01:07.940> need<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.210> shut<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.509> down<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.020> I

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
right where I need to shut it down so I

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.800 
right where I need to shut it down so I
don't<00:01:09.290> want<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.500> have<00:01:09.619> to<00:01:09.740> hold<00:01:09.890> down<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.369> the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
don't want to have to hold down just the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.300 
don't want to have to hold down just the
power<00:01:11.810> button<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.320> shut<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:12.619> thing<00:01:12.680> down<00:01:12.890> but

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.350 
power button to shut this thing down but
it<00:01:13.399> looks<00:01:13.550> like<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.700> might<00:01:13.940> have<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.119> do<00:01:14.330> it

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
it looks like I might have to do it

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.670 
it looks like I might have to do it
because<00:01:14.509> I<00:01:14.750> don't<00:01:14.899> have<00:01:14.960> access<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.560> this

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.120 

there<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.680> is<00:02:53.770> again<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:56.110> isn't<00:02:56.440> good<00:02:56.620> this

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
there it is again this isn't good this

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.890 
there it is again this isn't good this
is<00:02:57.310> something<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.760> do<00:02:57.880> with<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.120> screen<00:02:58.510> it's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
is something to do with the screen it's

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.840 
is something to do with the screen it's
certainly<00:02:59.230> not<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.680> refreshing<00:03:00.400> thing<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.760> don't

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
certainly not a refreshing thing I don't

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.190 
certainly not a refreshing thing I don't
think<00:03:01.410> because<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.590> pops<00:03:02.800> up<00:03:03.070> even<00:03:03.520> before<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
think because it pops up even before the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.130 
think because it pops up even before the
operating<00:03:05.200> system<00:03:05.700> has<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.760> chance<00:03:07.210> to<00:03:07.450> do

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
operating system has a chance to do

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.500 
operating system has a chance to do
anything<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.120> like<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.330> hardware<00:03:10.750> problem

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
