for some reason i think it looks really
really<00:00:50.300> cool<00:00:50.329> with<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.409> radar<00:00:51.980> shoulder

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
really cool with the radar shoulder

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
pieces the art of the Comets and the

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:55.779 
pieces the art of the Comets and the
boots<00:00:54.710> i<00:00:54.890> think<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.159> looks<00:00:55.309> cool<00:00:55.429> even<00:00:55.640> though

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.069 
boots i think it looks cool even though
i<00:00:55.820> could<00:00:55.999> probably<00:00:56.179> change<00:00:56.449> over<00:00:56.749> to<00:00:56.929> the

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
i could probably change over to the

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.299 
i could probably change over to the
boots<00:00:57.769> for<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.019> iron<00:01:00.019> banner<00:01:00.350> make<00:01:00.859> it<00:01:01.010> give

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
boots for the iron banner make it give

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.099 
boots for the iron banner make it give
it<00:01:01.339> a<00:01:01.429> different<00:01:01.579> look<00:01:01.789> but<00:01:02.149> right<00:01:02.749> now<00:01:02.899> i'm

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
of the the chest reach from the raid and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.290 
of the the chest reach from the raid and
I<00:01:36.860> got<00:01:37.010> this<00:01:37.190> one<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.490> do<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.850> reason<00:01:38.060> I<00:01:38.150> got

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
I got this one I do the reason I got

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.810 
I got this one I do the reason I got
this<00:01:38.360> one<00:01:38.540> over<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.110> other<00:01:39.320> one<00:01:39.550> if<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:40.670> guys

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
this one over the other one if you guys

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.490 
this one over the other one if you guys
notice<00:01:41.150> right<00:01:41.300> here<00:01:41.360> there's<00:01:42.050> two<00:01:42.290> different

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
notice right here there's two different

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.440 
notice right here there's two different
types<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:42.980> once<00:01:43.190> there's<00:01:43.760> one<00:01:43.910> that<00:01:44.060> gives<00:01:44.240> you

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
types of once there's one that gives you

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.950 
types of once there's one that gives you
more<00:01:45.140> additional<00:01:45.680> ammo<00:01:45.920> for<00:01:46.310> your<00:01:46.930> for<00:01:47.930> your

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
more additional ammo for your for your

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.200 
more additional ammo for your for your
assault<00:01:48.560> with<00:01:48.710> an<00:01:48.830> assault<00:01:49.190> rifle<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.940> for

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
assault with an assault rifle and for

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.110 
assault with an assault rifle and for
your<00:01:50.390> pulse<00:01:50.840> rifle<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.590> went<00:01:52.580> with<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.790> shotgun

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
your pulse rifle I went with the shotgun

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.730 
your pulse rifle I went with the shotgun
and<00:01:53.450> scouring<00:01:53.780> for<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:54.080> ones<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:54.440> I<00:01:54.560> went

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
and scouring for the ones that I went

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.230 
and scouring for the ones that I went
with<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.980> shotgun<00:01:55.190> in<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.460> sky<00:01:55.730> rifle<00:01:56.090> is

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
with the shotgun in the sky rifle is

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.780 
with the shotgun in the sky rifle is
because<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.170> could<00:01:57.410> probably<00:01:57.650> pick<00:01:57.920> up<00:01:58.130> some

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
because I could probably pick up some

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.280 
because I could probably pick up some
type<00:01:59.000> of<00:01:59.030> gauntlet<00:01:59.630> or<00:01:59.810> something<00:02:00.170> like<00:02:00.230> that

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
type of gauntlet or something like that

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.280 
type of gauntlet or something like that
it<00:02:00.410> gives<00:02:00.710> me<00:02:00.830> more<00:02:01.010> auto<00:02:01.280> rifle<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.870> could

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
it gives me more auto rifle and I could

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.170 
it gives me more auto rifle and I could
probably<00:02:03.590> go<00:02:04.070> ahead<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.610> keep<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.970> ones

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
probably go ahead and just keep the ones

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.889 
probably go ahead and just keep the ones
I<00:02:05.330> want<00:02:05.630> with<00:02:05.870> my<00:02:06.140> heavy<00:02:06.800> weapons<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.330> went

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
I want with my heavy weapons so I went

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.330 
I want with my heavy weapons so I went
with<00:02:09.019> that<00:02:09.200> one<00:02:09.410> instead<00:02:09.769> of<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.979> other<00:02:10.009> one<00:02:10.220> I

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
with that one instead of the other one I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.979 
with that one instead of the other one I
also<00:02:10.459> want<00:02:10.759> but<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.090> will<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.569> reason<00:02:11.840> was

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
also want but this will the reason was

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.440 
also want but this will the reason was
because<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.560> intellect<00:02:12.890> at<00:02:13.159> 75<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.849> the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
because of the intellect at 75 and the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.510 
because of the intellect at 75 and the
disciplines<00:02:14.959> at<00:02:15.049> 81<00:02:15.499> are<00:02:15.709> you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
disciplines at 81 are you

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.240 
disciplines at 81 are you
I<00:02:16.580> really<00:02:17.210> really<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.750> my<00:02:18.680> intellect<00:02:19.190> that

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
I really really like my intellect that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.130 
I really really like my intellect that
my<00:02:19.430> discipline<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.030> be<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.210> little<00:02:20.630> bit<00:02:20.780> higher

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
my discipline to be a little bit higher

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.320 
my discipline to be a little bit higher
than<00:02:21.470> my<00:02:22.220> strength<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.760> other<00:02:22.910> one<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.120> believe

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
than my strength the other one I believe

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.600 
than my strength the other one I believe
had<00:02:23.630> intellect<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.260> strength<00:02:24.560> only<00:02:25.040> with

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.520 
this one I get intellect and discipline
which<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.830> faster<00:02:28.430> super<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.120> fascinates<00:02:29.990> so
