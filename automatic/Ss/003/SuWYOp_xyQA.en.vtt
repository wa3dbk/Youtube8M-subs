00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.009 
that's basically what happened they just
shut<00:02:19.670> down<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.000> server<00:02:20.209> without<00:02:20.450> letting<00:02:20.930> us

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
shut down the server without letting us

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.009 
shut down the server without letting us
know<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:22.040> leading<00:02:22.220> Oliver<00:02:22.580> files<00:02:22.850> but<00:02:23.720> I

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
know the leading Oliver files but I

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.020 
know the leading Oliver files but I
would<00:02:24.319> we<00:02:24.709> were<00:02:24.830> lucky<00:02:25.010> enough<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.640> made<00:02:26.000> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
would we were lucky enough that I made a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.390 
would we were lucky enough that I made a
backup<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.599> everything<00:02:27.140> yesterday<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
afternoon and Central Europe time and so

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.770 
afternoon and Central Europe time and so
it's<00:02:34.130> been<00:02:34.280> rolled<00:02:34.549> back<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.850> little<00:02:35.239> bit<00:02:35.450> like

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
it's been rolled back a little bit like

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.800 
it's been rolled back a little bit like
ranks<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.500> if<00:02:36.890> you've<00:02:37.220> bought<00:02:37.489> a<00:02:37.519> rank<00:02:37.820> it

ranks and if you've bought a rank it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.349 
ranks and if you've bought a rank it
might<00:02:39.049> have<00:02:39.170> been<00:02:39.260> rolled<00:02:39.560> back<00:02:39.650> if<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.359> if

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
might have been rolled back if you if

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.900 
might have been rolled back if you if
you<00:02:41.570> bought<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:41.989> like<00:02:42.320> after
