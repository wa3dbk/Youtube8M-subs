of scenarios as mention your commitment

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.679 
of scenarios as mention your commitment
so<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.619> could<00:02:03.950> be<00:02:04.130> doing<00:02:04.250> heavy<00:02:04.549> because<00:02:05.420> it's

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
so you could be doing heavy because it's

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.449 
so you could be doing heavy because it's

the suspension also

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.740 
the suspension also
is<00:02:12.349> expensive<00:02:13.069> because<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.610> global<00:02:14.209> system

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
is expensive because it is global system

is expensive because it is global system
so<00:02:15.580> different<00:02:16.580> from<00:02:16.730> your<00:02:16.970> normal<00:02:17.000> core

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569

for the day bag very specific mentioned

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.040 
for the day bag very specific mentioned
to<00:06:09.960> me<00:06:10.110> so<00:06:10.550> simply<00:06:11.550> chuck<00:06:11.820> in<00:06:12.030> a<00:06:12.240> Recaro<00:06:12.720> seat

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.630 
to me so simply chuck in a Recaro seat
and<00:06:13.320> expect<00:06:13.650> an<00:06:13.770> air<00:06:13.920> bag<00:06:14.100> to<00:06:14.250> function

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
and expect an air bag to function

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.850 
and expect an air bag to function
properly<00:06:14.970> as<00:06:15.150> it<00:06:15.300> should

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
properly as it should

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.380 
properly as it should
was<00:06:16.860> not<00:06:17.010> really<00:06:17.250> ideal<00:06:17.460> and<00:06:17.940> therefore<00:06:18.270> they

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
was not really ideal and therefore they

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:25.420 
was not really ideal and therefore they
were<00:06:18.480> not<00:06:18.510> able<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.870> do
