00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.000
 # Please introduce yourself. It is a vegetable of the planning and development group producer. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.490
 I am involved in the development of PS4 version demons this time 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.340
 As what I did in the past 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.720
 Get amped C21 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.000
 Cosmic Break Cosmic Commander 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.630
 Has developed 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.700
 # Please tell us the features of PS4 4 core CPU high performance GPU and specs 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.700
 Is also available online 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 I felt it was quick to do nothing, especially when it came to drawing 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.600
 Draw and compare the same scene as a high-end PC for development 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.500
 PS4 is faster than that, especially also for PS4 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 I feel that there is a difference even in the stage of not being optimized 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.300
 Originally it was with the main part of the game 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.700
 It is designed so that the part of the engine is separated 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.400
 At this time, I worked on porting the engine part to work on PS4 this time 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.000
 It could be ported in about a month, but by porting the engine part 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 Almost without putting your hand into the game code 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 The same content as the PC version now works on PS4 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.800
 Parts that will be different from the PC version in the future 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.200
 It's game pad support or update mechanism 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.720
 I will go into implementation 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.000
 # Please tell me the hard points, as a personal PC online game development 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.100
 As it has been done, development for consumer game consoles was the first experience. 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:11.100
 So if it is the PC version, it's usually the difference between the rules 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.000
 There is a part that is a little different 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 For example, there is a button on the front of the window 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 I think that there are many applications that the letter was written 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 If you do it with the consumer game that is shown on the TV screen 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Depending on the setting of the TV 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.500
 It does not happen that only half can be seen 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.000
 Certainly, even looking back at the game you've played 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.100
 I've never seen a game that has a button on the right 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.959
 I felt that I felt that I was just now 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.870
 On the other hand, the development environment and 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.549
 I have experience, but I don't get stuck 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.959
 I can advance 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.300
 # Please give a word to users 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.000
 It will be a title release for consumer game consoles 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.500
 Although there have been challenges before, and as a result it did not reach release 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.000
 Such a thing is included and it becomes the title of wish. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.100
 I think that I want many users to play by all means
