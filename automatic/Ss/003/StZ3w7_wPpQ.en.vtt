00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
rear speaker enclosures I've always

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.900 
rear speaker enclosures I've always
thought<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.640> 1800<00:02:20.640> Goldwing<00:02:21.090> had<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
thought that the 1800 Goldwing had a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.160 
thought that the 1800 Goldwing had a
weakness<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:25.080> leds<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:25.800> only<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
weakness and the leds you only have the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.330 
weakness and the leds you only have the
saddlebag<00:02:28.459> not<00:02:29.459> LED<00:02:29.940> turn<00:02:30.300> signals<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.560> I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
saddlebag not LED turn signals and I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.880 
saddlebag not LED turn signals and I
didn't<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.940> was<00:02:33.090> enough<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:34.440> can<00:02:34.650> see

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
didn't think that was enough you can see

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.410 
didn't think that was enough you can see
from<00:02:35.130> here<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:36.440> wrap<00:02:37.440> around<00:02:38.239> flexible<00:02:39.239> LED

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.970 
coming up behind me there's no doubt now
with<00:03:10.890> all<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.519> those<00:03:11.850> lights<00:03:12.180> blinking<00:03:12.980> that

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
with all of those lights blinking that

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.140 
with all of those lights blinking that
that<00:03:14.850> I'm<00:03:14.970> about<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.920> make<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.980> turn<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.700> really

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
that I'm about to make a turn I really

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.900 
that I'm about to make a turn I really
think<00:03:18.690> these<00:03:20.150> will<00:03:21.150> help<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.570> safety<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:23.100> our

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
think these will help the safety of our

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.180 
think these will help the safety of our
trike

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
trike

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.320 
trike
all<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.390> these<00:03:27.250> flexible<00:03:28.250> strip<00:03:28.550> LEDs<00:03:29.030> by<00:03:29.270> the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
all of these flexible strip LEDs by the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.520 
all of these flexible strip LEDs by the
way<00:03:29.570> came<00:03:29.900> from<00:03:30.550> radiance<00:03:31.550> comm<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:35.530> we're

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
way came from radiance comm and we're

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.140 
way came from radiance comm and we're
very<00:03:36.560> reasonable<00:03:38.830> this<00:03:39.830> next<00:03:40.490> part<00:03:40.730> frankly

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
very reasonable this next part frankly

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.690 
very reasonable this next part frankly
has<00:03:41.390> nothing<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.110> do<00:03:42.470> with<00:03:42.680> safety<00:03:43.220> it's<00:03:43.400> just

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
has nothing to do with safety it's just

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.920 
has nothing to do with safety it's just
one<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.000> my<00:03:44.620> clean<00:03:45.620> elections<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.630> like<00:03:47.630> him<00:03:47.810> to

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
one of my clean elections to like him to

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.180 
one of my clean elections to like him to
have<00:03:48.940> LEDs<00:03:49.940> on<00:03:50.870> my<00:03:51.620> motorcycles<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:54.800> can<00:03:54.980> see

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
have LEDs on my motorcycles you can see

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.520 
have LEDs on my motorcycles you can see
up<00:03:55.340> under<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.760> back<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.240> trike<00:03:56.570> there's<00:03:57.260> a

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
up under the back of the trike there's a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.980 
up under the back of the trike there's a
there's<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.680> strip<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.460> LEDs<00:04:01.840> under<00:04:02.840> there<00:04:03.020> that

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
there's a strip of LEDs under there that

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.700 
there's a strip of LEDs under there that
are<00:04:05.990> changing<00:04:06.560> color<00:04:07.960> not<00:04:08.960> quite<00:04:09.200> as<00:04:09.350> easy<00:04:09.560> to

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
are changing color not quite as easy to

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.700 
are changing color not quite as easy to
see<00:04:10.070> I've<00:04:10.670> also<00:04:10.820> got<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.210> set<00:04:11.590> under<00:04:12.590> the

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
see I've also got a set under the

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.410 
see I've also got a set under the
floorboards<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:15.340> up<00:04:16.340> inside<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.940> engine<00:04:17.120> and

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
floorboards and up inside the engine and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.699 
floorboards and up inside the engine and
up<00:04:17.570> in<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.810> short<00:04:18.109> grills<00:04:20.230> this<00:04:21.230> is<00:04:21.440> what

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
up in the short grills this is what

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.840 
up in the short grills this is what
radiance<00:04:23.140> calls<00:04:24.140> their<00:04:24.530> chameleons<00:04:25.510> you<00:04:26.510> can

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
radiance calls their chameleons you can

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.110 
radiance calls their chameleons you can
change<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.120> flash<00:04:29.390> rate<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.710> we<00:04:31.550> can<00:04:31.580> make<00:04:31.910> it

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
change the flash rate and we can make it

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.240 
change the flash rate and we can make it
a<00:04:32.390> single<00:04:32.690> color<00:04:33.080> you<00:04:33.320> see<00:04:33.560> now<00:04:33.740> it's<00:04:33.920> got<00:04:34.100> the

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
a single color you see now it's got the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.540 
a single color you see now it's got the
breathing<00:04:35.230> function<00:04:36.230> go<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:38.170> and<00:04:39.460> there's<00:04:40.460> a

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
breathing function go in and there's a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.300 
breathing function go in and there's a
flash<00:04:41.270> strobe<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.140> in<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.590> red<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:43.010> can<00:04:43.160> make

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
flash strobe and in the red you can make

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.280 
flash strobe and in the red you can make
it<00:04:43.460> any<00:04:43.610> one<00:04:43.790> of<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.620> seven<00:04:45.620> colors<00:04:47.290> but

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
it any one of the seven colors but

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.159 
it any one of the seven colors but
anyway<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:49.100> get<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.090> kick<00:04:50.360> out<00:04:50.540> of<00:04:50.570> that

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
anyway you get a kick out of that

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.980 
anyway you get a kick out of that
thanks<00:04:51.740> for<00:04:51.890> looking
