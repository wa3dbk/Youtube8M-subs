00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.920
 when someone was talking about the end of the world 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.560
 we used to lock him up or laugh at him or 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 both things but we never took it in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.910
 serious 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.890
 maybe we should have done it but I'm 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.020
 anticipating it is better to start with the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.019
 beginning with the kidnapping of desmond 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.539
 mails my son this guy did not have 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.879
 ambition or direction and plans for 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.449
 future what I did have was a legacy 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.320
 ancestral a legacy that he chose to deny 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.320
 it almost cost him half 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.590
 was captured and imprisoned those who 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.050
 they took it they thought it could help them 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.440
 to find something 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.200
 the fruit one of the artifacts that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.149
 we call fragments of the edl remains of 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.170
 thousand-year-old technology spread over the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.930
 planet 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.079
 some hidden others all found 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.409
 many dangerous in the hands of a single 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.810
 the same world that had Desmond 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.079
 you know them as industries 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.630
 abstergo us as the Templars 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.000
 the enemy we have fighting against 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.520
 them thousands of years even more if 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.789
 you believe the stories of your origins I 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.179
 I believe them after all I've seen the 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.320
 true that is the beauty and the horror of 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.540
 cheer up 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.310
 an artifact that allows us to enter 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.380
 the lives of our ancestors and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.510
 to live them has the power to change it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.390
 all of showing us history as 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.090
 it really happened until his creation the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.490
 victor where day power and molded 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.700
 the truth we intend to change that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.800
 release bodies and minds but we have 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.479
 our limitations and today the 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.180
 Templars are the ones who lead 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.350
 but it is getting closer to something greater than 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.960
 the murderers and the templars 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.119
 something bigger than all of us and if 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.540
 we did not find a way to stop it in 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.300
 a week will end all 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.540
 for all 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.990
 In the end, everything depends on him 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.030
 ledesma through the animus discovered his 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.340
 origins explored the lives of their 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.100
 ancestors and reveal their secrets 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.140
 after doing that he trained he resorted to 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.880
 another ancestor to get decades of 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.110
 experience in a few days 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.090
 it worked that we think we hope but 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.730
 soon very soon we will know 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.190
 this ominous date looming 21 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.470
 December 2012 we do not know what 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.360
 it will happen only that this is where they want 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.850
 that we are when he arrives 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.880
 they have been guiding us in their own way 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.790
 dislocated and frustrating 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.450
 those voices of the first civilization 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.910
 those who came before 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.850
 a race of precursors of immense power 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.520
 and uncertain motivation 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.890
 they created the fragments of the idea 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.890
 this is where they've taken him 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.830
 we with him is before the entrance of 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.810
 this place lost so much time ago 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.150
 armed with the knowledge of altair and 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.850
 the elx skills in your hand leads 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.370
 the baby fruit and we are at your 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.600
 side ready to support him in everything 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.180
 we can 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.129
 its name is to disassemble 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.129
 and it has brought us to the end
