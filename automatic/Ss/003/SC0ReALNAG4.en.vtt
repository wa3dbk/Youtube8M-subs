also<00:00:26.849> made<00:00:27.060> by<00:00:27.210> LifeStraw<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.050> called

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
also made by LifeStraw but it's called

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.150 
also made by LifeStraw but it's called
the<00:00:28.289> lifestyle<00:00:28.710> family<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.179> more

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
the lifestyle family and it is a more

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.250 
the lifestyle family and it is a more
frequent<00:00:32.160> use<00:00:32.640> type<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.239> filter<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:34.020> has<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
frequent use type of filter it has a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.200 
frequent use type of filter it has a
similar<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:35.130> filter<00:00:35.520> mechanism<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
similar kind of filter mechanism that

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.660 
similar kind of filter mechanism that
the<00:00:36.450> smallest<00:00:37.170> straw<00:00:37.440> does<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.489> lot

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the smallest straw does but it's a lot

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.459 
the smallest straw does but it's a lot
more<00:00:38.820> robust<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.540> filter<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.840> lot<00:00:40.050> more<00:00:40.230> water

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
more robust can filter a lot more water

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.000 
more robust can filter a lot more water
and<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.460> actually<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:42.200> purify<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.559> water<00:00:43.590> or

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and it actually can purify your water or

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.840 
and it actually can purify your water or
filter<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.399> elements<00:00:45.649> biological<00:00:46.850> elements

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
filter out elements biological elements

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
filter out elements biological elements
and<00:00:47.969> different<00:00:48.030> things<00:00:48.360> better<00:00:49.350> than<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and different things better than the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.350 
and different things better than the
smaller<00:00:50.370> life<00:00:50.640> straw<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.780> thing<00:00:52.020> can

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
smaller life straw can so this thing can

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.080 
smaller life straw can so this thing can
actually<00:00:54.360> filter<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.520> 18,000<00:00:56.520> liters<00:00:56.789> so

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
actually filter about 18,000 liters so

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.459 
actually filter about 18,000 liters so
that's<00:00:57.270> about<00:00:57.390> four<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.840> half<00:00:57.870> thousand

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that's about four and a half thousand

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.250 
that's about four and a half thousand
gallons<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> few<00:01:00.840> years<00:01:01.109> on

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
gallons so you can go for a few years on

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
gallons so you can go for a few years on
this<00:01:01.520> with<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> family<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:02.940> four<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.390> five

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
this with a family of four or five

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.649 
this with a family of four or five
pretty<00:01:04.500> easily<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.129> today<00:01:06.000> we're<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.420> gonna

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
pretty easily so today we're just gonna

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.149 
pretty easily so today we're just gonna
do<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> demo<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> show<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.560> how<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:07.950> thing

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
do a demo and show you how this thing

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.100 
do a demo and show you how this thing
works<00:01:08.400> I'm<00:01:09.150> showing<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.420> how<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.810> filter

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
works I'm showing you how it can filter

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.929 
works I'm showing you how it can filter
out<00:01:10.229> some<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.650> murky<00:01:11.220> water<00:01:11.430> I'm<00:01:11.729> using

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
out some really murky water I'm using

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.300 
out some really murky water I'm using
the<00:01:12.090> same<00:01:12.270> water<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.600> actually<00:01:13.049> used<00:01:13.310> in

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the same water that actually used in

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.969 
the same water that actually used in
testing<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.909> life<00:01:15.509> straw<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.380> basically

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
testing this life straw but basically

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.820 
testing this life straw but basically
it's<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.460> some<00:01:18.140> pond<00:01:19.140> water<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> have

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it's just some pond water that I have

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.010 
it's just some pond water that I have
nearby<00:01:20.220> that's<00:01:20.400> pretty<00:01:20.729> murky<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.299> dirty<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
nearby that's pretty murky and dirty and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.070 
nearby that's pretty murky and dirty and
the<00:01:22.950> way<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.430> functions<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.720> put

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the way that this functions is you put

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.640 
the way that this functions is you put
it<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.700> 2-liter<00:01:27.240> bucket<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:27.900> or

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it in this little 2-liter bucket here or

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.940 
it in this little 2-liter bucket here or
container<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.270> since<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.079> dirty

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
container that you know since the dirty

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.160 
container that you know since the dirty
water<00:01:32.159> down<00:01:32.460> into<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> filter<00:01:33.180> mechanism<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
water down into the filter mechanism and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.710 
water down into the filter mechanism and
it<00:01:34.380> filters<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:36.150> waste<00:01:36.329> water<00:01:36.509> will

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it filters it out the waste water will

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.359 
it filters it out the waste water will
come<00:01:36.869> out<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.009> filtered<00:01:38.340> water

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
come out here and the filtered water

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.030 
come out here and the filtered water
you'll<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> drink<00:01:39.270> out<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.659> okay<00:01:40.320> so

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you'll want to drink out here okay so

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
you'll want to drink out here okay so
and<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> top<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:44.540> container<00:01:45.540> here

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and in the top of this container here

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.240 
and in the top of this container here
there's<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> little<00:01:46.259> pre-filter<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.100> about

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
there's a little pre-filter it's about

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
there's a little pre-filter it's about
one<00:01:47.520> micron<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.119> size<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.930> get

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
one micron in size and it's just to get

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.480 
one micron in size and it's just to get
out<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> bigger<00:01:49.470> nasties<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.100> leaf

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
out the bigger nasties like leaf

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.080 
out the bigger nasties like leaf
sediments<00:01:51.229> sand<00:01:52.229> mud<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.399> sort<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.670> thing

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
sediments sand mud that sort of thing

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.170 
sediments sand mud that sort of thing
so<00:01:54.630> you're<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:55.610> prematurely<00:01:56.610> killing<00:01:57.060> your

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
so you're not prematurely killing your

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.560 
so you're not prematurely killing your
filter<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.320> suppose<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.219> lost<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.299> or

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
filter and I suppose if you lost this or

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.910 
filter and I suppose if you lost this or
broke<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.049> could<00:02:01.170> use<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.350> t-shirt<00:02:01.619> or

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
broke this you could use a t-shirt or

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.069 
broke this you could use a t-shirt or
something<00:02:02.070> similar<00:02:02.579> but<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.630> let's<00:02:03.810> give<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
something similar but so let's give it a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.520 
something similar but so let's give it a
try<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.040> gonna<00:02:05.159> take<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.579> thing

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
try so I'm just gonna take this thing

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.760 
try so I'm just gonna take this thing
dump<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.430> the<00:02:08.550> top<00:02:08.760> here<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.410> see<00:02:10.740> all

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
dump it in the top here you can see all

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.120 
dump it in the top here you can see all
the<00:02:11.040> sand<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> light<00:02:11.850> there<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.920> mud<00:02:13.920> and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
the sand and the light there and mud and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.530 
the sand and the light there and mud and
stuff<00:02:14.310> going<00:02:14.610> through<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.210> typically

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
stuff going through and they typically

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.600 
stuff going through and they typically
say<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.140> wait<00:02:22.290> about<00:02:22.410> five<00:02:22.800> minutes<00:02:23.040> so

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
say just to wait about five minutes so

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.780 
say just to wait about five minutes so
I'm<00:02:23.700> gonna<00:02:23.850> do<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.240> come<00:02:24.420> back<00:02:25.790> alright

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
I'm gonna do that and come back alright

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.520 
I'm gonna do that and come back alright
so<00:02:26.940> we're<00:02:27.090> back<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.960> might<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.230> noticed

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
so we're back you might have noticed

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.870 
so we're back you might have noticed
here<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.010> little<00:02:29.340> puddle<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.730> water

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
here the little puddle of water

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.810 
here the little puddle of water
basically<00:02:30.780> what<00:02:30.930> they<00:02:31.020> do<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.430> they<00:02:32.430> recommend

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
basically what they do is they recommend

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.090 
basically what they do is they recommend
before<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.210> start<00:02:33.480> drinking<00:02:33.960> out<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
before you start drinking out of the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.550 
before you start drinking out of the
spout<00:02:35.370> or<00:02:35.550> collecting<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:37.020> potable<00:02:37.440> water

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
spout or collecting the potable water

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.580 
spout or collecting the potable water
out<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.160> blue<00:02:38.340> spout<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.380> bleed<00:02:40.380> a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
out of this blue spout that you bleed a

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.280 
out of this blue spout that you bleed a
little<00:02:40.830> bit<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> waste<00:02:41.490> water<00:02:41.640> out<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
little bit of the waste water out and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.910 
little bit of the waste water out and
let<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> run<00:02:43.770> for<00:02:43.950> about<00:02:44.010> 10<00:02:44.310> seconds<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.970> then

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
let it run for about 10 seconds and then

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.680 
let it run for about 10 seconds and then
you<00:02:46.920> open<00:02:47.250> up<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.490> spout<00:02:47.820> which<00:02:48.060> lets<00:02:48.330> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
you open up this spout which lets the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.350 
you open up this spout which lets the
the<00:02:49.290> potable<00:02:49.710> water<00:02:49.740> out<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.340> let's<00:02:51.000> give<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.270> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
the potable water out so let's give it a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.070 
the potable water out so let's give it a
try<00:02:51.600> we'll<00:02:52.350> see<00:02:53.250> how<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.490> tastes<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.030> see<00:02:54.990> it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
try we'll see how it tastes and see it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:03.180 
try we'll see how it tastes and see it
starting<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.470> come<00:02:55.590> out

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.450 

so<00:03:03.700> it's<00:03:04.270> not<00:03:04.420> supposed<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.690> be<00:03:04.840> really<00:03:05.140> fast

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
so it's not supposed to be really fast

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.310 
so it's not supposed to be really fast
like<00:03:06.460> a<00:03:06.520> lot<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.030> filters<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.690> filter

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
like a lot of the filters that filter

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.770 
like a lot of the filters that filter
slowly<00:03:10.140> but<00:03:11.280> what<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.520> good<00:03:13.240> about<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:13.720> that

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
slowly but what is good about it is that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.520 
slowly but what is good about it is that
you<00:03:13.990> can<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:14.350> put<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:14.830> into<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:16.530> collecting

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
you can just put this into a collecting

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.680 
you can just put this into a collecting
container<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.760> drink<00:03:18.970> your<00:03:19.150> water<00:03:19.330> from

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
container that you drink your water from

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.650 
container that you drink your water from
so<00:03:20.230> they<00:03:21.220> don't<00:03:21.370> recommend<00:03:21.730> this<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.330> try<00:03:22.600> to

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
so they don't recommend this you try to

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.660 
so they don't recommend this you try to
use<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.050> like<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.350> water<00:03:23.980> tap<00:03:24.310> from<00:03:24.550> your

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
use this like a water tap from your

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.710 
use this like a water tap from your
house<00:03:24.960> but<00:03:25.960> that<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:27.160> put<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:28.030> little

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
house but that it you put a this little

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.900 
house but that it you put a this little
blue<00:03:28.870> spout<00:03:29.200> or<00:03:29.380> two<00:03:29.560> into<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> bigger

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
blue spout or two into a bigger

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.580 
blue spout or two into a bigger
collecting<00:03:31.450> container<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.110> just<00:03:32.170> let<00:03:32.470> it

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
collecting container and just let it

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.190 
collecting container and just let it
filter<00:03:32.800> through<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:34.150> people<00:03:34.840> let<00:03:35.110> it

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
filter through that so people let it

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.630 
filter through that so people let it
collect<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.530> little<00:03:35.770> bit<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.070> water<00:03:36.250> here

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
collect a little bit of the water here

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.310 
collect a little bit of the water here
and<00:03:37.360> I'm<00:03:37.570> gonna<00:03:37.720> give<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:37.960> a<00:03:38.050> try<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:41.050> we<00:03:41.170> can

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
and I'm gonna give it a try so we can

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.690 
and I'm gonna give it a try so we can
see<00:03:41.440> here<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.890> water<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.190> very<00:03:42.250> clear

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
see here that the water is very clear

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.000 
see here that the water is very clear
compared<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:44.440> dirty<00:03:44.650> water<00:03:44.890> that

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
compared to the dirty water that

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.820 
compared to the dirty water that
originally<00:03:45.460> went<00:03:45.640> into<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.450> again<00:03:47.020> just

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
originally went into it and again just

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.280 
originally went into it and again just
to<00:03:48.010> stress<00:03:48.280> clarity<00:03:48.850> is<00:03:48.970> not<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.750> good

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
to stress clarity is not a good

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.950 
to stress clarity is not a good
indication<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:51.280> purity<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.630> only<00:03:52.780> real<00:03:52.930> way

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
indication of purity the only real way

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.110 
indication of purity the only real way
to<00:03:53.170> test<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:53.800> is<00:03:53.860> either<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.550> drink<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:54.940> and

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
to test this is either to drink it and

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.990 
to test this is either to drink it and
and<00:03:56.040> check<00:03:57.040> in<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.220> couple<00:03:57.490> weeks<00:03:57.610> make<00:03:57.850> sure

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
and check in a couple weeks make sure
