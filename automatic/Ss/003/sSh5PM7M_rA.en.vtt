00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.840 
would go with a higher end computer
maybe<00:02:23.220> an<00:02:23.430> imac<00:02:23.820> quad<00:02:24.750> core<00:02:25.020> or<00:02:25.290> mac<00:02:26.100> pro<00:02:26.460> 8

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
maybe an imac quad core or mac pro 8

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.080 
maybe an imac quad core or mac pro 8
core<00:02:27.270> because<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.470> game<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.650> very<00:02:29.090> intensive

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
core because this game is very intensive

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.630 
core because this game is very intensive
as<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.350> see<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.800> pretty<00:02:32.130> laggy<00:02:32.370> now

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
as you can see it is pretty laggy now

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.860 
as you can see it is pretty laggy now
I'm<00:02:32.760> trying<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.090> move<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.330> around<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.780> it's

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
I'm trying to move it around and it's

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.490 
I'm trying to move it around and it's
going<00:02:34.050> really<00:02:34.290> slow<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.760> um<00:02:36.170> yeah<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.350> was

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
going really slow but um yeah this was

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.710 
going really slow but um yeah this was
just<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.800> demonstration<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:38.760> macbook<00:02:39.450> pro

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
just a demonstration of my macbook pro

3.0<00:02:40.020> 6<00:02:40.710> 2<00:02:40.800> gigahertz<00:02:42.710> gaming<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:44.300> don't<00:02:45.300> have

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
3.0 6 2 gigahertz gaming I don't have

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.180 
3.0 6 2 gigahertz gaming I don't have
that<00:02:45.660> many<00:02:45.780> games<00:02:46.080> but<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.800> only<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.160> I

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
that many games but this is only one I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.500 
that many games but this is only one I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
decided to show you that it is pretty

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.450 
decided to show you that it is pretty
intensive<00:02:48.990> with<00:02:49.110> all<00:02:49.230> these<00:02:49.380> graphics<00:02:50.220> going

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
intensive with all these graphics going

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.340 
intensive with all these graphics going
over<00:02:50.610> all<00:02:51.390> these<00:02:51.630> houses<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.170> stuff<00:02:53.510> um<00:02:54.510> i'll

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
over all these houses and stuff um i'll

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.480 
over all these houses and stuff um i'll
go<00:02:55.500> ahead<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.709> show<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.040> guys<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:58.800> i<00:02:59.040> were<00:02:59.250> to

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
go ahead and show you guys if i were to

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.850 
go ahead and show you guys if i were to
turn<00:02:59.700> up<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.690> rendering<00:03:01.140> options<00:03:01.290> all<00:03:01.709> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
turn up the rendering options all the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.840 
turn up the rendering options all the
way<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:06.440> number<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.560> objects<00:03:08.070> will<00:03:08.310> toten<00:03:08.610> up<00:03:08.730> to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
way a number of objects will toten up to

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.290 
way a number of objects will toten up to
totally<00:03:09.360> insane<00:03:09.900> would<00:03:10.640> all<00:03:11.640> right<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:11.970> as<00:03:12.000> we

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
totally insane would all right so as we

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.860 
totally insane would all right so as we
crash<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:13.110> will<00:03:13.350> start<00:03:13.620> up<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.920> new<00:03:13.950> thing<00:03:14.870> and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
crash we will start up a new thing and

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.900 
crash we will start up a new thing and
right<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.709> as<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.040> guys<00:03:17.190> can<00:03:17.370> tell<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:17.730> is

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
right there as you guys can tell this is

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.870 
right there as you guys can tell this is
having<00:03:18.209> trouble<00:03:18.480> already<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.800> is<00:03:20.220> gone<00:03:20.430> really

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
having trouble already it is gone really

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
having trouble already it is gone really
slow<00:03:21.390> I'm<00:03:21.420> trying<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.959> move<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.260> around<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:24.150> as

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
slow I'm trying to move it around and as

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.990 
slow I'm trying to move it around and as
you<00:03:25.050> can<00:03:25.200> see<00:03:25.230> it's<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.980> can't<00:03:26.340> handle<00:03:26.610> all

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
you can see it's it can't handle all

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.110 
you can see it's it can't handle all
those<00:03:27.209> textures<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.230> objects<00:03:28.739> I'm<00:03:29.610> trying<00:03:29.970> to

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
those textures and objects I'm trying to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.140 
those textures and objects I'm trying to
simply<00:03:30.690> turn<00:03:30.959> my<00:03:31.489> i'm<00:03:32.489> using<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.880> arrow<00:03:33.030> keys

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
simply turn my i'm using the arrow keys

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.720 
simply turn my i'm using the arrow keys
here<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.780> try<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.500> look<00:03:34.680> around<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.190> thing

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
here to try and look around the thing

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.940 
here to try and look around the thing
but<00:03:36.030> it's<00:03:36.180> not<00:03:36.360> working<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:37.320> if<00:03:37.470> i<00:03:37.620> did<00:03:37.680> like

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
but it's not working but if i did like

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.340 
but it's not working but if i did like
this<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.880> runs<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.300> lot<00:03:39.450> smoother<00:03:39.780> because<00:03:39.959> all

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
this it runs a lot smoother because all

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.520 
this it runs a lot smoother because all
it's<00:03:40.560> rendering<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.390> runway<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:43.410> as

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
it's rendering is the the runway but as

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.860 
it's rendering is the the runway but as
i<00:03:43.650> get<00:03:43.800> to<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.040> objects<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.610> goes<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.180> much<00:03:45.239> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
i get to the objects it goes so much the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.170 
i get to the objects it goes so much the
frames<00:03:46.140> per<00:03:46.350> second<00:03:46.830> just<00:03:47.040> dip<00:03:47.370> down<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.440> I

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
frames per second just dip down and I

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.670 
frames per second just dip down and I
can't<00:03:51.180> handle<00:03:51.360> totally<00:03:51.870> insane<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.470> can

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
can't handle totally insane but it can

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.940 
can't handle totally insane but it can
handle<00:03:52.980> tons<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:54.030> objects<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:55.380> guys<00:03:55.590> if<00:03:55.800> you're

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
handle tons of objects so guys if you're

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.640 
handle tons of objects so guys if you're
interested<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.610> this<00:03:56.760> computer<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:58.500> go

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
interested in this computer you can go

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.229 
interested in this computer you can go
ahead<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:58.890> get<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.190> if<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.370> want<00:03:59.550> but<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.970> would
