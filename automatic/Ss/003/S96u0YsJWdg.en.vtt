when<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:05.910> was<00:00:06.120> driving<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:06.870> one<00:00:07.610> 92.6<00:00:08.610> I

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
when I was driving this one 92.6 I

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.990 
when I was driving this one 92.6 I
noticed<00:00:09.150> there<00:00:09.330> was<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> lot<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.929> play<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
noticed there was a lot of play in the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.549 
noticed there was a lot of play in the
shifter<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.599> could<00:00:12.809> actually<00:00:12.990> hear<00:00:13.469> it

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
shifter you could actually hear it

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.620 
shifter you could actually hear it
rattle<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.250> when<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.549> try<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.820> shift<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.480> you

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
rattle and when you try to shift it you

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.779 
rattle and when you try to shift it you
know<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.929> would<00:00:16.109> or<00:00:16.529> just<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.010> know<00:00:17.070> half-inch

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
know it would or just you know half-inch

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.960 
know it would or just you know half-inch
of<00:00:17.910> play<00:00:18.320> moving<00:00:19.320> between<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.800> gears<00:00:20.070> now<00:00:20.670> for

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
of play moving between the gears now for

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.150 
of play moving between the gears now for
my<00:00:21.119> experience<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> problem<00:00:23.070> is

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
my experience I know what the problem is

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.939 
my experience I know what the problem is
it's<00:00:23.430> those<00:00:23.609> classic<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.350> nylon

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
it's those classic you know nylon

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.550 
it's those classic you know nylon
plastic<00:00:26.279> shift<00:00:26.880> bushings<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:28.080> wear<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
plastic shift bushings that wear and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
plastic shift bushings that wear and
just<00:00:28.680> fall<00:00:28.920> out<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.789> linkage<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.330> just

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
just fall out so your linkage is just

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.930 
just fall out so your linkage is just
rattling<00:00:31.109> around<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.679> metal<00:00:32.009> hole<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.550> this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
rattling around in a metal hole and this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.819 
rattling around in a metal hole and this
can<00:00:33.210> actually<00:00:33.239> be<00:00:33.660> quite<00:00:33.960> dangerous<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.590> have

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
can actually be quite dangerous I have

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.250 
can actually be quite dangerous I have
actually<00:00:35.309> seen<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.579> car<00:00:35.880> come<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.809> park<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
actually seen a car come out of park and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
actually seen a car come out of park and
roll<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> hill<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.010> run<00:00:38.340> into<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> tree

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
roll down a hill and run into a tree

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.260 
roll down a hill and run into a tree
because<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.260> shift<00:00:40.590> bushings<00:00:41.190> were<00:00:41.760> totally

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
because the shift bushings were totally

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.130 
because the shift bushings were totally
shot<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.340> 201<00:00:45.120> owner<00:00:45.329> though<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
shot so as a 201 owner though if you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.720 
shot so as a 201 owner though if you
have<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> replace<00:00:46.620> shift<00:00:47.190> bushings<00:00:47.610> you're

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
have to replace shift bushings you're

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.220 
have to replace shift bushings you're
going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.300> challenge<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.930> your<00:00:49.079> hand

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
going to have a challenge on your hand

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.939 
going to have a challenge on your hand
particularly<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> 190e<00:00:52.050> 2.6

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
particularly if you have the 190e 2.6

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.150 
particularly if you have the 190e 2.6
you<00:00:53.370> hardly<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.180> any<00:00:54.449> room<00:00:54.690> at<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.890> work

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you hardly have any room at all to work

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.760 
you hardly have any room at all to work
between<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.270> side<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> transmission<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
between the side of the transmission and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.689 
between the side of the transmission and
the<00:00:59.550> tow<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.960> body<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.520> I've<00:01:02.670> learned

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the tow in the body so what I've learned

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.100 
the tow in the body so what I've learned
over<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> years<00:01:03.510> working<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.930> these

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
over the years working on these

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.260 
over the years working on these
particular<00:01:04.320> jassi's<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.700> best<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.150> just

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
particular jassi's is it's best to just

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.440 
particular jassi's is it's best to just
drop<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.650> transmission<00:01:08.369> down<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.909> it's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
drop the transmission down I know it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.870 
drop the transmission down I know it's
more<00:01:09.990> work<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.890> tell<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.520> you're<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.820> to

more work but I tell you you're going to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.570 
more work but I tell you you're going to
have<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.420> hard<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:13.010> replacing<00:01:14.010> the

a difficult time turning over with the
starter<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.710> replace<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.280> switch

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
starter you have to replace the switch

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.390 
starter you have to replace the switch
you<00:01:29.820> also<00:01:30.030> need<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.750> drop<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.740> transmission

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
you also need to drop the transmission

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
you also need to drop the transmission
down<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.420> need<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
down and what you need to do that is you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
down and what you need to do that is you
need<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> fan<00:01:36.570> shroud<00:01:36.810> off

and<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.189> allow<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.610> engine<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.270> come<00:01:54.540> down

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and just allow the engine to come down

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
and just allow the engine to come down
be<00:01:54.899> sure<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.259> support<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> exhaust<00:01:55.920> but

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
be sure and support the exhaust but

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
be sure and support the exhaust but
allow<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> engine<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.960> come<00:01:58.290> down<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.009> this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
allow the engine to come down to this

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.850 
allow the engine to come down to this
point<00:01:59.549> right<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:01.590> there's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
point right here so you can see there's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.130 
point right here so you can see there's
the<00:02:02.100> lever<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:03.060> even<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:04.020> looking

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the lever but even then you're looking

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.530 
the lever but even then you're looking
up<00:02:04.409> up<00:02:04.619> up<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.090> bushing

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
up up up in there to get to that bushing

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.930 
up up up in there to get to that bushing
and<00:02:06.770> there's<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.099> neutral<00:02:08.399> safety<00:02:08.550> switch

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and there's the neutral safety switch

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.660 
and there's the neutral safety switch
which<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.599> now<00:02:09.840> would<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.319> access<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:11.099> so

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
which you now would have access to so

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.120 
which you now would have access to so
this<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.569> little<00:02:12.810> tip<00:02:13.050> for<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
this is just a little tip for you to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.400 
this is just a little tip for you to
owners<00:02:14.490> if<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.300> have<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.600> work<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.020> side

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
owners if you have to work on that side

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.080 
owners if you have to work on that side
of<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> transmission<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.250> replace<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
of the transmission to replace you of

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.390 
of the transmission to replace you of
those<00:02:18.210> two<00:02:18.420> parts<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.770> way<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.040> do<00:02:20.250> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
those two parts this is the way to do it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.250 
those two parts this is the way to do it
now<00:02:20.820> we're<00:02:21.270> not<00:02:21.390> done<00:02:21.630> yet<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:22.020> still<00:02:22.110> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
now we're not done yet it's still a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.020 
now we're not done yet it's still a
challenge<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.980> get<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.280> bushing<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:23.970> out

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
challenge to get that bushing in and out

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
so tight up in there that I really can't

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.780 
so tight up in there that I really can't
even<00:02:33.660> film<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.710> so<00:02:35.370> I've<00:02:35.490> got<00:02:35.670> the

here's the lever and here's the shift
rod<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.220> look<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:41.520> happens<00:02:42.000> when<00:02:42.240> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
rod and look what happens when the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.420 
rod and look what happens when the
bushing<00:02:43.260> disintegrates<00:02:43.860> you've<00:02:44.070> got<00:02:44.250> this

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
bushing disintegrates you've got this

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.210 
bushing disintegrates you've got this
much<00:02:44.700> play<00:02:45.000> that's<00:02:45.270> why<00:02:45.480> you'll<00:02:45.720> feel<00:02:45.990> slop<00:02:46.890> in

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
much play that's why you'll feel slop in

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.800 
much play that's why you'll feel slop in
the<00:02:47.310> shifter<00:02:47.820> when<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.120> shift<00:02:48.390> you'll<00:02:48.630> also

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
the shifter when you shift you'll also

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.380 
the shifter when you shift you'll also
hear<00:02:49.490> rattling<00:02:50.490> down<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:50.970> while<00:02:51.180> you're

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
hear rattling down there while you're

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.600 
hear rattling down there while you're
driving<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:53.520> bushing<00:02:54.420> looks<00:02:54.630> like<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.610> this

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
driving the bushing looks like this this

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.750 
driving the bushing looks like this this
this<00:02:57.030> bushing<00:02:57.330> here<00:02:57.660> was<00:02:57.870> used<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:59.610> know

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
this bushing here was used on you know

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.600 
this bushing here was used on you know
Mercedes<00:03:00.150> from<00:03:00.660> back<00:03:01.320> in<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.530> 60s<00:03:02.130> right<00:03:02.190> up

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
Mercedes from back in the 60s right up

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.200 
Mercedes from back in the 60s right up
into<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.060> 2000<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:05.070> one<00:03:05.370> Universal

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
into the 2000 so this is one Universal

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.600 
into the 2000 so this is one Universal
part<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> Mercedes<00:03:07.260> Benz<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.580> a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
part on a Mercedes Benz and it is a

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.050 
part on a Mercedes Benz and it is a
universal<00:03:09.390> failure<00:03:09.750> due<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.620> age<00:03:10.770> okay<00:03:11.760> this

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
universal failure due to age okay this

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.210 
universal failure due to age okay this
is<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.510> failure<00:03:12.870> due<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.320> age<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.800> these<00:03:13.980> cars

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
is a failure due to age and these cars

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.300 
is a failure due to age and these cars
are<00:03:14.430> getting<00:03:14.670> older<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.930> challenge<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.830> to

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
are getting older so the challenge is to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.850 
are getting older so the challenge is to
be<00:03:18.150> able<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.450> get<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:19.140> know<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.650> see<00:03:19.830> how

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
be able to get you know you can see how

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.890 
be able to get you know you can see how
tight<00:03:20.010> this<00:03:20.520> fits<00:03:20.880> on<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.330> rod<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
tight this fits on the rod but the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.350 
tight this fits on the rod but the
challenge<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.500> really<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:23.550> get<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.940> into<00:03:24.270> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
challenge is really to get it into the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
hole on that shift lever and we've come

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.010 
hole on that shift lever and we've come
up<00:03:28.860> with<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.100> special<00:03:29.340> tool<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:30.180> will<00:03:30.600> do<00:03:30.810> that

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
up with a special tool that will do that

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.230 
up with a special tool that will do that
first<00:03:31.350> I'll<00:03:31.680> show<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.070> how<00:03:32.370> we<00:03:32.430> do<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.790> right

here and then we'll go up and try to get

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.820 
here and then we'll go up and try to get
a<00:03:35.820> couple<00:03:36.180> shots<00:03:36.210> how<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.690> tool<00:03:37.020> fits<00:03:37.410> up<00:03:37.650> in

a couple shots how the tool fits up in

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.880 
a couple shots how the tool fits up in
there<00:03:38.040> alongside<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.330> transmission<00:03:40.290> to

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
there alongside the transmission to

bushing
right<00:06:42.279> out<00:06:42.809> now<00:06:43.809> what<00:06:44.020> could<00:06:44.199> be<00:06:44.349> slicker<00:06:44.680> than

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 
right out now what could be slicker than

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.479 
right out now what could be slicker than
that<00:06:45.009> it's<00:06:45.249> a<00:06:45.430> multi-purpose<00:06:46.150> tool
