00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
idea

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.890 
idea
notion<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.879> could<00:02:12.090> create<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.420> hundred

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
notion that you could create a hundred

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.800 
notion that you could create a hundred
acres<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.470> usable<00:02:13.650> land<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.580> keep<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.540> port

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
acres of usable land and keep the port

acres of usable land and keep the port
functions<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.650> those<00:02:16.860> jobs<00:02:17.190> intact<00:02:17.640> it's

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
functions and all those jobs intact it's

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.449 
functions and all those jobs intact it's
a<00:02:18.269> very<00:02:18.870> interesting<00:02:19.019> idea<00:02:19.650> but<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.190> lot<00:02:20.430> of

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
a very interesting idea but a lot of

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.100 
a very interesting idea but a lot of
things<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:20.940> happen<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.510> voters<00:02:21.810> have<00:02:21.989> to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
things have to happen the voters have to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.900 
things have to happen the voters have to
vote<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.830> Port<00:02:23.129> Commission<00:02:23.310> has<00:02:23.730> to

vote for it the Port Commission has to

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.790 
vote for it the Port Commission has to
agree<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:25.019> things<00:02:25.319> have<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.650> move

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
agree and then things have to move

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.199 
agree and then things have to move
forward<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.190> if<00:02:26.310> all<00:02:26.489> those<00:02:26.730> things<00:02:27.030> happen

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
forward but if all those things happen

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.180 
forward but if all those things happen
we<00:02:27.480> take<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> hard<00:02:28.019> look<00:02:28.170> at<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.440> absolutely<00:02:28.950> but

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
we take a hard look at it absolutely but

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.490 
we take a hard look at it absolutely but
that's<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> realm<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.500> theoretical

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500

time and money on a project that's not
going<00:03:30.090> anywhere<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:31.049> would<00:03:31.590> guess<00:03:31.859> that

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
going anywhere so I would guess that

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.589 
going anywhere so I would guess that
we're<00:03:32.340> closer<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.940> end<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.389> process

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
then we are to the beginning six years

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.059 
then we are to the beginning six years
into<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.510> when<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:36.870> end<00:03:37.109> is<00:03:37.349> I<00:03:37.680> can't

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
into it but when that end is I can't

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.920 
into it but when that end is I can't
tell<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.519> i<00:03:38.549> hope<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.940> end<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.329> we<00:03:39.540> find<00:03:39.810> a
