00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 
is by standing and it will be a long

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.380 
is by standing and it will be a long
thing<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.100> I'm<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.430> separate<00:00:05.879> them<00:00:06.180> in

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
thing so I'm going to separate them in

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.560 
thing so I'm going to separate them in
three<00:00:06.750> parts<00:00:07.049> it's<00:00:07.799> um<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.429> tutorial<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.450> my

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
three parts it's um the tutorial for my

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.430 
three parts it's um the tutorial for my
legacy<00:00:10.219> but<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.360> torn<00:00:12.360> apart<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.960> made<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> new

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
legacy but I torn apart and made a new

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.740 
legacy but I torn apart and made a new
safe<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:15.109> so<00:00:16.109> yeah<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:17.279> I'm<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.600> show

safe and so yeah so I'm going to show

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.390 
safe and so yeah so I'm going to show
you<00:00:18.810> how<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> make<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.350> old<00:00:19.529> safe<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.160> still

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
you how to make the old safe I still

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.240 
you how to make the old safe I still
have<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> blueprints<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> make<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:22.980> what

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
have the blueprints to make it so what

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.660 
have the blueprints to make it so what
you<00:00:23.369> first<00:00:23.730> want<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:25.789> um<00:00:26.789> get<00:00:28.670> the

you first want to do is um get the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.729 
you first want to do is um get the
bottom<00:00:30.029> piece<00:00:31.369> okay<00:00:33.170> it<00:00:34.170> has<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.710> least

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
bottom piece okay it has to be at least

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.160 
bottom piece okay it has to be at least
one<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.309> those<00:00:35.430> green<00:00:35.700> pieces<00:00:36.000> okay<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
one of those green pieces okay which I

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
one of those green pieces okay which I
don't<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:39.079> yeah<00:00:40.079> I'll<00:00:40.890> go<00:00:41.670> find<00:00:41.910> one<00:00:50.000> okay

don't have so yeah I'll go find one okay

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.400 
don't have so yeah I'll go find one okay
take<00:00:51.780> these<00:00:52.350> pieces<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.600> get<00:00:54.600> four<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.110> them

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
take these pieces and get four of them

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400 
take these pieces and get four of them
and<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:55.829> form<00:00:56.129> together<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.940> then<00:00:57.289> put<00:00:58.289> them

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and then form together and then put them

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.299 
and then form together and then put them
in<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.180> now<00:01:00.180> I'm<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> show<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.230> how<00:01:01.680> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in and now I'm going to show you how it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:10.929 
in and now I'm going to show you how it
worked<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:09.380> these<00:01:10.380> kind<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.680> pieces

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
worked so you get these kind of pieces

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:21.460 
worked so you get these kind of pieces
um<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> put<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.950> knob<00:01:17.600> get<00:01:18.600> three<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.049> them

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.249 

one<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:23.299> on<00:01:25.040> here<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.780> I'm

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
one of them on here you know what I'm

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.069 
one of them on here you know what I'm
going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> show<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.970> but<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> other<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.049> oh

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
going to show you but the other like oh

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.410 
going to show you but the other like oh
say<00:01:31.290> what<00:01:31.439> still<00:01:31.710> works<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> same<00:01:32.100> way<00:01:32.420> since

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
say what still works the same way since

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.539 
say what still works the same way since
that<00:01:33.600> I'll<00:01:33.810> turn<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.060> um

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
that I'll turn it a little so this is um

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.550 
that I'll turn it a little so this is um
so<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.329> he's<00:01:42.750> my<00:01:42.990> channel<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.860> um

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
so as you can see he's my channel and um

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.990 
so as you can see he's my channel and um
he<00:01:46.560> said<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> make<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> tutorial

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
he said and make a tutorial

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.380 
he said and make a tutorial
and<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.810> now<00:01:51.640> I'll<00:01:52.640> let<00:01:52.850> them<00:01:52.910> make<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.060> tutorial

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
and so now I'll let them make a tutorial

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.020 
and so now I'll let them make a tutorial
for<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:53.840> one<00:01:54.340> um<00:01:55.600> better<00:01:56.600> now<00:01:57.550> I'm<00:01:58.550> sorry<00:01:58.880> I

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
for this one um better now I'm sorry I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.210 
for this one um better now I'm sorry I
couldn't<00:01:59.330> make<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.540> tutorial<00:01:59.990> for<00:02:00.290> my<00:02:00.620> old<00:02:00.920> safe

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
couldn't make a tutorial for my old safe

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.160 
couldn't make a tutorial for my old safe
but<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:02.000> one's<00:02:02.240> much<00:02:02.570> better<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:05.020> here's<00:02:06.020> the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
but this one's much better so here's the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.120 
but this one's much better so here's the
mechanism<00:02:06.800> um<00:02:08.350> I'm<00:02:09.350> gonna<00:02:09.560> show<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:09.740> it<00:02:10.039> in

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
mechanism um I'm gonna show you it in

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.730 
mechanism um I'm gonna show you it in
full<00:02:10.399> detail<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.150> know<00:02:11.390> how<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.630> build<00:02:11.870> it

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.340 

so<00:02:15.740> as<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.070> can<00:02:16.220> see<00:02:16.520> um<00:02:16.850> we<00:02:17.450> need<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:18.050> one's

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
so as you can see um we need this one's

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.199 
so as you can see um we need this one's
on<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:21.020> one<00:02:21.560> piece<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.720> middle<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:25.209> piece

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
on a one piece in the middle that piece

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.760 
on a one piece in the middle that piece
but<00:02:26.570> except<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.200> has<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.470> plus<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.290> so

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
but except it has a plus on it so and so

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.270 
but except it has a plus on it so and so
this<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.130> how<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.430> looks<00:02:31.459> like<00:02:31.760> what's<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.120> lot

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
this is how it looks like what's a lot

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.540 
this is how it looks like what's a lot
so<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.970> cig<00:02:35.180> mechanism<00:02:35.780> as<00:02:35.930> my<00:02:36.110> old<00:02:36.320> one

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
so this is a cig mechanism as my old one

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.090 
so this is a cig mechanism as my old one
except<00:02:37.550> when<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.150> pull<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.690> down<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.890> was<00:02:40.070> a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
except when you pull it down this was a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.710 
except when you pull it down this was a
little<00:02:40.459> longer<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.209> one<00:02:41.390> was<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.570> little

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
little longer this one was a little

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.530 
little longer this one was a little
longer<00:02:42.140> let<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.250> put<00:02:43.459> them<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.880> if<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.360> saw

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
longer let it put them and if you saw

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.260 
longer let it put them and if you saw
the<00:02:44.600> other<00:02:44.900> video<00:02:45.320> there<00:02:45.590> was<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.739> slope<00:02:46.310> that's

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
the other video there was a slope that's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.470 
the other video there was a slope that's
how<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.750> pushed<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.500> out<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:51.970> there<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.000> have

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
how it pushed it out so there you have

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.630 
how it pushed it out so there you have
to<00:02:53.720> put<00:02:53.959> these<00:02:54.350> two<00:02:54.650> hands<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.370> have<00:02:55.489> to

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
to put these two hands and you have to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
to put these two hands and you have to
put<00:02:55.850> these<00:02:56.060> um<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:56.989> put<00:02:57.769> three<00:02:58.190> because<00:02:59.150> i<00:02:59.420> am

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
put these um I put three because i am

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.850 
put these um I put three because i am

kept i shorten these pieces out I didn't

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.190 
kept i shorten these pieces out I didn't
have<00:03:07.340> room<00:03:07.580> for<00:03:07.880> since<00:03:08.299> I<00:03:08.480> made<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.780> more

compact<00:03:10.450> but<00:03:12.070> that's<00:03:13.070> how<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.340> got<00:03:13.459> locked<00:03:13.910> and

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
compact but that's how it got locked and

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.440 
compact but that's how it got locked and
when<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.080> pushed<00:03:15.410> it<00:03:15.769> pushed<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.519> so<00:03:17.180> what

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
when it pushed it pushed of it so what

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.620 
when it pushed it pushed of it so what
you<00:03:17.600> want<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.989> do<00:03:18.170> first<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.860> um<00:03:19.459> get<00:03:20.269> those

you want to do first is um get those

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.410 
you want to do first is um get those
pieces<00:03:21.290> then<00:03:22.220> I'm<00:03:22.670> get<00:03:23.060> one<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.450> those<00:03:23.600> circle

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
pieces then I'm get one of those circle

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.720 
pieces then I'm get one of those circle
the<00:03:26.420> circle<00:03:26.660> one<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:29.209> one<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:30.040> one<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:31.459> this

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
the circle one the one the one in this

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.819 
the circle one the one the one in this

this<00:03:42.650> one<00:03:43.070> was<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.790> piece<00:03:44.090> from<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.870> different

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
this one was a piece from a different

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.009 
this one was a piece from a different
Lego<00:03:45.470> set<00:03:45.890> it's<00:03:46.730> not<00:03:46.880> Lego<00:03:47.180> it's<00:03:47.450> like<00:03:47.750> Mega

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
Lego set it's not Lego it's like Mega

of these and two of those those ones or
ones<00:04:30.130> of<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.490> pluses<00:04:30.759> two<00:04:31.360> pluses<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:33.570> and

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
ones of the pluses two pluses and and

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.320 
ones of the pluses two pluses and and
two<00:04:35.620> dots<00:04:35.910> so<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.300> then<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:38.970> this<00:04:39.970> one<00:04:40.180> must

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
two dots so and then it this one must

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.589 
two dots so and then it this one must
longer<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:41.050> if<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.560> pull<00:04:41.949> it<00:04:42.070> down<00:04:42.280> then<00:04:43.270> it

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
longer so if you pull it down then it

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.170 
longer so if you pull it down then it
then<00:04:44.289> there<00:04:44.530> was<00:04:44.560> a<00:04:44.680> slope<00:04:45.039> and<00:04:45.250> then<00:04:45.400> it<00:04:45.940> just

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
then there was a slope and then it just

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.659 
then there was a slope and then it just
pops<00:04:46.479> up<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:48.810> then<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.080> rest<00:04:50.289> you<00:04:50.919> put<00:04:51.280> a<00:04:51.310> knob

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
pops up so then the rest you put a knob

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.680 
pops up so then the rest you put a knob
right<00:04:51.940> there<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.780> then<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:54.520> walk<00:04:55.240> right<00:04:55.419> there

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
right there and then a walk right there

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.010 
right there and then a walk right there
i<00:04:56.139> shorten<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:56.949> one<00:04:57.220> out<00:04:57.599> because<00:04:58.599> whenever

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
i shorten this one out because whenever

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.750 
i shorten this one out because whenever
I<00:04:59.199> said<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.710> was<00:04:59.909> bigger<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:02.740> just<00:05:02.949> and<00:05:03.280> then

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
I said it was bigger it just and then

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.719 
I said it was bigger it just and then
I'll<00:05:04.000> side<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.419> this<00:05:04.539> door<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.889> old<00:05:06.220> door<00:05:06.490> used

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
I'll side of this door the old door used

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.420 
I'll side of this door the old door used
to<00:05:06.820> be<00:05:06.909> over<00:05:07.150> here<00:05:07.539> but<00:05:08.199> it<00:05:08.740> still<00:05:09.039> has<00:05:09.250> the

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
to be over here but it still has the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.820 
to be over here but it still has the
same<00:05:09.580> mechanism<00:05:10.120> so<00:05:10.720> all<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.110> have<00:05:11.289> to<00:05:11.409> do<00:05:11.620> now

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
same mechanism so all you have to do now

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.719 
same mechanism so all you have to do now
is<00:05:11.860> cover<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.610> up<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:13.060> for<00:05:13.539> the<00:05:13.630> tray<00:05:13.930> um<00:05:14.729> get

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
is cover it up and for the tray um get

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.060 
is cover it up and for the tray um get
one<00:05:15.909> of<00:05:16.000> these<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.539> then<00:05:17.260> get<00:05:17.620> one<00:05:17.650> of<00:05:17.919> those

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
one of these and then get one of those

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.570 
one of these and then get one of those
slope<00:05:18.550> pieces<00:05:19.060> I<00:05:20.099> don't<00:05:21.099> have<00:05:21.190> one<00:05:21.370> right<00:05:21.430> now

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
slope pieces I don't have one right now

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.629 
slope pieces I don't have one right now
so<00:05:22.530> put<00:05:23.530> a<00:05:23.560> slope<00:05:23.770> piece<00:05:23.979> right<00:05:24.159> there<00:05:24.190> and

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
so put a slope piece right there and

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.469 
so put a slope piece right there and
then<00:05:24.760> get<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.810> four<00:05:26.680> by<00:05:26.830> ones<00:05:27.120> put<00:05:28.120> one<00:05:28.330> right

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
then get the four by ones put one right

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.120 
then get the four by ones put one right
here<00:05:28.750> put<00:05:29.050> one<00:05:29.229> over<00:05:29.259> here<00:05:29.919> okay<00:05:31.440> um<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:32.949> also

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
here put one over here okay um you also

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.529
