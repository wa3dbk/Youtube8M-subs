00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.359
 the ex mens are one of my groups 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.250
 superhero favorites just me 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.960
 I love the characters I like them a lot 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.599
 the stories but I know them since 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.490
 I was a kid and I saw his series really 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.260
 love and price michael bendis is a 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.449
 writer that I think is a good writer 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.760
 I read many comics that he wrote about 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.750
 Avengers and the comics he wrote 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.670
 of spiderman and I think it's good 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.010
 but obviously he does not know anything about the 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.970
 x-men to make them aware that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.310
 those who do not know 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.030
 the original x-men were the angel 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.050
 cyclops beast the ice man and without 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.510
 serious 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.850
 obviously together with professor javier 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.470
 and brian michael bendis had the idea of 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 make a comic in which the five 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.090
 original members of the x-men are 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.640
 transported in time by beast and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.470
 now they are in the present and they have to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.380
 deal with the world that is now 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.810
 They are as they were in the past 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.810
 idea is not bad in fact I like the 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.000
 problem is that being someone who read 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.140
 the original comics of the x-men that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.450
 they left decades ago 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.220
 I'm related to the characters 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.900
 I'm related to what the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.270
 characters at that time and it was images 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.470
 with 20 and he was trying 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.259
 represent the characters as is 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.030
 as they were in the past as it as it was 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.400
 that are supposed 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.510
 from the time where I take it out brahÃ­m 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.510
 alcobendas failed miserably 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.330
 the ice man is the youngest member 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.070
 of the team and he basically 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.050
 and what he is most interested in is having fun 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.870
 he is interested in games and is the most 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.740
 irresponsible but in any case it is a 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.890
 good guy and he's brave and he hit him there 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.140
 worse and what I think is that the reason 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.220
 why he hit them with man 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.630
 of ice is because the ice man is a 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.670
 character that did not change much in the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.130
 years society still in the current comics 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.320
 when he is already a veteran the x-men that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.210
 it's still his personality so 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.830
 I think that's why he was not wrong because 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.200
 it's basically impossible to be wrong if 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.310
 you are related to comics 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.370
 current 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.910
 beast beast is a genius is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.880
 extremely sarcastic and always 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.560
 love to use a very vocabulary 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.010
 extensive and references literary works 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.830
 in that more or less he did 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.560
 the character does not feel different but 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.370
 at least he did not get away so much but hey 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.550
 with angel and without serious and cyclops is where 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.930
 he walked away terribly 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:52.800
 cyclops in the original comics is a 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.720
 young man who is very intelligent 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.040
 he is the leader of the segments he is 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.880
 extremely loyal to professor javier and 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.880
 he is very withdrawn because his power 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.160
 it becomes a threat up to all 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.140
 who has around him he knows that 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.930
 accident could kill any of 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.330
 your peers to anyone and that 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.220
 the distances the rest that makes 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.460
 cyclops that turns cyclops a 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.230
 lonely but anyway in the 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.990
 battlefield or in any other 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.780
 situation he can become dominant he 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:31.230
 it is not insecure in fact the character is 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.510
 so interesting precisely that's why it's 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.890
 his power and the fact that he does not want 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.870
 hurt someone 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.000
 he does not take away from anyone what he does 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.680
 that feels bad to the role of people who 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.530
 you want to get away obviously it was 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.360
 overcoming this 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.640
 to a certain extent with the passage of 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.250
 years but in this one because he's barely in 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.000
 his first years that curious powers 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.000
 this does not affect much 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.130
 not only that no moment is made 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.020
 mention of the cyclops be afraid of 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.020
 hurt people especially after 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.350
 learn that in the future he killed the 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.010
 Professor Javier, but I do believe that 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.480
 I showed him too insecure and up 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.460
 almost submissive is seen in certain 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.320
 situations which goes with us 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.320
 character 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:20.340
 definitely not without serious without serious 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.230
 she is a very intelligent woman is very 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.590
 kindly cares for his companions 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.970
 and she is insecure in fact she is already in love 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.030
 of cyclops but never be encouraged to say it 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.270
 and she doubts and cyclops feels the same 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.970
 for her 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.800
 in this gingrey comic is basically a 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.870
 bitch she mistreats people and abuses 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.330
 of his power in fact he came to control 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.760
 mentally to angel to force him to 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.170
 do something that I did not want and talking about 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.030
 that at that time she only had 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.370
 telekinesis and it was after much 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.620
 while the trained teacher who 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.330
 developed his telepathy the fact that 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.460
 simply develop your telepathy the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.200
 Nothing completely violates what we do 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.200
 of the character and angel 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:10.030
 angel originally he was always a 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:13.680
 angel is literally a millionaire 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:17.050
 extremely attractive with wings ok 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.699
 the guy was always extremely 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.740
 arrogant he is very very aggressive although 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.029
 He is not a bad person but he has a 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.219
 aggressive personality and is 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:28.900
 extremely arrogant and it is also 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.400
 very dominant which I many times 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.409
 have conflicts with cyclops and others 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.090
 members of the group more than anything with the 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:38.590
 boss no 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.870
 in fact angel before belonging to the 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.400
 x-men or that doctor x-men when 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.790
 I was a teenager but before I was 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.650
 with the x-men he was already a vigilante 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.840
 be a watchman on your own that 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.479
 fought against armed criminals while 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.910
 on the ground and left its symbols 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:59.520
 in fact it reminds me a little bit of batman in 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.190
 one in a panel that showed angel and 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.360
 Angel shows him here as a coward 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:09.870
 to which there is no problem in 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.930
 master it and basically it's normal that 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.639
 be mistreated I do not like what 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.110
 more bothered me is that when he agreed to 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:21.330
 hers the future and saw that he lost his wings 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.830
 he got to not only rible something happened to me 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.860
 horrible let's get out of here let's get out of here 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.139
 not the true angel would have never 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.090
 scared and there would be reaction like that 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.830
 what the true angel would have done 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.199
 he would have said what shit happened that 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.880
 use what happened and I want to grab the guy 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.780
 who did this to me that would have been his 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.159
 reaction 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.930
 It would have put us like crazy and 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:42.479
 being afraid and asking everyone to 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:46.080
 help him get them out of trouble 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:48.030
 that was grotesque angel is despite being 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.940
 a weaker member of the x-men and of 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.169
 what more did not hurt in their adventures 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.840
 one of those who first went to the 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.780
 attack and he was never afraid and is 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.430
 probably the most experienced and what 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.960
 they did so 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.300
 what do you want the comics of 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.040
 brian michael bendis are not bad this 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.920
 it is not a criticism to him as a writer 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.960
 but I just have to have to 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.150
 say it he does not know anything about the 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.060
 excellent and is not representing the 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.130
 characters how are they really are 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.020
 as they were in the comics if you want to do 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.060
 others are the characters that I make another 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.490
 version of the characters but not 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.710
 say that they are the same characters 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.900
 a few decades ago only that posts in the 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.700
 this because clearly they are not are 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.060
 very very different 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.060
 regards
