00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it into salt and that will stop the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.600 
it into salt and that will stop the
process<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.110> rotting<00:00:43.500> process<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:44.280> so

process the the rotting process there so
when<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> mix<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.750> salt<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.140> there<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.850> I'll

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
when a mix that salt in there and I'll

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.660 
when a mix that salt in there and I'll
use<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.200> tail<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.860> fur<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> tail

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
use this this tail and fur on the tail

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.840 
use this this tail and fur on the tail
it's<00:00:50.879> very<00:00:51.180> soft<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:52.829> very<00:00:53.219> very<00:00:53.520> soft
