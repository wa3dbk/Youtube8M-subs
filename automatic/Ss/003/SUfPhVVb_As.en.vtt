00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 No 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.730
 It was finally done 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:15.800
 Day is suddenly but everyone 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.090
 Do you shoot videos on ipad 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.900
 I'm taking but ipad 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:31.220
 Tara back of the camera this is ipad Datoshi 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:35.790
 If you do not take in this side liquid crystal on the opposite side of the camera you do not cleanly taken its place here 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:42.060
 If you can take it with a beautiful person , you can take quite beautifully because it is absolutely necessary here 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:47.310
 What I wanted to use is that what I take, because of course I will take pictures like this 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:51.120
 I can not see the screen, I wonder if it is in focus if I can not see here on this side 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:55.780
 I can not confirm that I thought there 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:01.780
 Fixedly room fixed to ipad tripod somehow 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:08.170
 If you can not shoot a movie while checking 2 screens 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.290
 The other day that way that famous Mr. Yasushi Seto 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.290
 Ah 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:23.770
 Kon'nichiwaa that of the gorilla pod here Koji Seto is in the opposite direction to the tripod of a single-lens reflex 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:30.130
 Slam the ipad where you're doing me there Nowa there I hang Yao school 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.500
 A self-portrait by forcibly ipad so gripped Toko in 5 tablespoons second camera and Rutteyuu 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.580
 Video 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.440
 Was uploaded but I saw this at 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.460
 Ah 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.510
 shower 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:47.930
 The mon was not seen a person for a I thought was honest such a thing as 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:49.010
 But I thought that the way to fix the ipad using that gorilla pod is pretty good 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.840
 but 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:58.070
 Just that 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.700
 I was thinking in various ways that I could do something good in my way 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.750
 like this 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:08.000
 What kind of state is the LCD screen because it is taken with ipad 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.250
 I wanted to shoot while checking what kind of status the focus was on 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.860
 There are various results 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.050
 Something like this 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:22.250
 We introduce Mr. Seto who finished 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.250
 It looks like it was completed today 15 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.560
 If it was this, I think it would be a bit messy and it would be hard to see, so let's get close to each part 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:35.780
 I would like to explain 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.870
 Yes, I see the state of removing the now-eye pad is 15 group 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.020
 I have an ipad here but here 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:47.920
 Smart Cover Triangular fold to make the ipad stand up first 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.480
 And setting dust-free and the setting was ipad 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.720
 I this 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.840
 Something near what what was unlucky to what's Kke 7 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.680
 Another gorilla pod battermon like 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.350
 I was lucky enough to give it to my head 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.700
 Extra attached tripod 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:12.640
 Fix the screw and attach the ipad here 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.480
 Yes Ai pad mounting Mashi was slightly here 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.680
 That's right ぇ 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.819
 I'm anxious 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.650
 Yes i am anxious too 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:29.480
 It feels like it will definitely fall if you shake it and this 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.689
 First of all, whether you are framed in with this mirror or not 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.069
 It is a mirror for confirming what this camera says 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:39.569
 Here are stuck 9th 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:45.300
 So you can easily remove it if you take off the pot here 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:50.910
 I have not adjusted the angle for a while now but if I move here 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:55.470
 The angle of view of the camera and how to see this mirror 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:01.450
 It was quite close, so it appears on the LCD screen as it appears here . 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:04.620
 It was an unexpected lucky discovery and then some code comes out of ipad 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.620
 As we follow this 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.520
 In this way doing the snapping this that there is a microphone in such a place, for example, in such a place 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.500
 Fix it 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.220
 What while taking a selfie 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:27.260
 Sound picks up so near 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:31.030
 Please let me have a look at the mirror installed here. 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.030
 I will try this a little 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:41.160
 How my face is reflected This is a mirror to check from the left This is now reflected 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.740
 Is the LCD screen 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:51.360
 ipad of and bicycle shop Aja bicycle here is is this is a 100 yen shop 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.930
 Flexible bend at the corner bicycle accessories corner 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:00.900
 Originally attached to the bicycle 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:05.240
 Mira of the head I found this and this does not come to a tripod like this 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:09.070
 Processed has Tsuke and I will not now or in the screw 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.880
 And bring me good 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:18.280
 Right side color your own LCD screen 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:21.040
 You can check the condition of the film, and this little girl's tiny mirror looks like this 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.740
 I'll bite a screw here 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.960
 This is- 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.969
 Thank you 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.119
 Since this is also written in blue, Google etc. 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:37.139
 I 'm going to a good angle and last 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:37.139
 Here is the scene This mirror is this mirror 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.360
 Until i come 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:50.139
 This It is a room mirror that has been used 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:53.349
 I'm not using it now, I've put on that dust and I've put it on for a while, and this is just sandwiching 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:06:00.460
 Only sandwich on the tripod of the body in the only back 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:06:03.350
 Just this mirror This biggest and potentially useful mirror This is not really useful 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.840
 What is important is this and this 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.550
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.970
 And this is 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:14.420
 It looks quite properly when viewed with the naked eye a little but I know array that's this I camera over 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.420
 Screen is 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.200
 Feel the microphone too 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:32.200
 Now while checking your position with ipad while checking the focus 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:40.350
 Moreover, you can shoot using the out camera 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:40.350
 The sound can also be taken in batches. The name of this tripod is visible. 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:51.750
 Mr. Seto I can see how 15 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:53.430
 Do I have put a 100 care Tsutsu a little even fall if Iere audience 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:59.130
 During shooting 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.910
 Don't touch it, so it's not like a gorilla pod , though 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.260

 It looks like I made 15 features 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:20.950
 It is a video dedicated to you all the time 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:27.299
