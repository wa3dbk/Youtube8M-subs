 navas 10 in this video I want 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.000
 recommend a great application of 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.920
 mac an application that we have 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.119
 promoters rather we have licenses 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.679
 that will expire us so it's 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.449
 much better for all of you 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.980
 we have two licenses at the end of the video 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.539
 I explain how to get the licenses 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.339
 not good the truth is that it is a 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.900
 application that for all the switches 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.580
 those who come from windows is going to 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.770
 like it a lot because they have some 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.450
 but vitamin - enriched functions of windows 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.829
 a way that only the mac can 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.300
 make good let's go to launchpad 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.520
 let's see what application we are going to 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.770
 recommend is this is the last one is called 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.000
 very an application really very good 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.980
 that we are going to open we are going to see a 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.989
 little bit above the adjustments and then 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.039
 we see a little bit that they do good to fix 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.629
 that here we can say that 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.039
 starts automatically when you start the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.809
 session which is a must 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.489
 to use the application because 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.710
 works in the background and the truth is 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.510
 what is exquisite what this 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.790
 good application fijaros here what 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.290
 we can say is that you see the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.960
 incognito of mvm if we put it in 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.640
 standard will be seen here in the dock if 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.310
 we put it in menu bar is going to see by 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.820
 up here I have it in face them of 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.560
 such way 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.540
 you do not see the application is working 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.280
 in the background but I do not see myself to 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.260
 me so I like to have it I'm a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.850
 your taste not here we will see how 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.500
 we use this application with the mouse 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.740
 with the mouse, note that in this option 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.220
 of male zoom control we will be able to 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.900
 tell him that when we click on him over 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.520
 all the windows as we're going to see a 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.200
 a little bit later we will appear 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.300
 these options that we have here of 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.490
 agreement now let's review them and then 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.800
 that when we bring the windows to 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.540
 corners are going to do all these things 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.250
 that we are seeing here and that is also 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.990
 customizable because we can tell you 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.030
 I put it in full screen when 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.160
 we give the room a corner 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.690
 determined or that you put it to a room 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.100
 of the screen as you are going to see now of 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.810
 good agreement here we also have 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.520
 keyboard options we have a shortcut 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.700
 fast that I have configured alt 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.340
 command and efe in such a way that from 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.409
 here we will be able to adjust with the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.179
 keys with the keyboard of our mac to the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.220
 final we will be able to adjust any 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.569
 window and this to my little one 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.730
 productivity at least keep 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.680
 incredible for simply with the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.849
 macbook keyboard as power 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.560
 resize the windows and 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.690
 positioned to my liking an application 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.430
 exquisite now that we have the taste 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.799
 we can customize some 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.629
 Preseas some preferences of re 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.610
 window dimensions to our liking 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.230
 we can touch this like we 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.760
 we want and well here we have the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.470
 updates I have it since 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.030
 I automatically check all the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.349
 updates but good let's see 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.170
 what does this application really do 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.420
 because it seems incredible to me 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.040
 go for example to my website that 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.840
 well let's go to the youtube channel 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.420
 where are you for example that is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.010
 well this one here and no healthy code tv and 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.780
 good to see that here we have the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.870
 conventional window but what is it that 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.299
 It is very cool application we are going to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.640
 go to the icon this to the little green button 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.769
 this one that has a plus and notice that we 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.930
 unfold this new window from here 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.250
 we could tell you that the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.340
 active window 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.080
 will be resized in this way what 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.000
 we could put as we want 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.430
 so in plan custom something really 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.320
 pretty cool then to work in a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.480
 big screen or final or in any 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.370
 screen and resize the windows to 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.200
 our taste to be more productive 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.790
 guys good to see that we also have 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.950
 here a series of presets we can 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.050
 put it to full screen we can 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.880
 put it on the left we can put it 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.920
 on the right we can put what 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.420
 we have around here then up or down 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.340
 let's put it down here for example 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.380
 see how it resizes well 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.239
 something that really seems to me very 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.610
 cool and for example so we could 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.020
 do to our liking but not notice that 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.820
 now let's see another of the functions 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.500
 who has this application when we take 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.540
 the window and drag it for example 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.400
 here to notice that we get a frame and 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.650
 when we release we can resize 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.840
 this is perfectly configurable and at 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.280
 more pure 'style roll windows where 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.530
 we could resize the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.150
 windows like we would like 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.040
 just going to the corners like 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.780
 you are not seeing in this way then 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.370
 we could resize the window as 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.110
 we would like to see if 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.390
 we are here to notice that we take it to 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.190
 a good room this is simply what 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.130
 What makes windows is exactly the same 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.840
 you take away what more 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.730
 is this where I can 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.160
 resize me the windows like me 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.890
 want you can have in a corner in 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.310
 another corner for example any 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.170
 Web navigator 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.030
 this works with all applications 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.980
 they have windows and they have about 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.900
 all these and with milestones no other option 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.070
 pretty cool for example is the keyboard 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.450
 As I told you before, I've 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.390
 configured the keyboard in such a way that 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.860
 when I play alt command and fix you 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.680
 that this appears to me from here where I 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.540
 I can move, I can resize when 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.830
 I have to notice that touching these 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.870
 combinations that you are seeing in 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.400
 screen I can touch the window and 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.960
 put it as I want we can also 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.270
 the presets that I've told you before 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.670
 we can put the number one that puts it 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.260
 here for example and in this of this 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.720
 position and number two when I play the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.120
 number two we appear like this something 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.620
 really super super intuitive and cool 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.450
 that we can configure ourselves to 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.970
 our taste according to our 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.400
 screen at the end to be able to work 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.930
 a super super comfortable way of such 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.330
 so that we are at the end 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.620
 more productive you know that to me 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.570
 it seems that mag is something of the most 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.040
 productive we have good guys 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.810
 surely now I'm thinking I want 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.969
 this application is available in 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.889
 the mac app store is worth nine euros 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.169
 of veneers but let's give two 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.579
 licenses and not promoters but licenses 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.259
