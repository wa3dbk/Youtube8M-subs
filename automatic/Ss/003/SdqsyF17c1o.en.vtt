that's<00:03:56.590> actually<00:03:57.040> where<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.489> microphones

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
that's actually where the microphones

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.660 
that's actually where the microphones
are<00:03:58.390> on<00:03:58.750> either<00:03:59.590> side<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.489> actually

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
are on either side and it actually

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.360 
are on either side and it actually
listens<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.600> noise<00:04:01.930> around<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.190> then

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
listens to the noise around you and then

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.550 
listens to the noise around you and then
it<00:04:03.489> sends<00:04:03.700> out<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.850> reverse<00:04:04.390> signal<00:04:05.019> to

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
it sends out a reverse signal to

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.170 
it sends out a reverse signal to
counteract<00:04:06.430> that<00:04:06.700> noise<00:04:07.180> around<00:04:07.540> you

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
counteract that noise around you

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.580 
counteract that noise around you
and<00:04:08.269> that's<00:04:08.629> actually<00:04:08.900> how<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.260> noise

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
and that's actually how the noise

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.069 
and that's actually how the noise
cancellation<00:04:10.340> works<00:04:10.909> now<00:04:11.269> on<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.569> other<00:04:11.780> side

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
cancellation works now on the other side

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.649 
cancellation works now on the other side
here<00:04:12.379> you'll<00:04:12.590> see<00:04:12.829> where<00:04:13.219> you<00:04:13.459> plug<00:04:14.030> in<00:04:14.090> the

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
here you'll see where you plug in the

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.930 
here you'll see where you plug in the
headphone<00:04:15.319> cable<00:04:15.590> now<00:04:16.250> on<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.579> headphone

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
headphone cable now on the headphone

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.210 
headphone cable now on the headphone
cord<00:04:17.269> you'll<00:04:17.780> notice<00:04:18.169> this<00:04:18.350> little<00:04:18.680> switch

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
cord you'll notice this little switch

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.890 
cord you'll notice this little switch
that<00:04:19.250> says<00:04:19.639> high-low<00:04:20.269> now<00:04:20.479> that<00:04:20.660> does<00:04:20.870> not

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
that says high-low now that does not

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.379 
that says high-low now that does not
affect<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:22.100> level<00:04:22.550> of<00:04:22.639> noise<00:04:22.850> cancellation

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
affect the level of noise cancellation

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.540 
affect the level of noise cancellation
at<00:04:23.479> all<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:23.810> simply<00:04:24.229> affects<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.860> volume<00:04:25.400> so

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
at all that simply affects the volume so

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.860 
at all that simply affects the volume so
if<00:04:25.639> you<00:04:25.729> want<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:25.970> little<00:04:26.180> bit<00:04:26.330> softer<00:04:26.750> even

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
if you want a little bit softer even

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.409 
if you want a little bit softer even
switch<00:04:27.169> it<00:04:27.320> down<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.650> low<00:04:27.830> but<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.100> like<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.610> high

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
switch it down to low but I like it high

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.409 
switch it down to low but I like it high
and<00:04:29.690> then<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.199> simply<00:04:30.410> flip<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.310> in<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:32.210> you

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
and then you simply flip it in and you

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.840 
and then you simply flip it in and you
are<00:04:32.539> all<00:04:32.720> ready<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:33.470> go<00:04:33.889> and<00:04:34.250> do<00:04:34.520> make<00:04:34.699> sure

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
are all ready to go and do make sure

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.600 
are all ready to go and do make sure
that<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.330> wear<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:36.320> right<00:04:36.860> headphone<00:04:37.370> on

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
that you wear the right headphone on

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.760 
that you wear the right headphone on
your<00:04:38.060> right<00:04:38.330> ear<00:04:38.600> because<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:39.229> inside<00:04:39.710> is

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
your right ear because the inside is

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.159 
your right ear because the inside is
actually<00:04:40.220> slanted<00:04:41.000> back<00:04:41.240> so<00:04:41.479> it'll<00:04:41.599> be<00:04:41.750> kind

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
actually slanted back so it'll be kind

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.810 
actually slanted back so it'll be kind
of<00:04:42.320> uncomfortable<00:04:42.680> if<00:04:43.009> you<00:04:43.099> don't<00:04:43.370> wear<00:04:43.550> on

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
of uncomfortable if you don't wear on

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.129 
of uncomfortable if you don't wear on
the<00:04:44.060> correct<00:04:44.389> ear<00:04:44.599> but<00:04:44.810> these<00:04:44.900> are<00:04:45.050> just

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
the correct ear but these are just

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.960 
the correct ear but these are just
incredibly<00:04:45.830> comfortable<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.580> incredibly

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
incredibly comfortable and incredibly

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.330 
incredibly comfortable and incredibly
good<00:04:47.810> headphones<00:04:48.169> and<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:49.009> don't<00:04:49.160> have<00:04:49.250> to

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
good headphones and you don't have to

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.240 
good headphones and you don't have to
worry<00:04:49.610> about<00:04:49.699> too<00:04:50.660> much<00:04:50.930> noise<00:04:51.590> cancellation

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
worry about too much noise cancellation

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.089 
worry about too much noise cancellation
and<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.849> buildup<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.570> pressure<00:04:54.020> on<00:04:54.440> your<00:04:54.560> ears<00:04:54.830> I

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
and a buildup of pressure on your ears I

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.969 
and a buildup of pressure on your ears I
use<00:04:55.550> these<00:04:55.759> on<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.360> 5-hour<00:04:56.960> trip<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.620> then<00:04:57.770> I've

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
use these on a 5-hour trip and then I've

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.249 
use these on a 5-hour trip and then I've
used<00:04:58.009> them<00:04:58.460> quite<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:58.940> bit<00:04:59.030> just<00:04:59.449> add<00:04:59.630> my<00:04:59.810> iMac

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
used them quite a bit just add my iMac

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.950 
used them quite a bit just add my iMac
and<00:05:00.710> they<00:05:01.130> work<00:05:01.340> very<00:05:01.849> very<00:05:01.970> well<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.780> there's

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
and they work very very well and there's

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.839 
and they work very very well and there's
not<00:05:03.080> a<00:05:03.139> buildup<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.860> pressure<00:05:04.070> on<00:05:04.520> your<00:05:04.610> ears

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
not a buildup of pressure on your ears

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.670 
not a buildup of pressure on your ears
the<00:05:05.030> noise<00:05:05.210> cancellation<00:05:05.630> is<00:05:05.900> not<00:05:06.080> irritating

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
the noise cancellation is not irritating

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.610 
the noise cancellation is not irritating
at<00:05:06.740> all<00:05:07.009> it's<00:05:07.550> just<00:05:07.789> the<00:05:08.509> right<00:05:08.690> amount<00:05:08.750> it's

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
at all it's just the right amount it's

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.310 
at all it's just the right amount it's
perfect<00:05:10.280> um<00:05:10.430> it<00:05:11.120> cancels<00:05:11.570> out<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.840> noise<00:05:12.020> but

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
perfect um it cancels out the noise but

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.680 
perfect um it cancels out the noise but
there's<00:05:12.590> not<00:05:12.800> too<00:05:13.130> much<00:05:13.280> pressure<00:05:13.610> also<00:05:14.419> the

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
there's not too much pressure also the

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.080 
there's not too much pressure also the
actual<00:05:15.199> sound<00:05:15.620> is<00:05:15.889> just<00:05:16.130> really<00:05:16.699> incredible

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
actual sound is just really incredible

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.490 
actual sound is just really incredible
and<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.300> nice<00:05:17.449> thing<00:05:17.659> about<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:18.080> over<00:05:18.380> the

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
and the nice thing about the over the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.589 
and the nice thing about the over the
ear<00:05:18.530> is<00:05:18.949> you<00:05:19.220> don't<00:05:19.490> have<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.940> have<00:05:20.210> as<00:05:20.389> much

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
ear is you don't have to have as much

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.540 
ear is you don't have to have as much
noise<00:05:20.930> translation<00:05:21.440> pressure<00:05:21.770> because<00:05:22.250> it

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
noise translation pressure because it

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.520 
noise translation pressure because it
naturally<00:05:22.909> blocks<00:05:23.750> out<00:05:23.960> some<00:05:24.169> of<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.289> sound

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
naturally blocks out some of the sound

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.980 
naturally blocks out some of the sound
just<00:05:24.770> because<00:05:25.130> it's<00:05:25.580> over<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.000> ear<00:05:26.300> now<00:05:26.750> guys

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
just because it's over the ear now guys

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.629 
just because it's over the ear now guys
