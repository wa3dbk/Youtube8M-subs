reboot

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.510 

we<00:01:54.760> start<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:58.299> is<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.570> real<00:01:58.900> real<00:01:59.830> doozy<00:02:00.400> it

we start this is a real real doozy it

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.200 
we start this is a real real doozy it
took<00:02:00.729> me<00:02:01.740> thinking<00:02:02.740> about<00:02:02.799> this<00:02:03.759> is<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.940> third

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
took me thinking about this is the third

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.219 
took me thinking about this is the third
day<00:02:04.479> of<00:02:04.509> me<00:02:04.900> looking<00:02:05.229> at<00:02:05.380> me<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.960> took<00:02:07.960> about

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
day of me looking at me and I took about

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.090 
day of me looking at me and I took about
half<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.739> computer<00:02:09.220> apart<00:02:09.550> before

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
half the computer apart before

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.100 
half the computer apart before
discovering<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.250> problem<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.940> was<00:02:13.630> pulling

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
discovering the problem I was pulling

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.550 
discovering the problem I was pulling
drives<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:15.780> all<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:17.020> different<00:02:17.230> kind<00:02:17.530> of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
drives and all the different kind of

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.030 
drives and all the different kind of
peripherals<00:02:19.050> when<00:02:20.050> eventually<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.590> finally

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
peripherals when eventually I finally

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.759 
peripherals when eventually I finally
pulled<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.690> or<00:02:22.739> disconnected<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:25.769> the

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
pulled the or disconnected the the

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.520 
pulled the or disconnected the the
memory<00:02:27.400> stick<00:02:27.790> reading<00:02:28.300> device<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.019> that's

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
memory stick reading device and that's

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.120 
memory stick reading device and that's
when<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.069> started<00:02:30.489> working<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:32.130> was

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
when it started working and I was

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.570 
when it started working and I was
looking<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:34.660> see<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:35.080> could<00:02:35.500> possibly<00:02:36.130> have

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
looking to see what could possibly have

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.110 
looking to see what could possibly have
cost<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.269> when<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.690> found<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:39.760> left<00:02:39.970> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
cost that when I found that I left the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.390 
cost that when I found that I left the
memory<00:02:40.450> stick<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:40.810> silly<00:02:41.470> isn't<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.130> anyway

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
memory stick in silly isn't it so anyway

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.259 
memory stick in silly isn't it so anyway
there<00:02:42.790> we<00:02:42.910> are<00:02:43.060> stuck<00:02:43.480> at<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.690> splash<00:02:43.959> screen

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
there we are stuck at the splash screen

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.830 
there we are stuck at the splash screen
halfway<00:02:46.269> just<00:02:47.230> stuck<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:48.390> nothing<00:02:49.390> works

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
halfway just stuck there nothing works

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:59.039 
halfway just stuck there nothing works

it's stuck on the splash screen and just
for<00:03:06.450> just<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:07.570> giggles<00:03:08.110> let's<00:03:08.410> try<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.769> pull

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
for just for giggles let's try and pull

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.680 
for just for giggles let's try and pull
it<00:03:09.070> out<00:03:09.220> right<00:03:09.430> now<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.670> know<00:03:09.850> it'll<00:03:10.120> restart<00:03:10.540> if

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
it out right now I know it'll restart if

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.569 
it out right now I know it'll restart if
I<00:03:10.810> pull<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.320> out<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.590> restart<00:03:12.130> but<00:03:12.280> let's<00:03:12.489> see

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
I pull it out and restart but let's see

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.949 
I pull it out and restart but let's see
what<00:03:12.730> happens<00:03:13.000> if<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.150> pull<00:03:13.359> it<00:03:13.390> out<00:03:13.510> just<00:03:13.840> right
