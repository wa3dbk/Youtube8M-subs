00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to know about note blocks okay first

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.139 
to know about note blocks okay first
note<00:00:39.780> blocks<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.379> case<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.680> didn't<00:00:40.950> know<00:00:41.149> LT

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
note blocks in case you didn't know LT

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.240 
note blocks in case you didn't know LT
changes<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> tune<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> note<00:00:43.710> blocks<00:00:43.980> like

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
changes the tune of the note blocks like

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.310 
changes the tune of the note blocks like
so<00:00:46.280> there<00:00:47.280> are<00:00:47.399> 25<00:00:47.789> different<00:00:48.030> tunes<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:49.170> each

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
so there are 25 different tunes to each

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
so there are 25 different tunes to each
note<00:00:49.590> block<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.940> will<00:00:51.030> restart<00:00:51.480> once

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
note block and then it will restart once

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.389 
note block and then it will restart once
you<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> highest<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
you get the highest like that so you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.520 
you get the highest like that so you
have<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.640> from<00:00:53.789> high<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> low<00:00:54.350> next<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.500> need

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
have one from high to low next you need

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
have one from high to low next you need
to<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> note<00:00:56.309> block<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> block

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to know that the note block or the block

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.420 
to know that the note block or the block
underneath<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.410> note<00:00:58.559> block<00:00:58.800> determines

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
underneath your note block determines

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.139 
underneath your note block determines
the<00:00:59.579> pitch<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.910> your<00:00:59.940> note<00:01:00.149> block<00:01:01.969> giving<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the pitch of your note block giving it a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.810 
the pitch of your note block giving it a
sound<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.379> said<00:01:04.589> before<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.280> 25

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
sound like I said before there are 25

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.090 
sound like I said before there are 25
different<00:01:06.479> tunes<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.439> 25<00:01:07.830> tunes

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
different tunes and there are 25 tunes

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.390 
different tunes and there are 25 tunes
for<00:01:08.310> every<00:01:08.520> pitch<00:01:08.760> now<00:01:09.689> which<00:01:10.650> means<00:01:10.890> for

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
for every pitch now which means for

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.830 
for every pitch now which means for
every<00:01:11.460> note<00:01:11.880> block<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> different<00:01:12.720> block

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
every note block with a different block

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.270 
every note block with a different block
underneath<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.409> changes<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> different

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
underneath it changes it to a different

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.010 
underneath it changes it to a different
sound<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.180> I've<00:01:15.270> seen<00:01:15.299> by<00:01:15.630> trial<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
sound from what I've seen by trial and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.539 
sound from what I've seen by trial and
error<00:01:16.170> there<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.650> five<00:01:16.860> different<00:01:16.890> bottom

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
error there are five different bottom

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.820 
error there are five different bottom
blocks<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.030> make<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> different<00:01:18.570> sound<00:01:18.830> which

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
blocks that make a different sound which

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.700 
blocks that make a different sound which
determines<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.640> pitch<00:01:21.020> dirt<00:01:22.520> would

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
block directly above a note block it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.590

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
you will want a full delay on the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.030 
you will want a full delay on the
repeater<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.810> that'll<00:02:52.500> make<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.680> sound<00:02:52.950> like

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
repeater and that'll make it sound like

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.449 
repeater and that'll make it sound like
this<00:02:53.750> like<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> real<00:02:55.020> doorbell<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:56.100> see<00:02:56.310> how

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
this like a real doorbell you see how

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.890 
this like a real doorbell you see how
the<00:02:56.520> redstone<00:02:57.000> lights<00:02:57.270> this<00:02:57.450> up<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.840> then

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
the redstone lights this up and then

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.710 
the redstone lights this up and then
lights<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.190> afterwards<00:02:59.790> that's<00:03:00.390> because

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
lights of this afterwards that's because

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.840 
lights of this afterwards that's because
this<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.990> on<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> full<00:03:01.380> delay<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.950> delay<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
this is on a full delay and delay the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.520 
this is on a full delay and delay the
noise<00:03:03.060> because<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.080> got<00:03:04.260> rid<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.440> this

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
noise because if I got rid of this

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.490 
noise because if I got rid of this
repeater<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:06.270> put<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> redstone<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:07.080> it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
repeater and I put a redstone here it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.070 
repeater and I put a redstone here it
wouldn't<00:03:07.800> sound<00:03:07.950> great<00:03:08.190> at<00:03:08.340> all<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.810> if<00:03:09.990> you

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
wouldn't sound great at all so if you

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.390 
wouldn't sound great at all so if you
get<00:03:10.230> something<00:03:10.440> like<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.680> all<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.250> need<00:03:11.370> to

repeater down and you put it on full
delay<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.810> will<00:03:18.900> make<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.170> sound<00:03:19.440> more

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
delay and it will make it sound more

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.100 
delay and it will make it sound more
