00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.420
 I had 90 missing with a new video and 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.180
 good friends this time we have a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.830
 top I decided very interesting is this is 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.840
 flame cannes so visual tip good for 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.640
 what is the use serves us to be able to mark 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.770
 your photos previously I went up one 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 that was very similar to is a disadvantage 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.000
 is that he only marked them within the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.860
 system and when they were exported 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.960
 photographs were not marked that for 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.480
 some some good point about 1 some 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.210
 point against but good in this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.980
 option to call camps to the photographs 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.460
 and they are marked with a date and a 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.540
 time when you take them this I'm going 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 to show a little about how 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.940
 it works like you take a picture by 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.670
 example I'm going to take carry arms I do 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.699
 here 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.500
 and let me take the short photograph by 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.969
 it soon brings a little delay like 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.649
 You can see it takes a little while to take the 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.760
 photos I think this is going to go 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.079
 checking horta in the next 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.179
 updates I do not think they take long 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.500
 and as you can see below, the 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.750
 date and what is the time of the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.130
 photography to 9 it fits a lot to stand out from 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.990
 tui that is that they have the possibility of 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.490
 hotels setting I will show a 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.080
 little about what I speak 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.240
 and good if we enter what are adjustments 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.189
 we have a menu called the system can 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.110
 4t let's access here we have the ones from 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.840
 enable it the option to create a copy 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.399
 and only mark the copy this way you 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.740
 you take a picture you are going to create two 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.899
 of it and only one will be left 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.929
 marked and not other functions what is 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.610
 the times stamp color is this mask the 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.380
 color with what you are going to mark of the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.880
 letters and you can catch what the guy is 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.920
 of letter there are only three markets 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.759
 I have chosen helvetica and good here in 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.700
 the colors are what is blue red 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.959
 dark gray white and green practices I go 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.940
 to choose the red so they can see 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.899
 how does something very important work 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.520
 after having done any 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.440
 change they have to make a sprint 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.209
 until now they have to do it like that 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.920
 I hope that future exhibitions go 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.000
 to solve and good 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.730
 we came back 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.230
 see how this works well 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.090
 ready friends this let's go into what 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.820
 is the camera immediately so that 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.430
 you can check a bit this 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.380
 you see the different color there and we should 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.800
 Take a photograph at those moments 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.180
 and to see how it looks is marked 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.180
 let's see how it was 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.220
 and good as you can see here was 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.200
 marked already with red the truth is a 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.270
 option that can be very good for 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.370
 some who like to leave marks 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.870
