haven't seen it before so I've got my
nerd<00:00:21.270> hat<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.689> my<00:00:21.960> propeller<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.560> spinning<00:00:22.680> and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
nerd hat on my propeller is spinning and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.560 
nerd hat on my propeller is spinning and
let's<00:00:23.519> talk<00:00:23.699> about<00:00:23.880> what<00:00:24.119> we're<00:00:24.269> looking<00:00:24.480> at

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
let's talk about what we're looking at

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.310 
let's talk about what we're looking at
here<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> these<00:00:26.760> are<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.150> statistics<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
here so these are the statistics that

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.179 
here so these are the statistics that
tell<00:00:28.890> us<00:00:29.070> how<00:00:29.400> rare<00:00:29.900> given<00:00:30.900> items<00:00:31.289> are<00:00:31.560> from

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
tell us how rare given items are from

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.060 
tell us how rare given items are from
care<00:00:32.610> packages<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:34.140> I've<00:00:34.260> done<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
care packages and what I've done is I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.069 
care packages and what I've done is I
sort<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.460> sorted<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.120> by<00:00:36.149> how<00:00:36.510> rare<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:36.960> are

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
sort of sorted them by how rare they are

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.389 
sort of sorted them by how rare they are
now<00:00:37.260> there's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> bunch<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.770> ties<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.309> you

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
now there's a bunch of ties in there you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.979 
now there's a bunch of ties in there you
see<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> bunch<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.910> them<00:00:39.059> show<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.719> three

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
see a bunch of them show up like three

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.959 
see a bunch of them show up like three
percent<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> time<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.309> I've<00:00:41.640> sort<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
percent of the time but I've sort of

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.520 
percent of the time but I've sort of
them<00:00:42.090> by<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.360> rare<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.079> when<00:00:43.500> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
them by how rare they are and when you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.040 
them by how rare they are and when you
reroll<00:00:44.129> them<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.940> odds<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.450> getting<00:00:45.510> better

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
reroll them your odds of getting better

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
reroll them your odds of getting better
stuff<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.370> bit<00:00:47.550> higher<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.210> for

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
stuff are a little bit higher so for

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110 
stuff are a little bit higher so for
example<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.500> look<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.969> second<00:00:50.969> column

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
example if you look at the second column

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.330 
example if you look at the second column
there<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.899> ammo<00:00:52.260> comes<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.710> twenty<00:00:53.070> percent

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
there the ammo comes up twenty percent

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100 
there the ammo comes up twenty percent
of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.520> time<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.059> every<00:00:54.149> five<00:00:54.420> rolls<00:00:54.750> are

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
of the time one in every five rolls are

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049 
of the time one in every five rolls are
one<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.320> every<00:00:55.410> five<00:00:55.620> care<00:00:55.920> packages<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.730> going

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
one in every five care packages is going

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.270 
one in every five care packages is going
to<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.300> ammo<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.170> spy<00:00:58.379> plane<00:00:58.649> encounter<00:00:59.039> spy

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to have ammo the spy plane encounter spy

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.889 
to have ammo the spy plane encounter spy
they<00:00:59.579> show<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.850> fifteen<00:01:00.270> percent<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> time

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
they show up fifteen percent of the time

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.490 
they show up fifteen percent of the time
but<00:01:01.410> when<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.770> reroll<00:01:02.129> them<00:01:02.370> those<00:01:02.789> lower

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
but when you reroll them those lower

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
but when you reroll them those lower
kill<00:01:04.500> streak<00:01:04.739> Cal<00:01:04.920> Colin<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.479> less<00:01:06.479> common

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
kill streak Cal Colin are less common

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.260 
kill streak Cal Colin are less common
than<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> initial<00:01:08.909> roll

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
than they are in the in the initial roll

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.120 
than they are in the in the initial roll
and<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:10.020> take<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.590> those<00:01:10.680> percentage

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and they take some of those percentage

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.710 
and they take some of those percentage
points<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.610> distribute<00:01:12.060> them<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> higher

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
points and distribute them to the higher

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870 
points and distribute them to the higher
stuff<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.650> example<00:01:13.710> Blackbird<00:01:14.430> napalm

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
stuff like for example Blackbird napalm

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
stuff like for example Blackbird napalm
strike<00:01:15.119> those<00:01:15.630> things<00:01:15.869> are<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.530> percent

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
strike those things are all one percent

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
strike those things are all one percent
more<00:01:17.159> likely<00:01:17.520> than<00:01:17.670> they<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.060> been<00:01:18.240> on

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
more likely than they would have been on

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.160 
more likely than they would have been on
your<00:01:19.259> initial<00:01:19.500> roll<00:01:20.000> now<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.479> break<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.960> tie

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
your initial roll now to break the tie

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
your initial roll now to break the tie
there<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.040> example<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.580> mortar<00:01:23.939> team

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
there for example you know mortar team

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.270 
there for example you know mortar team
in<00:01:24.330> sentry<00:01:24.689> gun<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.470> applied<00:01:25.740> my<00:01:26.070> own

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
in sentry gun I have applied my own

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.070 
in sentry gun I have applied my own
personal<00:01:26.880> feeling<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.420> which<00:01:27.689> one<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> these

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
personal feeling on which one of these

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.010 
personal feeling on which one of these
things<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.560> more<00:01:28.829> valuable<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> said<00:01:30.299> you're

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
things is more valuable so I said you're

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
things is more valuable so I said you're
free<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> disagree<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.790> have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
free to disagree but but there you have

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.469 
free to disagree but but there you have
it<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.020> look<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:36.000> third

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it now if you look at this the third

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.109 
it now if you look at this the third
column<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.320> whether<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.400> reroll<00:01:38.820> if

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
column there is whether you reroll if

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.340 
column there is whether you reroll if
you're<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.810> something<00:01:40.229> that's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
you're going to get something that's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.370 
you're going to get something that's
better<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:40.979> worse<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:42.020> all<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> way<00:01:43.259> up

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.899 
through the valkyrie rocket if you
reroll<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.200> odds<00:01:46.470> are<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.490> you're<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
reroll the odds are that you're going to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.899 
reroll the odds are that you're going to
get<00:01:48.060> something<00:01:48.540> better<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.850> that

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
get something better so it's not that

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.230 
get something better so it's not that
hard<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> remember<00:01:51.899> quite<00:01:52.350> frankly<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.040> know

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
hard to remember quite frankly you know

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.670 
hard to remember quite frankly you know
the<00:01:54.240> better<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.689> worst<00:01:54.899> column<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the better and worst column or just the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.080 
the better and worst column or just the
inverse<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.250> each<00:01:56.369> other<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:56.969> you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
inverse of each other you know if you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.370 
inverse of each other you know if you
were<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> take<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> worst<00:01:57.659> column<00:01:57.990> subtracted

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
were to take the worst column subtracted

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
were to take the worst column subtracted
from<00:01:58.409> 100<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.979> would<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.579> better<00:01:59.759> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
from 100 you would get the better and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.050 
from 100 you would get the better and
I'll<00:02:00.810> another<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> ground<00:02:01.920> rule<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.579> that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I'll another a ground rule here is that

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090 
I'll another a ground rule here is that
when<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.420> reroll<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.259> don't<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> same

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
when you reroll you don't get the same

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.219 
when you reroll you don't get the same
thing<00:02:05.159> again<00:02:05.969> now<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> bet<00:02:06.780> there's<00:02:06.960> someone

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
thing again now I bet there's someone

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.479 
thing again now I bet there's someone
out<00:02:07.350> there<00:02:07.380> who<00:02:07.680> found<00:02:07.890> some<00:02:08.069> sort<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.369> glitch

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
out there who found some sort of glitch

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.100 
out there who found some sort of glitch
in<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> system<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.209> they<00:02:09.330> occasionally<00:02:09.629> get

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
in the system and they occasionally get

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
in the system and they occasionally get
the<00:02:10.229> same<00:02:10.410> thing<00:02:10.619> twice<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.550> according<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
the same thing twice but according to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.590 
the same thing twice but according to
Treyarch<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.850> you're<00:02:13.970> not<00:02:14.030> supposed<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.480> be

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
Treyarch that you're not supposed to be

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.330 
Treyarch that you're not supposed to be
getting<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.930> same<00:02:15.140> thing<00:02:15.410> after<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:15.980> reroll

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
getting the same thing after you reroll

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.730 
getting the same thing after you reroll
I<00:02:16.550> guess<00:02:17.210> crazy<00:02:17.390> things<00:02:17.720> happen<00:02:18.020> but<00:02:18.200> but<00:02:18.590> by

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
I guess crazy things happen but but by

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.410 
I guess crazy things happen but but by
and<00:02:18.860> large<00:02:18.920> that's<00:02:19.520> one<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> rules<00:02:20.090> built

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
and large that's one of the rules built

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.780 
and large that's one of the rules built
into<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> system<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.610> might<00:02:22.760> be

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
into the system so so you might be

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.250 
into the system so so you might be

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
will admit there are situational things

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.440 
will admit there are situational things
that<00:03:12.530> that<00:03:13.070> might<00:03:13.220> change<00:03:13.520> your<00:03:13.700> opinion<00:03:14.030> for

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
that that might change your opinion for

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.990 
that that might change your opinion for
example<00:03:14.900> if<00:03:15.080> you're<00:03:15.560> playing<00:03:15.950> sabotage<00:03:16.670> and

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
example if you're playing sabotage and

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.270 
example if you're playing sabotage and
you<00:03:17.570> have<00:03:17.750> Valkyrie<00:03:18.110> rockets<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:18.620> your<00:03:18.860> pocket

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
you have Valkyrie rockets in your pocket

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.580 
you have Valkyrie rockets in your pocket
then<00:03:19.820> they<00:03:19.970> can<00:03:20.180> be<00:03:20.210> really<00:03:20.810> useful<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.500> know

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
then they can be really useful you know

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.380 
then they can be really useful you know
from<00:03:21.800> across<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.130> map<00:03:22.520> you<00:03:22.550> can<00:03:22.880> defend<00:03:23.240> the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
from across the map you can defend the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.270 
from across the map you can defend the
bomb<00:03:23.600> plant<00:03:23.930> after<00:03:24.140> somebody's<00:03:24.770> landed<00:03:25.160> it

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
bomb plant after somebody's landed it

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.280 
bomb plant after somebody's landed it
and<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.300> counts<00:03:26.540> for<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.930> whole<00:03:27.260> lot

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
and and that counts for a whole lot

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.250 
and and that counts for a whole lot
while<00:03:28.160> on<00:03:28.460> this<00:03:28.820> chart<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.480> Valkyrie<00:03:29.840> rocket

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
while on this chart the Valkyrie rocket

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.770 
while on this chart the Valkyrie rocket
is<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:31.070> guess<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.460> best<00:03:31.700> thing<00:03:31.850> that<00:03:32.210> falls<00:03:32.450> in

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
is I guess the best thing that falls in

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.960 
is I guess the best thing that falls in
that<00:03:32.810> less<00:03:33.410> than<00:03:33.440> fifty<00:03:33.860> percent<00:03:34.130> knots<00:03:34.370> it's

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
that less than fifty percent knots it's

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.580 
that less than fifty percent knots it's
5050<00:03:35.570> if<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.720> get<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.870> Valkyrie<00:03:36.200> rock<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.530> you

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
5050 if you get a Valkyrie rock and you

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.540 
5050 if you get a Valkyrie rock and you
might<00:03:36.740> want<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.040> stick<00:03:37.250> with<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.400> either

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
might want it to stick with it either

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.830 
might want it to stick with it either
way<00:03:37.760> but<00:03:39.400> for<00:03:40.400> some<00:03:40.670> like<00:03:41.090> objective<00:03:41.600> games

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840

Valkyrie rocket motor team those things

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.360 
Valkyrie rocket motor team those things
are<00:03:44.360> really<00:03:44.660> useful<00:03:44.930> well<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.650> find<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.100> in

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
are really useful well I find that in

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.430 
are really useful well I find that in
team<00:03:46.610> deathmatch<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:47.570> Valkyrie<00:03:47.959> rocket<00:03:48.320> the

team deathmatch the Valkyrie rocket the

team deathmatch the Valkyrie rocket the
mortar<00:03:48.709> team<00:03:48.890> they<00:03:49.070> don't<00:03:49.250> do<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:49.400> ton<00:03:49.850> for<00:03:50.180> me

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
mortar team they don't do a ton for me

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.699 
mortar team they don't do a ton for me
especially<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.840> Valkyrie<00:03:51.200> rocket<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.530> find

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
especially the Valkyrie rocket I find

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.870 
especially the Valkyrie rocket I find
that<00:03:51.800> I<00:03:51.890> die<00:03:51.950> while<00:03:52.250> I'm<00:03:52.340> trying<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.700> use<00:03:52.850> the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
that I die while I'm trying to use the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.460 
that I die while I'm trying to use the
thing<00:03:53.209> in<00:03:53.420> team<00:03:53.630> deathmatch<00:03:53.780> because<00:03:54.230> people

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
thing in team deathmatch because people

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.199 
thing in team deathmatch because people
are<00:03:54.560> just<00:03:54.680> all<00:03:54.860> over<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.160> place<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.550> even<00:03:56.090> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
mighty napalm which isn't a bad kill

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.949 
mighty napalm which isn't a bad kill
streak<00:03:58.190> for<00:03:58.340> team<00:03:58.490> deathmatch<00:03:58.880> isn't<00:03:59.600> as<00:03:59.720> good

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
streak for team deathmatch isn't as good

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.870 
streak for team deathmatch isn't as good
as<00:04:00.020> it<00:04:00.200> would<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.890> say<00:04:01.100> domination<00:04:01.730> we

Express playlist the san-tarah it might

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.100 
Express playlist the san-tarah it might
be<00:04:13.130> extra<00:04:13.580> valuable<00:04:14.000> because<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.570> many<00:04:14.750> people

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
be extra valuable because so many people

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.380 
be extra valuable because so many people
run<00:04:15.260> UAV<00:04:15.709> because<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:16.640> few<00:04:16.910> people<00:04:16.970> have

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
run UAV because so few people have

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.590 
run UAV because so few people have
ghosts<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:18.470> in<00:04:19.430> general<00:04:19.640> if<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.120> want<00:04:20.359> one<00:04:20.540> of
