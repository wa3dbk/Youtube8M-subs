would think that is 19 years of age

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.560 
would think that is 19 years of age
maybe<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:13.170> every<00:01:13.470> week<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.100> he<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.330> play<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
maybe not every week but he can play a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.230 
maybe not every week but he can play a
major<00:01:15.869> role<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> observed

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
