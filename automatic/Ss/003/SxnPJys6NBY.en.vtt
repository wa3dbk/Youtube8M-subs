00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:32.560 

I<00:00:28.599> feel<00:00:29.599> conditions<00:00:30.230> are<00:00:30.380> horrendous<00:00:31.570> real

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
I feel conditions are horrendous real

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.680 
I feel conditions are horrendous real
slick<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.290> its<00:00:33.610> encinal<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:35.090> made<00:00:35.329> it<00:00:35.480> tough

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
slick and its encinal it made it tough

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.350 
slick and its encinal it made it tough
on<00:00:35.870> both<00:00:36.050> teams<00:00:36.350> it's<00:00:37.309> more<00:00:37.520> of<00:00:37.579> a<00:00:37.790> problem<00:00:38.120> of

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
on both teams it's more of a problem of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.330 
on both teams it's more of a problem of
footwork<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.079> I<00:00:39.110> think<00:00:39.469> the<00:00:39.710> defensive<00:00:40.160> backs

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
footwork so I think the defensive backs

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.799 
footwork so I think the defensive backs
were<00:00:40.520> having<00:00:40.730> a<00:00:40.790> hard<00:00:40.820> time<00:00:41.030> getting<00:00:41.719> it

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
were having a hard time getting it

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.360 
were having a hard time getting it
getting<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:42.260> out<00:00:42.440> of<00:00:42.469> there<00:00:42.680> backpedaling

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
getting it out of there backpedaling

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.880 
getting it out of there backpedaling
slipping<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.390> I<00:00:44.420> think<00:00:44.629> that<00:00:44.780> was<00:00:45.050> kind<00:00:45.289> of<00:00:45.350> the

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
slipping so I think that was kind of the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.520 
slipping so I think that was kind of the
key<00:00:46.429> you're<00:00:47.030> able<00:00:47.179> to<00:00:47.390> catch<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:47.960> hitch<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.410> go

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
key you're able to catch a hitch and go

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.610 
key you're able to catch a hitch and go
down<00:00:48.769> here<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:50.510> know<00:00:50.570> i<00:00:50.929> think<00:00:51.109> the<00:00:51.350> DB

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
down here and you know i think the DB

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.869 
down here and you know i think the DB
kind<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:51.949> got<00:00:52.039> his<00:00:52.129> feet<00:00:52.309> crossed<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:52.789> little

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
kind of got his feet crossed a little

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.899 
kind of got his feet crossed a little
bit<00:00:53.120> got<00:00:53.359> a<00:00:53.390> big<00:00:53.600> pretty<00:00:54.079> throw<00:00:54.320> by<00:00:54.699> severs<00:00:55.699> and

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
bit got a big pretty throw by severs and

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:06.430 
bit got a big pretty throw by severs and
nice<00:00:56.449> touchdown<00:00:56.659> kinda<00:00:57.140> nice<00:00:57.260> too

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.460 

that<00:01:07.040> one<00:01:07.310> was<00:01:07.580> by<00:01:07.820> breaking<00:01:08.450> peterson<00:01:09.080> number

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
that one was by breaking peterson number

so<00:04:36.200> there's<00:04:36.380> two<00:04:36.590> contrasting<00:04:37.280> philosophers

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
so there's two contrasting philosophers

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.510 
so there's two contrasting philosophers
over<00:04:38.420> this<00:04:38.540> one<00:04:39.140> rut<00:04:39.650> likes<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:40.070> run<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.370> ball
