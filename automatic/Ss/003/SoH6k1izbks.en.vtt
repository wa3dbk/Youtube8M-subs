military-themed MMO this kind of goes
into<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.509> easy<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> develop<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.619> ps4<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
into how easy it is to develop for ps4 I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.920 
into how easy it is to develop for ps4 I
mean<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> what<00:01:23.610> Sony<00:01:23.850> wanted<00:01:24.299> easy

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
mean this is what Sony wanted easy

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
mean this is what Sony wanted easy
transfer<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.590> games<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.009> ps4<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.549> mean<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
transfer of games to ps4 I mean if the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700 
transfer of games to ps4 I mean if the
ps4<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.420> still<00:01:27.600> using<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.290> same<00:01:28.320> kind<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
ps4 was still using the same kind of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
ps4 was still using the same kind of
architecture<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.400> ps3<00:01:29.880> or<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.299> very<00:01:30.509> rough

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
architecture as ps3 or it was very rough

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.120 
architecture as ps3 or it was very rough
and<00:01:30.930> hard<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> understand<00:01:31.590> something<00:01:31.890> new

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and hard to understand something new

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.069 
and hard to understand something new
from<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> ground<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:33.509> probably<00:01:33.750> wouldn't

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
from the ground up we probably wouldn't

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.600 
from the ground up we probably wouldn't
get<00:01:34.229> something<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.710> war<00:01:34.950> thunder<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> ps4

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
get something like war thunder to ps4

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.429 
get something like war thunder to ps4
but<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.479> know<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.810> current<00:01:37.110> game<00:01:37.229> that's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
but you know it's a current game that's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.859 
but you know it's a current game that's
already<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:38.159> PC<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:39.180> seems<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.570> an<00:01:39.720> easy

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
already out for PC it seems like an easy

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.510 
already out for PC it seems like an easy
transfer<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> that's<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.070> that's<00:01:41.130> good

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
transfer and that's you know that's good

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.920 
transfer and that's you know that's good
I<00:01:41.700> mean<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.970> think<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> first<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.840> many

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
I mean I think this is the first of many

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.539 
I mean I think this is the first of many
game<00:01:43.200> announcements<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.799> ps4<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> mean<00:01:44.490> we

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
game announcements on ps4 I mean we

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.560 
game announcements on ps4 I mean we
probably<00:01:44.759> would<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.000> never<00:01:45.149> seen<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> game

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
probably would have never seen a game

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.870 
probably would have never seen a game

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
so let's talk about agent does anybody

remember this back in III 2009 Sony
basically<00:02:23.609> announced<00:02:23.849> agent<00:02:24.420> which<00:02:24.540> was<00:02:24.719> a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
basically announced agent which was a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.080

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
which was greatness awaits well it looks

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.949 
which was greatness awaits well it looks
like<00:03:22.949> Sony<00:03:23.220> has<00:03:23.459> now<00:03:23.639> patented<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.599> you<00:03:24.870> know

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
like Sony has now patented the you know

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.960 
like Sony has now patented the you know
slogan<00:03:25.349> greatness<00:03:25.739> awaits<00:03:25.859> so<00:03:26.489> we've<00:03:26.639> got<00:03:26.849> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
slogan greatness awaits so we've got the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.789 
slogan greatness awaits so we've got the
script<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.389> was<00:03:27.479> leaked<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.109> now<00:03:28.440> we've<00:03:28.620> got

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
script that was leaked and now we've got

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.219 
script that was leaked and now we've got
a<00:03:28.829> patent<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.609> think<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.359> piece<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.750> slogan<00:03:31.139> is

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
a patent I think the piece for slogan is

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.210 
a patent I think the piece for slogan is
now<00:03:31.349> going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.650> be<00:03:31.739> greatness<00:03:32.069> awaits

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
now going to be greatness awaits

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.039 
now going to be greatness awaits
obviously<00:03:33.060> Sony<00:03:33.269> files<00:03:33.479> patents<00:03:33.870> all<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
obviously Sony files patents all the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.360 
obviously Sony files patents all the
time<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.409> they<00:03:34.500> don't<00:03:34.590> use<00:03:34.829> all<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.129> them<00:03:35.250> but

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
time and they don't use all of them but

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.409 
time and they don't use all of them but
I<00:03:35.430> think<00:03:35.639> it's<00:03:35.729> fair<00:03:35.879> to<00:03:35.940> say<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.299> is

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
I think it's fair to say this is

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.360 
I think it's fair to say this is
probably<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.750> ps4<00:03:37.019> slogan<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.010> what<00:03:38.190> do<00:03:38.280> you

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
probably the ps4 slogan so what do you

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.069 
probably the ps4 slogan so what do you
think<00:03:38.579> but<00:03:38.819> of<00:03:38.940> course<00:03:38.970> if<00:03:39.659> you<00:03:39.840> live<00:03:40.049> in

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
think but of course if you live in

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.569 
think but of course if you live in
europe<00:03:40.199> how<00:03:40.650> long<00:03:40.859> will<00:03:41.069> it<00:03:41.099> take<00:03:41.159> for<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.549> to

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579
