00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
into the move area when you first get

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.680 
into the move area when you first get
your<00:00:04.859> MOU<00:00:04.980> Vario<00:00:05.339> you<00:00:05.850> have<00:00:06.000> an<00:00:06.120> SD<00:00:06.270> card<00:00:06.450> slot

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
your MOU Vario you have an SD card slot

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.660 
your MOU Vario you have an SD card slot
and<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.440> have<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> USB<00:00:08.099> port<00:00:08.340> on<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.519> bottom

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
and you have a USB port on the bottom

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.580 
and you have a USB port on the bottom
but<00:00:09.389> if<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.599> notice<00:00:09.780> there's<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.139> little<00:00:10.260> port

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
but if you notice there's a little port

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.169 
but if you notice there's a little port
on<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.800> back<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.490> what<00:00:11.639> we've<00:00:11.820> done<00:00:12.000> is

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
on the back and so what we've done is

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.180 
on the back and so what we've done is
we've<00:00:12.330> made<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.780> video<00:00:13.080> input<00:00:13.500> board<00:00:13.740> it

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
we've made this video input board it

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.099 
we've made this video input board it
plugs<00:00:14.549> into<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> back<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.509> lets<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.809> put

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
plugs into the back and it lets you put

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.720 
plugs into the back and it lets you put
composite<00:00:16.619> video<00:00:16.710> into<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> back<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
composite video into the back of the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.460 
composite video into the back of the
move<00:00:18.029> area<00:00:18.300> so<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.600> watch<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.260> about
