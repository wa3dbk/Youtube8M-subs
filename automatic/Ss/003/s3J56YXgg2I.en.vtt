00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.119 
actually on this line lock as well but
I'll<00:00:38.760> talk<00:00:38.969> more<00:00:39.000> about<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> minute

company black fox don't know because
I've<00:00:48.030> already<00:00:48.239> done<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> previous<00:00:49.289> video<00:00:49.410> on

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
I've already done a previous video on

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
I've already done a previous video on
the<00:00:50.910> black<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.149> course<00:00:51.210> companies<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.809> can

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the black of course companies you can

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.790 
the black of course companies you can
watch<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.440> dead

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
watch that one it's dead

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.119 
watch that one it's dead
but<00:00:53.309> anyway<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.210> blade<00:00:54.539> steel<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.140> 448

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
but anyway the blade steel is 448

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.689 
but anyway the blade steel is 448
stainless<00:00:57.030> steel<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:58.230> got<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.699> rockwell

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
stainless steel it's got a rockwell

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.510 
stainless steel it's got a rockwell
hardness<00:01:00.539> scale<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.350> between<00:01:01.949> 55<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
hardness scale I think of between 55 and

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.410 
hardness scale I think of between 55 and
57<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.899> even<00:01:04.739> though<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.159> 440<00:01:05.880> which<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
57 so even though this is 440 which is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
57 so even though this is 440 which is
sometimes<00:01:06.810> looked<00:01:06.990> down<00:01:07.110> upon<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
sometimes looked down upon because of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.030 
sometimes looked down upon because of
the<00:01:08.340> correct<00:01:08.549> heat<00:01:08.700> treatment<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.530> it's<00:01:10.530> 440

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the correct heat treatment and it's 440

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830 
the correct heat treatment and it's 440
a<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:11.970> actually<00:01:12.210> too<00:01:12.330> bad<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.659> blade

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
a it's not actually too bad for blade

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.740 
a it's not actually too bad for blade
steel<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.549> has<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> very<00:01:15.330> sharp<00:01:15.570> edge

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
steel at all this has a very sharp edge

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.960 
steel at all this has a very sharp edge
on<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.049> I've<00:01:16.890> used<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.460> couple<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
on it I've used it for a couple of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
on it I've used it for a couple of
things<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.240> slicing<00:01:18.750> some<00:01:18.900> fruit<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
things like slicing some fruit and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.950 
things like slicing some fruit and
cuttings<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.640> some<00:01:21.150> other<00:01:21.540> things<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
cuttings and some other things like that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
cuttings and some other things like that
in<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> kitchen<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.490> still<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.790> very

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
in the kitchen and it still going very

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.270 
in the kitchen and it still going very
sharp<00:01:24.150> edge<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.450> actually<00:01:24.979> now<00:01:25.979> because

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
sharp edge on it actually now because

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
sharp edge on it actually now because
he's<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.850> heat<00:01:27.000> treatment<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.479> would<00:01:27.600> keeping

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
he's the heat treatment it would keeping

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.510 
he's the heat treatment it would keeping
it<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.470> take<00:01:28.770> an<00:01:28.890> edge<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.130> keeping<00:01:29.400> edge

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it will take an edge in keeping edge

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.100 
it will take an edge in keeping edge
very<00:01:29.670> well<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.360> also<00:01:30.799> it's<00:01:31.799> very<00:01:31.890> stained

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
very well and also it's very stained

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
very well and also it's very stained

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
pictures of it because I thought when I

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
anyway the the blade is three inches

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.070 
anyway the the blade is three inches
long

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
long

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.100

pocket<00:02:22.440> clip<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:22.830> which<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.280> haven't

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
pocket clip here so which I haven't

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.949 
pocket clip here so which I haven't
really<00:02:23.610> used<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.569> imagine<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.900> would

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
really used but I can imagine that would

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.400 
really used but I can imagine that would
be<00:02:26.000> quite<00:02:27.000> good<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.480> there's<00:02:28.140> only<00:02:28.200> one

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
be quite good as so there's only one

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.210 
be quite good as so there's only one
option<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.800> that's<00:02:29.480> tip<00:02:30.480> down<00:02:30.780> carry<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:32.190> your

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
option and that's tip down carry in your

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.580 
option and that's tip down carry in your
pocket<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:33.000> can't<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.110> can't<00:02:34.320> screw

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
pocket you can't you can you can't screw

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.780 
pocket you can't you can you can't screw
it<00:02:34.680> obviously<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.280> can't<00:02:35.520> put<00:02:35.700> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
it obviously but you can't put it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
it obviously but you can't put it
anywhere<00:02:36.000> else<00:02:36.209> there's<00:02:36.360> no<00:02:36.450> option<00:02:36.780> for

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
anywhere else there's no option for

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.380 
anywhere else there's no option for
being<00:02:37.320> anywhere<00:02:37.590> else<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.040> there<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.330> yes<00:02:39.330> a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
being anywhere else but there is a yes a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.170 
being anywhere else but there is a yes a
Torx<00:02:39.780> screw<00:02:40.140> all<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.370> them<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.550> talked<00:02:41.760> screw<00:02:42.150> I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
Torx screw all of them a talked screw I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.690 
Torx screw all of them a talked screw I
think<00:02:42.510> talk<00:02:42.989> screws<00:02:43.410> yeah<00:02:43.590> yeah<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.610> you

think talk screws yeah yeah and you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.560 
think talk screws yeah yeah and you
could<00:02:44.790> probably<00:02:44.970> take<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.270> apart

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
could probably take that apart

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.710 
could probably take that apart
skeletonized<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.220> see<00:02:47.340> through<00:02:47.520> there

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
skeletonized you can see through there

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.229 
skeletonized you can see through there
to<00:02:48.720> reduce<00:02:48.959> weight<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.260> guess<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.709> weighs

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
to reduce weight I guess and it weighs

there's no plate wiggle or play at all

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.800 
there's no plate wiggle or play at all
yeah<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:47.579> know<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:48.060> move<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.570> to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
yeah and you know you just move that to

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.470 
yeah and you know you just move that to
the<00:03:49.440> side<00:03:49.470> there<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.130> it's<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.730> very<00:03:51.090> very

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
the side there and it's a very very

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.970 
the side there and it's a very very
smooth<00:03:51.810> deployment<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.290> mean<00:03:52.470> there<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:52.829> an

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
smooth deployment I mean there is an

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.830 
smooth deployment I mean there is an
issue<00:03:53.100> as<00:03:53.370> you're<00:03:53.519> here<00:03:53.820> because<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.600> this

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
issue as you're here because of this

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.990 
issue as you're here because of this
piece<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.620> metal<00:03:55.890> which<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.070> like<00:03:56.400> bent<00:03:56.730> to

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
piece of metal which is like bent to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.110 
piece of metal which is like bent to
push<00:03:57.360> against<00:03:58.430> yeah<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.459> think<00:03:59.579> I<00:03:59.850> think<00:03:59.880> it

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
push against yeah I think I think it

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.310 
push against yeah I think I think it
actually<00:04:00.209> pushes<00:04:00.540> against<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.930> blade<00:04:01.170> when

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
actually pushes against the blade when

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.050 
actually pushes against the blade when
you<00:04:01.410> open<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.709> cuz<00:04:01.860> that's<00:04:02.040> what<00:04:02.280> as<00:04:02.670> soon<00:04:02.910> as

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
you open it cuz that's what as soon as

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.569 
you open it cuz that's what as soon as
the<00:04:03.209> space<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.600> freed<00:04:03.870> up<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.320> pops<00:04:05.250> into<00:04:05.489> place

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
the space is freed up it pops into place

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.110 
the space is freed up it pops into place
if<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.239> can<00:04:06.420> hear<00:04:07.079> that<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.700> has<00:04:08.850> kind<00:04:09.090> of

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
if you can hear that and it has kind of

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.979 
if you can hear that and it has kind of
like<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:10.290> clicks<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.739> little<00:04:11.010> bit<00:04:11.130> into<00:04:11.310> place

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
like it clicks a little bit into place

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.650 
like it clicks a little bit into place
there<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.260> then<00:04:14.040> fully<00:04:14.880> into<00:04:15.090> place<00:04:15.120> there<00:04:15.480> so

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
there and then fully into place there so

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.240 
there and then fully into place there so
it's<00:04:15.900> quite<00:04:16.019> solid<00:04:16.200> but<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:17.010> don't

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
it's quite solid but I just I don't

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.000 
it's quite solid but I just I don't
trust<00:04:17.519> them<00:04:17.700> most<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.120> time<00:04:18.299> that's<00:04:18.479> all

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
trust them most of the time that's all

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.050 
trust them most of the time that's all
yeah<00:04:20.010> there's<00:04:20.160> got<00:04:20.280> a<00:04:20.310> nineteen<00:04:20.640> pound<00:04:20.850> from

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
yeah there's got a nineteen pound from

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.990 
yeah there's got a nineteen pound from
PNA<00:04:21.599> so<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:23.190> know<00:04:23.280> it's<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.729> bit<00:04:23.880> more

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
PNA so you know it's a bit more

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.150 
PNA so you know it's a bit more
expensive<00:04:24.210> than<00:04:24.390> some<00:04:24.570> other<00:04:24.830> basic<00:04:25.830> pocket

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
expensive than some other basic pocket

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.810 
expensive than some other basic pocket

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
one but this is you know it's a little

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.490 
one but this is you know it's a little
bit<00:04:28.380> more<00:04:28.670> a<00:04:29.810> little<00:04:30.810> bit<00:04:30.840> more<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.260> know<00:04:31.320> than

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
bit more a little bit more you know than

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.260 
bit more a little bit more you know than
you<00:04:31.590> might<00:04:31.740> get<00:04:31.950> for<00:04:32.130> a<00:04:32.220> very<00:04:32.490> basic<00:04:32.730> basic

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
you might get for a very basic basic

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.580 
you might get for a very basic basic
pocket<00:04:33.690> knife<00:04:33.810> it's<00:04:34.140> got<00:04:34.260> this<00:04:34.320> is<00:04:34.440> leather

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
pocket knife it's got this is leather

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.340 
pocket knife it's got this is leather
lanyard<00:04:35.520> here<00:04:35.670> this<00:04:35.910> comes<00:04:36.120> on<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:37.110> suppose

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
lanyard here this comes on I suppose

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.010 
lanyard here this comes on I suppose
probably<00:04:38.340> all<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.850> new<00:04:39.330> black<00:04:39.570> fox<00:04:39.810> at

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
probably all of the new black fox at

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.170 
probably all of the new black fox at
once<00:04:40.230> anyway<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:41.220> didn't<00:04:41.730> put<00:04:41.820> that<00:04:41.850> on<00:04:41.940> there

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
you can take it off you know not too bad

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.430 
you can take it off you know not too bad
to<00:04:46.530> have<00:04:46.680> on<00:04:46.800> that<00:04:47.840> it's<00:04:48.840> got<00:04:48.990> kind<00:04:49.170> of<00:04:49.260> like<00:04:49.380> a

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
to have on that it's got kind of like a

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.130 
to have on that it's got kind of like a
full<00:04:50.250> edge<00:04:50.550> as<00:04:50.760> well<00:04:50.910> it<00:04:51.180> starts<00:04:51.900> off<00:04:51.990> as<00:04:52.110> a

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
full edge as well it starts off as a

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.260 
full edge as well it starts off as a
thick<00:04:52.350> blade<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.340> gets<00:04:53.550> thinner<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.090> it's

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
thick blade and it gets thinner and it's

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.580 
thick blade and it gets thinner and it's
got<00:04:54.420> kind<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:54.660> like<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.810> full<00:04:55.050> set<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.410> that's

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
got kind of like a full set so that's

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.050 
got kind of like a full set so that's
just<00:04:55.830> whenever<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:56.310> see<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.460> full<00:04:56.670> search<00:04:56.910> in

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
just whenever you see a full search in

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.060 
just whenever you see a full search in
the<00:04:57.120> blade<00:04:57.270> oh<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.660> just<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:58.050> when<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:58.920> if

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
the blade oh that is just to when you if

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.560 
the blade oh that is just to when you if
you<00:04:59.220> are<00:04:59.310> going<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.550> pair<00:04:59.760> something<00:05:00.030> it's

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
you are going to pair something it's

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.210 
you are going to pair something it's
just<00:05:00.750> because<00:05:01.050> there's<00:05:01.290> less<00:05:01.470> metal<00:05:01.740> has<00:05:02.100> to

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
just because there's less metal has to

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.620 
just because there's less metal has to
go<00:05:02.310> through<00:05:02.490> so<00:05:02.640> there's<00:05:02.790> like<00:05:02.910> less<00:05:03.300> friction

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
go through so there's like less friction

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.060 
go through so there's like less friction
and<00:05:03.960> resistance<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.410> stuff<00:05:04.680> so<00:05:04.860> it's<00:05:04.980> just

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
and resistance and stuff so it's just

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.070 
and resistance and stuff so it's just
easy<00:05:05.280> for<00:05:05.400> piercing<00:05:05.880> but<00:05:06.690> I<00:05:06.750> haven't<00:05:06.870> used

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
easy for piercing but I haven't used

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.220 
easy for piercing but I haven't used
ever<00:05:07.200> anything<00:05:07.320> any<00:05:07.710> piercing<00:05:08.160> just<00:05:09.230> slicing

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
ever anything any piercing just slicing

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.310 
ever anything any piercing just slicing
but<00:05:11.190> he<00:05:11.340> held<00:05:11.730> up<00:05:11.880> very<00:05:11.910> well<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.630> was<00:05:12.780> you<00:05:13.200> know

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
but he held up very well it was you know

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.480 
but he held up very well it was you know
glided<00:05:13.770> through<00:05:14.360> some<00:05:15.360> fruit<00:05:15.540> in<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.690> kitchen

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
glided through some fruit in the kitchen

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.510

grip<00:05:35.310> onto<00:05:35.790> this<00:05:36.300> here<00:05:36.570> it<00:05:37.110> actually<00:05:37.380> makes<00:05:37.530> it

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
grip onto this here it actually makes it

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.970 
grip onto this here it actually makes it
rather<00:05:37.830> difficult<00:05:38.100> to<00:05:39.080> to<00:05:40.080> open<00:05:40.410> it<00:05:40.470> up<00:05:40.560> you

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
rather difficult to to open it up you

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.800 
rather difficult to to open it up you
know<00:05:41.070> so<00:05:41.730> you<00:05:41.820> have<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.060> kind<00:05:42.330> of<00:05:42.360> like<00:05:42.510> hold

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
know so you have to kind of like hold

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.040 
know so you have to kind of like hold
your<00:05:43.050> hand<00:05:43.350> off<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:43.910> this<00:05:44.910> bit<00:05:45.150> here<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.570> kind

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
your hand off of this bit here and kind

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.900 
your hand off of this bit here and kind
of<00:05:46.110> push<00:05:46.350> diagonally<00:05:47.310> rather<00:05:47.550> than<00:05:47.670> just

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
of push diagonally rather than just

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.810 
of push diagonally rather than just
straight<00:05:48.150> up<00:05:48.680> but<00:05:49.680> when<00:05:50.130> it<00:05:50.250> when<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.490> when<00:05:50.760> it

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
straight up but when it when it when it

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.490 
straight up but when it when it when it
opens<00:05:51.150> it<00:05:51.270> is<00:05:51.360> very<00:05:51.540> smooth<00:05:51.750> then<00:05:51.960> it's<00:05:52.110> a<00:05:52.200> very

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
opens it is very smooth then it's a very

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.350 
opens it is very smooth then it's a very
smooth<00:05:52.860> closing<00:05:53.340> closing<00:05:53.940> as<00:05:54.150> well<00:05:56.030> so<00:05:57.030> it's<00:05:57.270> a

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
smooth closing closing as well so it's a

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.170 
smooth closing closing as well so it's a
hollow<00:05:57.570> ground<00:05:57.780> I<00:05:57.960> think<00:05:58.820> I'm<00:05:59.820> not<00:05:59.940> entirely

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
hollow ground I think I'm not entirely

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.240 
hollow ground I think I'm not entirely
sure<00:06:00.330> on<00:06:00.570> that<00:06:00.600> but<00:06:01.170> I<00:06:01.320> think<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:01.800> it<00:06:02.010> feels

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
sure on that but I think that it feels

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.520 
sure on that but I think that it feels
like<00:06:02.400> a<00:06:02.430> hollow<00:06:02.610> ground<00:06:02.760> to<00:06:02.970> me<00:06:03.090> I<00:06:03.900> don't<00:06:04.410> know

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
like a hollow ground to me I don't know

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.200 
like a hollow ground to me I don't know
whether<00:06:04.680> the<00:06:05.070> full<00:06:05.250> set<00:06:05.430> in<00:06:05.580> fact<00:06:05.820> I<00:06:05.970> think<00:06:06.030> I

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
whether the full set in fact I think I

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.330 
whether the full set in fact I think I

life is a nice little pocket I've got

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.080 
life is a nice little pocket I've got
some<00:06:26.220> jimping<00:06:26.700> here<00:06:26.970> but<00:06:27.450> it's<00:06:27.570> kind<00:06:27.840> of<00:06:29.090> it's

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
some jimping here but it's kind of it's

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.180 
some jimping here but it's kind of it's
quite<00:06:30.330> rounded<00:06:30.810> I<00:06:30.960> know<00:06:31.020> why<00:06:31.320> they<00:06:31.470> do<00:06:31.530> rounded

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
quite rounded I know why they do rounded

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.100 
quite rounded I know why they do rounded
Jimmy<00:06:33.180> like<00:06:33.390> that<00:06:33.510> if<00:06:33.600> you're<00:06:33.690> gonna<00:06:33.780> do<00:06:33.990> it

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
Jimmy like that if you're gonna do it

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.710 
Jimmy like that if you're gonna do it
you<00:06:34.320> know<00:06:34.440> do<00:06:34.650> properly<00:06:35.520> that's<00:06:36.450> not<00:06:36.570> on<00:06:36.660> the

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
you know do properly that's not on the

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.180 
you know do properly that's not on the
back<00:06:36.870> there<00:06:37.080> is<00:06:37.200> like<00:06:37.590> that<00:06:37.680> down<00:06:37.830> the<00:06:37.919> bottom

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
back there is like that down the bottom

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.850 
back there is like that down the bottom
as<00:06:38.280> well

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
as well

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.260 
as well
it's<00:06:39.860> quite<00:06:40.040> long<00:06:40.190> so<00:06:40.250> I<00:06:40.760> guess<00:06:41.000> it<00:06:41.180> would

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
it's quite long so I guess it would

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.610 
it's quite long so I guess it would
serve<00:06:41.510> some<00:06:41.690> purpose<00:06:41.810> but<00:06:42.110> it's<00:06:42.230> not<00:06:42.350> sharp

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
serve some purpose but it's not sharp

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.180 
serve some purpose but it's not sharp
enough<00:06:42.710> to<00:06:42.889> really<00:06:43.490> cut<00:06:43.700> enough<00:06:45.070> you<00:06:46.070> know

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
enough to really cut enough you know

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.379 
enough to really cut enough you know
stopping<00:06:46.610> on<00:06:46.730> there<00:06:46.880> if<00:06:46.970> you<00:06:47.030> were<00:06:47.120> gonna<00:06:47.240> go

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
stopping on there if you were gonna go

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.570 
stopping on there if you were gonna go
pair<00:06:47.630> something<00:06:47.810> with<00:06:48.050> that<00:06:48.200> full<00:06:48.470> edge<00:06:49.400> on

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
pair something with that full edge on

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.000 
pair something with that full edge on
the<00:06:49.639> back<00:06:50.020> it's<00:06:51.020> not<00:06:51.139> really<00:06:51.470> gonna<00:06:51.590> stop<00:06:51.860> too

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
the back it's not really gonna stop too

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.890 
the back it's not really gonna stop too
much<00:06:52.160> but<00:06:52.430> it's<00:06:52.580> better<00:06:53.180> than<00:06:53.270> nothing<00:06:53.570> and

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
much but it's better than nothing and
