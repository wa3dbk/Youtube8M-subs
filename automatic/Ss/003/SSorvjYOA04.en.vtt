00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
rated card when he was less the city so

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.949 
rated card when he was less the city so
there<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.650> go<00:03:31.829> next<00:03:32.459> up<00:03:32.609> is<00:03:32.819> Douglas<00:03:33.479> so<00:03:33.780> this

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
there you go next up is Douglas so this

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.439 
there you go next up is Douglas so this
guy<00:03:34.139> has<00:03:34.470> actually<00:03:34.859> gone<00:03:34.979> from<00:03:35.189> Brazilian<00:03:35.729> to

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
guy has actually gone from Brazilian to

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.929 
guy has actually gone from Brazilian to
Dutch<00:03:36.959> which<00:03:37.319> is<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.560> cool<00:03:37.919> little<00:03:38.310> change<00:03:38.699> and

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
Dutch which is a cool little change and

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.339 
Dutch which is a cool little change and
I<00:03:39.299> think<00:03:39.479> that's<00:03:39.599> mainly<00:03:39.780> because<00:03:39.930> he's<00:03:40.199> been

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
I think that's mainly because he's been

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.589 
I think that's mainly because he's been
living<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.340> grow<00:03:41.519> he<00:03:41.699> lived<00:03:41.879> in<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.479> know

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
living in the grow he lived in you know

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.629 
living in the grow he lived in you know
Holland<00:03:43.169> for<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:43.500> long<00:03:43.739> I'm<00:03:43.979> not<00:03:44.099> 100%<00:03:44.430> sure

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
Holland for so long I'm not 100% sure

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.339 
Holland for so long I'm not 100% sure
but<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.479> can<00:03:45.629> see<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.959> he<00:03:46.049> was<00:03:46.079> Brazilian

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
would have been a very dangerous card

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.480 
would have been a very dangerous card
but<00:04:24.720> ei<00:04:24.870> were<00:04:25.139> all<00:04:25.290> about<00:04:25.560> making<00:04:25.800> ridiculous

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
but ei were all about making ridiculous

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.270 
but ei were all about making ridiculous
upgrades<00:04:27.030> on<00:04:27.300> inform<00:04:28.259> cards<00:04:28.590> on<00:04:28.680> fee<00:04:28.800> 411<00:04:29.220> I

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
upgrades on inform cards on fee 411 I

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.560 
upgrades on inform cards on fee 411 I
think<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.490> was<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.669> first<00:04:29.850> year<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:30.090> informs

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
think it was the first year that informs

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.600 
think it was the first year that informs
actually<00:04:30.840> came<00:04:31.050> out<00:04:31.199> and<00:04:31.380> yeah<00:04:32.220> they<00:04:32.370> used<00:04:32.550> to

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
actually came out and yeah they used to

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.610 
actually came out and yeah they used to
give<00:04:32.729> them<00:04:32.880> absolutely<00:04:33.270> huge<00:04:33.780> stat<00:04:34.139> boosts<00:04:34.350> so

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
give them absolutely huge stat boosts so

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.800 
give them absolutely huge stat boosts so
that's<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.190> cool<00:04:35.340> one<00:04:35.460> see<00:04:35.699> moving<00:04:36.330> on<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.780> our

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
that's a cool one see moving on to our

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.450 
that's a cool one see moving on to our
final<00:04:37.169> player<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.919> day<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.310> thought

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
final player of the day and I thought

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.870 
final player of the day and I thought
I'd<00:04:38.550> leave<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.880> pastor<00:04:39.509> parish<00:04:39.870> specialist<00:04:40.880> up

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
I'd leave a pastor parish specialist up

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.390 
I'd leave a pastor parish specialist up
for<00:04:42.120> debate<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.630> it<00:04:43.110> is<00:04:43.259> going<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.860> Massa

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
for debate and it is going to be Massa

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.540 
for debate and it is going to be Massa
so<00:04:44.850> you<00:04:44.910> can<00:04:45.120> see<00:04:45.330> that<00:04:45.600> he<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.530> Brazilian<00:04:47.400> on

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
so you can see that he is Brazilian on

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.219 
so you can see that he is Brazilian on
