Titan<00:00:17.400> -<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> very<00:00:19.140> specialist

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
Titan - this is a very specialist

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.880 
Titan - this is a very specialist
microphone<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.520> looks<00:00:21.000> very<00:00:21.300> similar<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.720> our

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
microphone it looks very similar to our

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.080 
microphone it looks very similar to our
4408<00:00:22.920> which<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.430> all<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> best-selling

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
4408 which is all the best-selling

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.779 
4408 which is all the best-selling
microphones<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.439> universal<00:00:26.250> application

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
microphones and a universal application

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.660 
microphones and a universal application
like<00:00:27.199> but<00:00:28.199> looks<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.830> about<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.220> far<00:00:29.429> as<00:00:29.490> it

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
like but looks is about as far as it

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.130 
like but looks is about as far as it
goes<00:00:29.820> internally<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.779> very<00:00:30.960> very

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
goes internally it's a very very

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
goes internally it's a very very
different<00:00:31.320> microphone<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.279> let's<00:00:32.460> start<00:00:32.759> with

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
different microphone so let's start with

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.360 
different microphone so let's start with
the<00:00:33.030> looks<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.480> feature<00:00:33.930> set<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:35.219> main

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the looks and the feature set the main

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
the looks and the feature set the main
differentiated<00:00:36.180> between<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> 4400

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
differentiated between this and the 4400

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530 
differentiated between this and the 4400
a<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.670> silver<00:00:39.239> metal

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
a is that this is a silver metal

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.930 
a is that this is a silver metal
metallic<00:00:39.930> sized<00:00:40.230> finish<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.160> 4400<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
metallic sized finish and the 4400 a is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.549 
metallic sized finish and the 4400 a is
black<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:42.660> easy<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.020> tell<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
black so it's very easy to tell the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.920 
black so it's very easy to tell the
difference<00:00:43.829> between<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.690> feature<00:00:45.690> set

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
difference between them the feature set

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
difference between them the feature set
is<00:00:46.079> exactly<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> same<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> 10<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
is exactly the same so you have a 10 and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.010 
is exactly the same so you have a 10 and
a<00:00:48.210> 20<00:00:48.510> DB<00:00:48.780> pad<00:00:49.160> 60<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.399> 120<00:00:50.850> Hertz<00:00:51.449> bass

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a 20 DB pad 60 and 120 Hertz bass

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
a 20 DB pad 60 and 120 Hertz bass
roll-off<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.370> four<00:00:53.670> polar

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
roll-off and then you have four polar

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
roll-off and then you have four polar
patterns<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.780> cardioid<00:00:55.320> hyper-cardioid

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
patterns on the cardioid hyper-cardioid

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.200 
patterns on the cardioid hyper-cardioid
and<00:00:56.520> figure-of-eight

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and figure-of-eight

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.650 
and figure-of-eight
it<00:00:57.780> also<00:00:57.930> ships<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> same<00:01:00.030> kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.449> shot

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it also ships with the same kind of shot

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.779 
it also ships with the same kind of shot
down<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> 4400<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
down at the 4400 a so you get this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
down at the 4400 a so you get this
Universal<00:01:03.449> shock<00:01:03.629> mount<00:01:03.870> which<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.049> really

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Universal shock mount which is really

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
Universal shock mount which is really
unique<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.100> our<00:01:05.460> company<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.150> something

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
unique to our company and something

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.370 
unique to our company and something
which<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.130> quite<00:01:08.130> pleased<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> design

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
which is quite pleased with as a design

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.450 
which is quite pleased with as a design
it<00:01:10.380> means<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.010> you're<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.310> doing

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it means that if you're just doing

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.149 
it means that if you're just doing
straight<00:01:11.790> vocals<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.479> mount<00:01:12.659> mic

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
straight vocals you can mount mic

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
straight vocals you can mount mic
normally<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.509> want<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> do

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
normally like this if you want to do

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
normally like this if you want to do
instrument<00:01:16.650> making<00:01:16.830> applications<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.790> can

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
instrument making applications you can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.490 
instrument making applications you can
lock<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.450> mic<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> pretty<00:01:19.080> much<00:01:19.170> any

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
lock the mic and pretty much any

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.170 
lock the mic and pretty much any
position<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> within<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> shot<00:01:20.939> pan

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
position you want to within the shot pan

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
position you want to within the shot pan
so<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> makes<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> very<00:01:21.960> easy<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.710> into

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
so it makes it very easy to get into

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.880 
so it makes it very easy to get into
tight<00:01:23.189> spaces<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.930> similarly<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.650> flip

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
tight spaces and similarly if you flip

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.510 
tight spaces and similarly if you flip
the<00:01:26.009> outside<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> shock<00:01:27.210> mount<00:01:28.250> like<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the outside of the shock mount like that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.450 
the outside of the shock mount like that
and<00:01:29.810> then<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.930> mount<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> mic<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.950> lock<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and then you mount the mic and lock it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.910 
and then you mount the mic and lock it
in<00:01:32.549> position<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> mic<00:01:34.619> sits

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
in position so that the mic sits

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.270 
in position so that the mic sits
completely<00:01:35.189> outside<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> shock<00:01:36.420> mount<00:01:37.280> you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
completely outside the shock mount you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
completely outside the shock mount you
can<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.700> get<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.030> very<00:01:39.210> close<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.990> close

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
can then get in very close for close

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.170 
can then get in very close for close
Viking<00:01:40.530> applications<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.610> example<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
Viking applications for example this is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510 
Viking applications for example this is
a<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.479> very<00:01:42.659> good<00:01:43.130> percussion<00:01:44.130> bike<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
a very very good percussion bike and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.190 
a very very good percussion bike and
it's<00:01:44.640> extremely<00:01:45.180> good<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.450> kick<00:01:45.659> drum<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it's extremely good on kick drum and you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
it's extremely good on kick drum and you
can<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.740> right<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.189> very<00:01:47.460> close<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
can get it right in very close to the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.450 
can get it right in very close to the
skin<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.509> drum<00:01:48.689> head<00:01:49.130> which<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> very

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
skin of a drum head which is very

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.679 
skin of a drum head which is very
difficult<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.090> any<00:01:51.240> other<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.540> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
difficult to do with any other kind of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.960 
difficult to do with any other kind of
mounting<00:01:52.290> mechanism<00:01:52.549> so<00:01:53.549> those<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
mounting mechanism so those are the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.240 
mounting mechanism so those are the
feature<00:01:54.210> set<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.630> internally<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.770> mic<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
feature set but internally the mic is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.789 
feature set but internally the mic is
very<00:01:56.909> different<00:01:57.329> much<00:01:57.960> more<00:01:57.990> specialist<00:01:58.649> in

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
very different much more specialist in

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.679 
very different much more specialist in
the<00:01:58.860> 408<00:01:59.610> that's<00:01:59.909> because<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> only

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the 408 that's because it's one of only

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.270 
the 408 that's because it's one of only
a<00:02:00.869> handful<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.380> microphones<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> world

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
a handful of microphones in the world

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.459 
a handful of microphones in the world
that<00:02:02.490> has<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> titanium<00:02:03.119> sputtered<00:02:03.780> capsule<00:02:04.290> as

that has a titanium sputtered capsule as

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.840 
that has a titanium sputtered capsule as
opposed<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.100> more<00:02:05.250> standard<00:02:05.340> gold

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
sputtered capsule which all of our mics

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.309 
sputtered capsule which all of our mics
out<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.610> nearly<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> other<00:02:09.929> mics<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.259> the

the<00:02:12.530> difference<00:02:12.800> between<00:02:12.920> titanium<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.880> gold

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
the difference between titanium and gold

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.030 
the difference between titanium and gold
capsules<00:02:14.660> is<00:02:14.810> titanium<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.470> much<00:02:15.680> stiffer

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
capsules is titanium is a much stiffer

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.910 
capsules is titanium is a much stiffer
metal<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.750> get<00:02:17.960> a<00:02:18.170> much<00:02:18.710> quicker

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
metal and so you get a much quicker

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.550 
metal and so you get a much quicker

microphone<00:02:21.680> if<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.310> buttered<00:02:22.610> with

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
microphone if it's buttered with

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.720 
microphone if it's buttered with
titanium<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:24.770> also<00:02:24.920> means<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.550> get

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
titanium and it also means that you get

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.910 
titanium and it also means that you get
therefore<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.420> much<00:02:26.630> faster<00:02:27.110> transient

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
therefore a much faster transient

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.280 
therefore a much faster transient
response<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:29.150> makes<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:29.810> microphone

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
response that makes this microphone

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.290 
response that makes this microphone
absolutely<00:02:31.010> ideal<00:02:31.130> for<00:02:31.370> anything<00:02:31.700> percussive

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
absolutely ideal for anything percussive

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.180 
absolutely ideal for anything percussive
so<00:02:32.570> clearly<00:02:33.290> it's<00:02:33.500> very<00:02:33.680> good<00:02:33.800> on<00:02:33.890> percussion

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
so clearly it's very good on percussion

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.580 
so clearly it's very good on percussion
and<00:02:34.550> drums<00:02:34.580> it's<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.720> very<00:02:35.959> very<00:02:36.230> good<00:02:36.380> kick

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
and drums it's a very very good kick

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.730 
and drums it's a very very good kick
drum<00:02:36.800> mic<00:02:37.010> for<00:02:37.160> example<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:38.780> also<00:02:38.959> very<00:02:39.620> good

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
drum mic for example it's also very good

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.760 
drum mic for example it's also very good
on<00:02:39.860> things<00:02:40.100> like<00:02:40.540> slap<00:02:41.540> bass<00:02:41.750> guitar<00:02:42.140> the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
on things like slap bass guitar the

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.250 
on things like slap bass guitar the
hammer<00:02:43.310> action<00:02:43.520> on<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.820> piano<00:02:44.270> anything<00:02:45.140> which

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
hammer action on a piano anything which

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.300 
hammer action on a piano anything which
you're<00:02:45.440> trying<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.650> pick<00:02:45.770> up<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.010> percussive

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
you're trying to pick up the percussive

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.280 
you're trying to pick up the percussive
element<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.630> mighty<00:02:47.810> more<00:02:48.020> years

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
element of this is the mighty more years

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.220 
element of this is the mighty more years
and<00:02:49.000> alongside<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.450> it's<00:02:50.690> also<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.959> very<00:02:51.110> good

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
and alongside that it's also a very good

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.130 
and alongside that it's also a very good
rap<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.830> voice<00:02:52.730> over<00:02:52.970> microphone<00:02:53.480> people

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
rap and voice over microphone people

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.470 
rap and voice over microphone people
tend<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.560> forget<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:55.370> speech<00:02:55.760> is<00:02:56.120> very

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
tend to forget that speech is very

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.020 
tend to forget that speech is very
percussive<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:57.530> P's<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:57.890> T's<00:02:58.400> things<00:02:58.820> like

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
percussive so P's and T's things like

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.760 
percussive so P's and T's things like
that<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.630> kind<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.840> things<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.320> miss<00:03:00.590> if

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
that make the sound intelligible those

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.330 
that make the sound intelligible those
are<00:03:05.870> those<00:03:06.230> are<00:03:06.290> percussive<00:03:06.800> elements<00:03:07.190> that

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
are those are percussive elements that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.600 
are those are percussive elements that
make<00:03:07.520> speech<00:03:07.880> really<00:03:08.860> understandable<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.340> so
