 Hello everyone on Alexander Channel in brest 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.540
 Today I got a repair but so 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.690
 gadgets 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.660
 26 with a removable cartridge said not 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.600
 running some of the times modes 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.600
 check set the hit mode 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.539
 set the word drilling mode also beats 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.380
 just drilling works well 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.800
 Naturally as the first thing 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:53.520
 remove the mode switch is done 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:54.149
 we can easily see it 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 breakdown 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.940
 namely our metal that's it 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.520
 the guide is bent on one side 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.719
 broken down the body it usually happens 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.020
 then when a person 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:13.499
 flips position modes sense not 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.630
 waiting for the puncher to stop here 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:17.399
 new us that is on the one hand the body 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.959
 from the second side 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.810
 naturally perpendicular up 

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:25.020
 looks I think replacing this part in 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.689
 this will be enough perforators because 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:39.029
 here we have two guides 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:40.140
 whole let's check well after 

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:45.560
 replacements 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:54.420
 so we set the blow mode works 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:55.830
 bore drilling earned and also 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.410
 often for fun on these fixes 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.440
 enable so much so why because of this 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.720
 glands did not work one of the modes 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.520
 didn't work right here because 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.870
 sixes he is worth such a plan shaft 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.989
 similar and depending on its position 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.970
 certain mode is activated and if 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.130
 suppose instead of this position here we 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.290
 let him down a little or a bit 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.390
 can raise one of the modes 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.910
 work wrong that is when 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.420
 piece of iron arched she guides 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.640
 pushed a little bit wrong as it should 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.880
 because of this, one of the modes worked 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.019
 wrong that is because of such little things 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.420
 226 punch doesn't work, I hope 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.790
 the video was helpful so subscribe 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.000
 on my channel commenting video 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.000
 enough
