00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.900
 can quietly move the tablet 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.330
 carrying a new one there may be 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.640
 instability on the screen because it is 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.130
 carrying here then I can 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.050
 work normal without any problems 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.190
 this video here will be divided into two 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.649
 parts 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.300
 connecting loading and then disrupting 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.060
 when they have 100% and I'll show them to 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.739
 You what happens with 100% I go 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.750
 tell the tablet now 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.750
 Let's go off here ok 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.640
 it will enter the loading screen 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.320
 carrying dollar how long should I 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.270
 denied these people when I 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.270
 we can leave in the first each 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.010
 the first load is independent of the 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.100
 first of the other loads when it arrives 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.510
 in 100% here you can now disconnect the 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.820
 car because it has already loaded and will not 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.520
 load more than touch 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.500
 then this one in a moment and he takes 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.780
 and it totally erases this, it 's just for 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.380
 show that it is charging a touch 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.380

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.000

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.910
 happens when we say connect the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.680
 cable that with it 100% and if it drops the battery 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.840
