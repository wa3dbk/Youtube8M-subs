00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.500
 Hello, I am a Wiwi official. 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.200
 Welcome to NiceChord Good Chords 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.680
 Today, I want to tell you what is "terminating" 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.200
 I don't know if you have seen me before. 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.200
 What is the "What is the function of chords"? 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.440
 If not already 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.560
 I recommend you check out the two videos first. 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.900
 Come back to see this one today. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.980
 This way you will be easier to understand today's theme. 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.000
 Back to the topic of termination 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.740
 Many people who play the piano hear the words "terminating" 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.420
 Probably will directly associate the last four chords of Harnon’s scale practice. 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.560
 Even many people think that 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.700
 The four chords are called terminations. 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.980
 But it is not 喔

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.100
 "Termination" is actually what it means literally. 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.900
 Way of termination 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.460
 Or you use a more vernacular way 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.920
 Is used to end a sentence, a paragraph 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.720
 Or the last one or two chords of a piece of music 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.780
 Arrangement 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.740
 There are many kinds of terminations 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.160
 I will introduce two of the most common terminations today. 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.560
 Their Chinese names 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.640
 They are called "positive termination" and "semi-terminating" respectively. 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.880
 The termination of the positive is just saying 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.560
 Chord from the fifth note 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.820
 The termination of the chord received the first tone 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.420
 Or you can use the musician’s jargon 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.540
 Five-level chords are terminated by a first-order chord 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.480
 Then the music department likes the chord progression with Roman numerals. 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.880
 So you often see that we write it like this 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.260
 If it is converted to C major, 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.020
 That is the G chord or the G7 chord 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.180
 Received a C chord 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.660
 If you have a good chord movie before, 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.900
 You must know that I said that G7 is connected to C. 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.560
 There will be a feeling of relief 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.200
 Then you carry out this chord with a feeling of relief. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.120
 Put it at the end of a sentence 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.500
 It sounds like it’s very... It’s really over. 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 Listen to this example 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.400
 Note that the last two chords are G7 to C 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.720
 It creates a feeling of ending 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.620
 So this piece of music doesn’t continue after that. 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.840
 Don't feel very strange 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.060
 You listen again 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.560
 This is the positive termination 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.140
 It will make a feeling of ending 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.120
 Next is semi-terminating 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.640
 Semi-terminating is saying 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.820
 Finally stopped at the fifth chord 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.640
 Or the termination of a five-level chord 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.860
 In the case of C major, it means 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.940
 Finally stop at the end of the G or G7 chord 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.720
 But you remember my previous video saying 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.120
 Does the G or G7 chord cause a feeling that it is not over yet? 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.560
 If the last chord at the end of your sentence is G or G7 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.500
 It sounds like there is a feeling that halfway through is not over yet 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.940
 Listen to this example 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.780
 So it will be called semi-terminating 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.920
 Because it has a feeling of going half way 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.720
 So it looks like this piece of music 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.660
 I must be followed by another sentence. 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.740
 Then end with a positive termination 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.620
 It sounds like a complete feeling 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.040
 You have to pay attention 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.580
 Caused by the G7 chord at the end of our first line 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.100
 Still not finished feeling 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.660
 There is also the second line ending with G7 connected to C. 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.420
 The feeling of ending 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.500
 The above is the last episode of today's termination course. 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.520
 In addition to positive termination and semi-terminating 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.540
 What other termination methods do we have? 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.620
 This is going to wait for the next episode and continue to talk~
