00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.380 
tops out at 220 miles an hour and is
apparently<00:01:37.560> faster<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.970> TOR<00:01:39.240> know

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
apparently faster than these in TOR know

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.149 
apparently faster than these in TOR know
which<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.750> well<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:40.530> pretty<00:01:40.710> damn<00:01:40.950> fast

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
which is well that's pretty damn fast

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.850 
which is well that's pretty damn fast
and<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.590> twin-turbocharged<00:01:43.590> v8

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and I think it is a twin-turbocharged v8

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.319 
and I think it is a twin-turbocharged v8
with<00:01:44.070> an<00:01:44.189> electric<00:01:44.579> motor<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.060> just

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
with an electric motor in there just

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.749 
with an electric motor in there just

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
and I'll have a look at the wiki because

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.979 
and I'll have a look at the wiki because
I'm<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.740> little<00:02:08.250> nerd<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.599> apparently

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
I'm a little nerd and it apparently

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.300 
I'm a little nerd and it apparently
turns<00:02:10.410> out<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
turns out that the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.699 
turns out that the
is<00:02:11.400> from<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.760> car<00:02:12.030> called<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.300> Falcon<00:02:12.930> f7<00:02:13.110> now<00:02:13.680> I

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
is from a car called the Falcon f7 now I

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.350 
is from a car called the Falcon f7 now I
have<00:02:13.950> never<00:02:14.250> heard<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.700> car<00:02:14.910> before<00:02:15.060> but

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
have never heard of this car before but

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.790 
have never heard of this car before but
it<00:02:15.480> looks<00:02:15.690> pretty<00:02:15.870> damn<00:02:16.140> awesome<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:16.770> I

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
it looks pretty damn awesome so I

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.680 
it looks pretty damn awesome so I
probably<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> picture<00:02:18.270> up<00:02:18.330> before<00:02:18.599> you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
probably have a picture up before you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.910 
probably have a picture up before you
here<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.380> look<00:02:19.470> at<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
here for you to have a look at and you

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.530 
here for you to have a look at and you
could<00:02:20.069> compare<00:02:20.220> for<00:02:20.610> yourself<00:02:21.060> but

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
could compare for yourself but

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.199 
could compare for yourself but
apparently<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.069> Falcon<00:02:23.520> f7<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
apparently that is the Falcon f7 on the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.490 
apparently that is the Falcon f7 on the
front<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:24.780> let's<00:02:24.930> talk<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.050> little<00:02:25.140> bit<00:02:25.410> about

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150

some brakes on there we're gonna have a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.270 
some brakes on there we're gonna have a
look<00:03:03.870> at<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.049> bumpers<00:03:04.620> let's<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.099> look

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
look at the bumpers let's have a look

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.800 
look at the bumpers let's have a look
right<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.640> we<00:03:05.730> got<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:06.060> with<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.390> cannons

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
right so we got that with the cannons

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.630 
right so we got that with the cannons
and<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.110> front<00:03:07.380> splitter<00:03:07.739> we<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.549> one

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and the front splitter we have that one

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.009 
and the front splitter we have that one
which<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.910> exactly<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.360> same<00:03:09.510> with<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.720> carbon

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
which is exactly the same with a carbon

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.550 
which is exactly the same with a carbon
1<00:03:10.230> i'm<00:03:10.680> gonna<00:03:11.130> go<00:03:11.340> with<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:12.299> one<00:03:12.360> now<00:03:12.720> all

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
1 i'm gonna go with that one now all

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.620 
1 i'm gonna go with that one now all
this<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.489> hard<00:03:14.700> choice<00:03:14.880> because<00:03:15.329> i<00:03:15.359> think

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
this is a hard choice because i think

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.020 
this is a hard choice because i think
this<00:03:16.200> one<00:03:16.260> whatever<00:03:17.160> secondary<00:03:17.640> color<00:03:17.880> you

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
this one whatever secondary color you

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.729 
this one whatever secondary color you
have<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.450> will<00:03:18.600> change<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.350> one<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:19.709> i

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
have it will change it to that one so i

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.009 
have it will change it to that one so i
think<00:03:19.859> i'm<00:03:20.100> gonna<00:03:20.220> go<00:03:20.489> with<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:21.510> secondary

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
think i'm gonna go with the secondary

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.360 
think i'm gonna go with the secondary

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.369 
then I'd say they look more like yeah I
think<00:04:30.969> they<00:04:31.120> look<00:04:31.240> more<00:04:31.419> like<00:04:31.479> those<00:04:31.780> okay<00:04:32.319> so

these are the rims are probably by the

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.879
