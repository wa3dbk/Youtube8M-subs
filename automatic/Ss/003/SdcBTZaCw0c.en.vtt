I'm<00:02:13.800> talking<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.550> military<00:02:14.940> class

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
I'm talking about the military class

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.949 
I'm talking about the military class
high-quality<00:02:17.400> okay<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.120> low<00:02:18.300> profile<00:02:18.810> as

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
high-quality okay and low profile as

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.869 
high-quality okay and low profile as
well<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.319> they<00:02:19.440> don't<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.860> way<00:02:20.099> with

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
well so they don't get in the way with

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.300 
well so they don't get in the way with
your<00:02:21.480> large<00:02:21.870> CPU<00:02:22.470> cooler<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:22.980> that's<00:02:23.040> really

really<00:04:07.260> like<00:04:07.410> about<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.829> bias<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.880> the

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
really like about this bias this is the

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.430 
really like about this bias this is the
new<00:04:09.120> generation<00:04:09.299> bias<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.079> can<00:04:10.200> use<00:04:10.319> your

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
new generation bias you can use your

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.409 
new generation bias you can use your
mouse<00:04:10.650> or<00:04:10.889> you<00:04:10.950> can<00:04:11.069> use<00:04:11.190> your<00:04:11.310> keyboard<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:12.209> go

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
mouse or you can use your keyboard so go

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.170 
mouse or you can use your keyboard so go
through<00:04:12.630> all<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.810> different<00:04:12.989> options<00:04:13.290> I

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
through all the different options I

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.940 
through all the different options I
basically<00:04:15.180> created<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.690> second<00:04:16.169> video<00:04:16.410> that

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
basically created a second video that

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.940 
basically created a second video that
gives<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.340> all<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.700> benchmarks<00:04:18.090> based<00:04:18.720> on

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
gives you all the benchmarks based on

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.800 
gives you all the benchmarks based on
4.7<00:04:19.950> gigahertz<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.639> got<00:04:20.880> out<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.510> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
4.7 gigahertz that I got out of the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.680 
4.7 gigahertz that I got out of the
Intel<00:04:22.550> 2500<00:04:23.550> kcp<00:04:24.240> you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
Intel 2500 kcp you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.140 
Intel 2500 kcp you
okay<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.560> went<00:04:26.010> through<00:04:26.160> all<00:04:26.370> these<00:04:26.610> options

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
okay so I went through all these options

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.440 
okay so I went through all these options
which<00:04:27.300> are<00:04:27.420> very<00:04:27.690> thorough<00:04:28.440> very<00:04:28.710> complete

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
which are very thorough very complete

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.230 
which are very thorough very complete
set<00:04:30.450> up<00:04:30.570> my<00:04:30.810> voltages<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:32.070> course<00:04:32.430> adjusted

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
set up my voltages of course adjusted

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.870 
set up my voltages of course adjusted
all<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.960> options<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.520> was<00:04:35.520> causing

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
all of the options that was causing

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.030 
all of the options that was causing
throttling<00:04:36.660> or<00:04:36.810> power<00:04:37.020> saving<00:04:37.470> features<00:04:37.860> that

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
throttling or power saving features that

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.160 
throttling or power saving features that
disabled<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.670> lot<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:38.940> options<00:04:39.420> in<00:04:39.600> there<00:04:39.780> so

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
disabled a lot of options in there so

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.720 
disabled a lot of options in there so
that<00:04:40.320> way<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.470> could<00:04:40.590> do<00:04:40.830> my<00:04:40.950> overclocking<00:04:41.640> and

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
that way I could do my overclocking and

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.770 
that way I could do my overclocking and
get<00:04:41.910> stable<00:04:42.420> results<00:04:43.250> low<00:04:44.480> temperatures<00:04:45.480> and

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
get stable results low temperatures and

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.200 
get stable results low temperatures and
lower<00:04:46.590> voltages<00:04:47.280> that's<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.730> key<00:04:47.940> thing<00:04:48.180> here

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
lower voltages that's the key thing here

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.820 
lower voltages that's the key thing here
it's<00:04:48.510> not<00:04:48.600> about<00:04:48.660> overclocking<00:04:49.440> like<00:04:49.560> crazy

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
it's not about overclocking like crazy

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.410 
it's not about overclocking like crazy
like<00:04:50.100> I<00:04:50.250> mentioned<00:04:50.610> earlier<00:04:50.730> in<00:04:50.970> my<00:04:51.090> previous

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
like I mentioned earlier in my previous

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.410 
like I mentioned earlier in my previous
videos<00:04:51.870> it's<00:04:52.350> about<00:04:52.560> overclocking<00:04:53.100> smart<00:04:53.880> you

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
videos it's about overclocking smart you

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.240 
videos it's about overclocking smart you
can<00:04:54.630> use<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:54.900> overclocking<00:04:55.350> genie<00:04:55.770> which

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
can use the overclocking genie which

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.520 
can use the overclocking genie which
basically<00:04:56.670> you<00:04:56.880> press<00:04:57.150> it<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.480> in<00:04:57.870> one<00:04:58.110> second

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
basically you press it and in one second

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.500 
basically you press it and in one second
it<00:04:58.620> calculates<00:04:59.160> all<00:04:59.430> of<00:04:59.610> these<00:04:59.850> values<00:05:00.300> you

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
it calculates all of these values you

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.050 
it calculates all of these values you
can<00:05:00.840> get<00:05:01.050> 4.2<00:05:01.740> gigahertz<00:05:02.040> no<00:05:02.400> problem<00:05:02.850> out<00:05:02.940> of

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
can get 4.2 gigahertz no problem out of

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.120 
can get 4.2 gigahertz no problem out of
the<00:05:03.150> CPU<00:05:03.600> on<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:04.320> fly<00:05:04.530> there<00:05:04.830> with<00:05:05.010> that

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
the CPU on the fly there with that

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.010 
the CPU on the fly there with that
overclocking<00:05:05.820> genie<00:05:06.060> button<00:05:06.510> that's<00:05:06.750> on<00:05:06.900> the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
overclocking genie button that's on the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.200 
overclocking genie button that's on the
motherboard<00:05:07.290> or<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:08.430> can<00:05:08.610> go<00:05:08.760> here<00:05:09.030> through

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210
