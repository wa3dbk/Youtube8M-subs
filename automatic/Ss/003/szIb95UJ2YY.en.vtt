00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
a nice build up to the very first verse

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.790 
a nice build up to the very first verse
of<00:04:36.340> this

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800

kind<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.210> ring<00:04:47.479> out<00:04:47.690> almost<00:04:48.199> to<00:04:48.289> the<00:04:48.409> point

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
kind of ring out almost to the point

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.089 
kind of ring out almost to the point
where<00:04:48.919> they<00:04:49.340> are<00:04:49.580> like<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.180> drone<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:51.259> just<00:04:52.009> the

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
where they are like a drone and just the

not<00:05:18.740> only<00:05:18.770> did<00:05:19.159> I<00:05:19.250> like<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.699> way<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:20.150> the

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
not only did I like the way that the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.050 
not only did I like the way that the
reverb<00:05:20.900> made<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.889> vocals<00:05:22.310> sound<00:05:22.490> is<00:05:22.729> slightly

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
reverb made the vocals sound is slightly

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.719 
reverb made the vocals sound is slightly
bouncy<00:05:23.630> just<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:23.900> very<00:05:24.080> nice<00:05:24.229> bouncy<00:05:24.770> echo<00:05:25.159> but

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
bouncy just a very nice bouncy echo but

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.330 
bouncy just a very nice bouncy echo but
I<00:05:25.940> really<00:05:26.389> liked<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.930> vocal<00:05:27.380> delivery<00:05:27.560> the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
I really liked the vocal delivery the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.529 
I really liked the vocal delivery the
most<00:05:28.639> I<00:05:28.880> think<00:05:29.060> that<00:05:29.180> was<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.389> most

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
most I think that was the most

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.170 
most I think that was the most
impressive<00:05:29.840> aspect<00:05:30.289> of<00:05:30.830> this<00:05:31.340> track<00:05:31.699> I<00:05:31.940> like

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
impressive aspect of this track I like

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.270 
impressive aspect of this track I like
how<00:05:32.360> Michael<00:05:32.780> just<00:05:33.380> doesn't<00:05:33.710> stick<00:05:34.069> to<00:05:34.250> a

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
how Michael just doesn't stick to a

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.189 
how Michael just doesn't stick to a
tempo<00:05:34.789> just<00:05:35.120> doesn't<00:05:35.360> stick<00:05:35.599> to<00:05:35.719> a<00:05:35.750> simple

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 
tempo just doesn't stick to a simple

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.040 
tempo just doesn't stick to a simple
melody<00:05:36.440> but<00:05:37.219> it's<00:05:37.580> more<00:05:38.120> as<00:05:38.240> if<00:05:38.419> he's<00:05:38.629> doing

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
melody but it's more as if he's doing

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.100 
melody but it's more as if he's doing
spoken<00:05:39.860> word<00:05:40.219> on<00:05:40.580> this<00:05:41.180> song<00:05:41.509> I<00:05:41.810> think<00:05:41.870> the

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
spoken word on this song I think the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.719 
spoken word on this song I think the
only<00:05:42.229> aspect<00:05:42.800> of<00:05:42.889> this<00:05:42.979> track<00:05:43.250> that<00:05:43.430> I<00:05:43.460> didn't

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
only aspect of this track that I didn't

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.309 
only aspect of this track that I didn't
really<00:05:43.849> like<00:05:43.969> and<00:05:44.330> you<00:05:44.389> guys<00:05:44.539> are<00:05:44.719> free<00:05:45.080> to

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
really like the build-up into the chorus

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.430 
really like the build-up into the chorus
where<00:05:52.460> the<00:05:52.550> guitar<00:05:52.849> was<00:05:53.029> like<00:05:53.180> Danny<00:05:53.539> I<00:05:53.779> can

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
where the guitar was like Danny I can

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.320 
where the guitar was like Danny I can

hookah bar harem feel that this song has
and<00:06:07.789> though<00:06:08.360> it's<00:06:08.690> okay<00:06:08.840> to<00:06:09.319> kind<00:06:09.500> of<00:06:09.529> break

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
and though it's okay to kind of break

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.499 
and though it's okay to kind of break
away<00:06:09.860> from<00:06:10.009> that<00:06:10.159> it<00:06:10.639> does<00:06:10.969> it<00:06:11.120> at<00:06:11.240> a<00:06:11.270> really

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:11.509 
away from that it does it at a really

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.589 
away from that it does it at a really
breakneck<00:06:12.139> pace<00:06:12.440> just<00:06:12.770> BAM<00:06:13.580> introduces<00:06:14.449> it

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
breakneck pace just BAM introduces it

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.649 
breakneck pace just BAM introduces it
and<00:06:14.810> it's<00:06:14.960> kind<00:06:15.139> of<00:06:15.169> a<00:06:15.259> hard<00:06:15.529> wall<00:06:15.919> and<00:06:16.449> to<00:06:17.449> me

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
and it's kind of a hard wall and to me

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.230 
and it's kind of a hard wall and to me
just<00:06:18.139> not<00:06:18.800> not<00:06:19.039> a<00:06:19.069> very<00:06:19.340> good<00:06:19.490> way<00:06:19.669> of<00:06:19.699> breaking

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
just not not a very good way of breaking

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.909 
just not not a very good way of breaking
that<00:06:20.389> ice<00:06:20.599> I<00:06:20.990> did<00:06:21.229> like<00:06:21.380> the<00:06:21.529> hook<00:06:21.710> though

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919

which<00:06:22.250> for<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.669> most<00:06:22.849> part<00:06:23.150> is<00:06:23.389> built<00:06:24.319> up<00:06:24.500> of

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
which for the most part is built up of

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.120 
which for the most part is built up of
the<00:06:24.770> lyric<00:06:25.130> Discoverer<00:06:26.229> but<00:06:27.229> despite<00:06:27.590> that<00:06:27.620> is

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
the lyric Discoverer but despite that is

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.950 
the lyric Discoverer but despite that is
catchy<00:06:28.580> as<00:06:28.819> hell<00:06:29.060> I<00:06:29.240> could<00:06:29.449> definitely<00:06:29.599> see
