00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.999 

hello<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.839> William<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.499> David<00:00:10.799> from<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:11.009 
hello this is William and David from the

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.890 
hello this is William and David from the
Shepherd<00:00:11.490> school<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.179> when<00:00:12.450> my<00:00:12.570> nephew

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
Shepherd school and when my nephew

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.709 
Shepherd school and when my nephew
William<00:00:13.259> came<00:00:13.530> over<00:00:13.860> he<00:00:14.789> was<00:00:14.940> telling<00:00:15.299> me<00:00:15.329> that

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
William came over he was telling me that

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.580 
William came over he was telling me that
coca-cola<00:00:16.590> takes<00:00:17.520> rust<00:00:17.910> off<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.540> things<00:00:19.290> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
coca-cola takes rust off of things and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.800 
coca-cola takes rust off of things and
so<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:20.460> wanted<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.820> make<00:00:20.970> an<00:00:21.090> experiment<00:00:21.360> of<00:00:21.690> it

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
so we wanted to make an experiment of it

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:39.049 
so we wanted to make an experiment of it
so<00:00:21.990> we've<00:00:22.140> been<00:00:22.290> rust<00:00:22.530> in<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.920> nails<00:00:38.059> and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
so we've been rust in some nails and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.479 
so we've been rust in some nails and
William<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.749> putting<00:00:40.260> two<00:00:40.649> nails<00:00:41.039> in<00:00:41.539> each

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.309 

we're<00:00:47.489> using<00:00:47.699> waters<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.420> control<00:00:48.870> because

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:49.319 
we're using waters in control because

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:54.680 
we're using waters in control because
it's<00:00:49.530> an<00:00:49.649> experiment<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:52.280> we<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it's an experiment and we think that the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.040 
it's an experiment and we think that the
carbonic<00:00:55.260> acid<00:00:55.769> in<00:00:55.979> the<00:00:56.399> coke<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.809> Diet

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
carbonic acid in the coke and the Diet

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.040 
carbonic acid in the coke and the Diet
Mountain<00:00:58.170> Dew<00:00:58.729> will<00:00:59.729> take<00:01:00.179> the<00:01:00.329> most<00:01:00.479> rust<00:01:00.809> off

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
Mountain Dew will take the most rust off

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.349 
Mountain Dew will take the most rust off
we're<00:01:01.440> gonna<00:01:01.589> come<00:01:01.920> back<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:02.699> 24<00:01:03.329> hours

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
we're gonna come back in about 24 hours

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.990 
we're gonna come back in about 24 hours
and<00:01:03.929> see<00:01:04.649> which<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.100> takes<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.579> most<00:01:05.700> rust

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and see which one takes the most rust

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.810 
and see which one takes the most rust
off<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.899> been<00:01:07.079> 24<00:01:07.619> hours<00:01:07.680> actually<00:01:08.579> a<00:01:08.610> little

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
off it's been 24 hours actually a little

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.550 
off it's been 24 hours actually a little
longer<00:01:09.000> than<00:01:09.210> 24<00:01:09.540> hours<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.110> got<00:01:10.259> busy

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
longer than 24 hours because we got busy

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.440 
longer than 24 hours because we got busy
doing<00:01:10.770> over<00:01:10.950> stuff<00:01:11.219> we're<00:01:12.000> gonna<00:01:12.149> pull<00:01:12.329> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
doing over stuff we're gonna pull the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.870 
doing over stuff we're gonna pull the
nails<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.930> water<00:01:13.140> first

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
nails out of the water first

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.279 
nails out of the water first
do<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.000> think<00:01:15.149> any<00:01:15.360> rest<00:01:15.600> has<00:01:15.780> come<00:01:15.960> off<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
do we think any rest has come off of the

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:24.830 
do we think any rest has come off of the
nails<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.740> water<00:01:23.299> in<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> water

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
nails in the water in the water

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.959 
nails in the water in the water
are<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.170> any<00:01:25.289> better<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:26.430> don't<00:01:26.490> look<00:01:26.700> any

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
are they any better they don't look any

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:38.300 
are they any better they don't look any
better<00:01:36.109> no<00:01:37.109> the<00:01:37.409> water<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.859> didn't<00:01:38.189> take

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
better no the water really didn't take

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.230 
better no the water really didn't take
any<00:01:38.520> rust<00:01:38.759> off<00:01:38.969> before<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> water<00:01:40.969> that<00:01:41.969> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
any rust off before the water that that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.179 
any rust off before the water that that
came<00:01:42.719> from<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.350> water<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.710> think

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
came from the water I think

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.149 
came from the water I think
okay<00:01:44.759> we'll<00:01:45.000> pour<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.270> out<00:01:45.950> next<00:01:46.950> we're

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
okay we'll pour that out next we're

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.249 
okay we'll pour that out next we're
gonna<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.520> mountain<00:01:47.670> Dew<00:01:50.990> get<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.109> ones

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
gonna do the mountain Dew get the ones

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.380 
gonna do the mountain Dew get the ones
on<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> dude<00:01:53.359> that's<00:01:54.359> Diet<00:01:54.780> Mountain<00:01:54.929> Dew

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
on that dude that's Diet Mountain Dew

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.620 
on that dude that's Diet Mountain Dew
look<00:01:57.390> at<00:01:57.479> those<00:01:57.600> nails<00:01:59.060> there's<00:02:00.060> no<00:02:00.210> rust<00:02:00.450> on

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630

not a whole lot not as good as a dad
Mountain<00:02:28.480> Dew<00:02:28.600> surprising<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.530> would

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
Mountain Dew surprising that I would

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.600 
Mountain Dew surprising that I would
have<00:02:29.890> thought<00:02:30.040> those<00:02:30.250> would<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.489> been

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
have thought those would have been

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.600 
have thought those would have been
saying<00:02:34.650> he<00:02:35.650> doesn't<00:02:35.830> want<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.130> do<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.310> apple

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
saying he doesn't want to do the apple

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.880 
saying he doesn't want to do the apple
cider<00:02:36.760> vinegar<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.510> I'll<00:02:37.660> be<00:02:40.260> who<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.470> cut<00:02:41.709> on

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
cider vinegar so I'll be who the cut on

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.009 
cider vinegar so I'll be who the cut on
my<00:02:42.070> finger<00:02:42.130> is

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
my finger is

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.740 
my finger is
smarten<00:02:45.269> okay<00:02:46.680> look<00:02:47.680> at<00:02:47.800> that

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
smarten okay look at that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:03:00.809 
smarten okay look at that
no<00:02:49.750> rust<00:02:50.080> no<00:02:52.860> rust<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:56.340> we've<00:02:57.340> got<00:02:59.819> that
