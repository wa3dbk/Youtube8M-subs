00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi how are you I hope you are very very 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:08.700
 very well 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 help 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.240
 and they will wonder why I have an oven 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.950
 a table and everything here is good because 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.290
 Now let's start cooking a 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.450
 bit because I'm close to 10 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.820
 May apart that is a good idea 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.100
 to give the groom the girlfriend the friend 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.720
 because not because friends never 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.149
 we remember them more than the new 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.250
 video of the new see so also to 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.329
 pamper us a little bit 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.660
 even know how to make a cake 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.680
 easy without oven this stay in the video 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.930
 good the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.340
 need are some collections of bimbo 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.650
 that you find them in any 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.190
 any store to me cost me like 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.190
 10 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 we are going to need cream too 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.690
 I have this chantilly 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.409
 strawberries seals or the fruit that you 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.340
 you want to put in 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.399
 a knife 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.020
 and a spoon and ready 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.450
 good and now the procedure is the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.000
 next the first step we're going to 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.740
 take out our limbo mattresses and the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.740
 let's go halfway like this 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.909
 awakening hope completely but 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.870
 well more or less like that we are going to take 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.070
 our chantilly our bitumen 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.070
 and we will not give 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.850
 at the moment of the people 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.850
 because we are going to give it 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 together 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.400
 once 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.050
 let's put the tip that you choose in 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.600
 this case 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.710
 and we are imposing as you want then 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.710
 the order does not matter much 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.060
 ready once we have already covered the 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.680
 capital and below we put it on top 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.810
 of strawberries we put you with a little 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.700
 more of chantilly cream as I want 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.129
 I say so that the bread 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.569
 well a little bit like hunger 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.569
 taps to get wet 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.290
 let's make our bread last 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.140
 let's decorate book we're going to decorate 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.030
 with the same chantilly cream and with 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.400
 Completito chocolates although the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.550
 I bought in sparkle so super rich and they 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.840
 I will put up 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.540
 to decorate it let's do what 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.750
 next let's take chantilly cream 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.880
 obviously 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.390
 and we will put it on if super 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.390
 generously 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.319
 we will go down like this 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.170
 I know I'm not a chef and studied the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.659
 technical career in gastronomy ni 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.489
 I intend for you to do it but 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.640
 I'm just giving you my opinion as 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.769
 I would do this what I would give as 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.409
 that I would do and therefore nothing I hope that 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.239
 like and why you do what's tutorials 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.010
