00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
do a quick demo on the click up and also

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.670 
do a quick demo on the click up and also
doing<00:00:11.430> a<00:00:11.490> dynamic<00:00:11.670> okay<00:00:12.449> you<00:00:13.080> see<00:00:13.260> the<00:00:13.379> my<00:00:13.530> end

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
doing a dynamic okay you see the my end

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.990 
doing a dynamic okay you see the my end
of<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.889> rope<00:00:14.039> and<00:00:14.250> we're<00:00:14.580> going<00:00:14.699> to<00:00:14.730> consider

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
of the rope and we're going to consider

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.630 
of the rope and we're going to consider
this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.510> feeding<00:00:15.930> ok<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> demo<00:00:17.310> I'm

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
this is my feeding ok this is a demo I'm

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.340 
this is my feeding ok this is a demo I'm
not<00:00:17.910> wearing<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> harness<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.780> we're<00:00:19.230> going

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
not wearing the harness and we're going

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.980 
not wearing the harness and we're going
to<00:00:19.380> show<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.740> how<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.700> locking<00:00:21.150> works<00:00:21.360> now

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
to show you how this locking works now

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.040 
to show you how this locking works now
first<00:00:22.290> we're<00:00:22.530> going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.950> traditional

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
first we're going to do the traditional

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.890 
first we're going to do the traditional
like<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.200> ATC<00:00:25.860> okay<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.300> basically<00:00:27.720> you

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
like the ATC okay so that basically you

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800 
like the ATC okay so that basically you
have<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.230> break<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.950> ok<00:00:29.280> so<00:00:29.570> we're<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.690> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
have to break it ok so we're going to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.180 
have to break it ok so we're going to
loop<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:33.020> in<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.289> video<00:00:34.500> always<00:00:34.829> my

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
loop this and in this video always my

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.560 
loop this and in this video always my
right<00:00:35.430> side<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.970> feeding<00:00:36.180> okay<00:00:36.570> unless<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
right side is the feeding okay unless I

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.410 
right side is the feeding okay unless I
specify<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.630> it<00:00:40.250> slide<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> Rope

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
specify for it slide in here so the Rope

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.030 
specify for it slide in here so the Rope
is<00:00:42.570> passed<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.649> here

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
is passed here and it's right in here

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.590 
is passed here and it's right in here
and<00:00:44.640> bring<00:00:44.880> my<00:00:46.340> heaviness<00:00:47.340> lock<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> little

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and bring my heaviness lock a little

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.690 
and bring my heaviness lock a little
quick<00:00:49.340> all<00:00:50.340> right

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
quick all right

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.310 
quick all right
so<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:53.840> have<00:00:54.840> ability<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.440> move<00:00:57.020> both<00:00:58.020> ways

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so now have ability to move both ways

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.170 
so now have ability to move both ways
like<00:00:58.680> ATC<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.420> lock<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:03.559> it's<00:01:04.559> locked

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
like ATC and you can lock it it's locked

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.749 
like ATC and you can lock it it's locked
okay<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.929> simply<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.709> now<00:01:08.340> we'll<00:01:08.579> go<00:01:08.729> ahead

house<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.240> it's<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.350> hard<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.830> pull<00:02:23.010> away<00:02:23.190> I

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
house I can it's a hard to pull away I

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.620 
house I can it's a hard to pull away I
mean<00:02:24.570> now<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.310> when<00:02:27.090> persons<00:02:27.480> up

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
mean now but I think when persons up

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.690 
mean now but I think when persons up
their<00:02:27.780> weights<00:02:28.230> hundred<00:02:28.500> fifty<00:02:28.680> pounds<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.580> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
their weights hundred fifty pounds on a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.760 
their weights hundred fifty pounds on a
six<00:02:29.880> depends<00:02:30.180> whether<00:02:30.360> it's<00:02:31.260> probably<00:02:31.680> going

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
six depends whether it's probably going

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.950 
six depends whether it's probably going
to<00:02:31.830> move<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:32.880> all<00:02:33.000> know<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> rules

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
to move so and we all know in the rules

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.310 
to move so and we all know in the rules
you<00:02:34.260> cannot<00:02:34.650> let<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.520> rope<00:02:35.880> go<00:02:36.480> from<00:02:37.140> your

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
you cannot let this rope go from your

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.070 
you cannot let this rope go from your
hand<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.310> long<00:02:39.270> as<00:02:39.450> you're<00:02:39.600> holding<00:02:39.930> this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
hand so as long as you're holding this

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.670 
hand so as long as you're holding this
it<00:02:40.410> locks<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:41.540> it's<00:02:42.540> not<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.870> move<00:02:43.050> that's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it locks in it's not in the move that's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.860 
it locks in it's not in the move that's
it<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.190> mean<00:02:44.580> that's<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.030> end<00:02:45.210> of<00:02:45.390> story<00:02:45.720> to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
it I mean that's the end of story to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.220 
it I mean that's the end of story to
that<00:02:45.900> okay<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:48.230> in<00:02:49.230> order<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:51.020> loose<00:02:52.020> this

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that okay so in order to a loose this

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.600 
that okay so in order to a loose this
back<00:02:52.500> will<00:02:52.770> prove<00:02:53.040> back<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.340> where<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.550> was

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
back will prove back to where it was

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.810 
back will prove back to where it was
before<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.270> when<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> person<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.680> climber<00:02:56.010> is

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
before is when the person the climber is

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.080 
before is when the person the climber is
no<00:02:57.120> longer<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.800> tolling<00:02:58.800> just<00:02:59.100> cable<00:02:59.490> and<00:02:59.670> he's

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
no longer a tolling just cable and he's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.010 
no longer a tolling just cable and he's
climbing<00:03:00.540> up<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.930> it's<00:03:01.080> loose<00:03:01.460> so<00:03:02.930> what<00:03:03.930> you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
climbing up and it's loose so what you

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.780 
climbing up and it's loose so what you
do<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.410> want<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.590> go<00:03:04.740> ahead<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.190> just<00:03:05.340> go

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
do is you want to go ahead and just go

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.110 
do is you want to go ahead and just go
forward<00:03:06.890> now<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:07.980> got<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.160> kind<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.760> push

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
forward now you got a kind of a push

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.720 
forward now you got a kind of a push
hard<00:03:09.390> because<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:10.110> still<00:03:10.350> got<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.730> spring

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
hard because you still got that spring

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.520 
hard because you still got that spring
loaded<00:03:12.000> pieces<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.930> have<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.230> deal<00:03:13.500> with

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
loaded pieces that you have to deal with

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.770 
loaded pieces that you have to deal with
it<00:03:13.830> but<00:03:14.310> once<00:03:14.550> you're<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:14.850> this<00:03:14.970> position<00:03:15.030> this

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
it but once you're in this position this

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.390 
it but once you're in this position this
is<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.110> neutral<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:18.230> lose<00:03:19.400> like

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
is like a neutral you know lose like

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.640 
is like a neutral you know lose like
this<00:03:20.540> either<00:03:21.540> way<00:03:21.870> you're<00:03:22.440> back<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.950> again

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
this either way you're back in again

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.670 
this either way you're back in again
something<00:03:25.650> happens<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.520> coming<00:03:26.970> down<00:03:27.680> lock

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
something happens is coming down lock

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.080 
something happens is coming down lock
and<00:03:29.360> that's<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:34.459> so<00:03:35.459> that's<00:03:35.700> how<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.880> works

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
and that's it so that's how it works

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.250 
and that's it so that's how it works
very<00:03:36.660> simple<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:39.030> should<00:03:39.570> be<00:03:39.660> do<00:03:39.810> this<00:03:40.020> on

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
very simple and you should be do this on

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.690 
very simple and you should be do this on
the<00:03:40.350> fly<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.610> obviously<00:03:43.550> when<00:03:44.550> you're

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
the fly and obviously when you're

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.449 
the fly and obviously when you're
actually<00:03:46.340> repelling<00:03:47.340> your<00:03:48.270> partner<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:50.220> hold

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
actually repelling your partner you hold

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.100 
actually repelling your partner you hold
this<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:51.020> you<00:03:52.020> are<00:03:52.170> going<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.650> pull<00:03:53.400> down<00:03:53.430> and

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
this and you are going to pull down and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.949 
this and you are going to pull down and
pull<00:03:55.110> down<00:03:55.350> your<00:03:56.100> basic<00:03:56.520> and<00:03:56.670> releasing<00:03:57.270> the

pull down your basic and releasing the
