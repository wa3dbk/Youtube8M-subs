 But beauty, people, let's go, it's just the galley. 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.660

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.729
 Come on then it 's the guys that make it. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.799
 this race I recommend the xf of the galera 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.049
 but then you have another car 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.229
 raid you can with them but me 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.549
 I advise you to do it though 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.340
 There are 77 people playing and let's go there. 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.680
 we started here let's try 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.579
 keep this first place right 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:41.130
 Let's do it, it's nothing big. 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.479
 If you want to do it, you can only steal and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.740
 underneath it will not make a difference 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.810
 none 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.810
 so much that neither it gains much time 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.110
 but also let's go the interesting one of that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.869
 here it really is saae says it was 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.659
 what I did there then it's already there guys 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.530
 Come on, the guys are already insane and behind. 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.140

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.050
 Give a little something here and it's only if you do not 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.860
 Can you give it all to do first 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.350
 beauty people 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.850
 but in case you can not, you give in 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.940
 one a stop there behind and go there already 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.590
 Let's spend here, it 's good. We're in. 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.709
 first and iac 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.709
 we did everything first quiet are 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.900
 two laps there and there's just like me 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.440
 I left pattern as I ran the ghost 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.690
 guys 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.670
 but you can let every season go 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.420
 with a little person that for having a five 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.400
 people 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.440
 You'll be able to do it well. 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.730
 standard without much problem, right? 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.090
 but if you already there do more with here 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.860
 I even made seven here, but I would 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.050
 how to do standard but I think it's already 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.500
 stay a little is a little knee to you 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:11.459
 the picking in the back mother did not face 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.519
 know how to make old but do what right 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.220
 come on let's try to do everything 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.090
 Right here, the guys, all giving 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.010
 back to office 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.650
 I'll make it up then I want to. 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.380
 to see you turn around your paulo 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.630
 come on, let's continue here while 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.230
 If you have to turn the whole way down, do not 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.360
 soft 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.080
 we are already going to complete here the first 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.330
 Come back and we'll act for the second time there. 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.540
 Face that hockey in the tree. Come on. 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.540
 come on 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.620
 now here it is quiet here is the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.250
 building the most is to do the 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.830
 Arraiá and there are many people who will not 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.590
 It's got problems here, it's okay. 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.410
 and sometimes it's kind of hard for a baby. 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.200
 but this is a matter of practice the bank is 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.830
 As soon as you get agents, there you go. 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.810
 Quiet, so let's go. 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.880
 here on the second lap when showing here 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.120
 for you, how are you going to do it? 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.609
 you do not want to do 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.470
 the boot and there made here below but 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.449
 It does not give much time difference is not 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.790
 that anyone who falls there will fall into the 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.770
 also glue then does not do much 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.740
 difference let's not go there 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.030
 here we go already go part here again 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.220
 pro to overcome the raid here the double and I 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.169
 I'll also try to give a changed one 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.050
 In this race, the guys from time to time 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.919
 is to leave something different in it 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.560
 also 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.750
 and also to create other races of this 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.770
 Kind here more or less of yourself 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.630
 style 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:56.510
 Wow al old there now here 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.889
 Let's go and let's go back there, man. 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.800

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.660
 now just get it here but guys 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.150
 good to do everything first 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.729
 so guys kind have many 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.120
 difficulties not to do everything from 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.850
 first and have already spent here again 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.080
 now just get the checkpoint here 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:19.250

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.289
 checkpoint and our lady in the palm on the 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.139
 over there 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.760
 now just follow here this sharing of 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.979
 ground road is bravado with the car 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.380
 'superman' is difficult we have to 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.830
 learn to control here because the car 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.810
 super joe padilha's too much 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.470
 superesportivo Escalos too Pacino in 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.419
 north road right then there is that does not 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.260
 to demand a lot of the car, I can not 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.510
 catching too much speed and doing is 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.300
 want to do everything crazy then right? 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.940
 Come on, we'll just come back here in 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.180
 seven guys will want to steal again 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.550
 Let's make a date with Obama Lula. 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.949
 said the neighbor because here who goes 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.310
 to win is by hand 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:17.090
 come is almost over here more 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.770
 a little bit of the race here and I think 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.110
 that will take a while for the staff 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.320
 ending here also has to give a 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.840
 small cut in video 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.080
 wait for the guys to finish our ride 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.000
 mall where the garage is going to steal 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.580

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.840
 a little piece of cake, too. 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.140
 sometimes you can wrap it right in that 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:54.100
 Come on then let's go, let's finish 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.900
