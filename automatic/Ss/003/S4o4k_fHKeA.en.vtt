out<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.540> way<00:01:11.570> it's<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.870> little<00:01:12.080> bit<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.290> a

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
out of the way it's a little bit of a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.740 
out of the way it's a little bit of a
borrowing<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:13.700> time<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.000> decided<00:01:14.300> to

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
instead of doing for three again I went

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.240 
instead of doing for three again I went
five<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.000> four<00:01:20.570> for<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.470> last<00:01:21.680> part<00:01:21.979> of<00:01:22.100> the
