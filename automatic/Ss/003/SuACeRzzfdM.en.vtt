00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.830
 hi to all the grades later 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.019
 eight months finally show them what it is 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.350
 come out of this very bitter kato 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.090
 the blue stops up I prepared 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.160
 this little kit in the sense that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.670
 however few liters of came 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.949
 beer used the t58 as yeast 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.980
 so did not use the yeast is 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.929
 came out of the jar of 58 and a good one 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.239
 yeast that is often used for 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.809
 this type of beer should confer 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.690
 to the beer of spicy scents then 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.480
 on Belgian beers there is very good then 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.629
 added instead of sugar 400 g of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.969
 bigmat dry and 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.610
 candid brown also in this case 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.500
 understood sugar is particularly suitable 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.210
 in this type of beer during the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 fermentation had a problem because 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.489
 we began to feel bad about it 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.050
 that came out of the bubbler indeed 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.149
 felt a smell that was very similar to 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.280
 steals marches 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.890
 some told me that probably 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 badly oxygenated the must after inoculation 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.290
 but it seems unlikely to me 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.080
 because I think when I go to 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.479
 I really oxygenate it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.640
 scrupulous was probably the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.369
 low temperature and the yeast has 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.049
 suffered a little for this fact I have it 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.909
 done in the period in which there was the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.229
 snow the weather was very bad 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.790
 all over Italy 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.460
 in fact I took advantage of the snow that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.520
 had settled on the balcony for 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.860
 cool the must before pouring it 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.290
 in the fermenter however beyond 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.299
 all after the first transfer this 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.520
 bad smell and almost disappeared 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.399
 everything and then in the bottle has disappeared 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.890
 completely then the smell of eggs 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.009
 marches only became a distant memory 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.750
 fortunately more firmly we recommend 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.310
 use 10 grams per liter for the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.750
 karbon action regarding it 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.149
 however, sugar seemed to me 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.939
 exaggerated that this beer anyway 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.369
 requires long maturation times e 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.320
 however he would face the heat 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.239
 summer so it didn't seem the case 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.340
 although still risky because I have 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.420
 used 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.819
 a good 8.8 grams per liter of sugar one 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.620
 quite dangerous quantity though 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.400
 despite everything despite the heat of 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.489
 There have been no this summer 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.319
 explosions in the garage where I keep the barrels 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.599
 also true that it is quite cool there 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.690
 when it was thirty degrees outside 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.790
 I luckily in the garage had one 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.549
 temperature of 23 degrees where I have 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.769
 beer bottles kept 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.560
 visually looks very good is one 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.049
 nice foam on the nose you immediately feel it 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.500
 spicy or at least that's what I feel 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.690
 which probably just given other 58 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.590
 and there is very good in this kind of 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.170
 beer 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.290
 well sure the beer came very dark 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.709
 and very full-bodied can also be felt in the mouth 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.769
 the spicy and the malt we remember that 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.980
 8-degree beer is around 8 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:11.349
 alcohol but still carry them 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.040
 well in short because very full-bodied 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.690
 let's say from this point of view 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.609
 balanced 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.989
 the only discordant note and I'm not the only one 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.510
 to have noticed this thing is that the 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.540
 beer and very bitter in the sense is a lot 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.760
 bitter if we want to place it precisely is 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.760
 in the style of famous beers 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.310
 of abbey therefore it is more bitter than the gods 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.790
 abbey beers that we are used to 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.519
 drink to taste after all you love 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.790
 but this bitter pleases if I had to do 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.290
 there is really a style discourse 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.239
 very well 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.669
 apart from this what the beer is coming 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.419
 very very good is one of my favorites 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:52.099
 if I didn't have to do it again I would try to do it 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.560
 adding more water to the must then 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:58.160
 lengthening lightning maybe two liters per 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.430
 how to say in hope in the attempt 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.739
 to soften this bitterness a little 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.419
 in my opinion excessive and then for 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.040
 obviously compensate for the density 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.470
 however adding more water 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.139
 would go down anyway to stay 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.040
 however, respect the density 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.530
 I would add more malt extract 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.970
 to preserve even a little the body of 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.620
 this beer 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.259
 in any case a beer that I recommend 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.419
 do maybe with this little change 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.580
 stretching it more water e 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.460
 using malt extract in 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.740
 the grand cru also came a lot 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.560
 good here is perhaps superior to 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.389
 great if it weren't for this bitterness 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.620
 ok that's all guys see you at 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.620
 next beer hello
