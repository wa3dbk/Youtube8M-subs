00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
to land every single shot before and you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.290 
to land every single shot before and you

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
opponent fired so it was kind of risky

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.920

you<00:00:44.129> didn't<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.879> health<00:00:45.360> advantage

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
you didn't have the health advantage

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.190

thousand<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.649> five<00:00:50.250> hundred<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:52.170> would<00:00:52.440> be

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
thousand and five hundred it would be

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.639
