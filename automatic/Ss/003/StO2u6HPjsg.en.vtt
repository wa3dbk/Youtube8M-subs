 a 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.020
 complete web browser is because it allows us bing 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.610
 and pages exactly as we will do with our computer 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.410
 paper 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.830
 then 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.660
 not only is an experience closer to the care of the home computer but also 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.630
 an experience 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.659
 let's say multitasking because a simple click 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.860
 I can 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 inserting the page in the background is the fault of other functions ad 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.530
 example that of the photos 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.930

 machine zoom 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:16.359
 here is the article 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.219
 zooming 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.309
 he went in to see peace as a whole 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:29.720
 fuse very important is that of the presence in this film this phone 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.719
 there is a question there 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.099
 and this allows us for example to immediately process a new chat 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.299
 with just one click I enter and put life has not done is 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.159
 Courier service 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.919
 for example, a friend of mine loves those for it 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.519

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.220
 not to be updated 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.100

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.350
 a contact can also be inserted into your text 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.439

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.859
 here I can call you that I can send a message 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.489

 announced stars we have seen before 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:39.349
 and it will not be distinguished from arrest so it will be possible to cultivate one 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.689
 conversation 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.839
 how to extend it was a conversation that took place on scart 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.469
 when I administer continuous text messages 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.599

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.859
 a telephone part this 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.400

 ecomotor the call 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.109
 will go through the internet which will connect automatically 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.819

 You can use different connections on the cellphone pooh 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.029
 automatically switch one connection the other when you are 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:38.719

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.669
 via book protecting computer 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.979

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.629
 we do not feel part of the multimedia because it is always from the multimedia cat 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.560
 let's talk about a contributing phone memory banks really got one 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.740
 amount of dying of you
