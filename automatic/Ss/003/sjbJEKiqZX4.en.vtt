historical<00:01:07.470> time<00:01:07.979> period<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.659> did<00:01:10.790> with

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
historical time period and we did with

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.690 
historical time period and we did with
another<00:01:12.270> tale<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:13.530> another<00:01:14.040> girl<00:01:14.310> who's<00:01:14.520> in

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759

those things can be covered without
using<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.380> textbook<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.640> using

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
using a textbook but we're just using

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.289

our<00:01:59.369> pilgrims<00:02:00.030> blog

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
our pilgrims blog

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.260 
our pilgrims blog
so<00:02:00.960> I'll<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.409> find<00:02:01.680> various<00:02:02.310> different

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so I'll just find various different

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.080 
so I'll just find various different
resources<00:02:03.899> about<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.500> time<00:02:04.890> period<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.610> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
resources about the time period and I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.510 
resources about the time period and I
teach<00:02:06.600> from<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:08.090> truth<00:02:09.619> standpoint<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.190> some

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
teach from a truth standpoint so some

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.449 
teach from a truth standpoint so some
history<00:02:11.849> books<00:02:12.090> might<00:02:12.569> not

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
history books might not

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.429 
history books might not

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
my stuff at the same time is teaching

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.770 
my stuff at the same time is teaching
them<00:02:22.189> because<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.459> want<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> be<00:02:22.879> as<00:02:22.969> accurate<00:02:23.269> as

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.080 
them because I want to be as accurate as
possible<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.069> I<00:02:25.099> have<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.549> do<00:02:25.730> that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
possible and so I have to do that

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.539 
possible and so I have to do that
legwork<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.379> evenings<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.129> whenever<00:02:28.459> I

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
legwork in the evenings and whenever I

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.000 
legwork in the evenings and whenever I
do<00:02:28.640> my<00:02:28.819> planning<00:02:29.150> time<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.689> do<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.409> then<00:02:30.859> I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
do my planning time I do that and then I

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.459 
do my planning time I do that and then I
encompass<00:02:31.519> it<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:31.849> how<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.030> teach<00:02:32.420> them<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.230> that

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469 
encompass it in how I teach them so that

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.530 
encompass it in how I teach them so that
they<00:02:33.709> are<00:02:33.739> learning<00:02:34.129> history<00:02:34.849> they're

find<00:05:11.669> this<00:05:12.090> was<00:05:12.240> our<00:05:12.389> map<00:05:12.630> when<00:05:12.870> we<00:05:12.960> learned

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
find this was our map when we learned

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.990 
find this was our map when we learned
about<00:05:13.820> Jamestown<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:16.650> Native<00:05:17.010> Americans<00:05:17.760> and

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
their interaction with your pians so we

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.710 
their interaction with your pians so we
don't<00:05:21.449> stay<00:05:21.720> real<00:05:21.990> heavy<00:05:22.260> on<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.889> typical<00:05:23.720> new

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
don't stay real heavy on the typical new

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.230 
don't stay real heavy on the typical new

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
world story about the pilgrims we tell

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.450 
world story about the pilgrims we tell
all<00:05:27.479> sides<00:05:27.930> of<00:05:28.289> it<00:05:28.410> so<00:05:28.560> we<00:05:28.680> can<00:05:28.830> understand

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
all sides of it so we can understand

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.490 
all sides of it so we can understand
what<00:05:29.700> happens<00:05:30.210> so<00:05:30.450> they<00:05:30.570> have<00:05:30.780> a<00:05:30.810> historical

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
what happens so they have a historical

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.310 
what happens so they have a historical

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
same token we will learn about when we

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.900 
same token we will learn about when we
learned<00:05:37.260> about<00:05:37.380> colonial<00:05:38.280> times<00:05:38.520> we'll<00:05:38.760> learn

learned about colonial times we'll learn
about<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.479> 13<00:05:39.900> colonies<00:05:40.440> so<00:05:40.740> we're<00:05:41.099> do<00:05:41.340> our

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
about the 13 colonies so we're do our

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.150 
about the 13 colonies so we're do our
state's<00:05:41.940> and<00:05:42.300> our<00:05:42.419> capitals<00:05:43.080> starting<00:05:44.010> with

state's and our capitals starting with

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.469 
state's and our capitals starting with
the<00:05:44.280> 13<00:05:44.700> colonies<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:45.450> moving<00:05:45.780> up<00:05:45.960> so<00:05:46.560> just

really<00:05:48.919> simple<00:05:49.919> but<00:05:50.130> creative<00:05:50.639> ways<00:05:50.880> of<00:05:51.270> to

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
really simple but creative ways of to

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.300 
really simple but creative ways of to
cover<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.990> same<00:05:52.289> thing<00:05:52.800> then<00:05:53.160> you're

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
cover the same thing then you're

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.730 
cover the same thing then you're
expected<00:05:54.150> to<00:05:54.389> know<00:05:54.510> and<00:05:54.900> learn<00:05:55.050> in
