00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.970
 I would like to know about the dimensions 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.700
 plans reincarnate and hostels regarding 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.890
 domestic animals and one of their 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.630
 answer videos you talked about 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.480
 dimensions of spiritual plans with 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.770
 relation to humans society with 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.680
 relation to animals 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.500
 some similarity they also evolve here 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.800
 are assisted by consciences 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.960
 human pain or disincar- 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.019
 average how close to your gifts 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.110
 and you've been throwing a lot of fruit 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:01:01.870
 I'll try to find out everything is 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.690
 human configuration is 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.119
 different from animals to NetÃ£o 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.340
 chaco distribution is different 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.539
 we are a different experience from the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:18.729
 some animals is for example not 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:21.450
 has the psychosomatic part would be the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.789
 spirit is very thin 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.270
 So you get a school of fish 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:32.439
 the school is basically technical and 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:36.070
 a consciousness that is outside of that 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.830
 space that makes them those movements 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.229
 they do all right because this group 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.920
 the psychosoma that there is only che 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.869
 that if you catch a dog is 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.549
 different a cat 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.320
 each has the level of consciousness has the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.329
 your own lifeline 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:02:00.520
 some reincarnate and others do not 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:02.920
 It's only going to talk but you said it once. 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.320
 served is the spirit that the dog does 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.200
 You will see with the sum of a dog. 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.030
 a cat doggie you can see if 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.560
 we do not know for how long that 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:19.360
 hard spirit and reincarnate an animal 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.150
 This is something that we want. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.739
 we have an awareness of a situation 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.470
 and I think everyone has to be the same 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.470
 we can not humanize animals right? 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.980
 Ana imagines human beings even for 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.069
 I stop anyway he already has some 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.190
 difficulty but it may be that a person 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.650
 deceased right who had his dog there 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:53.190
 she stays there until then, right? 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:56.190
 may be that they average 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.099
 close to their owners 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.480
 this is also something that will not 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.329
 wrong with that, right? 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.500
 I'd say it's already happening to your 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.560
 experiences 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.560
 We'll keep talking about this more 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.349
 this is tomorrow 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.400
 each case is a risk we talk about 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.400
 on the next question
