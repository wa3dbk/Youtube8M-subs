 the enemy is the sling around her 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.490
 getting closer to what they do instead 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.500

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.900
 imposed exile in search of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.840
 reparation and a way the pure 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.880
 logical visions she believed in 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.410
 rescue 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.780
