when<00:02:55.590> I'm<00:02:55.680> playing<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:55.980> free<00:02:56.190> midfield<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.000> feel

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
when I'm playing a free midfield I feel

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.089 
when I'm playing a free midfield I feel
like<00:02:57.630> you're<00:02:57.959> wingers<00:02:58.290> are<00:02:58.319> pushing<00:02:58.799> up<00:02:58.920> so

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
like you're wingers are pushing up so

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.160 
like you're wingers are pushing up so
much<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.489> do<00:02:59.700> need<00:02:59.940> to<00:02:59.970> have<00:03:00.209> your<00:03:00.720> central

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
much you do need to have your central

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.630 
much you do need to have your central
midfielders<00:03:01.620> actually<00:03:02.010> coming<00:03:02.220> back<00:03:02.459> and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
midfielders actually coming back and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.800 
midfielders actually coming back and
then<00:03:02.760> obviously<00:03:02.849> we've<00:03:03.180> got<00:03:03.269> Ramirez<00:03:03.569> who<00:03:03.780> is

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
then obviously we've got Ramirez who is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.869 
then obviously we've got Ramirez who is
brilliant<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.799> like<00:03:05.040> every<00:03:05.459> aspect<00:03:05.819> of

brilliant in like every aspect of

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.880 
brilliant in like every aspect of
midfield<00:03:06.360> because<00:03:06.720> he's<00:03:06.840> got<00:03:07.110> his<00:03:07.470> past<00:03:07.769> and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
midfield because he's got his past and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.530 
midfield because he's got his past and
his<00:03:07.950> dribbling<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.400> defending<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.060> then<00:03:09.269> that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
his dribbling is defending and then that

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.569 
his dribbling is defending and then that
pace<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.049> 88<00:03:10.379> pace<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.890> getting<00:03:11.400> him<00:03:11.489> in
