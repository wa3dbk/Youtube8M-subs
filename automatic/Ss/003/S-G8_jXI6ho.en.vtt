00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
a certain system that I follow so here

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:40.950 
a certain system that I follow so here
we<00:00:33.220> go<00:00:33.370> guys<00:00:39.000> okay<00:00:40.000> so<00:00:40.480> hopefully<00:00:40.629> you<00:00:40.840> guys

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
we go guys okay so hopefully you guys

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.620 
we go guys okay so hopefully you guys
can<00:00:41.019> see<00:00:41.380> that<00:00:41.410> there<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.899> we<00:00:44.020> have<00:00:44.200> push<00:00:45.630> push

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
can see that there so we have push push

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.260 
can see that there so we have push push
pull<00:00:46.870> leg<00:00:47.079> right<00:00:47.649> so<00:00:48.460> as<00:00:48.520> you<00:00:48.640> can<00:00:48.790> see<00:00:48.850> on<00:00:49.180> the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
pull leg right so as you can see on the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.440 
pull leg right so as you can see on the
push<00:00:49.480> date<00:00:49.750> I<00:00:49.960> started<00:00:50.469> with<00:00:50.620> five<00:00:51.219> fives<00:00:51.520> all

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
push date I started with five fives all

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.639 
push date I started with five fives all
right<00:00:52.570> I<00:00:52.950> basically<00:00:53.950> have<00:00:54.300> four<00:00:55.300> rep<00:00:56.200> ranges

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
right I basically have four rep ranges

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.680 
right I basically have four rep ranges
that<00:00:57.309> I<00:00:57.340> work<00:00:57.700> through<00:00:58.000> workout<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.660> workout

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
that I work through workout to workout

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.430 
that I work through workout to workout
so<00:00:59.430> for<00:01:00.430> example<00:01:00.910> if<00:01:01.090> I<00:01:01.329> do<00:01:02.190> push<00:01:03.190> on<00:01:03.430> Monday

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
so for example if I do push on Monday

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.440 
so for example if I do push on Monday
okay<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.570> then<00:01:07.720> Tuesday<00:01:08.200> would<00:01:08.950> be<00:01:09.100> pull

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
okay so then Tuesday would be pull

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.800 
okay so then Tuesday would be pull
Wednesday<00:01:10.450> would<00:01:11.200> be<00:01:11.350> legs<00:01:12.390> take<00:01:13.390> Thursday

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
Wednesday would be legs take Thursday

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.050 
Wednesday would be legs take Thursday
off<00:01:14.020> so<00:01:14.409> then<00:01:14.560> Friday<00:01:14.979> will<00:01:15.369> be<00:01:15.460> back<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.820> push

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
off so then Friday will be back to push

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.840 
off so then Friday will be back to push
so<00:01:16.780> on<00:01:16.930> Monday<00:01:17.380> if<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:17.710> did<00:01:17.890> firefighters<00:01:18.610> for

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
so on Monday if I did firefighters for

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.570 
so on Monday if I did firefighters for
push<00:01:19.090> I'm<00:01:19.600> going<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.260> then<00:01:20.470> do<00:01:20.650> five<00:01:20.950> tens<00:01:21.340> on

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
this is called non linear periodization

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.350 
this is called non linear periodization
right<00:02:08.440> doing<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:09.429> for<00:02:09.610> about<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.820> month<00:02:10.119> and

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.729 
okay the other thing is why am I
starting<00:02:16.239> them<00:02:16.329> all<00:02:16.510> on<00:02:16.690> difference<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.650> as

light heavy light and my body is

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.230 
light heavy light and my body is
responding<00:04:22.930> really<00:04:23.200> well<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.710> that<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:24.400> do<00:04:25.180> I

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
responding really well to that so do I

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.790 
responding really well to that so do I
do<00:04:25.500> my<00:04:26.500> entire<00:04:26.800> workout<00:04:28.470> like<00:04:29.470> when<00:04:29.650> it's<00:04:29.740> a

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
do my entire workout like when it's a

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
do my entire workout like when it's a
5/5<00:04:30.220> day<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:30.940> for<00:04:31.120> example<00:04:31.720> if<00:04:32.289> it's<00:04:32.890> a<00:04:32.979> 5/5<00:04:33.520> day

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
5/5 day so for example if it's a 5/5 day

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.740 
5/5 day so for example if it's a 5/5 day
in<00:04:34.330> my

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
in my

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.580 
in my
doing<00:04:35.260> every<00:04:36.040> single<00:04:36.730> movement<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.930> day<00:04:38.260> in

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
doing every single movement that day in

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.050 
doing every single movement that day in
the<00:04:38.860> gym<00:04:39.600> with<00:04:40.600> a<00:04:40.630> five<00:04:40.990> sets<00:04:41.350> of<00:04:41.500> five<00:04:42.060> the

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
the gym with a five sets of five the

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.750 
the gym with a five sets of five the
answer<00:04:43.360> guys<00:04:43.540> is<00:04:43.780> no<00:04:44.140> I'm<00:04:44.890> doing<00:04:45.040> my<00:04:45.190> main<00:04:45.520> lift

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
answer guys is no I'm doing my main lift

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.190 
answer guys is no I'm doing my main lift
so<00:04:46.000> for<00:04:46.240> example<00:04:46.690> on<00:04:46.960> my<00:04:47.590> push<00:04:47.890> day<00:04:49.200> incline

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
so for example on my push day incline

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.550 
so for example on my push day incline
barbell<00:04:50.980> press<00:04:51.490> four<00:04:51.700> five<00:04:51.850> fives<00:04:52.180> yes<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:53.290> will

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
barbell press four five fives yes I will
