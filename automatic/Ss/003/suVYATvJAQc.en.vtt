00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:11.629
 I put in a pot with a little edge 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:14.330
 high 300 g of almonds 250 g of sugar 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:18.970
 and 100 g of water 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.970
 now we put them on a medium-sized stove 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.119
 well 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.080
 we turn from time to time with a 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.080
 wooden spoon 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.750
 we continue to mix from time to time 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.729
 so much with the wooden spoon until 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.729
 complete dissolution of the sugar 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.010
 now that the sugar has melted it starts to 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.010
 to boil 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:03.310
 and we always continue to mix of 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:06.840
 occasionally I recommend the flame 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.840
 lively but not at most 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.460
 well 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.950
 we always keep turning from time to time 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.950
 much 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:11.140
 in the next step the sugar 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.020
 it will become mealy you already see that 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.670
 the water has decreased on the edge of the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.860
 pot you already see even the sugar 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.860
 is taking solid consistency 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:50.269
 let's turn this gently 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:52.430
 the most important step is sugar 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:03:08.930
 becoming grainy is returning 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:12.760
 poured solid well at this point not 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.760
 it will do nothing but lower the flame 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.329
 keep turning 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.430
 here it is now continuing to turn up 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.329
 to when the sugar will not become 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.889
 powdery you see that still a little wet 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:46.569
 it will become completely dry 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.569
 keep turning vigorously 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.500
 the little the sugar will begin to melt 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.500
 and to attack 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:15.200
 I remind you that I have lowered the mafia has not 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.200
 allowed the sugar to solidify 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:34.500
 now make the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:38.160
 flame and even those who take away the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.470
 flame pot I find it more 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.470
 comfortable lowering the heat 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.910
 you can do it even with a spoon 10 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.730
 found the body from with the best 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:06.630
 because first of all it does not heat up 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:08.340
 second, the noise of the 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:14.640
 spoon in contact with the sheep that 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:17.750
 is well the sugar is starting to 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.750
 melt away 9 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.480
 look where the spoon went 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.920
 this is a passage that requires a lot 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.920
 arm strength 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:06:03.590
 keep on going, we're almost there 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.590
 our almonds are almost ready 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:23.660
 here we are now I continue to 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.550
 you can also hear the almonds 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.020
 they crackle when they start to feel 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.890
 crackling almonds means that 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.330
 you can put out the flame 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.550
 well now our almonds are 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.550
 ready I have to pour them into a pan 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.800
 poured into a pan someone will stay 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.780
 glued but cooling down yes 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:54.530
 they will come off by themselves enough to move them one 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:54.530
 even just so ready to eat
