so<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> quick<00:01:24.990> test<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> kodak<00:01:25.920> zi8

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
so this is a quick test to the kodak zi8

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.730 
so this is a quick test to the kodak zi8
using<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> rogue<00:01:27.570> video<00:01:27.930> mic<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> audio

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
input one thing to note is that the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.789 
input one thing to note is that the
kodak<00:01:31.079> zi8<00:01:31.520> can't<00:01:32.520> output<00:01:33.390> hdmi<00:01:34.320> while

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
kodak zi8 can't output hdmi while

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
field monitor so I can actually see what

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.380

I'm<00:01:40.229> doing<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:41.100> recording<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.790> particular

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.870 
I'm doing on recording this particular
video<00:01:42.689> sample<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.950> thing<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.220> concede<00:01:44.670> is

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
video sample one thing I will concede is

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.139 
video sample one thing I will concede is
that<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.149> rig<00:01:45.479> attached<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> zi8<00:01:46.710> is

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
that this rig attached to the zi8 is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.450 
that this rig attached to the zi8 is
more<00:01:48.149> expensive<00:01:48.450> than<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> CIA<00:01:49.290> itself<00:01:49.770> this

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
more expensive than the CIA itself this

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
more expensive than the CIA itself this
microphone<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.270> about<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> hundred<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
microphone here is about a hundred and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.719 
microphone here is about a hundred and
twenty-five<00:01:52.439> dollars<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.340> beach<00:01:53.490> tech

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
twenty-five dollars the beach tech

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.520 
twenty-five dollars the beach tech
adapter<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> hundred<00:01:54.689> bucks<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.140> this

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
adapter was a hundred bucks and this

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
adapter was a hundred bucks and this
bracket<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.420> $15<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.630> maybe<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> bracket

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
bracket was $15 so maybe the bracket

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.319 
bracket was $15 so maybe the bracket
would<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> bargain<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.820> swing<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.270> around

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
would be a bargain you swing this around

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.539 
would be a bargain you swing this around
right<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.860> basically<00:02:02.040> see<00:02:02.430> the

tech<00:02:13.800> takes<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.400> signal<00:02:14.700> from<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.880> rogue

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
tech takes the signal from the rogue

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.180 
tech takes the signal from the rogue
turns<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.540> into<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.750> mono<00:02:15.990> signal<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.620> runs<00:02:17.040> it

into<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.210> code<00:02:18.510> act<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.830> get<00:02:20.010> two

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
into the code act so that you get two

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.670 
into the code act so that you get two
channels<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.970> same<00:02:21.180> audio<00:02:21.540> one<00:02:22.380> thing<00:02:22.560> to

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
channels of the same audio one thing to

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.710 
channels of the same audio one thing to
think<00:02:22.890> about<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.400> using<00:02:23.730> DSLRs<00:02:24.390> ESRI

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
think about is that using DSLRs ESRI

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.770 
think about is that using DSLRs ESRI
popularized<00:02:25.470> dual<00:02:26.130> system<00:02:26.670> sound<00:02:27.030> what

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
popularized dual system sound what

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.690 
popularized dual system sound what
remember<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.800> use<00:02:28.950> dual<00:02:29.130> system<00:02:29.490> sound

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
remember you can use dual system sound

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.630 
remember you can use dual system sound
