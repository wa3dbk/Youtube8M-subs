on here is the lasering it's supposed to

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.570

be different on every every pair of ones
so<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.390> thought<00:01:47.540> that<00:01:47.600> was<00:01:47.870> unique<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.470> know

so I thought that was unique I know

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.890 
so I thought that was unique I know
they're<00:01:49.340> coming<00:01:49.790> out<00:01:49.850> with<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.150> 20s<00:01:50.600> or<00:01:50.750> they
