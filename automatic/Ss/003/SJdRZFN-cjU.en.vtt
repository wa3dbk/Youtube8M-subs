pilot flame increase in size this is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.149 
pilot flame increase in size this is
warming<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.260> called<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> safety<00:01:05.010> valve

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799

is in these lines and when we want

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.179 
is in these lines and when we want
cooling<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.479> create<00:01:54.869> heat<00:01:55.229> either<00:01:55.619> from<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189

from AC power down in this part the heat

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
from AC power down in this part the heat
evaporates<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.790> ammonia<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> tubes<00:02:03.659> and

evaporates the ammonia in the tubes and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260
