00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
model of course the line six and then I

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.870 
model of course the line six and then I
go<00:00:13.320> right<00:00:13.349> into<00:00:13.830> my<00:00:14.070> Marshall<00:00:14.429> Blues<00:00:14.580> breaker

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
go right into my Marshall Blues breaker

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.000 
go right into my Marshall Blues breaker

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
now the Blues breaker doesn't have an

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.490 
now the Blues breaker doesn't have an
effects<00:00:17.310> loop<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.699> us<00:00:17.869> right<00:00:18.869> into<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> face

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
effects loop so us right into the face

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.220 
effects loop so us right into the face
of<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.800> end<00:00:19.949> now<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> don't<00:00:21.090> really<00:00:21.330> program<00:00:22.020> my

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
of the end now I don't really program my

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.599 
of the end now I don't really program my
patches<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.859> people<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.250> are<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.490> gonna

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
patches for people that are just gonna

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.099 
patches for people that are just gonna
plug<00:00:23.880> their<00:00:24.029> headphones<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.840> kind<00:00:25.050> of

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
plug their headphones in and kind of

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.290 
plug their headphones in and kind of
noodle<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:26.340> patches<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:26.970> designed

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
noodle like that my patches are designed

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.519 
noodle like that my patches are designed
specifically<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.349> gigging<00:00:28.830> musician<00:00:29.510> so

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
specifically for the gigging musician so

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
specifically for the gigging musician so
when<00:00:31.529> my<00:00:31.679> band<00:00:31.859> plays<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:33.210> four

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
when my band plays out I have four

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.990 
when my band plays out I have four
patches<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> use<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.460> clean<00:00:35.730> patch

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
patches that I use I have a clean patch

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.810 
patches that I use I have a clean patch
and<00:00:36.360> three<00:00:36.719> various<00:00:37.110> gain<00:00:37.350> stages<00:00:37.950> now

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and three various gain stages now

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.700 
and three various gain stages now
because<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> only<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.809> one<00:00:40.050> clean<00:00:40.440> patch

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
because I only have the one clean patch

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.580 
because I only have the one clean patch
I<00:00:41.010> need<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> kind<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> be<00:00:41.879> three<00:00:42.590> patches

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
I need it to kind of be three patches

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.490 
I need it to kind of be three patches
within<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:45.149> use<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> by<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.379> know

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
within one and I use that by you know

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080 
within one and I use that by you know
adding<00:00:46.829> multi<00:00:47.160> effects<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:47.789> foot

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
adding multi effects that are foot

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.810 
adding multi effects that are foot
switchable<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.070> first<00:00:50.370> start<00:00:50.700> off

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
switchable so when we first start off

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.850 
switchable so when we first start off
the<00:00:51.480> clean<00:00:51.780> patch<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the clean patch is just going to be a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.290 
the clean patch is just going to be a
very<00:00:53.280> bare-bones

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.830 

I<00:00:59.890> want<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.070> be<00:01:01.219> warm<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.030> very<00:01:02.390> have<00:01:02.809> a

I want it to be warm and very have a
punch<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.860> just<00:01:04.250> really<00:01:04.729> sit<00:01:05.119> well<00:01:05.300> in

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
punch to it and just really sit well in

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.820 
punch to it and just really sit well in
the<00:01:05.570> mix<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.830> if<00:01:06.920> we're<00:01:07.070> doing<00:01:07.190> something<00:01:07.340> like

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.680 

some<00:01:14.830> Janis<00:01:15.190> Joplin<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:16.119> really<00:01:16.390> don't<00:01:16.540> need

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
some Janis Joplin you really don't need

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.840 
some Janis Joplin you really don't need
a<00:01:16.750> lot<00:01:16.960> of<00:01:17.020> clutter<00:01:17.440> on<00:01:17.830> that<00:01:18.310> guitar<00:01:18.490> you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
a lot of clutter on that guitar you

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.120 
a lot of clutter on that guitar you
really<00:01:19.119> just<00:01:19.330> wanted<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.750> be<00:01:19.900> very<00:01:20.229> clean<00:01:20.770> and

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
really just wanted to be very clean and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.820 
really just wanted to be very clean and
right<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.210> point<00:01:22.420> say<00:01:23.290> you're<00:01:23.440> doing<00:01:23.560> we

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.309 
have that and then you're gonna go to
like<00:01:52.049> say<00:01:52.429> Dakin<00:01:53.429> alone<00:01:53.909> again<00:01:54.319> adds

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
like say Dakin alone again adds

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:10.470 
like say Dakin alone again adds
modulation<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.609> little<00:01:57.270> bit<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.539> back

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.339 

you<00:02:11.480> got<00:02:11.690> per<00:02:12.379> say<00:02:12.530> you're<00:02:12.650> gonna<00:02:12.769> do<00:02:13.120> like

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.030 

so<00:02:42.660> right<00:02:42.870> there<00:02:43.050> it's<00:02:43.170> at<00:02:43.320> your<00:02:43.470> fingertips

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
so you're going to go back so you're

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.030 
so you're going to go back so you're
just<00:02:47.730> doing<00:02:48.000> some<00:02:48.180> field<00:02:48.390> work<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.800> want

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
just doing some field work and you want

00:02:50.040 --> 00:03:29.350 
just doing some field work and you want
just<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.430> clean<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:10.800> know

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.250 

you<00:03:30.360> know<00:03:30.450> but<00:03:30.569> then<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.959> very<00:03:31.200> easily

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
you know but then you can very easily

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.770 
you know but then you can very easily
just<00:03:31.830> add<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.099> modulation<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.270> go

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
just add the modulation to it and go

00:03:33.780 --> 00:05:17.070 
just add the modulation to it and go
right<00:03:34.050> back<00:03:34.080> into

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.940 

which<00:05:18.080> sounds<00:05:18.380> good<00:05:18.530> by<00:05:18.650> itself<00:05:18.710> but<00:05:19.220> again<00:05:19.520> a

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
which sounds good by itself but again a

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:39.980 
which sounds good by itself but again a
little<00:05:21.950> bit

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.330
