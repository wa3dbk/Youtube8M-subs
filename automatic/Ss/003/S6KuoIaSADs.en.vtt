and able it will have an underwater

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.610 
and able it will have an underwater
element<00:03:49.090> as<00:03:49.239> well<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.959> means<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.440> go

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
element as well that means you can go

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.250

and<00:03:50.799> explore<00:03:51.250> underwater<00:03:51.910> so<00:03:52.870> it's<00:03:53.019> highly

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
and explore underwater so it's highly

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.630 
and explore underwater so it's highly
likely<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.890> there's<00:03:54.430> going<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.610> be

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
likely that there's going to be

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.449 
likely that there's going to be
underwater<00:03:55.090> treasure<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:56.160> there<00:03:57.160> will<00:03:57.430> be
