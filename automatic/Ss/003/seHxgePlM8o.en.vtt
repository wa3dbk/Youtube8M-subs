lot<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.720> games<00:02:45.959> but<00:02:46.109> not<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.560> one<00:02:46.709> in

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
lot of games but not this one in

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:58.190 
lot of games but not this one in
particular<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.599> can<00:02:57.780> see<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.079> looks

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
particular so you can see it looks

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.770 
particular so you can see it looks
pretty<00:02:58.530> good<00:02:58.790> let's<00:02:59.790> go<00:02:59.970> back<00:03:00.150> home<00:03:00.359> and<00:03:00.599> see

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
pretty good let's go back home and see

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.160 
pretty good let's go back home and see
how<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.989> resumes<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:03.209> we<00:03:03.389> had<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.750> let's<00:03:04.049> go

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
how it resumes so we had that let's go

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.270 
how it resumes so we had that let's go
back<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.349> apps<00:03:04.760> will<00:03:05.760> go<00:03:05.910> back<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.120> resume<00:03:07.280> and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
back to apps will go back to resume and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.879 
back to apps will go back to resume and
you<00:03:08.549> can<00:03:08.700> see<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:08.970> resumed<00:03:09.329> pretty<00:03:09.690> fast<00:03:09.959> now

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
you can see it resumed pretty fast now

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.089 
you can see it resumed pretty fast now
if<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.130> go<00:03:11.160> into<00:03:11.459> another<00:03:11.639> app<00:03:13.010> graphically<00:03:14.010> it

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
if we go into another app graphically it

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.650 
if we go into another app graphically it
looks<00:03:14.280> great<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.669> doesn't<00:03:14.970> seem<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.120> hiccup<00:03:15.480> at

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
looks great it doesn't seem to hiccup at

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.300 
looks great it doesn't seem to hiccup at
all<00:03:15.780> or<00:03:15.959> anything<00:03:15.989> now<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.829> don't<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.099> a<00:03:17.130> whole

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
all or anything now I don't have a whole

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.129 
all or anything now I don't have a whole
lot<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.459> things<00:03:17.579> open<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.359> we<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.930> have<00:03:19.109> a

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
lot of things open and we do have a

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.140 
lot of things open and we do have a
built<00:03:19.380> in<00:03:19.530> task<00:03:19.739> manager<00:03:19.980> down<00:03:20.519> here<00:03:20.910> so

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
built in task manager down here so

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.220 
built in task manager down here so
should<00:03:22.079> be<00:03:22.230> no<00:03:22.500> problem<00:03:22.980> for<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.840> let's<00:03:25.049> go

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
should be no problem for it so let's go

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.879 
should be no problem for it so let's go
ahead<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.560> go<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.069> uno<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:28.260> obviously<00:03:28.709> this

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
ahead and go to uno and obviously this

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.370 
ahead and go to uno and obviously this
isn't<00:03:29.069> an<00:03:29.250> action-packed<00:03:29.849> game<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:31.049> one<00:03:31.230> to

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
isn't an action-packed game but one to

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.490 
isn't an action-packed game but one to
see<00:03:31.560> what<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.799> looks<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:33.079> this<00:03:34.079> one<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> have

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
see what it looks like this one I have

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.259 
see what it looks like this one I have
not<00:03:34.709> started<00:03:35.040> before<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:36.090> it'll<00:03:36.209> be

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
not started before so it'll be

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.729 
not started before so it'll be
interesting<00:03:36.359> to<00:03:36.780> see<00:03:36.870> how<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.290> handles

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
interesting to see how this handles

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.680 
interesting to see how this handles
multitasking<00:03:38.700> as<00:03:38.849> far<00:03:39.030> as<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:39.299> goes<00:03:39.359> we'll

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
multitasking as far as this goes we'll

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.210 
multitasking as far as this goes we'll
go<00:03:39.780> ahead<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.019> exit<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.739> go<00:03:40.859> back<00:03:41.040> in

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
go ahead and exit this and go back in

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.770 
go ahead and exit this and go back in
and<00:03:41.690> load<00:03:42.690> speeds<00:03:43.019> aren't<00:03:43.200> too<00:03:43.410> bad<00:03:44.630> but<00:03:45.630> the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
and load speeds aren't too bad but the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.890 
and load speeds aren't too bad but the
same<00:03:45.989> as<00:03:46.139> anything<00:03:46.349> else

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.230 

turn<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.050> down<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.290> little<00:03:51.410> bit<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:53.120> we'll

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
turn that down a little bit so we'll

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.340 
turn that down a little bit so we'll
just<00:03:53.300> keep<00:03:53.570> it<00:03:53.720> at<00:03:53.810> that<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:56.780> was<00:03:56.900> closest<00:03:57.320> to

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
just keep it at that it was closest to

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.490 
just keep it at that it was closest to
my<00:03:57.560> thumb<00:03:57.800> that's<00:03:57.980> fine<00:03:59.020> and<00:04:00.610> easy<00:04:02.260> just<00:04:03.260> for

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
my thumb that's fine and easy just for

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.230 
my thumb that's fine and easy just for
now<00:04:03.590> i<00:04:03.800> want<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.520> see<00:04:04.640> how<00:04:04.730> smooth<00:04:05.060> this

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
now i want to see how smooth this

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.880 
now i want to see how smooth this
actually<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.750> touch<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.200> screen<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.590> can<00:04:06.709> see

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
actually is touch the screen you can see

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:20.860 
actually is touch the screen you can see
load<00:04:07.100> times<00:04:07.370> are<00:04:07.520> pretty<00:04:07.700> good<00:04:18.190> read<00:04:19.750> so<00:04:20.750> let's

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
load times are pretty good read so let's

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.210 
load times are pretty good read so let's
go<00:04:20.989> ahead<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.200> hit<00:04:21.380> home<00:04:21.620> or<00:04:21.890> will<00:04:22.010> hit<00:04:22.100> the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
go ahead and hit home or will hit the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.340 
go ahead and hit home or will hit the
multitasking<00:04:22.910> button<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.419> see<00:04:24.140> how<00:04:24.260> it

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
multitasking button and see how it

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.580 
multitasking button and see how it
handles<00:04:24.500> dead<00:04:24.830> space<00:04:26.140> it's<00:04:27.140> going<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.320> fully

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
handles dead space it's going to fully

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.420 
handles dead space it's going to fully
reload<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.220> looks<00:04:28.340> like<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:30.010> which<00:04:31.010> which

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
reload it looks like it is which which

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.980 
reload it looks like it is which which
does<00:04:31.700> make<00:04:31.730> sense<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.360> has<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.600> load<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.870> into

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
does make sense it has to load it into

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.750 
does make sense it has to load it into
memory<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:33.380> we<00:04:33.560> may<00:04:33.680> be<00:04:33.740> using<00:04:34.130> all<00:04:34.280> of<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.550> but

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
memory and we may be using all of it but

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.460 
memory and we may be using all of it but
it's<00:04:35.270> not<00:04:35.480> a<00:04:35.510> horrible<00:04:35.930> thing<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.140> see<00:04:36.350> how

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
it's not a horrible thing you see how

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.500 
it's not a horrible thing you see how
fast<00:04:36.740> it<00:04:36.919> loads<00:04:37.130> not<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.400> problem<00:04:37.760> at<00:04:37.850> all<00:04:37.940> so

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
fast it loads not a problem at all so

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.440 
fast it loads not a problem at all so
gaming<00:04:39.110> overall<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.650> pretty<00:04:39.919> good<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:41.030> screen

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
gaming overall is pretty good the screen

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.050 
gaming overall is pretty good the screen
seems<00:04:42.020> pretty<00:04:42.380> responsive<00:04:43.130> it's<00:04:43.550> a<00:04:43.730> really

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
seems pretty responsive it's a really

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.750 
seems pretty responsive it's a really
bright<00:04:44.720> vibrant<00:04:45.020> bright<00:04:45.500> screen<00:04:45.919> I'm<00:04:46.460> under

pretty bright lights you can see my

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.480 
pretty bright lights you can see my
hands<00:04:48.470> they're<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.620> little<00:04:48.800> bit<00:04:48.980> washed<00:04:49.190> out

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
hands they're a little bit washed out

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.670 
hands they're a little bit washed out
from<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.940> light<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.750> this<00:04:50.900> screen<00:04:51.230> holds<00:04:51.560> up

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
from the light and this screen holds up

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.860 
from the light and this screen holds up
well<00:04:51.890> in<00:04:52.100> that<00:04:52.250> light<00:04:52.520> so<00:04:52.850> some<00:04:53.479> people<00:04:53.720> have

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870
