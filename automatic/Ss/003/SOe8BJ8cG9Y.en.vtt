the<00:01:39.630> same<00:01:39.750> exact<00:01:40.110> thing<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> m16a3<00:01:41.159> except

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the same exact thing is the m16a3 except

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.340 
the same exact thing is the m16a3 except
no<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.240> falsely<00:01:42.630> accuses<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.170> being

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
no one falsely accuses it in being

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
easy use for a first weapon and I say

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.359 
easy use for a first weapon and I say
that<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.409> perspective<00:01:49.680> alone<00:01:50.070> because

pretty well in close range but what you

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.840 
pretty well in close range but what you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
don't see is how many times I died while

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.520 
don't see is how many times I died while

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
playing like that running gun until I

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.800 
playing like that running gun until I

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
and the heavy barrel as I said the gun

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.440 
and the heavy barrel as I said the gun
really<00:02:44.340> excels<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.000> medium<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.420> long

really excels in the medium to long
range<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.080> why<00:02:46.200> fight<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.190> were<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> play

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
range so why fight it if I were to play

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.040 
range so why fight it if I were to play
conquest<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.120> stick<00:02:48.360> with<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.570> range<00:02:48.870> I

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
conquest and stick with that range I

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.810 
conquest and stick with that range I
might<00:02:49.470> consider<00:02:49.830> putting<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> ACOG<00:02:50.670> scope

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
might consider putting on the ACOG scope

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.790 
might consider putting on the ACOG scope
for<00:02:51.150> better<00:02:51.360> long-range<00:02:51.810> accuracy<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:52.770> I

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
for better long-range accuracy but I

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.229 
for better long-range accuracy but I
like<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> holographic<00:02:53.430> sight<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.060> can

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
like the holographic sight so that I can

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.640 
like the holographic sight so that I can
have<00:02:54.360> better<00:02:54.630> aim<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.110> medium<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.470> close

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
have better aim in the medium to close

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.130 
have better aim in the medium to close
range<00:02:55.920> if<00:02:56.130> it's<00:02:56.370> necessary<00:02:56.850> I'm<00:02:57.780> gonna<00:02:57.989> give

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
range if it's necessary I'm gonna give

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.190
