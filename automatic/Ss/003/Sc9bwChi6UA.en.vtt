00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.540
 some would say 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.330
 your cosplay culture comes from the words 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.810
 costume play customs trust play 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.479
 playstation obviously not 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.520
 play comes more than anything from when 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.130
 they refer as law of acting is 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.500
 represent and act in the best way 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.899
 possible to the character here that you like 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.190
 know that your characters pass to all 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:36.070
 long and destroy a complete city 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.880
 koch and the character always walks with 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.330
 horse face 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.900

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.450
 I am super confused many men 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.720
 seeing bones man but in reality 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.050
 that 's a fox is a woman is my 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.050
 wife 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 but that's like the milkmaid's already 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.990
 they know they are basically foxes 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.959
 disguised as male gods that go 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.160
 bothering people and being able to 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.790
 obviously they see us and disguised as a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.790
 satellite dish 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.190

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.959
 from town paleta and my name is edwin las 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.959
 voices of the people palette or your character 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.970
 it's from paleta town the two things if 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.340
 you're doing because it's because you 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.550
 you identify with the character is very 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.470
 electric no 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.240
 talking about personifying a character 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.940
 sincerely it feels great to be 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.670
 feels cool that one can relive their 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.040
 good times without knowing what it is 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.950
 cosplay let's ask more sea to 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.950
 see what we are sometimes told anonymous 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:01.140
 for my cosplay is an art 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:06.240
 as a way of expressing the taste that 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.550
 I have towards the anime and the characters to 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.870
 the ones that you love the ones you love 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.960
 those who are the heroes of childhood 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.090
 because they like it so much 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:23.110
 personify characters 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:25.300
 the truth I do not know I do not really like 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.280
 work things work the pieces 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.720
 because it 's super entertaining moment 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.720
 moment that you are not left 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.840
 We start again 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.469
 or the hypotheses 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.370

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.959

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.000

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.000
