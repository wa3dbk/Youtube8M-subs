a 45 degree angle after that it'll keep

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the way full and kind of let it sit for

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.179 
the way full and kind of let it sit for
a<00:01:26.460> second<00:01:26.850> gonna<00:01:27.390> let<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> foam<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:28.740> down<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
a second gonna let the foam go down the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.880 
a second gonna let the foam go down the
spark<00:01:29.460> will<00:01:29.610> go<00:01:29.729> down<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.890> if
