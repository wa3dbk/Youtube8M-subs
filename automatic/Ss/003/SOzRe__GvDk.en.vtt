I love these lines because I don't ever
have<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.760> be<00:00:54.789> worried<00:00:55.269> about<00:00:55.449> cutting<00:00:56.370> all

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
have to be worried about cutting all

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.639 
have to be worried about cutting all
over<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.760> place<00:00:57.999> anymore<00:00:58.329> so<00:00:59.049> once<00:00:59.350> we<00:00:59.469> have

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
over the place anymore so once we have

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.189 
over the place anymore so once we have
all<00:00:59.679> of<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.069> supplies<00:01:00.339> we<00:01:00.999> obviously<00:01:01.539> made<00:01:02.170> a

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
all of the supplies we obviously made a

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.020 
all of the supplies we obviously made a
package<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.949> wrap<00:01:03.129> and<00:01:03.459> roll<00:01:03.760> out<00:01:03.789> your

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
package to wrap and roll out your

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.550 
package to wrap and roll out your
wrapping<00:01:04.420> paper<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.720> then<00:01:08.020> take<00:01:08.350> your

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
wrapping paper and then take your

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:21.330 
wrapping paper and then take your
package<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.530> see<00:01:11.799> how<00:01:12.189> this<00:01:12.579> way<00:01:17.579> I<00:01:19.979> know<00:01:20.979> it's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
package and see how this way I know it's

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.639 
package and see how this way I know it's
not<00:01:21.460> gonna<00:01:21.700> work<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.570> wrap<00:01:22.780> it<00:01:22.990> from<00:01:23.200> this<00:01:23.409> side

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
not gonna work to wrap it from this side

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.499 
not gonna work to wrap it from this side
to<00:01:23.859> this<00:01:24.009> side<00:01:24.070> because<00:01:24.310> it's<00:01:24.820> obviously<00:01:25.299> not

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
to this side because it's obviously not

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:31.289 
to this side because it's obviously not
enough<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:26.439> overlap<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:28.390> on<00:01:28.509> this<00:01:28.689> end<00:01:28.930> so<00:01:30.299> we

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
enough to overlap here on this end so we

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.740 
enough to overlap here on this end so we
need<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.659> turn<00:01:31.869> it<00:01:31.990> this<00:01:32.140> direction<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.390> then

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
need to turn it this direction and then

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.550 
need to turn it this direction and then
I<00:01:35.200> just<00:01:36.130> normally<00:01:36.700> bring<00:01:37.659> up<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:38.020> paper<00:01:38.229> right

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
I just normally bring up the paper right

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.760 
I just normally bring up the paper right
here<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.159> then<00:01:40.000> grab<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.390> whole<00:01:40.810> roll<00:01:41.200> and

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
here and then grab the whole roll and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.709 
here and then grab the whole roll and
bring<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.909> up<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:45.700> bring<00:01:45.969> it<00:01:46.060> past<00:01:46.359> where<00:01:46.689> I

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
bring it up and I bring it past where I

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.859 
bring it up and I bring it past where I
know<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.979> seam<00:01:48.249> is<00:01:48.520> right<00:01:48.820> here<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.299> then

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
know the seam is right here and then

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.580 
know the seam is right here and then
just<00:01:50.049> hold<00:01:50.289> it<00:01:50.469> here

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.410 

right<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:58.980> where<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.790> look<00:01:59.970> where<00:02:00.210> my

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
right here is where my look where my

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.900 
right here is where my look where my
line<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:01.050> where<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> knew<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:02.340> overlapped

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
line was where I knew that it overlapped

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.999 
line was where I knew that it overlapped
and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.260> just<00:02:04.470> start<00:02:04.680> cutting<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:07.009> good

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and then you just start cutting a good

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.400 
and then you just start cutting a good
pair<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.340> scissors<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.910> imperative<00:02:09.360> once<00:02:10.289> we

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
pair of scissors is imperative once we

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.630 
pair of scissors is imperative once we
have<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> paper<00:02:10.800> cut<00:02:11.100> we<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.520> gonna

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
have the paper cut we know it's gonna

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.020 
have the paper cut we know it's gonna
overlap<00:02:12.230> here<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> middle<00:02:13.860> we<00:02:14.490> still<00:02:14.760> have

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
overlap here in the middle we still have

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.670 
overlap here in the middle we still have
issues<00:02:15.990> with<00:02:16.770> all<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.250> paper<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.330> side

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680

the<00:02:25.560> paper<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.910> other<00:02:27.060> direction<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.830> then

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
the paper the other direction and then

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.900 
the paper the other direction and then
from<00:02:30.540> one<00:02:30.810> end<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:34.110> end<00:02:34.550> pull<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.700> paper

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
from one end on one end pull the paper

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.979 
from one end on one end pull the paper
up<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.260> edge<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.220> box<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:39.350> okay

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
up to the edge of the box like this okay

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.330 
up to the edge of the box like this okay
if<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.910> we<00:02:45.690> cut<00:02:46.080> we<00:02:46.950> will<00:02:47.100> cut

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
if you do that and we cut we will cut

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.830 
if you do that and we cut we will cut
I'll<00:02:47.489> turn<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.790> around<00:02:47.910> here<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.630> feel

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
I'll turn it around here so you can feel

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.840 
I'll turn it around here so you can feel
better<00:02:51.590> once<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.739> have<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.920> paper<00:02:53.100> cut<00:02:53.489> meeting

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
better once we have a paper cut meeting

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.270 
better once we have a paper cut meeting
the<00:02:53.970> edge<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.450> we<00:02:55.110> will<00:02:55.260> be<00:02:55.350> able<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.650> cut<00:02:55.920> on

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the edge here we will be able to cut on

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.360 
the edge here we will be able to cut on
one<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.549> these<00:02:56.760> lines<00:02:57.200> about<00:02:58.200> here<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.830> then

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
one of these lines about here and then

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.150 
one of these lines about here and then
once<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.150> excess<00:03:00.570> paper<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.110> gone<00:03:01.350> we<00:03:01.980> will

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
once the excess paper is gone we will

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.940 
once the excess paper is gone we will
divide<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:03.360> distance<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.440> paper<00:03:04.709> with

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
divide the distance on the paper with

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.440 
divide the distance on the paper with
the<00:03:05.040> box<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.489> I'll<00:03:05.610> show<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.239> a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the box and I'll show you that in just a

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.289 
the box and I'll show you that in just a
minute<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:06.930> let's<00:03:07.530> cut<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.010> excess<00:03:09.000> paper

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
minute so let's cut this excess paper

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.210 
minute so let's cut this excess paper
off<00:03:10.730> once<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.910> excess<00:03:12.269> paper<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.720> cut<00:03:12.989> off

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
off once the excess paper is cut off

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.710 
off once the excess paper is cut off
then<00:03:14.269> you<00:03:15.269> can<00:03:15.420> see<00:03:16.160> here<00:03:17.160> where<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.420> divide

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
then you can see here where we divide

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.350 
then you can see here where we divide
the<00:03:19.350> paper<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.280> each<00:03:20.489> side<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> box

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
the paper on each side of the box

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.210 
the paper on each side of the box
equally<00:03:22.040> okay

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
equally okay

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.580 
equally okay
about<00:03:23.580> like<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.810> then<00:03:24.959> when<00:03:25.170> we<00:03:25.230> bring<00:03:25.440> it

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
about like that so then when we bring it

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.340 
about like that so then when we bring it
up<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.100> bring<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.790> down<00:03:26.820> we<00:03:27.630> know<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:28.049> there

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
up and bring it down we know that there

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.289 
up and bring it down we know that there
it<00:03:28.590> will<00:03:28.709> be<00:03:28.860> covered<00:03:29.580> sufficiently<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
it will be covered sufficiently on the

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.440 
it will be covered sufficiently on the
sides<00:03:30.510> okay<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:32.280> next<00:03:32.580> step

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
sides okay so the next step

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.430 
sides okay so the next step
it's<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.830> wrap<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.520> box<00:03:36.080> once<00:03:37.080> we<00:03:37.260> have<00:03:37.349> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
it's to wrap the box once we have the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.820 
it's to wrap the box once we have the
paper<00:03:37.770> all<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.900> always<00:03:40.110> put<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> piece<00:03:40.800> of

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
paper all so I always put a piece of

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.030 
paper all so I always put a piece of
tape<00:03:40.950> here<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.489> middle<00:03:41.790> on<00:03:42.050> this<00:03:43.050> piece<00:03:43.410> of

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
tape here in the middle on this piece of

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.250 
tape here in the middle on this piece of
paper<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.000> holds<00:03:45.360> everything<00:03:46.110> else

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
paper so that it holds everything else

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.100 
paper so that it holds everything else
securely<00:03:49.670> okay<00:03:50.670> now<00:03:51.209> cut<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.690> little<00:03:51.989> bit

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
securely okay now cut that a little bit

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.430 
securely okay now cut that a little bit
laughs<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:53.280> I'm<00:03:53.400> gonna<00:03:53.580> just<00:03:54.170> sing<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.200> a

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
laughs so I'm gonna just sing it a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.940 
laughs so I'm gonna just sing it a
little<00:03:55.709> bit<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:57.450> gives<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.780> nice<00:03:57.989> crisp<00:03:58.700> edge

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
little bit it gives it a nice crisp edge

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.410 
little bit it gives it a nice crisp edge
you<00:04:01.950> don't<00:04:01.980> have<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.670> do<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.940> if<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.239> don't

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
you don't have to do that if you don't

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.670 
you don't have to do that if you don't
want<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.810> if<00:04:03.959> you're<00:04:04.080> running<00:04:04.260> out<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.500> time

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
want to if you're running out of time

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.620 
want to if you're running out of time
okay

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
okay

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.080 
okay
so<00:04:07.050> just<00:04:07.319> bring<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.680> up<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.010> kind<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.340> pull<00:04:09.060> it

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
so just bring it up and kind of pull it

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.500 
so just bring it up and kind of pull it
taut<00:04:09.450> like<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:11.700> put<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.940> piece<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.180> tape

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
taut like that and put a piece of tape

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.789 
taut like that and put a piece of tape
there<00:04:14.450> we<00:04:15.450> have<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:15.720> basically<00:04:15.870> divided<00:04:16.590> on

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
there we have it basically divided on

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.500 
there we have it basically divided on
each<00:04:17.280> side<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:19.489> when<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.579> was<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.910> growing<00:04:21.239> up<00:04:21.359> I

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
each side so when I was the growing up I

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.790 
each side so when I was the growing up I
learned<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:23.490> wrap<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.150> ends<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.570> box<00:04:24.840> coming

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
learned to wrap the ends of a box coming

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.420 
learned to wrap the ends of a box coming
in<00:04:25.919> on<00:04:26.040> each<00:04:26.190> side<00:04:26.690> well<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:28.680> kind<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.100> pain

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
in on each side well it's kind of a pain

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.600 
in on each side well it's kind of a pain
trying<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.540> seems<00:04:30.900> bulky<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.530> me<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:31.950> one<00:04:32.580> of

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
trying it seems bulky to me so one of

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.460 
trying it seems bulky to me so one of
the<00:04:32.820> things<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.240> learned<00:04:33.450> was<00:04:33.750> just<00:04:34.260> come

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
the things that I learned was just come

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.820 
the things that I learned was just come
straight<00:04:34.830> down<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:37.050> put<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.290> piece<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.530> tape

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
straight down and put a piece of tape

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.170 
straight down and put a piece of tape
right<00:04:37.860> there<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.370> can't<00:04:38.580> ever<00:04:38.640> have<00:04:38.729> too<00:04:38.910> much

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
right there you can't ever have too much

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.680 
right there you can't ever have too much
tape<00:04:41.570> okay<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.810> then<00:04:43.220> bring<00:04:44.220> your<00:04:45.090> paper<00:04:45.330> over

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
tape okay and then bring your paper over

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.270 
tape okay and then bring your paper over
and<00:04:45.840> increase<00:04:46.680> these<00:04:47.669> wings<00:04:48.830> I'll<00:04:49.830> call<00:04:50.070> them

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
and increase these wings I'll call them

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.770
