00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.060 

so<00:01:37.609> placing<00:01:38.000> them<00:01:38.119> in<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.240> basket<00:01:38.450> now<00:01:39.070> when

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
so placing them in the basket now when

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.679 
so placing them in the basket now when
we<00:01:40.159> put<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.399> lid<00:01:40.579> on<00:01:40.609> you'll<00:01:41.299> see<00:01:41.509> that

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
we put the lid on you'll see that

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.810 
we put the lid on you'll see that
they're<00:01:41.840> steaming<00:01:42.250> but<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.369> creates<00:01:43.670> an

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
they're steaming but it creates an

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.109 
they're steaming but it creates an
environment<00:01:44.060> where<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.630> steam<00:01:45.969> continues<00:01:46.969> to

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
environment where the steam continues to

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.200 
environment where the steam continues to
cook<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.450> tortilla<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.020> creates<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.860> warm

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
cook the tortilla and creates a warm

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.760 
cook the tortilla and creates a warm
moist<00:01:50.210> environment<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.140> tortillas<00:01:51.560> don't

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
moist environment so the tortillas don't

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.910 
moist environment so the tortillas don't
dry<00:01:52.039> out<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.399> become<00:01:52.689> crunchy<00:01:53.689> or<00:01:54.079> dry<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.649> eat

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
dry out and become crunchy or dry to eat

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.069 
dry out and become crunchy or dry to eat
so<00:01:55.819> they'll<00:01:55.969> sit<00:01:56.149> up<00:01:56.270> there<00:01:56.420> for<00:01:56.600> two<00:01:56.810> or<00:01:56.899> three

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
so they'll sit up there for two or three

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.419 
so they'll sit up there for two or three
minutes<00:01:57.200> just<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.679> finish<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.130> cooking

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
minutes just to finish the cooking
