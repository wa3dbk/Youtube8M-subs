00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.970 
continuous operation underwater as well
as<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.790> two<00:03:13.209> minutes<00:03:13.599> submerged<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.620> then

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
as the two minutes submerged and then

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.759 
as the two minutes submerged and then
tested<00:03:15.549> now<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:16.450> next<00:03:16.870> day<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.260> results<00:03:17.680> are

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
tested now the next day the results are

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.729 
tested now the next day the results are
a<00:03:17.829> little<00:03:17.859> bit<00:03:18.129> different<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:19.000> Traxxas<00:03:19.870> 2075

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
a little bit different the Traxxas 2075

a little bit different the Traxxas 2075
servo<00:03:21.129> still<00:03:21.909> performed<00:03:22.329> flawlessly<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:22.900> they

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
servo still performed flawlessly so they

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.119 
servo still performed flawlessly so they
