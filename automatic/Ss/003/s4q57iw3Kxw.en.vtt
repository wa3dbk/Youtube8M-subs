amazing<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:27.600> used<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.840> sleep<00:04:28.110> in<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.410> then<00:04:28.919> I'd

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
amazing I used to sleep in it then I'd

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.040 
amazing I used to sleep in it then I'd
wake<00:04:29.190> up<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.460> morning<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.060> it'll<00:04:30.539> go<00:04:30.720> I

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
wake up in the morning and it'll go I

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.870 
wake up in the morning and it'll go I
never<00:04:31.560> really<00:04:31.860> gotten<00:04:32.010> Sudha<00:04:32.430> cram<00:04:32.610> height

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
never really gotten Sudha cram height

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.550 
never really gotten Sudha cram height
for<00:04:33.150> spots<00:04:33.449> because<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.810> found<00:04:34.110> that<00:04:34.320> face

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
for spots because I found that face

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.140 
for spots because I found that face
masks<00:04:35.039> work<00:04:35.250> really<00:04:35.460> really<00:04:35.610> well<00:04:35.850> and

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
masks work really really well and

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.000 
masks work really really well and
another<00:04:36.750> trick<00:04:37.020> that<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.320> use<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.590> keep<00:04:37.710> my<00:04:37.830> skin

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
another trick that I use to keep my skin

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.500 
another trick that I use to keep my skin
fresh<00:04:38.250> is<00:04:38.460> using<00:04:38.729> exfoliating<00:04:39.389> gloves

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
fresh is using exfoliating gloves

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.659 
fresh is using exfoliating gloves
obviously<00:04:40.229> use<00:04:40.740> them<00:04:40.889> very<00:04:41.070> carefully

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
obviously use them very carefully

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.070 
obviously use them very carefully
I<00:04:41.760> find<00:04:42.030> this<00:04:42.150> gets<00:04:42.330> all<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.570> dead<00:04:42.750> skin<00:04:42.870> off

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
I find this gets all the dead skin off

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.480 
I find this gets all the dead skin off
