00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.170
 very good all my name is frames and 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.290
 welcome to battlefield 4 in this 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.720
 occasion touches first and new guidance in the 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.400
 channel but it's from the battle fil is not from 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.200
 call of duty so let's see how 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.570
 come out let's see if people help 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.119
 to see if it serves as something to follow 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.680
 making more guides of course because 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.710
 when I started playing this game that 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.390
 It was a month and a half months two months ago me 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.400
 they gave advice tips that to me 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.890
 they were worth tips that I want to share 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.510
 with you to be able to six novices by 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.249
 if you just started in the game do it 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.579
 more or less well or have certain 

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:38.889
 references and guides of a person who 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.989
 has gone through it not so like what 

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:43.059
 mine is very recent, not in fact 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.989
 Well, I still do not hesitate 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.339
 because as I say I carry that I know 150 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.979
 hours more or less plays this game 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.440
 because more or less more or less is not that 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.959
 be total novice but I am I am there 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.670
 there is not so at first coming from the 

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:59.949
 call of duty gave me advice for 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.479
 adapt to the film film tips that 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.699
 they have been etched in my memory and 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.859
 I want to share with you but for 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.010
 Of course what I am going to say is my 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:08.900
 opinion and that of another 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.230
 what has helped me does not mean 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.090
 which is the truth but it is therefore something that 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.010
 I liked it and I want it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.560
 who has said not repeat me more times 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.660
 share with you so good to me 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.490
 in view mode my point of view comes 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.680
 of the call of duty and the call of duty 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.750
 I will explain so first what 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.230
 let's do is always play or almost 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.120
 always at the beginning in domination etc 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.070
 which it is the typical mourning for teams 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.620
 because they are the modes of the game that most 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.160
 they adapt to what is being called 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.810
 of duty small maps or maps and they are 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.370
 large maps but they are closed no 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.170
 are bounded by a red mesh that does not 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.350
 you can pass it on that you trespass 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.450
 they are smaller are adapted maps more 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.729
 or less in the style of call of duty 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.130
 they have a distance from the game 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.430
 not similar and the action that usually 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.750
 in that type of games is also more or 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.610
 less how each car has is 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.740
 exactly as frantic but 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.660
 can we turn it into 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.330
 frantic as long as we know to 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.310
 where to go where to position ourselves 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.870
 and how to organize with the patrol not 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.840
 because this is one of the things that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.460
 I want to influence the patrol is something very 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.800
 important in the debate, fil is something 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.690
 that I did not have nor have I taken into account 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.060
 until very recently, not until 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.770
 a few weeks playing on patrol is something 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.870
 that in the battlefield first I 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.850
 you go better because in the call of duty I 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.040
 I have a great time playing just from 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.380
 fact is one of the ways that better me 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.210
 it happened but in the battlefield not to be 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.670
 to play in patrol is a little bit 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.650
 pacifier is a bit difficult to win 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.210
 items in the call of duty something that 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.940
 you can do is win the games by 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.520
 You can only take streaks you can take 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.800
 flags you can do 50,000 things for 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.530
 win the game by yourself but in the 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.330
 case of the battlefield if you're not in a 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.520
 patrol when at least in domain etc 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.590
 Maybe maybe a 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.570
 little bit of you but in domain or in 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.420
 assault or our style of games do not 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.280
 you are well in line with the patrol as 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.709
 it's hard to win is not something that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.690
 that costs for that very reason that 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.360
 playing with friends in the battlefield is 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.459
 something that I find paramount not 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.750
 I really do not play the battlefield 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.440
 play the battlefield if I'm alone 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.060
 because he sees me 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.350
 assault and play with the sniper to 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.510
 entertain me that seems super 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.440
 fun but what has been the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.350
 game modes that I have informed you 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.660
 decent domain if not the game with a 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.820
 Equipillo with a patrol with friends 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.590
 Well, I kind of like it's not true 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.420
 and here eye to the data I want to make a 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.630
 small parentheses because in this clip 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.240
 you will see that I start to reborn people 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.700
 to throw out kits kill reborn kill 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.680
 reborn and is the best way and form 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.780
 which I thought was faster for 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.820
 raise points because many I 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.340
 you ask did not mark this hover but that 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.800
 already at level 104 in 110 as 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.540
 you can upload so many uncle points and say 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.980
 that you are a novice because it is very easy 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.440
 know what I'm living vote and 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.980
 you want to revive medicine cabinets and revive 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.990
 throwing bullets killing people is easy no 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.210
 I do not know how many points he threw me in this 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.760
 little minute but I'm pretty 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.130
 sure they have been enough so 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.220
 it's pretty sure that it's been quite 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.720
 so good kids, I hope you have 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.150
 enjoyed the good guide perate that 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.669
 it's a long time before he goes forward 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.500
 many times here I have put a few 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.570
 bits with the sniper where he had a 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.880
 little bit so you can see who could play 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.580
 and he could play aggressively with 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.160
 the sniper because both forms the truth 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.750
 is that it catches my attention I like them in 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.169
 the battlefield play with these 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.510
 styles not with these two styles with the 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.830
 sniper rifles those designated 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.930
 not only can it be but the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.419
 debod action rifles so broke 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.010
 following with the guides kids domain 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.530
 it's something you have to prove if you come 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.330
 of the clear you do the same and there's a lot 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.330
 people also ask me how they 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.490
 spot people as you do that from the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.950
 hand frames because I have many times not 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.210
 that has seen people so quickly 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.490
 no and sometimes he lets go of my hand and 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.800
 other times I do not like I do this because 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.640
 single in playstation 4 is done with the 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:14.750
 r1 and start a 3 with the r2 I started 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.880
 does with the cv and in xbox one and 360 I do not know 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.590
 how it will be but we did not imagine in the 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.840
 trigger that is above shooting 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.610
 because it's below depends not where 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.940
 shoot then the opposite that is 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.340
 above 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.800
 or down so good going on to 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.180
 next advice from the kids guide 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.280
 here for example you have seen not doing 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.070
 the symbol that I just told you not the 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.870
 by the hand that is sighting people and 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.510
 I recommend to me he recommended it to me deep 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.790
 be a colleague told me frames before 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.800
 always point to view me when I live 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.500
 the map I'm constantly pushing 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.720
 by clicking the button to see not because 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.420
 it is better that people are sighted and what 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.850
 kill a mate or kill him 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.590
 you kill the enemy you and Uncle 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.870
 is not sighted not for us to 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.330
 can kill so always always 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.090
 you always have to be in the games 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.950
 giving the button to constantly watch 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.780
 at first I thought that that has to 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.540
 do pointing and you do not need to point 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.940
 while the enemy is within 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.880
 four of the four blades that have 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.380
 all weapons are worth you not worth it 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.660
 that is simple kid this while 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.970
 watch all the time give it and I hope that 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.590
 you have liked anarchy so far I will do 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.240
 a few chapters because I do not want 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.670
 extend myself too much I'll do several 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.290
 chapters drop it in the section of 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.449
 comments what do you think that 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.580
 is basic to this game so that I 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.900
 I can explain it in the following 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.180
 episode so good kids I hope 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.069
 that you picture the game tips more 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.930
 tips will come about the battlefield 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:41.469
 greetings see you later 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.469
