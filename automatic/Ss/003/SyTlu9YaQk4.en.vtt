Todd I could promise you Kevin knows the
next<00:02:13.860> 20<00:02:14.130> seconds<00:02:14.520> are<00:02:14.880> not<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.330> be<00:02:15.390> fun

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
next 20 seconds are not going to be fun

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.570 
next 20 seconds are not going to be fun
he's<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.500> ignoring<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.069> here<00:02:17.370> when<00:02:17.489> he

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
he's just ignoring this here when he

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.699 
he's just ignoring this here when he
picked<00:02:17.790> fourth<00:02:18.120> overall<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:21.450> before<00:02:21.900> it's

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
picked fourth overall on before it's

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.320 
picked fourth overall on before it's
just<00:02:22.830> whether<00:02:22.980> or<00:02:23.099> not<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.370> translates<00:02:23.910> into

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
just whether or not that translates into

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.690 
just whether or not that translates into
a<00:02:24.450> better
