cutting that's just one example of what

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.609 
cutting that's just one example of what
we<00:01:56.499> can<00:01:56.649> do<00:01:56.740> with<00:01:56.859> a<00:01:56.890> curved<00:01:57.130> comb<00:01:58.619> initially

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
we can do with a curved comb initially

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.279 
we can do with a curved comb initially
we<00:01:59.740> cut<00:01:59.950> our<00:02:00.070> diagonal<00:02:00.640> forward<00:02:00.939> a<00:02:01.329> line<00:02:01.630> using

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
we cut our diagonal forward a line using

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.919 
we cut our diagonal forward a line using
condense<00:02:02.799> curved<00:02:03.070> comb<00:02:03.340> cutting<00:02:03.729> now<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.689> come

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
condense curved comb cutting now I come

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.559 
condense curved comb cutting now I come
to<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.200> nose<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:05.890> I<00:02:06.280> gather<00:02:06.520> all<00:02:06.939> of<00:02:06.999> the<00:02:07.539> hair

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
to the nose and I gather all of the hair

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.940 
to the nose and I gather all of the hair
up<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.880> into<00:02:09.880> my<00:02:10.060> hand<00:02:10.420> now<00:02:10.780> because<00:02:11.710> the

reaches so I won't destroy my a line I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.860 
reaches so I won't destroy my a line I
won't<00:02:21.110> disturb<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.460> basic<00:02:22.910> shape<00:02:23.240> but<00:02:23.690> when<00:02:23.840> I

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
won't disturb the basic shape but when I

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.860 
won't disturb the basic shape but when I
drag<00:02:24.230> all<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.980> hair<00:02:25.280> forward<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.420> I

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
drag all this hair forward and I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.620 
drag all this hair forward and I
condense<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.770> in<00:02:28.220> an<00:02:28.400> area<00:02:28.580> directly<00:02:29.270> above
