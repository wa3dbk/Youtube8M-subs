by<00:00:37.130> Super<00:00:38.130> Nintendo<00:00:38.220> I<00:00:38.550> think<00:00:38.880> or<00:00:39.000> Nintendo<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

think this was made by Sega Genesis
because<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.340> has<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.610> Sega<00:00:41.820> Genesis<00:00:42.270> look<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720

because it has that Sega Genesis look to
it<00:00:42.870> especially<00:00:43.380> in<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> neck<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> logo<00:00:44.430> right

the<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.120> paintwork<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.049> believe<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.620> is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the the paintwork but I believe this is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.300 
the the paintwork but I believe this is
removable<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.599> whole<00:02:30.650> cloth<00:02:31.650> thingie<00:02:32.099> here

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
removable this whole cloth thingie here

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.780 
removable this whole cloth thingie here
so<00:02:32.489> every

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
so every

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.699 
so every
thing<00:02:32.909> just<00:02:33.120> pretty<00:02:33.299> much<00:02:33.450> attaches<00:02:34.079> to<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
thing just pretty much attaches to the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.170 
thing just pretty much attaches to the
figure<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.159> we'll<00:02:35.280> take<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> close<00:02:35.670> look<00:02:35.790> here

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
