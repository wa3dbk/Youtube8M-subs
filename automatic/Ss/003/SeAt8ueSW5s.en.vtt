00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.840
 and now that it 's as stable speaks its 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.760
 friend saramago 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.920
 I have to teach this tutorial of how 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.439
 make the two types of gloves there 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.020
 in minecraft how to create them is very easy 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:22.850
 and it's very simple, we feel very few 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.710
 things and I will show you how 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.110
 because the first thing we have to do 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.380
 to be the first goal is the goal of 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.380
 snow 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.050
 We are two blocks of snow 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.050
 and a pumpkin 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.600
 the snow blocks we got 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.760
 only in an area where it is snowing 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.710
 with a multi external shovel the snow 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.210
 we go to the work table and we do it 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.700
 blocks once this is done 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.340
 We can find the pumpkin 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.900
 exploring the world of minecraft once 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.750
 that we have these 2 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.850
 these two minerals so to speak 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.160
 we place in a way the block of 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.230
 snow like this 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.480
 right away in the second block 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.480
 that is in the form of a pile 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.350
 and finally we put the pumpkin 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.409
 over here 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.720
 this we can put 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.410
 a block 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.610
 to better reach and put the pumpkin 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.890
 over and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.420
 as you can see here is the first goal 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.420
 in snow 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.820
 ok friends I bring you a second goal from 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.820
 my 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.410
 for this we need the four blocks 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.130
 and the pumpkin 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.369
 although these four blocks are blocks 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.189
 of iron we got them doing 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.369
 good ore iron ingots let's go 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.950
 baked this we make the ingot 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.270
 once we have the ingots done 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.820
 we are going to put work 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.860
 and we make them this blocks ok the way 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.250
 as it has been like a puzzle type 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.170
 we put one like this 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.410
 another like that 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.380
 one from the side 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.460
 and others we make them in the way we do 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.740
 a form of the letter t 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.610
 Once this is done, they can put a 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.819
 block here go up and put the pumpkin 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.159
 and so we want 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.299
 of iron as you can see this is easy 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:48.450
 very simple does not have much complication 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:53.050
 and here I left the two types of golem 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:57.480
 excel iron and here 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.480
 we have some snow 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.739
 ok that's all friends using friends 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.360
 in the assembly after another tutorial and we 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.360
 we see until the next
