is<00:02:45.060> as<00:02:45.690> if<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:47.550> person<00:02:47.730> has<00:02:48.120> freed<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.810> slave<00:02:49.550> as

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
is as if the person has freed a slave as

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.340 
is as if the person has freed a slave as
if<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.360> person<00:02:51.780> has<00:02:52.070> freed<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.280> slave

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
if the person has freed a slave

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.650 
if the person has freed a slave
what<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.470> freeing<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.980> slave<00:02:56.420> freeing<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.630> slave

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
what is freeing a slave freeing a slave

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.890 
what is freeing a slave freeing a slave
it's<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:59.010> giving<00:02:59.400> forty<00:03:00.120> thousand<00:03:00.600> dollars

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
it's like giving forty thousand dollars

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.790

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
dollars that's the equivalent modern day

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.880 
dollars that's the equivalent modern day
of<00:03:08.130> freeing<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.150> slave<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:10.170> reward<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.709> so

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
of freeing a slave the reward is so

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.590 
of freeing a slave the reward is so
immense<00:03:11.220> because<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:12.030> such<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.239> rare

you to make as much too often as
possible<00:03:22.140> count<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.980> seven<00:03:23.310> circuits<00:03:23.700> and

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
possible count the seven circuits and

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.420 
possible count the seven circuits and
play<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> raucous<00:03:25.170> count<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.190> seventh

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
play to a raucous count the seventh

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.430 
play to a raucous count the seventh
circuits<00:03:26.730> again<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.120> make<00:03:27.660> play<00:03:27.930> two<00:03:27.989> Rakas

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
circuits again and make play two Rakas

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.800 
circuits again and make play two Rakas
and<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.400> something<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.390> can<00:03:30.540> do<00:03:30.660> a

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
you're making pull offs if you lose you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.530 
you're making pull offs if you lose you
will<00:03:37.739> do<00:03:37.830> in<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.069> middle<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.400> Tawaf<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.390> can

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
will do in the middle of Tawaf you can

I'm making the laughs I made three

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.280 
I'm making the laughs I made three
circuits<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.769> lost<00:03:46.980> my<00:03:47.099> will<00:03:47.250> do<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.610> go<00:03:48.299> hey

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
circuits and I lost my will do a go hey

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.110 
circuits and I lost my will do a go hey
I've<00:03:49.769> competed<00:03:50.130> three<00:03:50.400> circuits<00:03:50.760> I'm<00:03:50.880> in<00:03:51.000> my

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
I've competed three circuits I'm in my

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.539 
I've competed three circuits I'm in my
fourth<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.630> go<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.739> make<00:03:52.860> my<00:03:53.010> will<00:03:53.160> do<00:03:53.280> come

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
fourth I go and make my will do come

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.670 
fourth I go and make my will do come
back<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.910> start<00:03:54.299> my<00:03:54.450> fourth<00:03:54.720> circuit<00:03:55.019> again<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
back I start my fourth circuit again and

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.580 
back I start my fourth circuit again and
continue<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:57.090> just<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.989> few<00:03:58.140> pointers<00:03:58.470> about

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
continue so just a few pointers about

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.089 
continue so just a few pointers about
wha
