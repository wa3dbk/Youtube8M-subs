00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.610
 when I will explain to you guys 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.110
 little things on the topic of calderÃ³n 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.120
 drunkenness 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.650
 some details milestones that you have to have in 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.280
 always count on ways that we have a 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.280
 new cable 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.670
 and we can meet with a small 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.289
 little problem 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.160
 no matter how much we have it 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.850
 we can get complicated with this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.650
 hook you have here 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.920
 and I'm going to advise you that when 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.520
 have a new cable verify that 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.520
 at least have 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.110
 a measure with which we can 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.730
 enter it in the servo support that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.200
 It is where you should spend the cable 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.670
 clutch 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.640
 here I have a support for you 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.500
 can see how low 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.450
 and as in a boat 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.890
 that is the correct way where 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.060
 mounted cable clutch inward 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.860
 of the interior of the motor of the car pardon 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.860
 then the stand of the deer 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.510
 sometimes you can tell how it's going 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.310
 everything put like this 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.509
 inside d 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.509
 in the engine room 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.080
 unicable and greece enters in 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.100
 and hooks 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.170
 now I had shown now I have 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.950
 a pedalboard so that they realize 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.950
 where it hooks 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.040
 etc 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.880
 a diet to accumulate so they can 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.880
 watch 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.570
 and once you entered the cable 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 of transform that has to go 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.320
 and fight 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.940
 all right 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.940
 back here 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.200
 in some new cables 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.450
 this process well and so nailed that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.299
 you can not manipulate it in 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.550
 when all this is placed so 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.630
 try to loosen it so that it turns 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.940
 on how it turns 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.140
 because in this way you can 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.140
 work more they charge in 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.599
 with a help from some tool 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.610
 they have to get up and then 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.470
 pull and lower it and you're hooked 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.220
 there's no way out of there 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.630
 but good note 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.630
 I for example gave myself 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.140
 the width of the habitat is 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.490
 35 free nectar 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.970
 we do not make the book so they have it 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.970
 consider 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.090
 let's measure it 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.450
 we have go to 75 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.720
 80 's and 11 would well again 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.150
 mini deer stand that these in 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.970
 some cables come very large and not 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.480
 it's a way of passing it, it happened to me when the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.970
 Roque car 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.890
 when I wanted to put the cable that brought 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.140
 in a new one that I had in the trunk I did not 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.690
 can put here the goats come up 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.820
 measure 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.370
 so for more new cable that they have 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:33.020
 in the spare trunk try 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.690
 have them spent 1180 1175 so that they do not 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.010
 have problems passing it this 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.490
 in this other view have movement 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.370
 so good 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.550
 I think he more or less understood 9 very 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.550
 boy
