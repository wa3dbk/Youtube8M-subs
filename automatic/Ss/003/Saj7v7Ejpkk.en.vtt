the<00:01:53.360> thinness<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.899> knife<00:01:55.110> though<00:01:55.820> these

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the thinness of this knife though these

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.490 
the thinness of this knife though these
stainless<00:01:57.719> steel<00:01:58.079> liners<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:59.430> a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
stainless steel liners and then a

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.120 
stainless steel liners and then a
plastic<00:02:01.500> or<00:02:02.100> again<00:02:02.939> probably<00:02:03.630> FRN<00:02:04.259> or<00:02:04.469> g10<00:02:04.920> I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
plastic or again probably FRN or g10 I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.850 
plastic or again probably FRN or g10 I
don't<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.579> g10<00:02:07.069> backspacer<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.489> then

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
don't think it's g10 backspacer and then

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.740 
don't think it's g10 backspacer and then
you<00:02:08.920> have<00:02:09.039> these<00:02:09.160> really<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.970> rinky-dinky

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
you have these really just rinky-dinky

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.960 
you have these really just rinky-dinky
thin<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:12.070> a<00:02:12.100> most<00:02:12.550> like<00:02:13.080> paper<00:02:14.080> thin<00:02:14.970> g10

work<00:02:38.290> well<00:02:38.820> maybe<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.940> little<00:02:40.209> bit<00:02:40.510> less<00:02:40.810> space

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
work well maybe a little bit less space

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.490 
work well maybe a little bit less space
on<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:43.150> side<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:43.930> know<00:02:44.050> would<00:02:44.230> run<00:02:44.500> great<00:02:44.890> on

crazy if I hold this right here maybe
get<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.560> focus<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:45.070> little<00:03:45.130> bit<00:03:45.370> better

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.470 

alright<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:50.760> okay<00:03:51.760> it's<00:03:51.910> going<00:03:52.060> out<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.239> focus

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
little bit up and down play side to side

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.860 
little bit up and down play side to side
you<00:04:30.669> can<00:04:30.789> tighten<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.150> pivot<00:04:31.479> down<00:04:31.599> a<00:04:31.660> little

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
you can tighten the pivot down a little

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.360 
you can tighten the pivot down a little
bit<00:04:32.050> but<00:04:32.289> then<00:04:32.440> it's<00:04:32.590> not<00:04:32.680> gonna<00:04:32.800> be<00:04:32.950> centered

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
bit but then it's not gonna be centered

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.610 
bit but then it's not gonna be centered
right<00:04:33.580> now<00:04:34.210> it's<00:04:34.479> you<00:04:35.229> know<00:04:35.320> pretty<00:04:35.500> well

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
right now it's you know pretty well

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.839 
right now it's you know pretty well
centered<00:04:35.919> flips<00:04:36.400> well<00:04:38.190> but<00:04:39.190> again<00:04:39.460> just

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
centered flips well but again just

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.029 
centered flips well but again just
overall<00:04:41.010> not<00:04:42.010> a<00:04:43.140> good<00:04:44.140> quality<00:04:44.349> knife<00:04:44.710> you
