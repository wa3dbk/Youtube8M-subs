that this car were used for the 2008 and

2009 seasons it was deployed a lot in
2009<00:03:43.960> in<00:03:44.230> particular<00:03:44.620> when<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.250> was<00:03:45.490> often<00:03:45.790> out

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
2009 in particular when it was often out

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:55.610 
2009 in particular when it was often out
