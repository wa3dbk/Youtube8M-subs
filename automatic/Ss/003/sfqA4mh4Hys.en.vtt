00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.440
 The US president has repeatedly stated that 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.049
 no plans to hold ground 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.700
 operations against the Islamic state 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.410
 however, some former even acting 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.969
 officials apparently do not believe 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.040
 promises of their president 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.500
 US Army Chief of Staff 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.020
 general and ray adverno told reporters 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.420
 that air strikes will not be enough to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.920
 Obama achievement 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.320
 which is to eliminate 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.689
 grouping general said the following 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
 quote for the destruction of extremists 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.590
 ground presence is required 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.730
 in the region 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.010
 to achieve the presidentâ€™s 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.750
 tasks in the region need a presence 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.460
 ground forces 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.980
 American soldiers will have to risk 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.079
 with their lives if the moment comes 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.030
 when I consider our advisors 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.550
 must accompany Iraqi troops in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.800
 attacks against specific objects igil i 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.870
 I will advise Obama to the president 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.610
 opponent with a tighter speaker position 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 house of representatives john baner 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.539
 criticized the president for saying 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.579
 that the us will not participate ground 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.469
 military operation in iraq and syria name 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.480
 text 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.400
 f-16 is not a strategy in itself 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.060
 airstrike they will help us reach 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.439
 necessary result for another 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.030
 ocean side in a similar vein 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.310
 speaks former prime minister 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.049
 britain tony blair actively 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 supported george bush during 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.780
 invasion of iraq 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.490
 now he declares that the British troops 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.799
 must be ready to return to this 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.869
 Are the Americans ready for military? 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.420
 action we asked about this passersby 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.640
 near the white house I support the military 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.290
 actions against the Islamic state 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.700
 but I do not think that you need to conduct ground 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.710
 operation right now 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.450
 how about you start it later 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.759
 depends on the circumstances 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.610
 if this is justified i would say yes 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.829
 but there must be good reasons we already 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.240
 decently broke wood there I do not think that 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.869
 further us presence in this 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.180
 the region 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.670
 can benefit me or mine 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.530
 fellow citizens of 1600 American 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.479
 servicemen are already in Iraq 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.939
 the us president said they would not 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.619
 take part in hostilities 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.689
 only in teaching and training so 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.460
 called local partner forces but 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.469
 some officials apparently 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.750
 prepare the public for a possible 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.560
 regular ground operation gyna slightly 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.129
