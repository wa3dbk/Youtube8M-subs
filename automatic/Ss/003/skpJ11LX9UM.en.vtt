 we have already made up for it here 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.449
 like to play in the drawer 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.520
 originally one 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.390
 then came from and we had 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.430
 three options and I could offer the so 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 flat or the saint john or plate and care of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.950
 let me down and then I have a lot of fun 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.080
 In addition , I chose it as I did 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.990
 municipal office concrete and the what for 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.750
 us and we certainly have a bed or garden at home 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.330
 and that again , hazel 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.670
 van see people I know with people from the gland 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.890
 I you so I have seen them and ask 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.170
 they say if you come by dating 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.070
 are you welcome to the fine and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.200
 know that well what care living means 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.930
 decided in the coalition agreement 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.130
 that the care homes are going to disappear 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.530
 in the long term and has gibberish back 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.869
 a new products for designed and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.369
 that they call them living here and care 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.409
 that finally flatters out of it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.540
 separate living and care 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.409
 But that means they are a client one 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.170
 apartment 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.950
 are going to rent from our partner Brabant 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.040
 they can then live in care and care in copper 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.380
 but not only care they purchase 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.600
 but of course also make use of 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.890
 all facilities that we consider as low 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.789
 cities of bidah 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.250
 yes we have that in the drawer and help 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.379
 clothing had stood us very well 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.780
 because the name we still have in our old age 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:20.879
 that we also have a fitness center there 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:24.780
 can use to of all things 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.730
 we have is a year of everything and the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.599
 things are big and the people are whole 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.879
 cozy and i just see that we are there anyway 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.750
 because we have to do it if you do 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:40.069
 still wanted to make something of young 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.379
 a desk that we would be so trendy about 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.819
 yet another, and so it is we are 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.709
 by the long niver me 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.980

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.930

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.849
 independent 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.489

 we can just do anything there 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.340
 I was in front of it all day saying 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.159
 but just in there is just that there 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.650

 don't have a child there where am 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.550
 you only have to press a button and 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.090
 the side already belongs to someone under 24 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.629
 hours 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.459

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.569
 pin us everyone around somewhere 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.360
 everyone needs a little bit one 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.690

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.709

 sweet a big one 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.500

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.530
 his sweather we are not there 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.870
 more your mother's table every day 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.350

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.069

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.080
 good freshly cooked food and we got there 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.760
 a this also fine because it is 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.440
 served in first I thought but I would 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.940
 try a sale as we open there 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.470
 can get in the room 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.910
 getting late first time because me 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.950
 still has to be in the afternoon 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.169
 rest and there is also when it then 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.419
 keep people see you through even at 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.769
 Afternoon calm again and well was not there 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.010
 want to do it 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.020
 since working on then i think care 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.530
 live for Mr. and Mrs. van Gemert 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.590
 and the good solution is that they 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.300
 clients in need of care 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.770
 can remain a safe living environment 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.930
 and that they take all care and all 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.380
 facilities can continue to decline and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.840
 it's great that that brabant care itself 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.540
 for these clients remains committed to 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.680
 make sure they have a nice daytime 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.930
 can get 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.040
 I have looked at me and here very much 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.010
 call these 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.300
 and I definitely think we approach all 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.550
 sit here I got a good impression and 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.039
 we look forward to winning here 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.169
 out what our good start to 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:13.360
 network my husband says the will be here 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.360
