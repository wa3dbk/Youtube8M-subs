00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.120
 it's good alligator 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:16.410
 to see if it's good is alligator what 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.300
 happened is caiman speaks ernesto chavana de 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 The city of Monterrey is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.850
 broadcasting live for the whole country 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.279
 and for all of us, I have transmitted a 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.400
 image where you throw yourself from a height of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.769
 67 meters in the fight that you had near 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.699
 from the city of mexico where you throw yourself 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.840
 back and fall straight to the stage 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:42.080
 that is outside the ring 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.590
 hello good night this great pleasure and if 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.750
 it has apparently become a little famous 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.740
 that video of that fight 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.840
 hey practice me first first 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.330
 from where the courage to launch 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.280
 from so high and what happened 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.170
 really if they did not catch you down there 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.329
 your friends or you passed 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.270
 not good that from the beginning I've 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.610
 said it was a bad calculation of mine the reasons 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.790
 to winnow from the truth they form 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.200
 pretty much I had always said that 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.610
 I have a partner that he always made 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.479
 things like that and the fact is that you 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.549
 you are crazy however this time believe me 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.369
 that there is a reason or there is a very reason 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.549
 strong that motivated me to do it was not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.470
 one were many and then I do not know suddenly 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.909
 He already told me watching the stairs and 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:38.409
 I was there is you have skiman 18 years 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:42.789
 and from when practicing is free 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.060
 three and a half years the name says that 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:50.439
 you are a fighter who walks through the sky 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.030
 everywhere he hears and where are you 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.100
 now they are in the hospital you are in your 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.850
 house where are you not right now I'm in your 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.369
 home what 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.770
 the federal district here I am 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.320
 resting right now will have a 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.479
 appointment with the doctor but then the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.880
 most important diagnoses I think that since 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.410
 it happened that you have what problem you have 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.020
 this was a blow that hurt me a couple 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.370
 of bones in the back the ankles 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.670
 I also have pressure on them is the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.130
 impact but what is stronger is 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.880
 the back but it's nothing very 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.340
 big 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.069
 and that I have had several diagnoses with 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.260
 different doctors told me that only 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.830
 with the necessary rest and with the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.410
 break 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.140
 that I give you very soon I'll be 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.210
 come back or you want to return do not fill 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.240
 Well, it's that they came to me today 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.000
 Sport is a passion casts a really 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.880
 very strong for me apart from all this 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.680
 studies however the fight has been already 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.170
 a love that has really created very 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.110
 strong what message do you give to young people 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.590
 who dabble in this difficult 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.030
 dangerous world of wrestling like 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.010
 as an example for me to do that is 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.380
 Well, I want to tell you that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.480
 according to the images is a true 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.190
 miracle what what happened to you 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.770
 because at that height the speed the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.500
 gravity 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:26.300
 the force with which you hit the ground 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.720
 was for you to tell us right now that it is 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.510
 a damage in the column that is very much 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.370
 more severe kaka mind in what I 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.260
 I was talking to a doctor DÃ­az 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.510
 within this I was commenting 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 because even he had the doubt that 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.240
 I lived up there not, and then the case is 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.250
 that we agree the two that of thousand 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.970
 ways that could have happened suddenly 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.400
 I suffered the best because this is not going to 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.800
 stop or stop walking or anything for the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.900
 style simply with time I 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.550
 I will be doing the same thing again 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.800
 before 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.800
 when you see the images that you think 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.930
 the afternoon fear gives me to see it 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:14.500
 there just is not no reason 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.470
 exact because I did it though 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.010
 and runs through any means on my 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:25.120
 bones to know how up there a turn 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.370
 hey and your parents who say all this day 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.860
 the only one who managed to accompany me was my 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.530
 mom and really that some say is that 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.300
 because you got up she was the one 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.910
 engine to get up more than anything for 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.270
 tell you I'm fine do not worry I was 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.920
 even recording the fight and there thrown 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.780
 in my only concern was to get up 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.030
 to tell her it was okay to 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.520
 see I have the video I have two shots 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.340
 one of a person who records it from 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.630
 the rostrum and I have another recording 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.720
 which is below and I see that here is 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.740
 done you hear the crunch of all your 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.110
 bones I hear so loud the crunch of 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.270
 your bones that I think fracture and 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.870
 then 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.820
 I see that as you fall unconscious 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.950
 is that that's what happens to all of me 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.180
 also in this video the video and it 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.310
 I heard a very loud noise 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.889
 I also tried to explain to me that it was 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.250
 because fibers a bone or something like that 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.900
 I would be telling the same thing but not what 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.120
 what happens is that in the air when I fall 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.979
 my hands go with such a figure 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.289
 way that impact you on the floor and what 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.110
 that is heard is the sound of my palm 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:39.560
 with the soil is the leadership that 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.630
 then listen to this when I fall walks 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.120
 like ants in all my legs 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.360
 I feel pressured under the truth 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.639
 and if in my head is the thought 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.810
 because I did it though already when 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.810
 begins to recover mobility 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.480
 there's a relief I never did unconscious 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.910
 I was awake 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.980
 you were aware of the tingling and 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.320
 you got up and what happens is that 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.460
 When you travel your mission it is always 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.930
 conscious that I never lost the 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.969
 knowledge of what he was doing and 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.269
 already when that tingling happens I move 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:21.389
 my partner goes up to second house of 

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:22.739
 fight but I choose something other than 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.589
 two terms below and then I 

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:28.669
 I still went up to finish it you went up 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:28.669
 finish the fight 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:36.569
 and I do not have an angel that ends you 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:39.449
 to say several messages with everything 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:42.210
 just happened in fact if I putting myself 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:44.729
 to meditate 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.340
 I am if the believer that things 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:50.190
 they go through something and then to be able 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.039
 keep walking to make the 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:56.009
 acrobatics that I do and to follow 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:58.740
 really fighting I must have a plan 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.599

 we send you a hug the wish of prompt 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.789
 recovery to come does not cost anything 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.149
 but also a greeting from here 

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:13.429
