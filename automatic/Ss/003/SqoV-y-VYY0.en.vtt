00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.360 
can but I'm just saying that's mostly to
shadow<00:03:01.480> sonic<00:03:02.019> rather<00:03:02.200> just<00:03:02.379> run<00:03:02.590> there<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
shadow sonic rather just run there and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.729 
shadow sonic rather just run there and
silver<00:03:07.030> as<00:03:07.150> his<00:03:07.269> own<00:03:07.450> psychic<00:03:07.930> powers<00:03:08.319> anyway

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
silver as his own psychic powers anyway

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.630 
silver as his own psychic powers anyway
