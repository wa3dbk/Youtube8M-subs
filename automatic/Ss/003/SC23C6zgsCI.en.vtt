things quite poetic things our pieces is

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.350 
things quite poetic things our pieces is
that<00:00:38.040> not<00:00:38.940> try<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:43.110> make<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> lot<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.559> noise

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
that not try to to make a lot of noise

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.470

smaller<00:00:49.320> things<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.030> interesting

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
smaller things and this is interesting

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.750 
smaller things and this is interesting
because<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.320> kind<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:54.350> parallel<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
because it's kind of parallel to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.599 
because it's kind of parallel to
biannual<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.969> Vinny's<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:58.170> write<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
biannual in Vinny's they write it the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.860 
biannual in Vinny's they write it the
same<00:00:59.820> about<00:01:00.000> them<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.770> seems<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:03.329> seems<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
same about them so it seems it seems to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.160 
same about them so it seems it seems to
show<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> kind<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:05.510> time<00:01:06.510> specific<00:01:08.360> take<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
show a kind of time specific take in the

multi media in the studies and in the
show<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.860> well

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.770 

it's<00:01:45.840> an<00:01:45.990> installation<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.539> this<00:01:48.539> is<00:01:48.659> not

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it's an installation because this is not

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.740 
it's an installation because this is not
a<00:01:48.840> love<00:01:49.079> song<00:01:49.109> and<00:01:50.479> it's<00:01:51.479> about<00:01:52.130> memory<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
a love song and it's about memory and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.559 
a love song and it's about memory and
disremember<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.319> how<00:01:56.310> actually<00:01:57.119> how<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
disremember and how actually how to

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.510 
disremember and how actually how to
conserve<00:01:58.439> memory<00:01:59.159> and<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:02.340> whole

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
conserve memory and the whole

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.349 
conserve memory and the whole
installation<00:02:02.880> contains<00:02:04.189> 75<00:02:05.189> pieces<00:02:05.520> in

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
installation contains 75 pieces in

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.830 
installation contains 75 pieces in
different<00:02:07.259> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.530> material<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.840> like

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
different kind of material you have like

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.690 
different kind of material you have like
glass<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.099> me<00:02:11.640> rose<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:13.019> clay

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
glass you have me rose and you have clay

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.670 
glass you have me rose and you have clay
so<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.000> most<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.569> pieces<00:02:15.900> are<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.410> clay

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so the most of the pieces are in clay

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.470 
so the most of the pieces are in clay
it's<00:02:17.489> typical<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.120> work<00:02:18.450> with

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
it's typical that I work with

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.809 
it's typical that I work with
found-footage<00:02:19.040> material<00:02:20.040> that's<00:02:20.610> typical

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
found-footage material that's typical

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.770 
found-footage material that's typical
but<00:02:22.190> actually<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> kind<00:02:24.299> you<00:02:24.450> see<00:02:24.660> it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
but actually that the kind you see it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.650 
but actually that the kind you see it
here<00:02:25.079> it's<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.910> curiosity<00:02:26.910> cabinet

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
here it's like this curiosity cabinet

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:44.190 
here it's like this curiosity cabinet
it's<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.530> first<00:02:28.769> time

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.110 

so<00:02:45.200> when<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.709> title<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.069> my<00:02:46.220> work<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.580> salmon

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
so when the title of my work is salmon

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.479 
so when the title of my work is salmon

Alaska subtitle if there was a happy
that<00:02:49.640> would<00:02:49.790> be<00:02:49.970> mine<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.640> installation

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
that would be mine it is a installation

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.509 
that would be mine it is a installation
a<00:02:52.760> group<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.180> fragments<00:02:53.950> different<00:02:54.950> shaped

people brought to me I connected them to

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.400 
people brought to me I connected them to
to<00:03:30.560> create<00:03:30.859> some<00:03:31.190> kind<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.549> a<00:03:32.140> feeling<00:03:33.140> that<00:03:33.290> it

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
to create some kind of a feeling that it

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.589 
to create some kind of a feeling that it
was<00:03:33.590> meant<00:03:33.829> to<00:03:34.099> be<00:03:34.129> together<00:03:34.599> different

the<00:05:46.470> human<00:05:46.770> face<00:05:47.040> is<00:05:47.550> for<00:05:47.970> me<00:05:48.120> like<00:05:48.600> a

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
the human face is for me like a

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:55.879 
the human face is for me like a
quintessential<00:05:49.650> of<00:05:51.500> being<00:05:52.500> human<00:05:52.800> or<00:05:54.889> let's

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
say better say being identified as you

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:07.370

mean<00:06:00.810> in<00:06:01.380> terms<00:06:02.370> of<00:06:02.729> visual<00:06:03.449> appearance<00:06:06.380> what

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
mean in terms of visual appearance what

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.100
