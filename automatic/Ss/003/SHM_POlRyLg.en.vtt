00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
find your balance point and probably you

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.499 
find your balance point and probably you
probably<00:01:37.340> won't<00:01:37.729> get<00:01:37.880> on<00:01:38.000> your<00:01:38.150> first<00:01:38.360> try

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
like you might get it like a little far

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.480 
like you might get it like a little far
not<00:01:40.340> too<00:01:40.460> far<00:01:40.729> but<00:01:41.540> on<00:01:41.950> what<00:01:42.950> I'd<00:01:43.070> like<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.369> do
