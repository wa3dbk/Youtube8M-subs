 extra virgin olive oil salt and black pepper 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.220
 enough to prepare first 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.350
 the cheese cream we put in a 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.350
 pan the cream 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:16.310
 along with the two cheeses and a pinch of 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.310
 black pepper 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.869
 let's mix and let go on the fire 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:28.819
 until the cheeses and cream do not 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.819
 they will be mixed and dissolved 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:41.020
 let's move on to preparing risotto 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:45.100
 in a pan we put a little oil and 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.610
 the red onion cut into cubes and the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.610
 let's brown 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.500
 we add the rice and we do it 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.500
 toast in the oil 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 for a few minutes 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:19.920
 after a few minutes of roasting 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:22.739
 add the wine and keep on the fire 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.489
 stirring until the rice has it 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.489
 completely absorbed 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.250
 a nice wine you will be completely 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.590
 dried we can start 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:47.380
 add one ladle at a time the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:47.380
 vegetable broth and we continue to mix 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.600
 expect the broth to dry and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.880
 let's proceed by adding one more 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.450
 ladle at a time until complete 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.390
 cooking 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.610
 it usually takes about 20 minutes 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.020
 at this stage when you add the 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.450
 broth a little at a time 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.730
 of course adjusted with salt or 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.610
 alternatively you can prepare a 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.040
 already salted vegetable broth so that the 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.470
 salt will already be inside the broth in 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.500
 in any case you should try the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.570
 preparation during cooking for 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.570
 see if it's salty enough 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.900
 five minutes before ending the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:43.440
 cooking we add the cream of cheeses 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:49.920
 and mix well then finally add 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:53.010
 a small piece of butter and a bit of 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.340
 chopped parsley and we make an ante 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.340
 dear 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.129
 after a few minutes of creaming the 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.060
 our risotto will be creamy and ready to 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.769
 enjoy 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.299
 so all I can do is wish you good 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.349
