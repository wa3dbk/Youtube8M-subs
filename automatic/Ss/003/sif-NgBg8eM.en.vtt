00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.430
 hello everyone with you lab test 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.150
 audi subject of this video review 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.850
 is a serial drink 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.620
 rest 350 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.870
 which is assembled based on components from 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.800
 ppm brief technical specifications 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.560
 models are the quad core processor 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.510
 MDF of 4350 clock speed 4 2 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.279
 gigahertz and what's interesting with 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.960
 unlocked multiplier thanks 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.379
 what the processor has good potential 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:40.290
 for overclocking motherboard jesus m5 and 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:45.129
 97 its r20 with a set of logic md 970 + sd 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.379
 950 amd radeon r9 270 with two 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.870
 gddr5 gigabytes 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.330
 RAM two modules shared 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.000
 8 gigabyte ddr3 with clock 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.790
 with a frequency of 1600 megahertz that work 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.890
 dual channel hard drive 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.650
 1 terabyte drive with speed 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.920
 plate rotation 7200 rpm 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.370
 and 32 megabytes im buffer operating 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.909
 system windows 8 1 single language 64 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.710
 a bit all the stuffing is placed at all 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.560
 cumbersome from its form factor but 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.950
 spacious aerocool ds 92 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.570
 black edition 600 watt power supply 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.789
 there are 7 slots in the back 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.189
 expansion with a convenient door lock 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.710
 front 9 universal compartments for 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.119
 optical drive installation 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.189
 drive ford factor three and a half 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.070
 and two and a half inches or fans 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.899
 using special trays 1 12 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.490
 centimeter fan by default 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.009
 installed on the back of the system 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.229
 unit near the processor and cooling 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.729
 its cooler is another one you can 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.450
 fasten to the bottom of the case 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.460
 two more upstairs and up to six 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.380
 can be installed in pairs in front 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.539
 part by donating part of the compartments for 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.400
 drives but get unprecedented 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.410
 system cooling rate 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.840
 video installed in the system unit 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.820
 the card has a cooling system of two 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.830
 steam attributed millimeter fans and 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.960
 aluminum radiators which are connected 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.060
 between each other heat and pipes 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.980
 because of the massive cooling system 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.510
 video card takes two slots at once 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.910
 rear panel extensions 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.700
 but it has two ways of you and 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.950
 one by one video outputs hdmi and displayport 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.080
 thanks to proprietary amd technology 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.670
 eyefinity video card can connect 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.050
 up to six monitors any 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.610
 configurations when using 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.590
 video splitter 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.959
 we want to check how the filling 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.700
 Recreation 256 will feel when 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.930
 using 3 brain test monitors 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.150
 simultaneously in the game world of tanks and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.980
 I must say it feels good on high 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.990
 graphics settings the number of frames in 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.670
 second keeps on quite playable 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.480
 level with total resolution 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.060
 Pictures is 5760 by 1000 one 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.160
 pixel viewing angle 120 degrees 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.020
 keep track of everything going on right away 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.660
 three screens with the habit is not easy but 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.290
 interesting sensations such a configuration 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.540
 definitely adds 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.220
 with one monitor connected you can not 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.110
 feel free to set the settings to 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.620
 maximum bunch of powerful processor 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.750
 amd fx and md radeon r9 video cards are not 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.709
 disappoint well and finally let's 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.500
 will test 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.030
 rest 356 in a variety of test 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.010
 synthetic test packs 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.709
 system performance site binge 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.110
 r11 5 put the processor three integers 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.430
 fifty nine hundredth points 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.920
 single-threaded processor for the superpi test 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.080
 32m completed in twenty two minutes 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.420
 forty five point one hundred three thousandth 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.530
 seconds test built into the archiver 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.230
 winrar 52 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.300
 but its results are a graphical test 3d 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.110
 March 2011 performance mode 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.260
 gave the result 6380 4 points in the mode 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.660
 extreme result was 2180 points 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.850
 These are the results of all tests of the newest 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.330
 3d mark system proved to be very 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.560
 worthy synthetic test aida 64 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.560
 here is the table with its results 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.480
 what is the impression of pkl wild 356 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.579
 purely positive sistemnik good as 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.170
 as a center for home entertainment and 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.819
 as a gaming computer 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.920
 permissible base filling 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.629
 technology ppm but u cracking down 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.939
 slip and media tasks 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.959
 so with heaped three-dimensional graphics 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.959
 goodbye
