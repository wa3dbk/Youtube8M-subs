you guys to be more empowered to do this
with<00:00:51.059> me<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.390> month<00:00:51.600> too<00:00:51.930> um<00:00:52.199> there's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
with me this month too um there's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.010 
with me this month too um there's
nothing<00:00:53.280> really<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.520> derived<00:00:54.390> from<00:00:54.780> me

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
nothing really that derived from me

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.170 
nothing really that derived from me
wanting<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.760> thought

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
wanting to do this but I just thought

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080 
wanting to do this but I just thought
it'd<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:58.559> better<00:00:59.160> thing<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.730> because<00:00:59.910> I

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
it'd be a better thing to do because I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.939 
it'd be a better thing to do because I
always<00:01:00.510> focus<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.199> buying<00:01:01.590> stuff

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
always focus on you know buying stuff

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
always focus on you know buying stuff
each<00:01:02.160> month<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.850> feel<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.780> kind<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
each month and I feel like it's kind of

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.479 
each month and I feel like it's kind of
like<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.500> thing<00:01:04.830> over<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.129> over<00:01:05.309> again

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
like the same thing over and over again

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
like the same thing over and over again
so<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:05.939> wanted<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> take<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> break<00:01:06.570> in

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
so I just wanted to take a break in

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
so I just wanted to take a break in
between<00:01:07.049> here<00:01:07.650> kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> Christmas

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
between here kind of like a Christmas

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
between here kind of like a Christmas
break<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:09.869> Christmas<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070
