chemistry<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.590> being<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.799> bit<00:03:15.950> more<00:03:16.160> when<00:03:16.370> the

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
chemistry to being a bit more when the

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.250 
chemistry to being a bit more when the
legends<00:03:16.760> come<00:03:16.910> out<00:03:17.030> because<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:18.019> gonna<00:03:18.170> be

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
so hard to put legend in a hybrid in my

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.809 
so hard to put legend in a hybrid in my
opinion<00:03:20.660> at<00:03:20.870> least<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.230> then<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.579> next<00:03:22.609> thing
