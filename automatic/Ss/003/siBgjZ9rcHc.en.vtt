00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.920
 This jet washer works well on the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.930
 Example mine center for 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.719
 other cities in the region 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.509
 they have a washing process 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.920
 helps to save water. 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.170
 contributing mainly to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.539
 minimize the problems of this period of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.880
 drought that punishes much of the country 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.519
 in this lack of water and we have a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.220
 process of re-appropriation of the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.740
 process, this process is not 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 It 's something inside the boxes. 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.420
 We have a rate that right harvesting 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.930
 amount of water that today gives 5 thousand 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.260
 liters of water that water is treated and right 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.930
 it is bad is reused again right that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.149
 We take the word again 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 to do the service in the car already exists 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.530
 the collection box which is compulsory where 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.110
 pass these collecting boxes to this water 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.390
 filters inside we already have a 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.969
 process of a box of five thousand book 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.030
 the water that happens to water is treated is 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.700
 made a ph of water, as if it were 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.850
 treated the water of a pool 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.070
 are simple design right you get there 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.680
 I reproached this water by passing it to 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.990
 other box where we pick it fall 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.299
 on top of that, that's how we 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.390
 already start washing the cars again 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.960
 She goes down and goes up on the turn. 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.540
 the water 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.729
 according to paulinho usually the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.040
 used approximately 60 thousand 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.869
 liters of water per month to wash in 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.600
 average 10 cars per day 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.380
 the economy today 80% the economy today is 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.619
 very big right because with 10 thousand liters 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.869
 water that would be a minimum rate to right 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.750
 a residence we have the ability to 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.210
 wash 300 cars and we take 300 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.130
 cars and who is watching us too 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.710
 that you can do 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 is the chaos that the population 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.729
 It's because of water, right? 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.909
 We do not know when this situation is 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.880
 back to normal then is the benefit 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.820
 We do not understand economics and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.130
 also for society is an action and that 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.640
 all are benefited 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.560
 it is a process of awareness when you 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.980
 part with such a process of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.800
 everyone is benefited by 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.260
 28 years of profession 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.930
 front of the jet was a year and nine 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.569
 months in the process of re-use if 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.430
 proud of the work done for him 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.530
 process should be used by 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.790
 other washes and other companies 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.250
 of mine 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.099
 is a project that many could have 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.349
 using to be able to contribute 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.650
 Do you see this lack of water you have today? 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:47.190
 it is through this that there is neither 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.900
 So, you have a firm today that says 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.799
 service because we have 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.799
 this process
