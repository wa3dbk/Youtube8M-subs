 Boone 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.810
 This Well then I ideal 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:15.450
 In this time 's hand in hand is taught by a follower the other day and it's used it 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:20.720
 Devised at the time to remember I would like choreography to quite before the Tteyuu the introduction of the app 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:26.359
 If you say that you are doing something in the video by hand 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.239
 With pro mode video it is slow down the playback speed with the video editing software for the camera 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.509
 I 'm talking about remembering being judged and remembering 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.290
 In the app it says this figure 5 take a bottle 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.460
 I do not know how to intonation 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.830
 Well it's easy to do so it's kinda handy to check on a little android 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.600
 You may only iphone Maybe because it is not 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.460
 When I actually use it, for example, I'm back now and I'm using the road of this time, but this is 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.329
 As a pro 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.660
 First you can step forward 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.090
 8 By launching the app and loading videos taken with a mobile phone 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.280
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.789
 Frame feed 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.789
 And you can see every single move 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.630
 After also to be in something like normal course play 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.870
 I think that this number will change if you move it up and down here 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:25.900
 In such feeling from 0.1 times in slow 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:29.420
 It is also possible to play I'd might not Matsukawa when you remember mer choreography 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.700
 Move faster than anything 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 I can do it 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:42.210
 After that there is a side-to-side flip here but this is also with one touch 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:46.600
 It looks like a mirror and looks like this is really bad spots and people don't have to do it 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:52.170
 I think you are but people easy to remember is more of here is to slowly and to the inverting 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:57.299
 Remember Toka to suit your or rather prefer to do easy speed and direction 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.979
 You can remember just because it's free It's probably because the ad is coming in 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.720
 There is also a paid version 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:07.600
 I think I can use it for free 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.770
 I love you like this and it's free and I think it can be used to check other sports and other forms 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.430
 Because it is recommended 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.620
 It has gotten a lot of cases has been doing commentary in the One to make the discussion songs to the extent 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.400
 In the little state that does not keep up easily 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.269

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:24.549
