00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.709
So now we have seen samba side by side the
step slide, and also the samba step forward

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.530
with the slide back.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.930
We are going to add a variation, another step
into the samba pagode routine, and that's

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.570
a single leg hip accent.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.160
Usually we're going to turn just a twist more
diagonal, and we are going to do it to that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.180
side first.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:35.040
You're going to step forward with the front
foot, hip accent, and bring all the way back.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.670
So, it's pretty much just like the step forward
slide back footwork, but however, we're doing

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.210
that into a small diagonal and we are going
to repeat the same leg a few times.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.850
So step forward, freeze for the weight, hip
accent, and then slide back.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.100
Step, hip accent, and slide back.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.640
Step, hip accent, and slide back.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.580
Faster, it's going to look basically, almost
like if you're not transferring the weight

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.460
completely forward, but you are.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.569
So, it's hip, accent.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.969
Let's do it to music.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:20.179
Four, three, two, and step, and step, and
step, and step.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.719
So, it's a small step, short step.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.759
You want to stay on the balls of your foot
on your supporting leg.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.240
And hip, step, step, step, step, and step.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.299
Do the other side.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:42.009
And four, three, two, prepare, and step, step,
step, step, step, step, step.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.340
Switch sides again.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:54.439
Four, three, two, and step, step, step, step,
four, three, two, switch sides.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.439
Step, step, step, step, four, three, two,
and one.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.829
That's your single leg hip accent step.
