translational modification or PTM where
we<00:00:25.410> take<00:00:25.529> chemical<00:00:25.980> analogs<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.580> those

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
we take chemical analogs of those

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.240 
we take chemical analogs of those
modifications<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.720> feed<00:00:27.900> them<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.109> cells<00:00:28.439> we

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
modifications and feed them to cells we

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.919 
modifications and feed them to cells we
can<00:00:29.400> use<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> also<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.910> tissues<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.570> even<00:00:30.810> in

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
can use it also on tissues or even in

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.260 
can use it also on tissues or even in
whole<00:00:31.259> organisms<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.669> idea<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
whole organisms and the idea is that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.580 
whole organisms and the idea is that
then<00:00:33.420> those<00:00:33.570> analogs<00:00:33.960> are<00:00:34.079> transferred<00:00:34.559> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
then those analogs are transferred to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.049 
then those analogs are transferred to
their<00:00:34.829> target<00:00:35.160> proteins<00:00:35.550> by<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.820> same

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
their target proteins by the same

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.690 
their target proteins by the same
transposes<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.989> would<00:00:37.079> transfer<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
transposes that would transfer the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700 
transposes that would transfer the
native<00:00:38.700> modification<00:00:39.420> alternatively<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.590> can

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
native modification alternatively we can

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.439 
native modification alternatively we can
use<00:00:40.770> enzyme<00:00:41.340> probes<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> flip<00:00:42.210> side<00:00:42.239> of

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
use enzyme probes on the flip side of

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.840 
use enzyme probes on the flip side of
this<00:00:42.690> technology<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.129> enzyme<00:00:44.550> folks

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
this technology we can use enzyme folks

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.849 
this technology we can use enzyme folks
that<00:00:45.059> will<00:00:45.120> ligate<00:00:45.510> directly<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> active

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
that will ligate directly to the active

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.740 
that will ligate directly to the active
site<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.070> an<00:00:47.280> enzyme<00:00:47.340> irreversibly<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.329> also

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
site of an enzyme irreversibly and also

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.479 
site of an enzyme irreversibly and also
introduce<00:00:49.109> tags<00:00:49.410> into<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> target<00:00:50.129> proteins

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
introduce tags into the target proteins

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
introduce tags into the target proteins
and<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.270> these<00:00:51.420> tags<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.809> place<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.320> do

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and with these tags in place we can do

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
and with these tags in place we can do
what<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.739> call<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> chemo<00:00:53.280> selective<00:00:53.699> ligation

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
what we call a chemo selective ligation

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.240 
what we call a chemo selective ligation
reaction<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> reaction<00:00:55.890> that's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
reaction so this is a reaction that's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.590 
reaction so this is a reaction that's
unaffected<00:00:56.670> by<00:00:57.149> all<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> other

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
unaffected by all of the other

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.479 
unaffected by all of the other
components<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> cell<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> react

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
components of the cell and react

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.860 
components of the cell and react
specifically<00:01:00.059> only<00:01:00.179> with<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> tag<00:01:00.660> that's

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
specifically only with the tag that's

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.060 
specifically only with the tag that's
been<00:01:00.989> introduced<00:01:01.379> either<00:01:01.679> through

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
been introduced either through

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.889 
been introduced either through
modification<00:01:02.670> by<00:01:02.850> transferase<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:03.420> through

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
modification by transferase or through

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.150 
modification by transferase or through
ligation<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.470> active<00:01:04.739> site<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.890> an<00:01:05.100> enzyme

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
ligation at the active site of an enzyme

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.010 
ligation at the active site of an enzyme
and<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> gives<00:01:06.119> us<00:01:06.240> access<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.840> large

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and that gives us access to a large

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.510 
and that gives us access to a large
number<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.320> handles<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.920> otherwise<00:01:08.310> would

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
advanced approach to this problem we've

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.310 
advanced approach to this problem we've
worked<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.270> little<00:03:03.510> bit<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.930> protein

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
worked a little bit on this protein

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.110 
worked a little bit on this protein
called<00:03:04.470> sonic<00:03:04.770> hedgehog<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> very

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
also in cell proliferation and it tends

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.090

ask using cholesterol as a substrate so

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.009 
ask using cholesterol as a substrate so
it's<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.670> type<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:44.850> protease<00:03:45.299> but<00:03:45.660> instead<00:03:45.900> of

it's a type of protease but instead of

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.509 
it's a type of protease but instead of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
ester bond at the c-terminus so this

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.819

type of modification is essentially

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.229 
type of modification is essentially
unique<00:03:53.100> across<00:03:53.340> nature<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.880> need<00:03:54.000> the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
unique across nature you need the

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.310 
unique across nature you need the
Hedgehog<00:03:54.570> protein<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.019> so<00:03:55.110> we<00:03:55.230> were

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
Hedgehog protein and so we were

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.110 
Hedgehog protein and so we were
interested<00:03:55.590> in<00:03:55.860> having<00:03:56.010> tools<00:03:56.370> available<00:03:56.670> to

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
interested in having tools available to

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.789 
interested in having tools available to
study<00:03:57.329> these<00:03:57.480> modifications<00:03:57.810> in<00:03:58.350> more<00:03:58.500> detail

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
study these modifications in more detail

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.140 
study these modifications in more detail
so<00:03:59.160> what<00:03:59.310> can<00:03:59.400> we<00:03:59.459> do<00:03:59.640> with<00:03:59.820> chemical

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
so what can we do with chemical

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.910 
so what can we do with chemical
proteomics<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.840> sonic<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.260> chav<00:04:01.470> where<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:01.739> can

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
proteomics is sonic a chav where we can

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.100 
proteomics is sonic a chav where we can
tag<00:04:02.549> both<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.269> cholesterol<00:04:03.660> ation<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.019> the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
tag both the cholesterol ation and the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.289 
tag both the cholesterol ation and the
polymerization<00:04:04.380> but<00:04:04.890> using<00:04:05.250> tags<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:06.090> have

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
polymerization but using tags that have

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.729 
polymerization but using tags that have
different<00:04:06.660> chemistries<00:04:07.079> so<00:04:07.350> we<00:04:07.440> can<00:04:07.560> look<00:04:07.650> at

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
different chemistries so we can look at

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.830 
different chemistries so we can look at
both<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:07.980> them<00:04:08.310> individually<00:04:08.579> or<00:04:08.880> together<00:04:09.510> in
