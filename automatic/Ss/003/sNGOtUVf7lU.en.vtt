00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.120
 hello I'm joan pujol hockey player 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.700
 grass of division junior really 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.980
 I will explain how to make a flick in the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.320
 hockey is very important to know that in 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.779
 this technical gesture the stick is caught with 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.250
 the hands separated and from here 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:27.310
 the position of the ball will be with two 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.430
 steps is to say the first step will be 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.529
 put the ball on the left foot 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.040
 front and the left foot with a 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.540
 very important flexion of the legs and 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.809
 from here with the stick shovel 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.970
 catch it from behind the ball is to say me 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.549
 I come to the ball from behind and with the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.640
 shovel and a flex and flat legs 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:55.600
 but also of upper trunk lame by 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.449
 down and with the arms I accompany the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.659
 ball with a regular lying towards 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.839
 up ending with a pass towards 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.710
 forward with my right foot I return it to 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.830
 do very slowly 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.580
 calculate a distance with your foot 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.409
 left to choose flexion and with the 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.009
 arms 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.039
 I finish the movement with a pass towards 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.140
 forward also the shoulders mark the 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.270
 direction of the ball if I want 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.270
 pass the ball there my shoulders have 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.020
 to be in the direction towards there with 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.020
 This line 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.000
 it is important to highlight in the flick that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.340
 the position of the arms during the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.020
 movement does not have to be flexed with 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.600
 the elbow is to say this is wrong 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.049
 it is important to keep the arms 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.820
 rigid to accompany and do the 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.510
 upward movement 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.510
 already 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.710
 and here the video I hope that I have 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.860
 liked and I encourage you to practice hockey 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.860
 grass
