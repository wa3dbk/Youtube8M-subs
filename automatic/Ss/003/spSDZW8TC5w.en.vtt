00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.199
 Riemers back to the future 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.890
 So I gave back to the future 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.869
 Christopher Lloyd as it as a doc brown 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.359
 incredibly horny funny and michael j 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.429

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.810
 precursor of you shit and me 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.759
 he already had it for him then 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.230
 Video cassette times that are devoured 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.940

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.379

 could like the quality of the video 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.870
 Cassettes got worse and worse 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.440
 this correction sign above in the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.200
 newspaper 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.910
 I thought so if you someday 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.100
 can look again and then came 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.250

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.109

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.180
 ray and damn it 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.700
 I do not know what movie I am 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.200
 hottest finds the first part is 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.299
 of course as an opening and yes here 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.939
 Time travel and that's the curse 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.100
 Commentator of the time travel only possible 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.460
 and honest times so many 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.720
 no sayings and so many cool things 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.159
 you probably realize I am 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.710
 fire and flame for the film and me 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.200
 Just love these movies 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.479
 timeless yes they are of course 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.960
 80s but that's kind of cool too 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:39.090
 if then what then so and what for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.670
 the future is from 1985 onwards 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.560
 produced movie leaves 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.740
 then he tears the past in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.420
 first part and in the second part it is 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.710
 yes then the future or I'm straight 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.720
 think maybe you know it ja 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.119
 I know it, too, maybe you know 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.000
 that's why I'm so in right now 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.080
 which year in which year plays in 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.850
 the second part of the 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.220
 actually in the future maybe it is 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.180
 yes so maybe comments 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.560
 maybe but I know it to date 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.320
 in any case, the films are all cool the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.410
 third wild west also super cool 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.390
 Of course I do not know if he will charm you 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.340
 lost in the third part but he 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.400
 is just one of them and I think so 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.170
 these western teeth are extremely cool this 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.850
 with ok of success past like 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.930
 Let's get out of this shit now 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.120
 past out 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.950
 that is then so that's the question 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.400
 which one poses because there is not 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.410
 so much 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.900
 technically possible and thus the train and 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.750
 So you 're so horny so you should 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.700
 Do not know these movies and post them 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.690
 pick it up after the movies are worth it 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.820
 as far as I'm concerned 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.260
 So it is film history, it is yes 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.390
 film history robert zemeckis he 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.830
 about it still cashed and who made 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.660
 relationship history about roberts and 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.959
 while he made the movie castaway 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.550
 has tom hanks he still has a 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.570
 horror strip with harrison ford boss 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.220
 continues to produce in the shade 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.800
 expandable others come back again 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.390
 back to the Future 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.280
 whether it is now a girl's movie is yes 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.440
 I know many things like fishing 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.660
 yes , that's really it in that case 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.810
 it is almost 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.820
 family entertainment 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.530
 it is so it is so seven Spielberg 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.900
 as a producer that is also noticeable and is 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.709
 no song he war reached reach 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.760
 idea with 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.040
 I mean that alan silvestri martinshof 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.840
 be kid so gailer soundtrack i have 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.340
 after that he does not think so anymore 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.980
 a sucker to get a soundtrack 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.810
 made for trailers but that is 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.950
 that's just that's easy 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.930
 I want the German comedy prize 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.570
 think so too and I mean that 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.820
 his good reason with me away look the 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.739
 movie with the whole family would be 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.260
 dude with a friend dsds is the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.090
 just cool the universal fit you 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.250
 you can even show in the nursing home and 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.140
 they will say oh what do you do then 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.290
 that's a nice mistake 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.550
 yes even if they may sometimes 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.740
 a bit louder advantages 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.900
 really great really great movie what 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.580
 I can eat to it 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.070
 yes it is that is still a thing 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.840
 So my husband of the pizza film alone 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.310
 because of this objection in the second part 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.610

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.210
 pc migrated in the second part i have me 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.350
 really laughed so tired because 

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.910
 Michael Fox plays on his own 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.070
 sister as playing himself and old 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.720
 and so and then we want it 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.380
 this as much as a sister 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.260
 you can always watch it is easy 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.320
 So horny share all worthwhile 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.670
 parts have their highlights and yes ob 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.320
 it continues now that I have here 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.090
 three parts are discussed three parts 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.890
 are part of a past part 2 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.650
 future part 3 wild west 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.970
 So I think a fourth part is coming 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.140
 Unfortunately I would not be me though 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.300
 I would be my hole in the belly 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.130
 honestly look forward when doc brown and 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.510
 i would come back marty mcfly 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.620
 could even picture it well but me 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.740
 I have not heard any rumors yet 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.660
 It is an often head in any case so 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.920
 You can do that every few months 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.140
 really get into it 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.850
 So you can also talk about this here 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.070
 Three parts are always beautiful 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.330
 beginning of the beautiful evening shape 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.010

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.690
