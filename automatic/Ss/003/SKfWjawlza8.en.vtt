all hundred people in or you're going to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.120 
all hundred people in or you're going to
stagger<00:03:16.880> them<00:03:17.090> out<00:03:17.240> maybe<00:03:17.540> 20<00:03:18.050> at<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.200> time<00:03:18.290> yeah

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
stagger them out maybe 20 at a time yeah

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.680 
stagger them out maybe 20 at a time yeah
we're<00:03:19.250> going<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.459> probably<00:03:19.760> stagger<00:03:20.270> roughly

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
we're going to probably stagger roughly

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.100 
we're going to probably stagger roughly
about<00:03:20.780> 25<00:03:21.380> people<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:22.370> come<00:03:22.550> through<00:03:23.110> then

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
about 25 people to come through then

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.850 
about 25 people to come through then
once<00:03:24.320> they<00:03:24.560> filter<00:03:25.040> out<00:03:25.070> then<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.150> will<00:03:26.300> let<00:03:26.510> in

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
once they filter out then we will let in

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.199 
once they filter out then we will let in
people<00:03:27.860> as<00:03:28.190> they<00:03:28.340> come<00:03:28.520> in<00:03:28.670> will<00:03:28.850> come<00:03:29.060> out

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
we'll probably keep it around that level

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.710 
we'll probably keep it around that level
