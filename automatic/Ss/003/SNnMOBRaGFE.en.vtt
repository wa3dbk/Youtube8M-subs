outwards<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:14.170> we'll<00:02:15.099> attach<00:02:15.459> one<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.269> fly

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
outwards and we'll attach one of the fly

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:25.540 
outwards and we'll attach one of the fly
bar<00:02:17.519> control<00:02:18.519> rods

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:54.070 

will<00:02:26.060> do<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.330> same<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.220> other<00:02:28.280> side

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.740 

so<00:02:55.080> we've<00:02:55.380> got<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.770> two<00:02:55.980> fiber<00:02:56.550> control<00:02:57.150> our

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
so we've got the two fiber control our

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.690 
so we've got the two fiber control our
rods<00:02:58.230> on<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.680> one<00:02:58.890> side<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.310> fly<00:02:59.490> bar

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
rods on to one side of the fly bar

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.430 
rods on to one side of the fly bar
control<00:03:00.060> rod<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:02.550> fly<00:03:02.730> bar<00:03:02.970> through<00:03:03.240> it<00:03:03.440> and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
control rod the fly bar through it and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.200 
control rod the fly bar through it and
then<00:03:05.220> through<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.870> head<00:03:07.050> like<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.120> we've

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
then through the head like so so we've

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.910 
then through the head like so so we've
got<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.450> together<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.900> we<00:03:09.990> need<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.440> put<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
got this together and we need to put the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.460 
got this together and we need to put the
second<00:03:11.340> half<00:03:11.520> on<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.660> sort<00:03:12.990> of<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.110> fly<00:03:13.260> bar

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
second half on this sort of the fly bar

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.770 
second half on this sort of the fly bar
control<00:03:13.860> arm<00:03:14.040> before<00:03:14.460> we<00:03:14.760> do<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:14.910> we<00:03:15.270> need<00:03:15.600> to

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
control arm before we do that we need to

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.040 
control arm before we do that we need to
put<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.830> control<00:03:17.520> arms<00:03:17.880> on<00:03:18.030> they<00:03:18.690> don't<00:03:18.900> need

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
put the control arms on they don't need

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.290 
put the control arms on they don't need
to<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.370> snapped<00:03:20.370> into<00:03:20.550> place<00:03:20.640> yet<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:21.240> they

to be snapped into place yet but they

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.740 
to be snapped into place yet but they
have<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.480> be<00:03:21.720> there<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.230> we<00:03:22.530> can<00:03:22.970> put<00:03:23.970> snap

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
have to be there so that we can put snap

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.830 
have to be there so that we can put snap
them<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.080> when<00:03:25.230> we're<00:03:25.440> ready<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.130> go<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.780> we'll

I'm<00:04:28.480> not<00:04:28.630> going<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:29.020> lock<00:04:29.680> take<00:04:29.980> these<00:04:30.160> in

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
I'm not going to lock take these in

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.220 
I'm not going to lock take these in
right<00:04:30.490> now<00:04:30.640> because<00:04:31.030> we're<00:04:31.540> going<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.810> have<00:04:32.050> to

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
right now because we're going to have to

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.160 
right now because we're going to have to
measure<00:04:32.410> them<00:04:32.740> later<00:04:33.730> on<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:34.660> make<00:04:34.810> sure<00:04:34.960> that

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
measure them later on to make sure that

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.830 
measure them later on to make sure that
the<00:04:35.670> fly<00:04:36.670> bar<00:04:36.880> perfectly<00:04:37.300> centered<00:04:37.540> you<00:04:37.720> can

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
the fly bar perfectly centered you can

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.640 
the fly bar perfectly centered you can
do<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:38.050> now<00:04:38.230> if<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:38.440> wanted<00:04:40.410> but<00:04:41.410> I'm<00:04:41.530> going

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.440 
do that now if you wanted but I'm going
to<00:04:41.710> wait<00:04:41.830> till<00:04:42.010> once<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.310> put<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:43.090> fly<00:04:43.270> our

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
to wait till once I put the the fly our

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.050 
to wait till once I put the the fly our
paddles<00:04:43.810> on<00:04:46.170> then<00:04:47.170> we<00:04:47.260> have<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:48.060> completed

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
paddles on then we have the completed

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.090 
paddles on then we have the completed
fly<00:04:49.570> bar<00:04:49.840> assembly<00:04:50.380> with<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.650> arms<00:04:50.890> all

together<00:04:52.680> next<00:04:53.680> thing<00:04:53.800> we're<00:04:53.950> going<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.220> do<00:04:54.400> is

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
together next thing we're going to do is

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.120 
together next thing we're going to do is
put<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.180> fly<00:04:56.020> bar<00:04:56.200> paddles<00:04:56.620> on<00:04:56.770> there<00:04:56.980> now

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
put the fly bar paddles on there now

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.280 
put the fly bar paddles on there now
these<00:04:57.250> screw<00:04:57.490> into<00:04:57.610> place<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.150> then<00:04:59.140> they're

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
these screw into place and then they're

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.490 
these screw into place and then they're
held<00:04:59.500> in<00:04:59.680> with<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.130> grub<00:05:00.730> screw<00:05:00.970> as<00:05:01.090> well<00:05:01.500> the

held in with a grub screw as well the

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.520 
held in with a grub screw as well the
measurement<00:05:03.040> is<00:05:03.210> given<00:05:04.210> for<00:05:04.480> between<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.200> fly

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
measurement is given for between the fly

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.790 
measurement is given for between the fly
bar<00:05:05.830> control<00:05:06.820> arm<00:05:07.000> and<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:08.170> paddle<00:05:08.470> here<00:05:08.650> is

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.620 
bar control arm and the paddle here is
18<00:05:09.130> millimeters<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:10.090> we'll<00:05:10.210> measure<00:05:10.360> that

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
18 millimeters so we'll measure that

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.520 
18 millimeters so we'll measure that
once<00:05:11.110> we<00:05:11.260> get<00:05:11.770> closer<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.220> being<00:05:12.400> finished<00:05:13.530> to

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
once we get closer to being finished to

once we get closer to being finished to
did<00:05:14.950> that<00:05:15.130> will<00:05:15.220> give<00:05:15.370> us<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.670> nice<00:05:16.030> thick

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
did that will give us a nice thick

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.870 
did that will give us a nice thick
