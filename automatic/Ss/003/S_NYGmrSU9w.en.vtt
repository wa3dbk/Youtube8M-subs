00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello good morning let's start the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.620
 Stretching exercises for 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.830
 bicycle as a first step you have to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.830
 warm the lower limbs well 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.360
 we started making slow movements 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.160
 slow movements of the feet 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.030
 and we're going to stand at the side for 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.030
 that is better seen 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.250
 the knees 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.920
 at the time we are doing stretches 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.920
 they do muscle activation 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.660
 in this we can delay approximately 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.650
 one minute and we are changing 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.840
 in second measure we stretch slowly 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.620
 the authors that are muscles that are going 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.640
 to use 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.660
 on the bicycle 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.620
 all the time 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.630
 let's go straight down and let's go 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.120
 expanding the base of support and 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:05.080
 we go down and down space space 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.050
 activating slow without stretching too much 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.150
 exactly and we continue 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.670
 now we are going to be specifically a 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.970
 Stretching the adductors 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.460
 we get the opposite knees and 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.330
 we stretch the author in this case the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.200
 left now to both sides 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.200
 we bend the left knee 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.550
 we stretch the right adductor slowly 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.630
 we can take 10 minutes 10 seconds 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.860
 minimum forgiveness 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.460
 let's go down 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.780
 and we do the stretch set of 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.020
 both of them 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.000
 a stretch of both 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.000
 and we direct our feet out 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.490
 slow 10 seconds approximately I'm 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.490
 picking up we go up 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.600
 supported with a partner leaning on 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.860
 Wall 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.610
 we stretch the picture slowly 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.610
 space 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.869
 we counted we came 10 and the second 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.450
 we loose and change 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.349
 and we change 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.349
 directly 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.430
 each each exercise can have a 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.760
 repetition of 5 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.700
 I am suffering, we are going up 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.470
 and we stretch all the top train 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.200
 we head upwards the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.459
 arms up high and we started 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.459
 to lift the tip of the feet 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.540
 we can count up to five seconds 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.439
 let's go slowly we go down and stretch 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.439
 and the arms 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.280
 it's something with the scapulae 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.980
 is 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.060
 separate the islands 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.180
 we separated we separated with the arms well 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.569
 stretched 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.349
 we count the same and the second minimum 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.349
 maximum 15 seconds 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.640
 now in a tube the legs 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.740
 in this position to allocate all the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.310
 part 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.310
 side 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.380
 slowly and always always change 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.380
 taking into account the 10 seconds 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.710
 here we change position and stretch 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.350
 backward 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.640
 to stretch the pectoralis major and minor 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.720
 It is easy 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.730
 slowly slowly we look forward 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.730
 and we understand the arms back 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.820
 shoulders 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:03.010
 as circular objects backwards in 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.010
 way to network and forward 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.380
 A) Yes 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.380
 slowly 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.680
 very well well we have stretched and we have 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.720
 activated all the train's musculature 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.709
 lower and the musculature of the train 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.709
 top thanks
