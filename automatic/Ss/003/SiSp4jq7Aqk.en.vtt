just<00:03:14.520> not<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.700> lot<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.910> opportunity<00:03:15.570> for<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.810> cuz

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
just not a lot of opportunity for it cuz

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.720 
just not a lot of opportunity for it cuz
it's<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.110> cartoony<00:03:16.650> i<00:03:16.830> will<00:03:17.190> say<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.400> all<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
it's a cartoony i will say that all the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.270 
it's a cartoony i will say that all the
characters<00:03:18.330> like<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.870> people<00:03:19.200> beautiful<00:03:19.830> it

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
characters like the people beautiful it

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.920 
characters like the people beautiful it
looks<00:03:20.400> like<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.670> pixar<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.330> it's<00:03:21.570> not<00:03:21.720> very

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
looks like a pixar like it's not very

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.960 
looks like a pixar like it's not very
much<00:03:22.230> I'm<00:03:22.739> into<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:23.370> very<00:03:23.550> cool<00:03:23.700> yeah

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
much I'm into that it's very cool yeah

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.790 
much I'm into that it's very cool yeah
but<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.660> think<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.290> could<00:03:25.440> have<00:03:25.530> been<00:03:25.620> possible

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
but I think it could have been possible

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.660 
but I think it could have been possible
the<00:03:26.190> ps3<00:03:26.989> definitely<00:03:27.989> yes<00:03:28.350> really<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.520> I

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
the ps3 definitely yes really like I

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.130 
the ps3 definitely yes really like I
think<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> big<00:03:30.180> draw<00:03:30.420> is<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.780> particle

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
think the big draw is the particle

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.410 
think the big draw is the particle
effects<00:03:31.440> on<00:03:31.650> my<00:03:31.830> calendar<00:03:32.070> yeah<00:03:32.520> right<00:03:32.790> that's

maybe<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:55.709> just<00:03:55.739> because<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.430> like

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
maybe it's just because I like
