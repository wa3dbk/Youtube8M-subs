different delay settings two of them I'm

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.859 
different delay settings two of them I'm
gonna<00:01:17.649> use<00:01:17.890> right<00:01:18.100> here<00:01:18.310> now<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:19.450> first<00:01:19.479> one

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
gonna use right here now the first one

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.050 
gonna use right here now the first one
is<00:01:19.929> a<00:01:20.170> delay<00:01:20.560> setting<00:01:21.070> but<00:01:21.549> not<00:01:21.729> just<00:01:21.970> a

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
is a delay setting but not just a

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.200 
is a delay setting but not just a
regular<00:01:22.420> delay<00:01:22.689> it's<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.289> warp<00:01:23.649> delay<00:01:24.159> it's<00:01:24.970> set

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
regular delay it's a warp delay it's set

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.389 
regular delay it's a warp delay it's set
at<00:01:25.299> 500<00:01:25.840> milliseconds<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.950> let<00:01:27.100> me<00:01:27.159> show<00:01:27.310> you

at 500 milliseconds and let me show you

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.380 
at 500 milliseconds and let me show you
how<00:01:27.549> it<00:01:27.610> works<00:01:27.759> here's<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:29.140> strait<00:01:29.470> delay<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
how it works here's the strait delay and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:45.749 
how it works here's the strait delay and
here's<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.110> war<00:01:40.619> from<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:44.310> okay<00:01:45.310> now<00:01:45.520> I'm

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
here's the war from the okay now I'm

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.219 
here's the war from the okay now I'm
gonna<00:01:45.909> make<00:01:46.090> my<00:01:46.149> loop<00:01:46.569> and<00:01:46.780> it's<00:01:46.990> gonna<00:01:47.080> be<00:01:47.170> a

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
gonna make my loop and it's gonna be a

00:01:47.229 --> 00:02:08.760 
gonna make my loop and it's gonna be a
dry<00:01:47.470> loop<00:01:47.799> here<00:01:48.700> we<00:01:48.759> go<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:49.209> get<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.479> mood<00:01:49.659> here

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.460 

okay<00:02:09.770> now<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:11.120> looks<00:02:11.330> goin<00:02:11.780> right<00:02:11.990> now<00:02:12.050> but<00:02:12.440> I

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
okay now that looks goin right now but I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.260 
okay now that looks goin right now but I
muted<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.860> for<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.070> second<00:02:13.460> I'm<00:02:13.910> gonna<00:02:14.030> play

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
muted it for a second I'm gonna play

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.120 
muted it for a second I'm gonna play
some<00:02:14.510> licks<00:02:14.720> over<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:15.380> as<00:02:15.500> if<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.800> was<00:02:15.980> an

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
some licks over it just as if it was an

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:39.260 
some licks over it just as if it was an
RC<00:02:17.090> 20<00:02:17.570> looper<00:02:17.960> here<00:02:18.230> we<00:02:18.320> go

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.880 

so<00:02:40.560> now<00:02:41.560> I'm<00:02:41.860> gonna<00:02:42.010> add<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.150> work<00:02:44.020> delay

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
so now I'm gonna add in the work delay

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.010 
so now I'm gonna add in the work delay
let's<00:02:45.730> check<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.120> out<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.570> loop<00:02:46.750> still

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
let's check this out the loop still

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.840 
let's check this out the loop still
going<00:02:47.290> dry<00:02:47.530> we're<00:02:48.520> gonna<00:02:48.610> add<00:02:48.700> some<00:02:48.820> more

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
going dry we're gonna add some more

00:02:48.850 --> 00:03:18.180 
going dry we're gonna add some more
