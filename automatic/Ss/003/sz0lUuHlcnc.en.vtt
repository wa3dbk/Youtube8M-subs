so<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:16.659> blade<00:02:16.930> thickness<00:02:17.739> on<00:02:18.159> this

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
so that is the blade thickness on this

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.050 
so that is the blade thickness on this
um<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:20.739> kind<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.010> an<00:02:21.159> in-between<00:02:21.280> for<00:02:21.819> cold

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
um it's kind of an in-between for cold

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.500 
um it's kind of an in-between for cold
steel<00:02:22.359> it's<00:02:22.599> not<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.379> thinnest<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:25.030> not<00:02:25.239> just

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
steel it's not the thinnest but not just

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.280 
steel it's not the thinnest but not just
thickest<00:02:25.930> as<00:02:26.109> you<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.319> see<00:02:26.530> there<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:28.290> there

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
thickest as you can see there is there

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
thickest as you can see there is there
is<00:02:29.409> flex<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.560> also<00:02:32.769> thick<00:02:33.099> enough

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
is flex to it but it's also thick enough

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.250 
is flex to it but it's also thick enough
to<00:02:33.459> do<00:02:33.579> some<00:02:33.760> real<00:02:33.909> damage<00:02:33.939> I<00:02:34.359> do<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.599> do<00:02:34.780> like<00:02:35.079> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
to do some real damage I do I do like it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.000 
to do some real damage I do I do like it
and<00:02:35.379> it<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:37.230> planet<00:02:38.230> up<00:02:38.560> here<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:41.319> thickness

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
and it is a planet up here the thickness

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.280 
and it is a planet up here the thickness
is<00:02:42.299> kind<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.359> in<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.599> bread<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:43.900> butter<00:02:44.200> zone

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
is kind of in that bread and butter zone

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.819 
is kind of in that bread and butter zone
where<00:02:44.739> it's<00:02:44.889> not<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.489> thick<00:02:45.879> that<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:47.530> hard

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
where it's not so thick that it's hard

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.500 
where it's not so thick that it's hard
to<00:02:48.069> use<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.579> know<00:02:48.669> it's<00:02:48.819> very<00:02:49.060> light<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.419> know

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
to use you know it's very light you know

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.149 
to use you know it's very light you know
shopping<00:02:50.049> right<00:02:50.109> some<00:02:50.349> cardboard<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.040> some

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
shopping right some cardboard and some

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.050 
shopping right some cardboard and some
some<00:02:51.939> wooden<00:02:52.209> dowels<00:02:52.389> in<00:02:52.689> the<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.849> barn

some wooden dowels in the and the barn

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.360 
some wooden dowels in the and the barn
then<00:02:55.329> it<00:02:55.450> cuts<00:02:55.750> thrown<00:02:56.049> like<00:02:56.200> butter<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.799> it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
then it cuts thrown like butter and it

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.159 
then it cuts thrown like butter and it
can<00:02:57.489> handle<00:02:57.639> some<00:02:58.000> pretty<00:02:58.389> thick<00:02:58.689> you<00:02:59.049> know

line they're just a really thick slabs

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.740 
line they're just a really thick slabs
of<00:03:09.099> steel<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.549> it's<00:03:09.969> a<00:03:10.090> really<00:03:10.329> nice<00:03:10.480> balance

difference<00:04:42.820> of<00:04:42.940> course<00:04:43.060> is<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.860> condors

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
difference of course is that condors

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.230 
difference of course is that condors
made<00:04:45.040> of<00:04:45.160> stainless<00:04:45.370> steel<00:04:45.730> as<00:04:45.880> opposed<00:04:46.150> to

made of stainless steel as opposed to
carbon<00:04:46.690> steel<00:04:46.960> so<00:04:47.169> you're<00:04:47.350> not<00:04:47.440> going<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.650> have

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
carbon steel so you're not going to have

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.670 
carbon steel so you're not going to have
that<00:04:47.860> toughness<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.960> area<00:04:50.200> yet<00:04:50.380> but<00:04:50.530> just

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
that toughness the area yet but just

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.260 
that toughness the area yet but just
wanted<00:04:50.889> to<00:04:50.980> show<00:04:51.130> that<00:04:51.160> first<00:04:51.669> comparison

so it's definitely uh you know a real

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.820 
so it's definitely uh you know a real
workhorse<00:05:49.300> of<00:05:49.630> machete<00:05:50.020> is<00:05:50.260> not<00:05:50.500> getting<00:05:50.800> a

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
workhorse of machete is not getting a

YouTube and not getting a lot of press
but<00:05:53.919> I<00:05:54.130> really<00:05:54.639> think<00:05:54.789> it's<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:55.000> cool<00:05:55.210> thing<00:05:55.450> to

the cool crease and things like that
this<00:06:08.320> is<00:06:08.380> kind<00:06:08.800> of<00:06:08.830> a<00:06:08.950> nice<00:06:09.130> in-between<00:06:09.630> it's

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
this is kind of a nice in-between it's

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.500 
this is kind of a nice in-between it's
long<00:06:10.990> you<00:06:11.770> know<00:06:11.860> 24<00:06:12.310> inches<00:06:12.639> and<00:06:12.700> and<00:06:13.300> thick

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
long you know 24 inches and and thick

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.629 
long you know 24 inches and and thick
enough<00:06:13.720> to<00:06:13.870> really<00:06:14.050> do<00:06:14.229> some<00:06:14.410> heavy<00:06:14.590> work<00:06:14.889> so<00:06:15.610> I

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
enough to really do some heavy work so I

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:16.950 
enough to really do some heavy work so I
think<00:06:15.729> it's<00:06:16.120> written<00:06:16.330> that<00:06:16.479> kind<00:06:16.660> of<00:06:16.690> middle

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
think it's written that kind of middle

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.040 
think it's written that kind of middle
zone<00:06:17.169> and<00:06:17.530> kind<00:06:17.740> of<00:06:17.860> fills<00:06:18.100> a<00:06:18.250> a<00:06:18.690> gap<00:06:19.690> in<00:06:19.990> your

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050

a grinding issue but I'll show you real
quick<00:07:39.740> before<00:07:39.889> we<00:07:40.099> go<00:07:40.310> just<00:07:40.550> to<00:07:40.970> compare<00:07:41.270> some

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:41.449 
quick before we go just to compare some

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:45.939 
quick before we go just to compare some
of<00:07:41.479> the<00:07:41.630> thickness<00:07:41.870> of<00:07:42.199> the<00:07:44.620> Condor<00:07:45.620> versus<00:07:45.919> a

of the thickness of the Condor versus a

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:48.040 
of the thickness of the Condor versus a
cold<00:07:46.220> steel<00:07:46.430> cuz<00:07:46.669> they're<00:07:46.789> they're<00:07:47.180> pretty

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.050 
cold steel cuz they're they're pretty

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:54.570 
cold steel cuz they're they're pretty
close<00:07:50.320> that<00:07:51.520> cold<00:07:52.520> steel<00:07:52.699> is<00:07:52.849> a<00:07:52.880> bit<00:07:53.090> thicker

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.580 
close that cold steel is a bit thicker

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.890 
close that cold steel is a bit thicker
by<00:07:55.580> a<00:07:55.610> hair<00:07:55.940> thicker<00:07:56.240> maybe<00:07:56.509> half<00:07:56.780> a

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:56.900 
by a hair thicker maybe half a

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.760 
by a hair thicker maybe half a
millimeter<00:07:57.259> thicker<00:07:57.590> so<00:07:58.419> up<00:07:59.419> to<00:07:59.690> size<00:08:00.440> wise

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:00.770 
millimeter thicker so up to size wise

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.680 
millimeter thicker so up to size wise
they're<00:08:01.659> pretty<00:08:02.659> close<00:08:04.300> you<00:08:05.300> can<00:08:05.389> see<00:08:05.419> the

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:05.690 
they're pretty close you can see the

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.570 
they're pretty close you can see the
coal<00:08:06.229> steel<00:08:06.440> has<00:08:06.590> a<00:08:06.620> much<00:08:06.889> better<00:08:07.039> lanyard

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:07.580 
coal steel has a much better lanyard
