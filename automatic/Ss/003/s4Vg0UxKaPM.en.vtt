notice<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.400> order<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.730> Planet<00:03:42.060> so<00:03:42.180> you've<00:03:42.330> got

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
notice the order of Planet so you've got

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.720 
notice the order of Planet so you've got
the<00:03:42.510> Sun<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.020> then<00:03:43.650> you've<00:03:43.770> got<00:03:43.800> where<00:03:44.370> sand

the Sun and then you've got where sand
is<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.390> order<00:03:45.570> of<00:03:45.690> planets<00:03:46.170> up<00:03:46.350> here<00:03:46.590> so

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
is in the order of planets up here so

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.290 
is in the order of planets up here so
let's<00:03:47.160> click<00:03:47.310> yes<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.700> I'll<00:03:47.910> show<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.180> how

kids they get to build a spacecraft and
fly<00:03:54.960> it<00:03:54.990> around<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.410> screen<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.040> can

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
fly it around the screen so you can

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.690 
fly it around the screen so you can
imagine<00:03:56.340> there<00:03:56.790> are<00:03:56.820> thousands<00:03:57.600> of

imagine there are thousands of
possibilities<00:03:59.700> here<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.750> just<00:04:00.930> drag

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
possibilities here and you just drag

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.790 
possibilities here and you just drag
these<00:04:01.530> over<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:03.110> it<00:04:04.110> gives<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.440> new<00:04:04.710> path

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
these over and it gives you a new path

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:16.130 
these over and it gives you a new path

lightest planet in the solar system over
to<00:04:50.130> float<00:04:50.400> if<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.729> placed<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.180> in<00:04:51.330> water<00:04:51.509> you

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
to float if you placed it in water you

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.529 
to float if you placed it in water you
did<00:04:52.560> not<00:04:52.710> know<00:04:52.830> that<00:04:52.880> now<00:04:53.880> will<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.150> get<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.419> do

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
did not know that now will you get to do

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:55.760 
did not know that now will you get to do
is<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.720> get<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.930> fly<00:04:55.110> around<00:04:55.229> with<00:04:55.680> your

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
is you get to fly around with your

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.719 
is you get to fly around with your
jetpack<00:04:56.419> just<00:04:57.419> by<00:04:57.539> touching<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:58.050> screen<00:04:58.319> and

jetpack just by touching the screen and
you<00:04:59.729> can<00:04:59.849> click<00:05:00.150> stars<00:05:00.539> and<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.289> idea<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.949> to

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
you can click stars and the idea is to

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.510 
you can click stars and the idea is to
fly<00:05:02.759> around<00:05:02.910> or<00:05:03.650> bumping<00:05:04.650> into<00:05:04.830> things<00:05:04.949> having

fun and collecting the parts of the

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.600 
fun and collecting the parts of the
spacecraft<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.770> can<00:05:10.949> see<00:05:11.130> down<00:05:11.370> here

spacecraft that you can see down here

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.550 
spacecraft that you can see down here
you<00:05:11.759> need<00:05:11.909> five<00:05:12.180> of<00:05:12.449> them<00:05:12.569> and<00:05:15.349> then<00:05:16.349> once

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
you need five of them and then once

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.129 
you need five of them and then once
you've<00:05:16.740> got<00:05:16.949> all<00:05:16.979> of<00:05:17.310> those<00:05:17.430> pieces<00:05:18.110> you<00:05:19.110> can

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
you've got all of those pieces you can

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:26.330 
you've got all of those pieces you can
then<00:05:19.560> jump<00:05:19.830> in<00:05:20.039> with<00:05:20.159> spacecraft<00:05:22.699> and<00:05:24.949> go<00:05:25.949> and

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
then jump in with spacecraft and go and

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.770 
then jump in with spacecraft and go and
fly<00:05:26.759> we<00:05:27.090> need<00:05:27.240> one<00:05:27.449> more<00:05:27.569> piece<00:05:27.840> areas

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.050 

go<00:05:31.440> click<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:31.800> gold<00:05:32.100> star<00:05:32.430> while<00:05:32.700> we're<00:05:32.880> here

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
go click this gold star while we're here

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:40.439 
go click this gold star while we're here
let's<00:05:34.130> fly<00:05:35.130> back<00:05:35.340> up<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.790> spacecraft

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.390 

and<00:05:40.930> yes<00:05:41.319> we<00:05:41.499> want<00:05:41.620> to<00:05:41.770> get<00:05:41.830> in<00:05:41.979> our<00:05:42.099> spacecraft

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
and yes we want to get in our spacecraft

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.649 
and yes we want to get in our spacecraft
that<00:05:42.699> we<00:05:42.849> just<00:05:43.029> built<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:45.580> now<00:05:46.270> we<00:05:46.330> get<00:05:46.509> to

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
that we just built and now we get to

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:59.550 
that we just built and now we get to
take<00:05:46.779> off

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.590 

and<00:06:00.560> what<00:06:00.770> you'll<00:06:00.890> see<00:06:00.980> is<00:06:01.370> that<00:06:01.970> we<00:06:02.120> end<00:06:02.300> up<00:06:02.450> in

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
and what you'll see is that we end up in

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.770 
and what you'll see is that we end up in
space<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.560> another<00:06:04.400> random<00:06:04.730> location<00:06:05.540> you

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
space and another random location you

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.150 
space and another random location you
can<00:06:05.960> see<00:06:06.170> roughly<00:06:06.530> where<00:06:06.740> you<00:06:06.830> are<00:06:06.950> by<00:06:07.130> looking

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
can see roughly where you are by looking

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.600 
can see roughly where you are by looking
at<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.610> map<00:06:07.820> or<00:06:08.480> over<00:06:08.690> here<00:06:08.720> and<00:06:09.320> you<00:06:10.070> can<00:06:10.220> fly

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
at the map or over here and you can fly

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.920 
at the map or over here and you can fly
around<00:06:10.640> you<00:06:11.090> can<00:06:11.270> say<00:06:11.480> i<00:06:11.510> want<00:06:11.750> to<00:06:11.780> go<00:06:11.900> to

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
around you can say i want to go to

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.660 
around you can say i want to go to
Planet<00:06:12.350> Earth<00:06:12.470> by<00:06:12.740> touching<00:06:13.040> it<00:06:13.280> like<00:06:13.340> this

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
Planet Earth by touching it like this

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.160 
Planet Earth by touching it like this
and<00:06:13.910> it<00:06:13.970> will<00:06:14.060> show<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:14.300> your<00:06:14.630> direction<00:06:14.900> to

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
and it will show you your direction to

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.590 
and it will show you your direction to
Planet<00:06:15.500> Earth<00:06:15.620> and<00:06:15.920> you<00:06:16.880> would<00:06:17.030> just<00:06:17.210> fly<00:06:17.540> down

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
Planet Earth and you would just fly down

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.290 
Planet Earth and you would just fly down
until<00:06:18.260> you<00:06:18.380> bump<00:06:18.590> into<00:06:18.770> that<00:06:19.040> planet<00:06:19.430> you<00:06:20.150> can

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
until you bump into that planet you can

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.820 
until you bump into that planet you can
also<00:06:20.390> just<00:06:20.690> fly<00:06:20.990> around<00:06:21.110> and<00:06:21.440> have<00:06:21.590> a<00:06:21.650> lot<00:06:21.770> of

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
also just fly around and have a lot of

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.430 
also just fly around and have a lot of
fun<00:06:22.070> which<00:06:22.280> is<00:06:22.330> what<00:06:23.330> may<00:06:23.480> kids<00:06:23.720> tend<00:06:24.050> to<00:06:24.230> do
