the kind of plan those guys came out
very<00:01:55.320> fresh<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:56.490> have

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
very fresh you know they have

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.450 
very fresh you know they have
opportunities<00:01:57.479> where<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:58.100> went<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.159> front<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
opportunities where we went in front of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.130 
opportunities where we went in front of
them<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.729> our<00:02:00.149> legs<00:02:00.450> seemed<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:00.960> bit

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
them but our legs seemed a little bit

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.590 
them but our legs seemed a little bit
heavy<00:02:01.290> seemed<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:02.030> those<00:02:03.030> guys<00:02:03.240> came<00:02:03.450> all

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
heavy seemed like those guys came all

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.080 
heavy seemed like those guys came all
about<00:02:03.780> energy<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.399> took<00:02:05.549> advantage<00:02:05.759> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
about energy so I took advantage of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.330 
about energy so I took advantage of
what's<00:02:07.079> frustrating<00:02:07.290> about<00:02:07.619> not<00:02:08.069> being<00:02:08.280> able

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
what's frustrating about not being able

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.339 
what's frustrating about not being able
to<00:02:08.610> come<00:02:09.030> back<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.239> get<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.629> energy<00:02:09.929> at<00:02:10.200> some

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
to come back or get that energy at some

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.970 
to come back or get that energy at some
point<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> game<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:11.670> fought<00:02:12.000> back

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
point in the game we fought back

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.410 
point in the game we fought back
pebble<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.400> me<00:02:13.730> when<00:02:13.909> you<00:02:14.000> when<00:02:14.150> you're<00:02:14.269> down

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
pebble to me when you when you're down

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.399 
pebble to me when you when you're down
by<00:02:14.690> 17<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:17.450> takes<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:17.959> much<00:02:18.140> more

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
by 17 and so it takes so much more

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.280 
by 17 and so it takes so much more
energy<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.890> fight<00:02:19.069> back<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.049> try<00:02:21.230> to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
energy to fight back and then to try to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.380 
energy to fight back and then to try to
maintain<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.799> when<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:22.220> game<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.670> it's

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
maintain and when that game is it's

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.860 
maintain and when that game is it's
almost<00:02:23.690> impossible<00:02:24.970> so<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.120> just<00:02:26.239> got<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.420> set

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
almost impossible so we just got to set

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.339 
almost impossible so we just got to set
a<00:02:26.900> front<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.230> way<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.379> kind<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.650> just<00:02:27.799> maintain

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
a front of way to kind of just maintain

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.759 
a front of way to kind of just maintain
you<00:02:30.349> know<00:02:30.470> for<00:02:30.890> for<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.819> full<00:02:32.030> game<00:02:32.209> if<00:02:32.420> we<00:02:32.450> can

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
you know for for the full game if we can

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.949
