 quake craft plugin bucket that are 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:27.710
 several servers 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.390
 good that it is very easy and we are going to 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.180
 need is good to download the wey 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.760
 kraft the hard point this has a 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.060
 server with kraft bukit and that the 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.550
 server now 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.420
 and the others I do not know with good justice 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.079
 first of all we have to 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.440
 download them 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.890
 to download text growing I'll leave it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 the link 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.810
 in the description of the video if not 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.460
 they find dead we unload it 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.079
 after we leave we do not have our 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.190
 server i have 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.530
 Perez 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.379
 here 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.940
 well what we are going to do is show 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.040
 folder where is there is our cake 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.000
 wake point hard the mass to send to the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.610
 plugins folder 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.850
 Once this is done, what are we going to do? 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.439
 is to open our rom dot bat 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.670
 we wait for the whole map to load 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.670
 everyone observes 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.850
 once we have it what we 're going to 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.850
 to do is open our chart 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.380
 good when we enter our 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.180
 server what are we going to do look for a 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.160
 free space or enclosed as they want 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.900
 let's decide maps 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.900
 I have save places 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.900
 What I did was make a square 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.050
 giant so that people can not 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.050
 escape 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.470
 as well as a block 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:14.960
 the other here double walsh bar and the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.960
 iron material and it's going to create this 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.049
 a people we have not created this what 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.209
 we're going to do is start creating the 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.750
 sand if they want the configuration 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.250
 casitas do not know something Montañitas 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.830
 want 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.630
 good is that it shows what is needed 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.600
 do nothing else with the chubby we put in 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.360
 the charles wake and create t 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.470
 and the name of the room that is going to be 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.470
 let's go by the name n 1 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.069
 what we are going to do now is 7 a 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.920
 how many minimum people to enter 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.720
 towards the sand and let's start we're not going to 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.490
 put wake 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.250
 the name of the arena was finished on 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.790
 minimum and the number of people I'm going to 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.579
 put 1 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.469
 because I want you to start and not 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.409
 I recommend that you put it in two or more 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:15.079
 still with two in one for 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.959
 show them the same but for the maximum 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:22.120
 of people 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.120
 name set max 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.159
 well now what we are going to put is the 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.340
 name of the map as we want it to come out 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:37.569
 in the posters for example if you 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:42.280
 in a map of castles models of 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:45.849
 boats with to put is with the name of 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:50.280
 the tennis room set map and the name 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.280
 put 11 ships boats 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.290
 after we are doing it is going to be earth 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.599
 it is for people who have gone 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.380
 appearing let's do it several times 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:06.620
 so that it does not look over quake 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.190
 on behalf of the spawn sand two 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.350
 together 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.330
 we put one here 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.210
 try to do it scattered so that 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.360
 do not take advantage of knowing the mates but 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.579
 appear I shot him if they are made 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:25.350
 scattered better 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.670
 to assume 10 everywhere out there 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.770
 78 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.940
 and good inside 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.460
 ok when this modest we finished 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.840
 create the sand put minimum players and 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.490
 maximum players 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.990
 the name of the map and add it after 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:48.520
 let's put the name sand and know 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.800
 that does not happen to save all the 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.290
 configurations now we're not going to go to 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.449
 our spawn or wherever we want that 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.650
 appear 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.650
 the little signs come out 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.240
 what are we going to do to put any 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.570
 Discard amount ready does not matter 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.070
 what is going to do is the law the sand one 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.810
 he cares about this 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.600
 another area nothing occupy this this this 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.350
 this way every sand has its little sign 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.169
 its not just what we're going to click on 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.310
 a sign with the wooden boat and 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.629
 second in this 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:34.200
 what we are going to do is put 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:36.570
 a der lübbe 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.180
 and that's where we're going to create this name 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.890
 boats 0 people who are the ones who are 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.100
 in 10 the maximum and 0 is the number of 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.840
 the room zero if we can enter this 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.760
 wait and even with all 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.730
 what we are going to do now is when 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:59.250
 someone lose or win will appear in 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.250
 a place I do not put here better 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.360
 quake 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.030
 one that is done this is almost 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.030
 everything ready 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:20.060
 know I saw it and it would be all we finished what 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.580
 we're going to do is go to a test 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.560
