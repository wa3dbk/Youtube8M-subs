 teresópolis 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.610
 why the television also helped the magazines 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.340
 magazine headline has grown a lot 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.660
 after the carnival 'to know if there was a mistake on the television and then 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.730
 Contains nothing revealed to the magazine 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.689
 really German people with this coverage of the carnival we do more 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.619
 once 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.619

 journalistic her and showed the party fashion party more never forgot a side 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.070
 of the journalist gives news and was one of the points of flooding reinforced the law that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 the senator did not have to have journalism and the carnival transmission 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.860
 carnival is still a journalistic way of doing it. 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.420
 he talks in journalism 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.329
 is the last very important point in history and both the globe and the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.039
 headline 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.450
 which was the coverage of the campaign for direct elections in the late regime dodo 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.409
 and duda at the end of the dictatorship I ran the high also reports that she full mother 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.369
 of April more space for home this popular movement what the globe do not know 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.140
 if you picked it up and it was the companion colette we had everything is history 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.040
 Let's give 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 all sides all farc how arrived there and of course 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.240
 and to the headline she did not flip it or she showed everything the way she really 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.440
 was happening day but this space in the debate even in the sauce itself 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.549
 if you remember the cockroach cabaret 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.649
 had all the politicians they debated between the lines the Brazilian politics 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.030
 in the chamber of the maracanã humorous program presented by the ice of the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.030

 made several titles in the lebron saleh nba with the doctors he had until a 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.690
 year 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.730
 a soul curious thing until the time of tancredo presented value as a 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.610
 Angel 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.610
 How far away did you pass away? 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 then had oil efe he did not come to take the power led alessandra river in the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.840
 day 21 of 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.819
 the singer a year ago eliziane esse 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.910
 this area 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.310
 this story of the headline it accompanies somewhat the history of politics 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.540
 Brazil is not it, those cases to others of lows with one of the burnings 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.379
 explanations for 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.699
 the difficulties 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:30.869
 were those economic plans is also this can be can be when seeing 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:35.279
 as an explanation however the crusader after the lap this also babalu the 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.639
 company structure 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.839
 no one of the things that if one of the two worlds later spoke spoke 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:46.129
 was that at the launch party of the world 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.230
 of the US economy of Japan did not have the money to throw the party because 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 had the account confiscated an all 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:59.709
 one got all the money prisoners had to mark when complaining that the table and the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.599
 same time borrow money with a post 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.909
 there because this party leaves Sao Paulo river or near the exit of hand has a 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.919
 law gas station 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:14.289
 or else they negotiated with the post morosani to make the party what you said 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.289
 in the Japanese camera that is also a novel 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.130
 in addition the body of the lock his book 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.650
 that there was a settlement an agreement of gentlemen between the blocked the flu 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.650
 I saw that the blockade would not put a novel in the headline and it will not 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.140
 have nothing to do with the moment is well so now what the novel and this was 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.720
 also same 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.779
 a factor of greater length 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:02.019
 with the globe and then he put it is all this good soap opera series 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.309
 different from the rhythm of the forró and the shapes of the globe and the worse hired the 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.379
 jayme monjardim because it's to do pantanal 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.260
 I can not help loading from japan canada and japan but also effective 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.870
 I'm not talking about what I've eaten like 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.329
 sugarcane highlights juggling and wei thunder 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.650
 You think this 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.430
 is an inheritance left by the star 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.590
 was left with something left Brazilian television to overproduce 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.110
 certainly because even the globe did not use it so much 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.169
 and do big things 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.499
 tel or I think it is the biggest inheritance that every day but this left 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:40.460
 the kilo what she did the world's soap opera mini-series 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.610
 Do you see the house seven women? 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.620
 nor so many other miniseries with that quality that it was a flood 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.139
 not read a quality in the air something that unites 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.909
 did you know that you were tuned in to quality management and refinement 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.450
 you could clearly see your blog where 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.960
 because today we sometimes change the peace channel that is the same man the 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.020
 the more you sit in the room the second he does the licking in the room in ct no 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.900
 She opened the door to her own house, let's go to Brazil. 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.780
 the piece that feather osmar gonçalves letícia spiller people started in a 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.589
 flood 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:16.990
 he said something interesting 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.880
 but we did not sell with a station we sold a brand a brand of 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.210
 television 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.620
 she ended up with one of the best billings 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.360
 what is the most impressive even in crisis 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.789
 between the stations she spoke well 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.419
 because of this designer issue 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.689
 was a soul poster person 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:41.719
 even if erre makes crisis she knew that the headline present a journalism 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:42.930
 Of Quality 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.290
 a miniseries even though it is with fewer features now the circularity allows 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.650
 The floor was 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.760
 in the program 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.480
 one was a way of calling deserted now it was not on a television 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.039
 Is it a television that inherited 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.900
 this headline burden on the 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.219
 and as far as I know, it must have dissipated 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:07.619
 the other broadcasters that it is bold that we mentioned in the 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:08.639
 first block 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.240
 we have had 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.800
 in this club block that do not belong to check but the option of 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.499
 cuca 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:18.930
 I would trade the pun but this boldness 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.080
 wetland feith caused the globe also to use itself as the lunch sector 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.600
 in the June miniseries 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.639
 and the carnival that we commented here 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.860
 all that she 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.969
 not everything else 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:36.020
 quite a bit of that than the headline is at 6 and innovated and brought in silver television 

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.979
 Brazilian 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.659
 We find some televisions out there, but that's how you said it. 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.340
 is permeating the programming of some televisions and that it is not only 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:45.469
 in schedules 

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:46.770
 the professionals 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.710
 in the sunfish newspapers that were formed there 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.710
 and then went to take that knowledge and experience 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.159
 it is well that there was satisfaction with what you notice is that we wear skirt 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.659
 you soon after what led you as a journalist 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:03.489
 work when the former mayor and 

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.449
 clothing for quality is not 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.839
 when there is a lot of quality and a little bow 

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:10.259
 Look what I would like our cry here 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.819
 He also worked there and worked there. 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.240
 in the headline 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.300
 on TV the professionals are there then on the market not on the market you put the 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.790
 that led to journalism 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.449
 this journalism 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.220
 He's going to get in there. 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.430
 We have several reporters who worked here in Brasilia. 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.669
 nothing else did 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.699
 I'm doing a beautiful job on tv globe 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.280
 they took with them that bit of luggage as far as they can be used 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.809
 for the journalist tv globe is missing is the set was real 

00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:49.539
 It is the counter-fugitive of the soap operas of the station, as it is the names that 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.089
 emerged in the 1990s 

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:52.949
 they were many not 

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:55.699
 you stayed task went to break soon after 

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:57.250
 in the interval we'll do 

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.110
 One more pause and then we come back to convert to what today 

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.249
 talk about this story from the television headline network we're back already
