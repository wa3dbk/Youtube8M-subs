00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.969
 hi welcome in the kitchen of ss cook 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.100
 we smell of easter 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.949
 have you ever seen these taralli in 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.139
 Puglia are the symbol of Easter I am 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.250
 the taralli with the icing to call them 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.350
 in the Italian manner 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.939
 in my part it is called and taradash 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.759
 lett 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.949
 ashley today lab dialect term 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:31.259
 it is to indicate the icing of which 15 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:35.370
 have been masters for centuries 500 g of flour 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.730
 double zero and 45 eggs in size 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.449
 medium 100 g of extra virgin olive oil of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.239
 light olive a small glass of liqueur 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.699
 here we have a nice pinch of 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 bicarbonate and then you will need a pinch 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.170
 of salt this with regard to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.800
 the taralli mixture for how much 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.320
 it's about the icing we need 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 125 g of water and 500 grams of 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.519
 sugar then the first thing me 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.040
 I'm going to break the eggs in a bowl 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.100
 like this then that of the robot 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.350
 or in any bowl at home 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.470
 we will then see which must be the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.720
 consistency that the dough will have when it is 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.650
 ready to be transformed into 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.390
 taralli now I will begin to mount 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.800
 with a hand whisk the eggs together with 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.900
 a teaspoon of baking soda 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.930
 tradition has it that we put a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:45.530
 pinch of salt for each new then 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:48.030
 1 2 3 and 4 jar began to mount unite 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.960
 the alcohol in this case I put the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:57.540
 anise liqueur 4 tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:01.190
 and we continue to mount and now always 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:08.429
 slowly still mounting by hand 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:14.700
 I combine the hate add the flour e 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:18.180
 began to knead here here will join all 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.500
 oil as the mixture begins 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.959
 to take shape 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:29.579
 here we continue to slowly unite 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:34.250
 the oil we transfer here is the dough 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.250
 very very soft point 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.380
 here it is smooth homogeneous then it 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.250
 we cover with a cloth with della 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.600
 film 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.790
 we let him rest a quarter of an hour 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.920
 twenty minutes then we start doing i 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.180
 taralli we take the pasta after the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:02.900
 rest we cut piece at a time and 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:10.130
 we supply small rolls and go to them 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:12.440
 thus close the characteristic of 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.460
 these taralli and that these before 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.420
 bake will be boiled or like 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.070
 I said he gets warmed up 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.710
 it means just diving into the water 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.920
 boiling exactly as we will do for 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.920
 a moment 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.890
 for the stars we need one 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.020
 pot partially filled with 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.840
 of the water we bring to the point of 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.360
 boiling the water must quiver not 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.700
 we must see the typical bubbles 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.490
 which serve for example for rooms i 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.430
 spaghetti because it must be a cooking 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.220
 very very very slow 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.959
 then slowly a pair of taralli 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.480
 at a time depending on the size of 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.360
 we pour water into this water is not 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.180
 salted and only water brought to the point 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.130
 of boiling 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.300
 when they are ready when we see them 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.200
 get to race yourself when they are 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.120
 floated up there 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.120
 drain and place them on a cloth 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.359
 while we cook the taralli we start a 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.549
 prepare the glaze let's put the water in 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.549
 a pan and sugar 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.210
 we will let the water and the sugar 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.070
 become a very thick syrup e 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.190
 we will bring this syrup to 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.020
 we will see each other in a temperature of 100 degrees 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.450
 a bit like syrup 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.260
 when we are at 100 degrees it begins to do 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.270
 of bubbles and being able to tamper with them 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.140
 touch it with your fingers 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.750
 we will form a yarn between the fingers a 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.170
 once placed to dry the taralli go 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.290
 kept between two towels for one night 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.600
 whole we take them one at a time and with 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.900
 a sharp knife we go to 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:11.900
 incise the entire edge of the taralli 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.450
 let's bake the taralli we make a double 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.010
 cooking the first ten minutes the oven 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.260
 will be at 200 degrees 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:22.010
 after we will lower the temperature of the 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.500
 oven and we will cook them at 180 degrees for 10 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.620
 15 minutes still obviously will depend 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.660
 also from your oven and up to 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.840
 when the taralli will be well swollen and 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.840
 golden 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:45.070
 here is the syrup and hot now with 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:51.220
 fingers wet with cold water 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:52.300
 here is where we create a thread if we have 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.789
 a 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.680
 a mixer of this type then a 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.470
 planetary that we can mount 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.440
 allow us to start assembling it 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.810
 syrup from the first moment then 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.520
 even when it's hot we have to do 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:13.419
 transform this transparent syrup 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:16.300
 and sticky in a white glaze when 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:19.600
 the icing will have become pretty white and 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:23.139
 so already well mounted just put it 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.050
 in a bain-marie to have it 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.510
 again of the right consistency for 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.729
 frost the biscuits then to this 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.130
 I take the cookies 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.020
 we eliminate the excess glaze e 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.570
 we put the biscuits 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:41.889
 as they are glazed on a plate 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:44.380
 from scope and we must do nothing but 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:48.970
 wait for the biscuit to be 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:52.300
 completely solidified and therefore 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:54.880
 at this point we can set up a nice one 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.409
 tray to pack it a nice ribbon 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.360
 colorful could be ours 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:00.360
 Easter gift for some caramia
