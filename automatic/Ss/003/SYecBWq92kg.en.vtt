00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.050
 There 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:11.730
 Today is that 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:13.510
 There is mh 21 wagon, but this 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.330
 a building 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.890
 During acceleration 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.789
 I guess is at high load to at the time of high load 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.420
 If the rotation of the children has not risen 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.190
 In that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:36.950
 I tried to ride, but after all from the hot spring town store 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:41.579
 It's funny with the lip, so I don't think it's an overall balance 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.300
 I think the kana not you say Mom probably doing the Na greater than or direct 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.440
 I'm going to look at it while talking a little 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.670
 Nicolo 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.579
 Sa line 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.579
 This camera I made the other day 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:01.940
 At the oil stand where I made red kagura 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.940
 I would like to shoot while doing this with a little bit 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.049
 inadvertently 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.829
 Hmmm 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.560
 I got a lag 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.960
 From the left 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.010
 Bang Bang 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.010
 The user's location is not 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.450
 I felt like I saw it 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.539
 It seems that you are walking thick 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.539
 Hmm 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 Because it only there is no evidence that was supported by the not from eternity in this also this time somewhere will say 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.560
 Let's go 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.260
 Remember Direct 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.050
 I came with cash 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.050
 Two turns are changing shape a little 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.980
 Is it improved? 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.860
 Because 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.250
 I wonder 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.060
 A plate is wound like something like a passing 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.670
 If you think something 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.680
 I This Ne in 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.190

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.950
 Yappa code 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.910
 I it was a defective product that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.760
 It has been a little improvement Well new thing is there only say 4 break 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.000
 A little bit more expensive platinum 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.810
 It is already 150,000 kilometers already 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.810
 There was no sign of changing, so this time the processing person will go this time too 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.220
 I was working for a while 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.850

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.390
