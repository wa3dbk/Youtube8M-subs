00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
you an idea that's the big boy and you

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.450 
you an idea that's the big boy and you
go<00:01:39.869> over<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:40.319> and<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.649> a<00:01:41.039> little<00:01:41.310> boy

over here so there really isn't much
variance<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.819> size<00:01:45.210> right<00:01:45.659> now<00:01:46.280> hopefully

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
variance in size right now hopefully

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
variance in size right now hopefully
that'll<00:01:47.490> stay<00:01:47.849> so<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:53.929> Kim<00:01:54.929> here<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.319> making
