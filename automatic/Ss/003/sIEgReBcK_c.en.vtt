this week so it took me a while and I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.030 
this week so it took me a while and I

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
didn't really have time to do that much

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.280 
didn't really have time to do that much
so<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> added<00:00:38.399> some<00:00:38.579> cabinets<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.870> had

one here and I had two in here and then
I<00:00:44.040> kind<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.430> tie<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.850> off<00:00:45.590> this<00:00:46.590> part

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
I kind of just tie it off this part

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.290 
I kind of just tie it off this part
right<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:48.450> looks<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> now<00:00:50.300> I'm

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
right here it looks like that now I'm

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
right here it looks like that now I'm
going<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.719> show<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.199> second<00:00:52.559> floor<00:00:52.789> on

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
going to show you the second floor on

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.490 
going to show you the second floor on
the<00:00:54.210> second<00:00:54.600> floor<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:54.960> added<00:00:55.350> some

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the second floor I just added some

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.520 
the second floor I just added some
tables<00:00:57.230> with<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.530> designs<00:00:59.190> on<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> wood

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
tables with the designs on the wood

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.840 
tables with the designs on the wood
design<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.609> four<00:01:02.910> tables<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.519> those

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
design have four tables so I think those

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.800 
design have four tables so I think those
look<00:01:06.060> good

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.679

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
pieces to do that I decided to put the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.190 
pieces to do that I decided to put the
petshop<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:22.580> because<00:01:23.930> everybody<00:01:24.930> was

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
this changed a little bit I just took

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.980 
this changed a little bit I just took
this<00:01:59.610> off<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.479> work<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
this off so that I can work on it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
this off so that I can work on it
separately<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> could<00:02:02.399> take<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> over<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.939> my

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
separately so I could take it over to my

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.749 
separately so I could take it over to my
work<00:02:03.270> table<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.070> work<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.250> it

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
is my garden center mock I think that it

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.950 
is my garden center mock I think that it
looks<00:05:03.910> pretty<00:05:04.390> good<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:04.600> far<00:05:06.360> um<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.600> has<00:05:07.750> lots

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
looks pretty good so far um it has lots

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.110 
looks pretty good so far um it has lots
of<00:05:08.080> flowers<00:05:08.560> in<00:05:08.800> it<00:05:08.920> and<00:05:09.370> then<00:05:09.580> it<00:05:09.700> has<00:05:09.880> the

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
of flowers in it and then it has the

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.960 
of flowers in it and then it has the
hanging<00:05:10.600> baskets<00:05:11.140> here<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.770> then<00:05:12.670> I<00:05:12.700> have

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
hanging baskets here and then I have

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.060

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
these little covered things with the

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.670 
these little covered things with the
flowers<00:05:15.460> growing<00:05:15.700> underneath<00:05:16.060> of<00:05:16.270> them<00:05:16.390> I

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
type thing for this front here

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.790 
type thing for this front here
and<00:05:25.150> then<00:05:25.570> you<00:05:25.630> walk<00:05:25.990> in<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.260> you<00:05:26.500> would<00:05:26.590> see

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
and then you walk in and you would see

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.060 
and then you walk in and you would see
all<00:05:26.950> this<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:29.260> then<00:05:29.440> I<00:05:29.470> just<00:05:29.710> have<00:05:29.890> these

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
all this and then I just have these

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.990 
all this and then I just have these
flowers<00:05:30.570> on<00:05:31.570> them<00:05:32.190> these<00:05:33.190> little<00:05:33.550> things<00:05:33.760> here

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
flowers on them these little things here

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.600 
flowers on them these little things here
these<00:05:34.960> are<00:05:35.140> actually<00:05:35.470> very<00:05:35.620> easy<00:05:35.980> to<00:05:36.220> take<00:05:36.400> off

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
these are actually very easy to take off

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.970 
these are actually very easy to take off
and<00:05:37.560> then<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.800> flower<00:05:39.070> pots<00:05:40.410> are<00:05:41.410> actually

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
and then the flower pots are actually

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.090 
and then the flower pots are actually
just<00:05:43.260> two<00:05:44.260> by<00:05:44.410> twos<00:05:45.300> in<00:05:46.300> black<00:05:46.660> with<00:05:47.320> a<00:05:47.350> technic

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
just two by twos in black with a technic

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.600 
just two by twos in black with a technic
pin<00:05:48.340> in<00:05:48.700> them<00:05:49.020> in<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.110> middle<00:05:50.380> and<00:05:50.580> then<00:05:51.580> you

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
pin in them in the middle and then you

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.540 
pin in them in the middle and then you
can<00:05:51.910> stick<00:05:52.240> a<00:05:52.270> flower<00:05:52.630> on<00:05:53.910> there<00:05:55.770> and<00:05:56.770> then

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
can stick a flower on there and then

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.410 
can stick a flower on there and then
it's<00:05:57.940> weird<00:05:58.570> because<00:05:58.840> these<00:05:59.500> actually<00:05:59.770> fit

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
it's weird because these actually fit

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.300 
it's weird because these actually fit
right<00:06:01.420> into<00:06:01.930> those<00:06:02.110> bladder<00:06:02.560> pieces<00:06:03.130> right

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
right into those bladder pieces right

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:10.850 
right into those bladder pieces right

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
there it's hard with holding the camera

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.080 
there it's hard with holding the camera
internal<00:06:11.860> light<00:06:12.130> here<00:06:13.020> there<00:06:14.020> we<00:06:14.110> go<00:06:14.790> but<00:06:15.790> um

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
internal light here there we go but um

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.940 
internal light here there we go but um
it<00:06:16.690> just<00:06:16.930> fits<00:06:17.170> right<00:06:17.320> in<00:06:17.620> here<00:06:18.120> like<00:06:19.120> that

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
it just fits right in here like that

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.780
