see<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:56.909> i<00:01:56.969> zoom<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.649> they're

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
see if i zoom in you can see they're

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.109 
see if i zoom in you can see they're
actually<00:02:00.270> three<00:02:00.570> pages<00:02:00.810> missing<00:02:01.939> then<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
actually three pages missing then it

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.530 
actually three pages missing then it
skips<00:02:03.390> from<00:02:03.479> number<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.700> number<00:02:05.700> five<00:02:06.180> so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
skips from number one to number five so

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.600 
skips from number one to number five so
I'm<00:02:06.630> assuming<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.560> two<00:02:07.829> three<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.310> four

you can see slender man in the middle
and<00:02:40.349> eight<00:02:40.650> others<00:02:41.010> being<00:02:42.049> literally<00:02:43.049> pulled

upside day if you just flip the page as
you<00:02:54.030> would<00:02:54.709> rationally<00:02:55.709> do<00:02:55.799> it<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.040> upside

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
you would rationally do it it's upside

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.280 
you would rationally do it it's upside
down<00:02:56.569> so<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:58.790> wonder<00:02:59.790> if<00:02:59.940> two<00:03:00.690> three<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.049> four

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
down so I wonder if two three and four

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.020 
down so I wonder if two three and four
wouldn't<00:03:01.590> mind<00:03:01.829> checking<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.549> back<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.879> their

wouldn't mind checking the back of their
so<00:03:03.209> if<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.360> haven't<00:03:03.569> already<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:04.079> make<00:03:04.200> sure

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
so if you haven't already to make sure

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.150 
so if you haven't already to make sure
there's<00:03:04.470> nothing<00:03:04.530> written<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.980> back<00:03:05.129> that

this might be for you than it is others

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.110 
this might be for you than it is others
will<00:03:10.680> say<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.190> they<00:03:11.280> think<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.640> belongs<00:03:11.940> to

will say that they think it belongs to
them<00:03:12.299> but<00:03:13.170> do<00:03:13.260> they<00:03:13.379> think<00:03:15.019> interesting<00:03:16.579> then

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
them but do they think interesting then

them but do they think interesting then
if<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.760> flip<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.060> over<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:19.530> says<00:03:19.799> 70<00:03:20.510> so

if you flip it over it says 70 so

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.340 
if you flip it over it says 70 so
