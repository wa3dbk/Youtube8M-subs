00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
basically what it is it's water and a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830 
basically what it is it's water and a
can<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> cool<00:01:21.299> thing<00:01:21.330> about<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.720> it's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
can but the cool thing about it it's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.960

like<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.990> pressurized<00:01:22.560> container<00:01:23.009> therefore

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
like a pressurized container therefore

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.179 
like a pressurized container therefore
it<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.450> stay<00:01:24.810> inflated<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.799> water<00:01:26.009> will

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
with my friends um we got like the lake

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.500 
with my friends um we got like the lake
or<00:03:56.620> whatever<00:03:56.830> it's<00:03:57.459> good<00:03:57.730> for<00:03:57.880> them<00:03:58.000> this

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
or whatever it's good for them this

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.460 
or whatever it's good for them this
retails<00:03:59.380> for<00:03:59.650> ten<00:04:00.220> dollars<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.910> then<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.660> 10

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
retails for ten dollars and then the 10

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.500 
retails for ten dollars and then the 10
ounce<00:04:02.620> retails<00:04:03.370> for<00:04:03.459> fifteen<00:04:03.940> dollars<00:04:04.269> and

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
ounce retails for fifteen dollars and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.199 
ounce retails for fifteen dollars and
then<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:04.690> think<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:06.070> can<00:04:06.220> get<00:04:06.340> too<00:04:06.700> many

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
then I think that you can get too many

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.180 
then I think that you can get too many
ones<00:04:07.510> are<00:04:07.690> like<00:04:07.720> 1.7<00:04:08.470> ounces<00:04:08.709> or<00:04:08.890> something

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
ones are like 1.7 ounces or something

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.100 
ones are like 1.7 ounces or something
and<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.700> think<00:04:09.910> it's<00:04:10.000> $12<00:04:10.570> for<00:04:10.750> those<00:04:10.870> tube

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
and I think it's $12 for those tube

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.600 
and I think it's $12 for those tube
which<00:04:11.290> I<00:04:11.380> don't<00:04:11.620> think<00:04:11.799> that's<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:12.430> good<00:04:12.549> of

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
which I don't think that's that good of

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.090 
which I don't think that's that good of
a<00:04:12.730> deal<00:04:12.910> because<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:14.470> whole<00:04:14.620> thing<00:04:14.799> about<00:04:14.920> the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
a deal because the whole thing about the

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.650 
a deal because the whole thing about the
minis<00:04:15.340> is<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.640> be<00:04:15.760> more<00:04:15.880> compact<00:04:16.299> but<00:04:16.540> this

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
minis is to be more compact but this

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.270 
minis is to be more compact but this
pretty<00:04:16.870> much<00:04:17.049> fits<00:04:17.320> in<00:04:17.440> any<00:04:17.590> space<00:04:17.859> i<00:04:18.010> really

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
pretty much fits in any space i really

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.920 
pretty much fits in any space i really
need<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:18.729> even<00:04:19.150> in<00:04:19.239> my<00:04:19.329> purse<00:04:19.510> or<00:04:19.690> whatever

like not apply that usually it would

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.529 
like not apply that usually it would
kind<00:04:55.550> of<00:04:55.610> start<00:04:55.819> to<00:04:55.909> move<00:04:56.090> around<00:04:56.120> all<00:04:56.509> over

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
kind of start to move around all over

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.620 
kind of start to move around all over
the<00:04:56.810> place<00:04:57.099> but<00:04:58.099> if<00:04:58.340> i<00:04:58.460> use<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.849> Evian<00:04:59.300> spray

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
the place but if i use the Evian spray

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.559 
the place but if i use the Evian spray
and<00:04:59.900> I<00:04:59.990> just<00:05:00.139> kind<00:05:00.319> of<00:05:00.380> spray<00:05:00.590> down<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.830> brush

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
and then I put the brush in there it

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.570 
and then I put the brush in there it
would<00:05:06.919> sort<00:05:07.130> of<00:05:07.220> just<00:05:07.430> like<00:05:09.310> apply<00:05:10.310> more

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
would sort of just like apply more

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.659 
would sort of just like apply more
nicely<00:05:12.190> like<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:13.310> see<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.550> difference

nicely like you see the difference

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.249 
nicely like you see the difference
between<00:05:14.060> okay<00:05:14.659> that's<00:05:14.840> where<00:05:14.960> it<00:05:15.020> was<00:05:15.110> before

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
between okay that's where it was before

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.409 
between okay that's where it was before
and<00:05:15.500> that's<00:05:15.800> where<00:05:15.949> it<00:05:16.009> is<00:05:16.099> now<00:05:16.310> like<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:17.210> see

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.969 
and that's where it is now like you see
the<00:05:17.509> difference<00:05:17.630> of<00:05:18.020> which<00:05:18.319> helped<00:05:18.620> apply<00:05:18.919> the

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
the difference of which helped apply the

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.589 
the difference of which helped apply the
pigment<00:05:19.639> better<00:05:19.789> this<00:05:20.060> is<00:05:20.120> way<00:05:20.569> more

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
pigment better this is way more

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.050 
pigment better this is way more
amplified<00:05:21.319> so<00:05:22.130> i<00:05:22.159> definitely<00:05:22.430> recommend<00:05:22.699> you

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
amplified so i definitely recommend you

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.189 
amplified so i definitely recommend you
while<00:05:23.180> checking<00:05:23.419> this<00:05:23.630> out<00:05:23.780> and<00:05:23.990> you<00:05:24.050> don't

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
while checking this out and you don't

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:25.899 
while checking this out and you don't
feel<00:05:24.349> like<00:05:24.440> spending<00:05:24.530> ten<00:05:24.889> dollars<00:05:25.220> on<00:05:25.490> water

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
feel like spending ten dollars on water

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.020 
feel like spending ten dollars on water
