that sounds silly but if you're not
going<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.410> play<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.040> game<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.370> win<00:02:50.630> there's<00:02:51.630> no

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
going to play the game to win there's no

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.890 
going to play the game to win there's no
point<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.400> I'd<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.390> think<00:02:54.570> that<00:02:54.630> we<00:02:54.780> can

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
point so I'd like to think that we can

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.720 
point so I'd like to think that we can
go<00:02:55.020> out<00:02:55.170> with<00:02:55.320> all<00:02:55.470> 60<00:02:55.830> games<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.250> know<00:02:56.340> that's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
go out with all 60 games I know that's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.990 
go out with all 60 games I know that's
not<00:02:56.880> going<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.180> happen<00:02:57.300> but<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.170> certainly<00:02:59.000> go

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
not going to happen but I certainly go

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.070 
not going to happen but I certainly go
into<00:03:00.300> each<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.570> every<00:03:00.720> game<00:03:00.870> with<00:03:01.020> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
into each and every game with the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.199 
into each and every game with the
expectation<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.680> we<00:03:01.800> we<00:03:02.490> will<00:03:02.700> win<00:03:02.940> and

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
expectation that we we will win and

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.420 
expectation that we we will win and
