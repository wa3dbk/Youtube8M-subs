is<00:00:11.880> gonna<00:00:12.240> be<00:00:12.330> quadrant<00:00:12.780> standard<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.769> this

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
is gonna be quadrant standard and this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.499 
is gonna be quadrant standard and this
is<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.309> speed<00:00:14.610> test<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:15.089> gonna<00:00:15.210> tell<00:00:15.420> you

right<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> next<00:00:43.950> test<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.340> gonna<00:00:44.430> be

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
right for the next test it's gonna be

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.900 
right for the next test it's gonna be
the<00:00:44.670> start<00:00:44.850> up<00:00:45.120> test<00:00:46.250> which<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.700> as

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the start up test which I get this as

00:00:47.910 --> 00:01:02.450 
the start up test which I get this as
fair<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.270> possible<00:01:00.890> all<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> note

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
fair as possible all right so the note

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.119 
fair as possible all right so the note
got<00:01:02.670> about<00:01:02.820> 23<00:01:03.270> 24<00:01:03.690> seconds<00:01:04.140> while<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
got about 23 24 seconds while the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.010 
got about 23 24 seconds while the
Samsung<00:01:05.519> Galaxy<00:01:05.640> 2<00:01:06.150> was<00:01:06.479> about<00:01:06.600> 3<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:06.900> 4

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
Samsung Galaxy 2 was about 3 or 4

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.350 
Samsung Galaxy 2 was about 3 or 4
seconds<00:01:07.409> off<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.760> also<00:01:08.880> tell<00:01:09.180> that

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
seconds off now you can also tell that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
seconds off now you can also tell that
the<00:01:09.479> processor<00:01:09.990> does<00:01:10.260> help<00:01:10.560> while<00:01:11.010> opening<00:01:11.369> up

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the processor does help while opening up

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.149 
the processor does help while opening up
simple<00:01:12.150> apps<00:01:12.330> such<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.750> calculating<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.950> no<00:01:14.100> 2

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
simple apps such as calculating the no 2

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.630 
simple apps such as calculating the no 2
tends<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> beat<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.689> all<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.560> them<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:17.580> we

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
tends to beat it in all of them now we

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.850 
tends to beat it in all of them now we
go<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> different<00:01:18.420> apps<00:01:18.570> open<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.740> camera<00:01:21.860> just

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
go to different apps open up camera just

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.690 
go to different apps open up camera just
a<00:01:22.920> little<00:01:23.189> bit<00:01:23.310> quicker<00:01:25.700> no<00:01:26.700> no<00:01:26.850> -<00:01:28.340> now<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> seem

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
a little bit quicker no no - now I seem

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.450 
a little bit quicker no no - now I seem
to<00:01:29.729> find<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:30.420> all<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.720> hips<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.079> here

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
to find this for all the hips on here

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.399 
to find this for all the hips on here
and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.549> also<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> -<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.900> internet

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and I also see that - on the internet

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.320 
and I also see that - on the internet
browser

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.790 

now<00:01:43.330> loading<00:01:43.690> up<00:01:43.780> pages<00:01:43.960> are<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.350> little<00:01:44.650> bit

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
now loading up pages are a little bit

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.260 
now loading up pages are a little bit
quicker<00:01:45.040> on<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.400> note<00:01:45.580> 2<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.970> that's<00:01:46.060> just

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
quicker on the note 2 and that's just

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.570 
quicker on the note 2 and that's just
because<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.540> LT<00:01:46.780> horizon<00:01:47.619> compared<00:01:48.460> to

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
because the LT horizon compared to

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.810 
because the LT horizon compared to
t-mobile's<00:01:49.119> Porgy<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.890> even<00:01:51.190> pinch-to-zoom

t-mobile's Porgy and even pinch-to-zoom

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.050 
t-mobile's Porgy and even pinch-to-zoom

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
seems to be a whole lot more fluent I'm

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.800 
seems to be a whole lot more fluent I'm
gonna<00:01:55.270> note<00:01:55.390> too

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
gonna note too

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.749 
gonna note too
but<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.380> is<00:01:56.619> still<00:01:56.800> pretty<00:01:56.950> fluent<00:01:57.400> on<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.610> S

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
but it is still pretty fluent on the S

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.510

are two great phones I noticed that

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.669 
are two great phones I noticed that
