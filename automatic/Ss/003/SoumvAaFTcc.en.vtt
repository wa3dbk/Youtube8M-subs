00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.450

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.790
 by brazil the truth was an experience 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.040
 pretty pretty thank you very much everyone 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.380

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.150
 and I back on the football grounds 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.520
 I thank each and every one of you 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.350
 for your support and above all for doing 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.270
 grow this soccer channel but good 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.859
 let's put the choro aside and we 'll 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.539
 give football who has not had a 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.010
 hand in hand against the goalkeeper who does not 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.050
 has failed a goal opportunity 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.789
 only against the goalkeeper so it is 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.559
 let's see some tips so that when 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.460
 face the goalie have a heads-up 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.229
 do not fuck it this is one of many 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.569
 solutions that you have in front of the goalkeeper 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:45.819
 if when you are going to face it you see that it came out 

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:45.819
 of more do not hesitate to try to pump sela 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.950
 Of course, to do this technique 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.900
 must be moving if you stop 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:05.360
 loses the surprise factor and comes the 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:07.430
 error and it is difficult for you to pump 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.470
 goalkeeper in motion tries to listen 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.060
 earth ela is a very easy movement 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.460
 you only have to paint the goalkeeper who 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.460
 you are going to throw and pum the ball 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.970
 This is the most used by players 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.590
 when facing the goalkeeper they make a series of 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.119
 tapes that lead the ball towards a 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.530
 side of the goalie so that with 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:46.720
 speed you win and put in golf sounds 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.789
 easy but if a goalkeeper knows or knows 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.189
 the forwards know that they will do this 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.610
 play then you must engineer cloth and 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.680
 think fast to get goal 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.350
 if the goalkeeper will hold you and I 'll hold you 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.500
 all the way one of two or ends 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.970
 stopping you the shot takes away the ball or 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.440
 you can use the clipping as the last 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.440
 option and achieve the coveted goal 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.709
 this technique is the simplest and you 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.959
 You want to pump it or beat it 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.900
 speed or make fun of it just 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.670
 get a goal and shoot there if you go 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.190
 facing the goalie and it's not very good 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.069
 mocking pumping the ball just throws and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.810
 Put it where you want because a doorman at 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.400
 time to check you or try to do 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.829
 everything possible so that he does not pass the ball 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.110
 many times in your mind you are thinking 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.720
 which one is going to do to me or where is it going to 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.329
 cheat or if you run and hit it or what 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.720
 be and what the goalie is thinking 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.579
 is you opted and you threw it and put it in 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.650
 you just have to be forward to know 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.790
 how to face the goalkeeper in any 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.099
 position that you play is going to serve you 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.840
 these tips but not only the 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.370
 individual technique or the good touch you 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.930
 they will help to score goals in a hand to 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.060
 hand how many times have you not seen a 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.099
 player who after making fun of 5 or 6 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.790
 rivals do not have legs to define 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.560
 in front of the goalkeeper 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.659
 you need enough leg power 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.280
 to define well in front of the goalkeeper 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.280
 that's why the forwards are so expensive 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.030
 this is a very simple exercise and very 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.310
 basic that will help you have legs at 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.620
 time to define and do not come dead 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.690
 in front of the goalkeeper 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.760
 go out with the ball from half court and 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.230
 try to mock the defense and get to 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.099
 enough legs to define 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.099
 in front of the frame 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.510
 practice this exercise several times and 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.490
 if possible with two defenses better 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.730
 to see how your legs are and your 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.730
 definition 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.090
