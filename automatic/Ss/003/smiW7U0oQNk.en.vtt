everyone<00:05:56.240> really<00:05:56.539> talks<00:05:56.810> about<00:05:56.960> but<00:05:57.349> that's

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:58.339 
everyone really talks about but that's

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:59.860 
everyone really talks about but that's
part<00:05:58.610> of<00:05:58.669> his<00:05:58.819> style<00:05:59.149> and<00:05:59.389> that's<00:05:59.629> one<00:05:59.839> thing

part of his style and that's one thing

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.010 
part of his style and that's one thing
that<00:06:00.139> makes<00:06:00.259> him<00:06:00.469> so<00:06:00.849> difficult<00:06:01.849> besides<00:06:02.539> his

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
that makes him so difficult besides his

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.469 
that makes him so difficult besides his
his<00:06:03.620> speed<00:06:03.919> and<00:06:03.949> his<00:06:04.099> reflexes<00:06:04.580> Manny

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
his speed and his reflexes Manny

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.490

Pacquiao<00:06:05.960> though<00:06:06.289> I<00:06:06.529> do<00:06:06.979> expect<00:06:07.520> him<00:06:07.879> to<00:06:08.500> catch

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
Pacquiao though I do expect him to catch

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.980 
Pacquiao though I do expect him to catch
Floyd<00:06:09.919> whenever<00:06:10.430> Floyd<00:06:10.789> is<00:06:10.969> on<00:06:11.479> the<00:06:11.810> ropes

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
Floyd whenever Floyd is on the ropes

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.869 
Floyd whenever Floyd is on the ropes
because<00:06:12.409> manny<00:06:12.680> throws<00:06:13.009> punches<00:06:13.610> from

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:13.879 
because manny throws punches from

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.899 
because manny throws punches from
awkward<00:06:14.330> angles<00:06:14.779> and<00:06:14.990> he<00:06:15.830> tends<00:06:16.129> to<00:06:16.279> faint<00:06:16.669> and

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
awkward angles and he tends to faint and

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.719 
awkward angles and he tends to faint and
I<00:06:17.000> think<00:06:17.060> that<00:06:17.449> if<00:06:17.810> he<00:06:17.960> faints<00:06:18.379> enough<00:06:18.680> it<00:06:18.949> can

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
I think that if he faints enough it can

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.809 
I think that if he faints enough it can
work<00:06:19.939> in<00:06:20.120> his<00:06:20.240> favor<00:06:20.800> Floyd<00:06:21.800> is<00:06:21.979> very<00:06:22.159> patient

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
work in his favor Floyd is very patient

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.360 
work in his favor Floyd is very patient
and<00:06:23.560> sometimes<00:06:24.560> he<00:06:24.710> can<00:06:24.800> be<00:06:24.860> a<00:06:24.949> little<00:06:25.099> too

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
and sometimes he can be a little too

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.550 
and sometimes he can be a little too
