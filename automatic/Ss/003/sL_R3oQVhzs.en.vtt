way out in deep space and I was told by

way out in deep space and I was told by
an<00:00:36.750> extremely<00:00:37.530> reliable<00:00:37.829> senior<00:00:38.790> military

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
ago he was told that on console 52 which

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.690 
ago he was told that on console 52 which
was<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.110> actual<00:00:49.110> number<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.250> console

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
was the actual number for that console

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
was the actual number for that console
at<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.850> time<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.110> very<00:00:52.320> compartmented

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
at the time that was very compartmented

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.029 
at the time that was very compartmented
and<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.460> secret<00:00:54.350> within<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.530> very<00:00:55.710> secret

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and very secret within a very secret

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.299 
and very secret within a very secret
facility<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> most<00:00:57.270> secret<00:00:57.690> area

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
facility this was the most secret area

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.160 
facility this was the most secret area
that<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.520> had<00:00:59.730> tracked<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.780> our<00:01:00.899> solar

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that they had tracked out in our solar

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.759 
that they had tracked out in our solar
system<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:02.030> object<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.359> 26<00:01:04.080> miles<00:01:04.409> in

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
system an object that was 26 miles in

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.280 
system an object that was 26 miles in
diameter<00:01:05.270> moving<00:01:06.270> quote<00:01:06.540> under<00:01:06.840> its<00:01:07.140> own

diameter moving quote under its own

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
diameter moving quote under its own
steam<00:01:07.490> this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> someone<00:01:08.939> who<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> from<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
steam this is someone who is from a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
steam this is someone who is from a
naval<00:01:09.750> intelligence<00:01:10.170> background<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
naval intelligence background and so

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.859 
naval intelligence background and so
kind<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.520> used<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.210> concept<00:01:12.600> at

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
kind of used that kind of concept at

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.450 
kind of used that kind of concept at
which<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.080> thought<00:01:13.229> was<00:01:13.350> kind<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> funny<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
which I thought was kind of funny to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.219 
which I thought was kind of funny to
describe<00:01:14.880> an<00:01:15.000> interstellar<00:01:15.420> vehicle<00:01:16.080> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
describe an interstellar vehicle of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.749 
describe an interstellar vehicle of
course<00:01:16.409> they're<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.560> using<00:01:16.950> steam<00:01:17.250> power

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
course they're not using steam power

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.719 
course they're not using steam power
like<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.270> still<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.189> concept<00:01:20.670> was

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
like we still do but but the concept was

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.090 
like we still do but but the concept was
that<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.119> clearly<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.080> natural<00:01:22.680> object

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that it was clearly not a natural object

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.730 
that it was clearly not a natural object
when<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.549> was<00:01:23.640> 26<00:01:24.150> miles<00:01:24.420> across<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.530> mean<00:01:25.650> this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
when it was 26 miles across I mean this

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
when it was 26 miles across I mean this
is<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.979> size<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.759> fairly<00:01:27.180> large<00:01:27.390> city

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
is the size of a fairly large city

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.280 
is the size of a fairly large city
floating<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:29.009> space<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.840> know<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
floating in space so we do know that

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.870 
floating in space so we do know that
these<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.619> been<00:01:31.740> imaged<00:01:32.220> by<00:01:32.369> our<00:01:32.610> deep<00:01:32.850> space

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
these have been imaged by our deep space

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.140 
these have been imaged by our deep space
network<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.470> DSN<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
network the DSN that that we have and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.609 
network the DSN that that we have and
that<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.540> been<00:01:36.689> imaged<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:37.380> systems

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
that it's been imaged on these systems

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.319 
that it's been imaged on these systems
and<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.030> had<00:01:39.329> these<00:01:39.600> kinds<00:01:40.170> of

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
and we have had these kinds of

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.600 
and we have had these kinds of
experiences<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.930> these<00:01:43.560> sorts<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.130> enormous

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
experiences with these sorts of enormous

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.480 
experiences with these sorts of enormous
deep<00:01:45.329> space<00:01:45.600> objects<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:46.950> we'll<00:01:47.700> send

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
deep space objects that then we'll send

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
deep space objects that then we'll send
orbs<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.820> objects<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.689> even<00:01:51.840> beings<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
orbs and objects and even beings on the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.490 
orbs and objects and even beings on the
ground<00:01:53.009> around<00:01:53.340> where<00:01:53.579> our<00:01:53.850> group<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.020> it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
ground around where our group is so it's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.560 
ground around where our group is so it's
out<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.979> space<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> atmosphere<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
out in space it's in the atmosphere and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.330 
out in space it's in the atmosphere and
then<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> ground<00:01:58.259> around<00:01:58.500> us<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> so

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
then it's on the ground around us and so

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.870 
then it's on the ground around us and so
it's<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.149> very<00:02:00.390> exciting<00:02:01.460> series<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.610> events

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it's a very exciting series of events

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.719 
it's a very exciting series of events
that<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.290> that<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.350> been<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:05.100> really

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that have that have been to really

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.520 
that have that have been to really
increase<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.360> frequency<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.049> intensity

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
increase in frequency and intensity

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.589 
increase in frequency and intensity
which<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.369> think<00:02:08.610> means<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.060> there's<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.300> lot

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
which I think means that there's a lot

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.819 
which I think means that there's a lot
of<00:02:09.750> changes<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.310> horizon
