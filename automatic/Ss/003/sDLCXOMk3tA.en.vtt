I<00:00:53.570> think<00:00:54.570> omgs<00:00:55.079> biggest<00:00:55.469> strength<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.860> their

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
I think omgs biggest strength is their

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.729 
I think omgs biggest strength is their
basic<00:00:56.640> mechanics<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:58.199> always<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
basic mechanics and they always have a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010 
basic mechanics and they always have a
strategy<00:00:59.219> prepared<00:00:59.760> for<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> game<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.809> for

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
strategy prepared for the game but for

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.380 
strategy prepared for the game but for
this<00:01:01.140> game<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:02.160> our<00:01:02.370> base<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.000> canis<00:01:03.239> were

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
this game I think our base in canis were

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.690 
this game I think our base in canis were
much<00:01:03.570> better<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.369> could<00:01:05.460> win<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
much better so I think we could win the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810 
much better so I think we could win the
game<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> your<00:01:07.350> direct<00:01:07.770> lane<00:01:08.010> opponent<00:01:08.250> was<00:01:08.610> go

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
game so your direct lane opponent was go

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
motor racing but um I agree that it is a

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.920 
motor racing but um I agree that it is a
turning<00:02:42.670> point<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:42.940> our<00:02:43.090> team<00:02:43.300> but<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.750> think

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
turning point for our team but I think

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.080 
turning point for our team but I think
it'd<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.860> bigger<00:02:45.160> turning<00:02:45.490> point<00:02:45.790> for<00:02:45.880> me

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
it'd be a bigger turning point for me

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.800 
it'd be a bigger turning point for me
also<00:02:46.480> because<00:02:47.610> I've<00:02:48.610> been<00:02:48.880> doing<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.600> well
