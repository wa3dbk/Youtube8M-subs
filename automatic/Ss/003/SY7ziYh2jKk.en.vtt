00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
i obviously could then go ahead and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.030 
i obviously could then go ahead and
spend<00:01:55.680> all<00:01:56.130> 10<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.810> jumbo<00:01:58.439> packs<00:01:58.770> now

rated<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.890> guess<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.369> could<00:02:05.579> still<00:02:05.850> have

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
rated I guess we could still have

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.850 
rated I guess we could still have
possibilities<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:06.869> fairly<00:02:07.229> decent<00:02:07.649> players
