00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
much more I play the game the more I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.380 
much more I play the game the more I
understand<00:01:15.420> how<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> adjust<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.890> shot<00:01:17.390> like

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
understand how to adjust your shot like

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.960 
understand how to adjust your shot like
for<00:01:18.659> example<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.189> people<00:01:20.790> always

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
for example you know people always

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.249 
for example you know people always
talked<00:01:21.299> about<00:01:21.390> reaches<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.619> game<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:24.259> reaches

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
talked about reaches a a game of reaches

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.350 
talked about reaches a a game of reaches
a<00:01:25.290> game<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.770> accuracy<00:01:26.280> well<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.240> really

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
a game of accuracy well I don't really

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.090 
a game of accuracy well I don't really
see<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.750> much<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.020> accuracy<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> game<00:01:29.070> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
see it so much as accuracy is a game of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.300 
see it so much as accuracy is a game of
understanding<00:01:29.850> where<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.090> reticle<00:01:30.509> is

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
understanding where your reticle is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.560 
understanding where your reticle is
because<00:01:32.310> I'm<00:01:32.460> not<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.759> aiming<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.390> any

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
because I'm not really aiming for any

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.910 
because I'm not really aiming for any
particular<00:01:34.049> part<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> guy<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.890> just

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
particular part of the guy I'm just

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.410 
particular part of the guy I'm just
aiming<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.460> hit<00:01:35.610> him<00:01:35.759> anywhere<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> body

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
aiming to hit him anywhere on the body

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.870 
aiming to hit him anywhere on the body
and<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.439> fact<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.829> people<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.520> take<00:01:38.670> so

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and the fact is people you can take so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.219 
and the fact is people you can take so
many<00:01:39.060> hits<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.720> people<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:40.049> more

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
many hits and that people are more

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.569 
many hits and that people are more
likely<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.740> come<00:01:40.860> out<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.220> give<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
likely to come out and give you that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.630 
likely to come out and give you that
shot<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.780> opposed<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> Call<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.590> Duty<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
shot as opposed to Call of Duty so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.160 
shot as opposed to Call of Duty so
accuracy<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> don't<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:45.659> see<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> being

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
accuracy I don't really see it being

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.219 
accuracy I don't really see it being
that<00:01:46.380> much<00:01:46.619> different<00:01:47.009> than<00:01:47.040> Call<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.310> Duty

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
that much different than Call of Duty

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.450 
that much different than Call of Duty
staying<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.380> target<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> little

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
staying on target you got do it a little

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.639 
staying on target you got do it a little
bit<00:01:50.549> more<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.000> you'll<00:01:51.960> lose<00:01:52.170> some<00:01:52.200> gunfights

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
bit more and you'll lose some gunfights

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.219 
bit more and you'll lose some gunfights
occasionally<00:01:53.220> from<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> most

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
occasionally from that but for the most

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.200 
occasionally from that but for the most
part

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
part

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.030 
part
it's<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.290> different<00:01:58.620> skill<00:01:58.800> set<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:01.710> is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
it's just a different skill set this is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.680 
it's just a different skill set this is
uh<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.970> new<00:02:03.090> game<00:02:03.300> types<00:02:03.480> it

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
uh this is one of the new game types it

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.090 
uh this is one of the new game types it
brung<00:02:03.870> it<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.080> think<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.410> old<00:02:04.590> game<00:02:04.830> type

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
brung it I think is the old game type

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.860 
brung it I think is the old game type
butts<00:02:05.310> new<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.580> me<00:02:05.730> since<00:02:06.060> my<00:02:06.210> first<00:02:06.390> head

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
since the last one and uh but it's well

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.390

it's called I think it's going crazy
king<00:02:14.790> or<00:02:15.030> king<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> hill<00:02:15.990> whatever<00:02:16.410> it's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
king or king of the hill whatever it's

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.450 
king or king of the hill whatever it's
called<00:02:16.680> before<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.890> go<00:02:20.040> against<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
called before and to go against the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.870 
called before and to go against the
grain<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:21.180> kind<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.440> AR

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
grain here I kind of like the AR

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.330 
grain here I kind of like the AR
sections<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.060> maps<00:02:24.240> more<00:02:24.660> than<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.020> DMR<00:02:25.500> I'll

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
sections and maps more than the DMR I'll

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.980 
sections and maps more than the DMR I'll
get<00:02:26.460> me<00:02:26.550> wrong<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.820> love<00:02:27.000> using<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.450> DMR<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
get me wrong I love using the DMR in the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.650 
get me wrong I love using the DMR in the
needle<00:02:28.230> rifle<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.670> understand<00:02:30.510> they're

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
needle rifle but I understand they're

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.510 
needle rifle but I understand they're
actually<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.110> maps<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.190> pick<00:02:32.370> them

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
actually in the maps and I can pick them

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.480 
actually in the maps and I can pick them
up<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.450> seems<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.900> AR<00:02:34.490> variations

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
up and it seems like the AR variations

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.270 
up and it seems like the AR variations
of<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> game<00:02:35.730> modes<00:02:36.120> makes<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.660> game<00:02:36.840> more

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
of the game modes makes the game more

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.680 
of the game modes makes the game more
fast-paced<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.850> know<00:02:38.940> exciting<00:02:39.570> as

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
fast-paced and you know exciting as

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.040 
fast-paced and you know exciting as
opposed<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.830> everybody<00:02:41.730> having<00:02:42.240> DMR's<00:02:42.750> where

opposed to everybody having DMR's where

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.350 
opposed to everybody having DMR's where
it's<00:02:43.200> more<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.670> mid-range<00:02:44.670> long<00:02:45.090> range

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
it's more of a mid-range long range

front of it and trying to put myself in
between<00:06:47.039> me<00:06:47.399> and<00:06:47.699> their<00:06:47.909> grenade<00:06:48.239> spots

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
between me and their grenade spots

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:49.669 
between me and their grenade spots
