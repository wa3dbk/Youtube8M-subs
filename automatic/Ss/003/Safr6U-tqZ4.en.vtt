00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.280
 good morning the recipe that we are going to 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.690
 prepare today you will see that it is super easy 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.859
 to do pretty fast and with nothing of 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.650
 ingredients we are going to prepare some 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.289
 delicious potato chips in the microwave 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.289
 to do it we're going to need potatoes 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.000
 I have one already cut and one without 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.130
 cut to show how salt is made 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.480
 role of this furnace or if since 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:46.710
 It's silicone suitable for the microwave and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.420
 as you can see nothing else to do it in 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.020
 First, what we are going to do is 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.820
 cut the potato to see you can do it from 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.289
 different ways you can do it by cutting 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.010
 the with mandolin has to be a 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.989
 Very thin potato is worth it or if you do not have 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.390
 you can do it by hand like the mandolin 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.589
 8 I can also do with some 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.680
 kind of 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.560
 peeler as you go better 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.940
 to cut it on everything we cut it 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.940
 we are very finite 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.659
 and we're cutting it into sheets 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.930
 first companies give more smaller 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.399
 but the closer we get to the center 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.399
 bigger will come out 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.510
 you see bigger and bigger 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.640
 this if you have the mandolin for the ac 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.450
 declaring faster but I like not the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.469
 I have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.469
 by the hand 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.630
 well we already have the potato cut thin 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.509
 once the potatoes are cut we will take 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.509
 the microwave dish 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.670
 and cut it we will cut the paper to the size 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.670
 of the plate 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.080
 once we adapt the following is 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.950
 go placing the 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.950
 potatoes 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.879
 you can also do it for example in what 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.360
 what is the dish or take advantage if your 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.910
 microwave brings it the grid that comes 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.950
 for the new microwaves with grill and 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.950
 So you do it because it is of more quantity 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.680
 As you can see I have reused 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.460
 I used in the grid and so I will 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.360
 at two heights 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.710
 now we will microwave it to 800 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.700
 watts if your microwave is over 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.530
 more power 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.140
 then you should lower it a little 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.040
 a little bit like it is in the case of mine 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.299
 then everything depends on the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.959
 of the power of your microwave are 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:27.260
 approximately 710 minutes to about 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.799
 800 watts then when we bring a few 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:36.400
 5 or 6 minutes we look at it to see how 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.400
 we have stayed and we put more time 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.310
 the first 5 minutes have already passed and 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.200
 As you can see, it starts to be 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.420
 toast it is not necessary to remove it 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.689
 I do so that you may know how you have 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.849
 And now we'll leave left because of 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.849
 moment three more minutes and from 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.379
 there we will look good here you have them 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.209
 at each microwave outlet 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.280
 At the beginning there are a few 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.040
 you will notice a little bit common as a 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:13.480
 they will instruct still they would seem raw 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:16.830
 ok but nothing to wait 30 seconds 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.830
 you see that we have been left 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.180
 super crunchy 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.260
 At the end of the post we sealed 54 minutes 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.860
 more and as you can see this is the result 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.860
 now we will use a little salt 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.380
 and we have them ready to serve 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.390
 good and here you have ours 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.850
 delicious chips without anything 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.240
 oil we have been super crispy 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.190
 and they have been made in a jiffy to see 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.670
 you can do much more of this 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:56.210
 It depends on what you want but good 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.530
 it depends on the capacity of your 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.020
 your microwave would have to 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:04.199
 do it in two or three runs but 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.550
 As you can see, it has no difficulty. 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:11.009
 have it a few minutes in the microwave and 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:14.280
 some chips or chips because in 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.889
 this case are not natural healthy fries 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.259
 and delicious I hope you liked it 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.900

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:25.550
 you give me I like to be grateful and we 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.550
 we see in the next video greeting
