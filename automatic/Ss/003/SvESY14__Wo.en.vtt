00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:18.960
 arrived from training all the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:23.130
 wash the helmet but not with it here 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.220
 right to clean a helmet you not be 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.050
 nothing more than a cloth a sponge and a 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.580
 shampoo of your choice 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.529
 you should not use any product 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.050
 to clean the helmet or 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.260
 inside and out that can attack the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.200
 protections up to that gloss of this 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.570
 protects Styrofoam and cleaning is very 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.820
 simple with a little water and a 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.129
 bit of shampoo you are going through a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.070
 sponge in all parts including the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.730
 part of Styrofoam and then rinse places 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.730
 to stay in the shade 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.410
 to do a more effective cleaning in case 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.540
 of the helmet never used you can use 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.150
 warm water with a little vinegar that is 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.760
 bactericide and that strange smell of 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.260
 vinegar comes out after it is 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.440
 dry, no problem 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.380
 and I usually wear a helmet and everything 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.810
 in the shower every four drills I go 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.300
 To the bath with my helmet already washed it 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.729
 whole there during the bath and put the ck 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.979
 and so it gets a better smell 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.050
 because no one can take it afterwards is the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.570
 cat even freaks when he sees a helmet 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.600
 that smell and to make that smell 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.600
 I do not usually start these 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.660
 foam protections because I think 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.490
 damage here is one in a covering fabric 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.009
 a foam of so much to take can 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.649
 end up taking off the foam is exposed 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.600
 so I enter the bank still 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.030
 same shot of the head and had a 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.880
 I remove nothing for you to do the cleaning 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.830
 was to maintain this original brightness 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.570
 use only a damp cloth not to use 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.570
 alcohol or bleach 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.609
 I hope you have enjoyed those 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.140
 tips 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.239

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.950
 explains how to properly adjust your 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.000
 helmet and we see each other around 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.000

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:37.620
