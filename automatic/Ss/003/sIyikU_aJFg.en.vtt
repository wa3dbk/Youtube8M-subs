is basically how the enjoyment but how

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.670 
is basically how the enjoyment but how
it<00:01:54.509> works<00:01:54.720> first<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.140> all<00:01:55.229> let's<00:01:55.409> say<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> want

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
it works first of all let's say I want

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.670 
it works first of all let's say I want
to<00:01:55.770> fire<00:01:56.340> protect<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.000> chest<00:01:57.689> plate<00:01:57.930> very

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
to fire protect this chest plate very

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.350 
to fire protect this chest plate very
very<00:01:58.979> important<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.520> actually<00:01:59.729> have<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
very important that I actually have the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480 
very important that I actually have the
chest<00:02:00.659> plate<00:02:00.899> selected<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.860> my<00:02:02.040> hand<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
chest plate selected and in my hand and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.929 
chest plate selected and in my hand and
then<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.119> hit<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.890> button<00:02:05.549> over<00:02:05.909> there

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
then I just hit the button over there

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.340 
then I just hit the button over there
and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.299> you'll<00:02:06.420> see<00:02:06.659> enchanting

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and then you'll see enchanting

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.169 
and then you'll see enchanting
successful<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.399> if<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:08.700> go<00:02:08.910> you'll<00:02:09.090> see

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
successful so if I now go you'll see

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.969 
successful so if I now go you'll see
that<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.539> now<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> chest<00:02:10.289> plate<00:02:10.440> with<00:02:10.739> fire

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that I now have a chest plate with fire

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.090 
that I now have a chest plate with fire
protection<00:02:11.190> for

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
protection for

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.790 
protection for
I<00:02:13.160> don't<00:02:14.000> think<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.540> do<00:02:14.690> blast<00:02:15.320> prediction

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
I don't think I can do blast prediction

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.530 
I don't think I can do blast prediction
so<00:02:15.980> you'll<00:02:16.190> see<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.520> I<00:02:16.610> can't<00:02:16.910> combine<00:02:17.120> blast

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
so you'll see that I can't combine blast

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.720 
so you'll see that I can't combine blast
protection<00:02:18.050> with<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.710> fire<00:02:19.130> protection<00:02:19.520> and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
protection with the fire protection and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.990 
protection with the fire protection and
I<00:02:20.210> can't<00:02:20.510> do<00:02:20.780> projectile<00:02:21.380> either<00:02:21.890> yeah<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:22.940> I

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
I can't do projectile either yeah so I

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.080 
I can't do projectile either yeah so I
can<00:02:23.030> t<00:02:23.300> predict<00:02:23.600> I'll<00:02:23.780> either<00:02:25.090> respiration

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
can t predict I'll either respiration

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.870 
can t predict I'll either respiration
for<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.690> falling<00:02:27.250> okay<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.520> can't<00:02:28.760> actually

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
for the falling okay so I can't actually

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.460 
for the falling okay so I can't actually
do<00:02:29.060> anything<00:02:29.110> else<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:31.100> don't<00:02:31.520> know<00:02:31.670> why<00:02:31.850> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
do anything else I don't know why the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.070 
do anything else I don't know why the
I'm<00:02:33.470> having<00:02:33.740> trouble<00:02:34.130> actually<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:35.390> making

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
I'm having trouble actually of making

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.340 
I'm having trouble actually of making
the<00:02:36.250> protection<00:02:37.250> its<00:02:37.400> self<00:02:37.760> work<00:02:38.090> because<00:02:38.840> the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
the protection its self work because the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.580 
the protection its self work because the
actual<00:02:40.090> code<00:02:41.090> for<00:02:41.120> protection<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.020> zero<00:02:42.350> and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
actual code for protection is zero and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.140 
actual code for protection is zero and
it<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.890> doesn't<00:02:43.130> want<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.460> just<00:02:43.790> doesn't

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
it just doesn't want it just doesn't

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.000 
it just doesn't want it just doesn't
want<00:02:44.270> to<00:02:44.330> take<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.110> I'll<00:02:45.530> get<00:02:45.710> back<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:45.890> you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
want to take it so I'll get back to you

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.280 
want to take it so I'll get back to you
guys<00:02:46.040> on<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.370> one<00:02:46.520> so<00:02:47.390> let's<00:02:47.630> show<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:48.080> that

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
guys on that one so let's show you that

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.470 
guys on that one so let's show you that
the<00:02:48.410> rest<00:02:48.620> also<00:02:48.830> works<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.430> list<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.730> projectile

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
the rest also works a list of projectile

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.230 
the rest also works a list of projectile
protection<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:52.520> if<00:02:52.610> we<00:02:52.730> go<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.030> we<00:02:53.090> have<00:02:53.120> a

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
protection so if we go and we have a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.640 
protection so if we go and we have a
look<00:02:53.450> we<00:02:53.630> now<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:53.990> projectile<00:02:54.470> protection

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
look we now have projectile protection

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.650 
look we now have projectile protection
so<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.430> can<00:02:55.700> actually<00:02:55.790> go<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.090> custom<00:02:56.510> now

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
so I can actually go and custom now

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.440 
so I can actually go and custom now
customize<00:02:57.290> my<00:02:57.710> my<00:02:58.930> my<00:03:00.460> armor<00:03:01.460> and<00:03:01.670> weaponry

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
customize my my my armor and weaponry

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.290 
customize my my my armor and weaponry
so<00:03:02.690> next<00:03:03.020> feather<00:03:03.680> falling<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.310> boots<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.150> if<00:03:05.240> I

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
so next feather falling is boots so if I

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.880 
so next feather falling is boots so if I
just<00:03:05.420> work<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.170> feather<00:03:06.410> falling<00:03:06.680> on

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
just work on the feather falling on

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.350 
just work on the feather falling on
boots<00:03:07.130> you'll<00:03:07.430> now<00:03:07.610> see<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.090> have<00:03:10.360> feather

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
boots you'll now see that I have feather

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.420 
boots you'll now see that I have feather
falling<00:03:11.660> on<00:03:11.900> my<00:03:12.050> boot<00:03:12.230> feather<00:03:12.860> falling<00:03:13.100> for

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
falling on my boot feather falling for

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.100 
falling on my boot feather falling for
and<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:14.090> now<00:03:14.300> can<00:03:14.480> actually<00:03:14.540> choose<00:03:14.870> one<00:03:15.080> of

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
and I now can actually choose one of

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.540 
and I now can actually choose one of
these<00:03:15.260> as<00:03:15.470> well<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:15.830> I'm<00:03:15.980> actually<00:03:16.160> gonna<00:03:16.370> go

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
these as well so I'm actually gonna go

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.260 
these as well so I'm actually gonna go
fire<00:03:17.000> protection<00:03:17.680> right<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.940> you'll<00:03:20.090> now<00:03:20.240> see

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
fire protection right so you'll now see

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.480 
fire protection right so you'll now see
that<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:20.990> feather<00:03:21.500> falling<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.130> fire

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
that I have feather falling and fire

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.580 
that I have feather falling and fire
protection<00:03:22.700> how<00:03:23.420> awesome<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.230> that

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
protection how awesome is that

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.830 
protection how awesome is that
next<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.430> helmet<00:03:25.820> so<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.330> actually<00:03:26.450> put<00:03:26.600> my

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
next is helmet so I can actually put my

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.810 
next is helmet so I can actually put my
respiration<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.010> helmet<00:03:28.340> which<00:03:28.490> means<00:03:28.700> I

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
respiration on the helmet which means I

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.720 
respiration on the helmet which means I
can<00:03:29.000> breathe<00:03:29.300> underwater<00:03:29.810> but<00:03:30.290> easier<00:03:30.770> so<00:03:31.490> if

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
can breathe underwater but easier so if

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.550 
can breathe underwater but easier so if
I<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:32.120> go<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:32.420> you'll<00:03:32.570> see<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.140> now<00:03:33.380> have

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
I just go and you'll see that I now have

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.860 
I just go and you'll see that I now have
respiration<00:03:34.190> but<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.580> can<00:03:34.760> also<00:03:35.030> combine<00:03:35.480> that

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
respiration but I can also combine that

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.130 
respiration but I can also combine that
with<00:03:35.930> affinity<00:03:36.680> equi<00:03:37.340> affinity<00:03:37.880> which<00:03:38.840> just

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
with affinity equi affinity which just

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.710 
with affinity equi affinity which just
basically<00:03:39.260> means<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.550> will<00:03:40.790> there<00:03:41.420> we<00:03:41.540> go

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
basically means that it will there we go

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.130 
basically means that it will there we go
it<00:03:41.960> will<00:03:42.410> not<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:43.760> will<00:03:44.090> be<00:03:44.210> as<00:03:44.360> if<00:03:44.480> I'm<00:03:44.660> not<00:03:44.870> in

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
it will not it will be as if I'm not in

so let's take this one here so it's a

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.659 
so let's take this one here so it's a
command<00:06:14.990> block<00:06:15.199> and<00:06:15.379> the<00:06:15.830> command<00:06:16.159> really<00:06:16.550> is

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
command block and the command really is

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.749 
command block and the command really is
enchant<00:06:17.270> ad<00:06:18.020> player<00:06:18.589> and<00:06:18.979> then<00:06:19.490> you<00:06:19.580> need<00:06:19.729> to

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
enchant ad player and then you need to

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.689 
enchant ad player and then you need to
either<00:06:20.360> choose<00:06:20.960> a<00:06:21.020> select<00:06:21.469> a<00:06:21.589> region<00:06:22.190> or<00:06:22.580> you

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
can if you want to maybe sell this you

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.339 
can if you want to maybe sell this you
can<00:06:24.529> actually<00:06:24.620> had<00:06:24.889> ad<00:06:25.550> XP<00:06:26.270> so<00:06:26.810> you<00:06:26.870> can<00:06:27.169> just

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
select which player so you can really

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.089 
select which player so you can really
fine-tune<00:06:29.539> which<00:06:29.990> player<00:06:30.319> actually<00:06:30.620> receive

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
fine-tune which player actually receive

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.790 
fine-tune which player actually receive
this<00:06:31.339> so<00:06:31.610> receives<00:06:32.000> this<00:06:32.180> then<00:06:32.900> next<00:06:33.289> the

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
this so receives this then next the

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.610 
this so receives this then next the
number<00:06:34.279> is<00:06:34.460> the<00:06:34.879> number<00:06:34.909> of<00:06:35.569> the<00:06:35.930> enchantment

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
number is the number of the enchantment

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.339 
number is the number of the enchantment
so<00:06:37.180> number<00:06:38.180> one<00:06:38.330> enchantment<00:06:38.930> is<00:06:39.080> fire

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.349 
so number one enchantment is fire

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:41.170 
so number one enchantment is fire
protection

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.840 
protection
and<00:06:41.510> then<00:06:41.720> the<00:06:42.170> level<00:06:42.650> of<00:06:42.860> it<00:06:43.100> so<00:06:43.310> this<00:06:43.460> level

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
and then the level of it so this level

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.730 
and then the level of it so this level
