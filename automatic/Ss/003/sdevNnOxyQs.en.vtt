shocks are quite common and they work
very<00:00:09.420> well<00:00:09.660> but<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.769> small<00:00:11.070> amount<00:00:11.309> of

anything to get it out this eliminates

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.400 
anything to get it out this eliminates
the<00:02:54.000> risk<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.570> scratching<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.080> ceiling

underneath the upper eyelet to make it

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.740 
underneath the upper eyelet to make it
easier<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.520> see<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.030> could<00:03:00.180> pull<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> silver

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
easier to see you could pull the silver

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
will lubricate everything overtime and

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.580 
will lubricate everything overtime and

the air sleeve and the a pilot this is

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.190 
the air sleeve and the a pilot this is
because<00:06:17.790> of<00:06:17.940> negative<00:06:18.419> air<00:06:18.600> pressure<00:06:18.630> that

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
because of negative air pressure that

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.780 
because of negative air pressure that
was<00:06:19.290> trapped<00:06:19.590> in<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.860> shock<00:06:20.100> during<00:06:20.610> the

was trapped in the shock during the
rebuild<00:06:21.240> now<00:06:21.870> when<00:06:22.050> trick<00:06:22.260> to<00:06:22.380> make<00:06:22.500> this

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
rebuild now when trick to make this

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.590 
rebuild now when trick to make this
easier<00:06:23.040> is<00:06:23.280> to<00:06:23.340> dial<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.090> rebound<00:06:24.419> to<00:06:24.570> the

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
easier is to dial the rebound to the

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.690 
easier is to dial the rebound to the
full<00:06:24.840> closed<00:06:25.200> position<00:06:25.770> and<00:06:25.950> then<00:06:26.430> fully

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
full closed position and then fully

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.400 
full closed position and then fully
compress<00:06:27.150> the<00:06:27.300> shock<00:06:27.570> before<00:06:27.900> you<00:06:28.169> try<00:06:28.350> to

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
compress the shock before you try to

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.380 
compress the shock before you try to
engage<00:06:28.590> those<00:06:28.950> threads<00:06:29.250> this<00:06:29.940> will<00:06:30.120> give<00:06:30.270> you

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
engage those threads this will give you

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.230 
engage those threads this will give you
enough<00:06:30.600> time<00:06:30.870> to<00:06:30.900> screw<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:31.590> two<00:06:31.740> together

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
enough time to screw the two together

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.370 
enough time to screw the two together
now<00:06:33.240> it's<00:06:33.360> important<00:06:33.690> to<00:06:33.720> remember<00:06:33.840> that<00:06:34.260> that

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
now it's important to remember that that
