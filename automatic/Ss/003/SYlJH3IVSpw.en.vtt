if<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.459> was<00:04:03.549> me<00:04:03.730> I'd<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:03.970> running<00:04:04.269> straight

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
if it was me I'd be running straight

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.650 
if it was me I'd be running straight
into<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:06.519> building<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.180> then<00:04:07.329> try<00:04:07.569> and

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
into that that building and then try and

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.970 
into that that building and then try and
head<00:04:07.810> behind<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.260> red<00:04:08.410> dots<00:04:08.650> all<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:08.889> way

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
head behind the red dots all the way

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.099 
head behind the red dots all the way
over<00:04:09.160> there<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.370> get<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.940> kill<00:04:10.329> but<00:04:10.930> that

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
over there to get the kill but that

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.599 
over there to get the kill but that
might<00:04:11.290> not<00:04:11.319> be<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.530> best<00:04:11.980> idea<00:04:12.069> he<00:04:12.370> seems<00:04:12.519> to

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
might not be the best idea he seems to

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.050 
might not be the best idea he seems to
be<00:04:12.670> sticking<00:04:13.060> back<00:04:13.239> with<00:04:13.540> his<00:04:13.690> team<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:15.060> here

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
be sticking back with his team and here

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.610 
be sticking back with his team and here
his<00:04:16.150> teammates<00:04:16.479> re-engage<00:04:16.930> we<00:04:17.139> shouldn't<00:04:17.500> run

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
his teammates re-engage we shouldn't run

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.259 
his teammates re-engage we shouldn't run
in<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.979> pick<00:04:18.250> up<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.489> kill<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.849> actually<00:04:19.180> get

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
in and pick up a kill and actually get

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.789 
in and pick up a kill and actually get
the<00:04:19.329> Mobe<00:04:19.599> so<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:19.930> probably<00:04:20.229> was<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.440> better

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
the Mobe so that probably was the better

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.629 
the Mobe so that probably was the better
decision<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.729> do<00:04:21.880> in<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.510> moment<00:04:22.750> so

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
decision to do in that moment so

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.040 
decision to do in that moment so
interesting<00:04:24.639> there's<00:04:24.940> already<00:04:25.180> a<00:04:25.510> difference

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
interesting there's already a difference

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.920 
interesting there's already a difference
within<00:04:26.260> seconds<00:04:26.919> of<00:04:26.979> jumping<00:04:27.430> on<00:04:27.550> board<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.060> I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
within seconds of jumping on board and I

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.450 
within seconds of jumping on board and I
wouldn't<00:04:29.289> quite<00:04:29.320> run<00:04:29.680> out<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:29.979> how<00:04:30.250> do<00:04:30.310> you

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
going for but it's particularly hard

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.810 
going for but it's particularly hard
when<00:04:46.630> you're<00:04:46.750> playing<00:04:46.930> in<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.170> full<00:04:47.350> part<00:04:47.620> a

running the portable radar which is

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.240 
running the portable radar which is
interesting<00:04:50.440> I've<00:04:50.890> always<00:04:51.070> preferred

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
interesting I've always preferred

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.580 
interesting I've always preferred
concussion<00:04:51.910> grenades<00:04:52.180> just<00:04:52.480> because<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:53.020> like

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
concussion grenades just because I like

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
to be able to do stunts checks just

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.670 
to be able to do stunts checks just
throw<00:04:55.150> stones<00:04:55.480> into<00:04:55.660> areas<00:04:56.110> before<00:04:56.260> me<00:04:56.560> just

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
throw stones into areas before me just

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.380 
throw stones into areas before me just
to<00:04:56.860> kind<00:04:57.400> of<00:04:57.460> gauge<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:57.970> see<00:04:58.150> if<00:04:58.240> they're

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
to kind of gauge and see if they're

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.570 
to kind of gauge and see if they're
actually<00:04:58.900> anyone<00:04:59.350> there<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.530> kill<00:04:59.920> but

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
actually anyone there to kill but

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.990 
actually anyone there to kill but
nonetheless<00:05:01.830> actually<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.100> does<00:05:03.520> look<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:03.970> be

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
nonetheless actually it does look to be

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.160 
nonetheless actually it does look to be
quite<00:05:04.240> useful<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.660> you<00:05:04.750> knows<00:05:04.870> where<00:05:05.020> all
