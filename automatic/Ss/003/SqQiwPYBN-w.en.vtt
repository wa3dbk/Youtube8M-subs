can't believe this car weighs 4,000
pounds

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040

it's<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:34.030> fast<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.569> breaking<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.049> that

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
it's that fast the breaking is that

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.860 
it's that fast the breaking is that
amazing<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.159> series<00:02:36.580> is<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.700> good

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
amazing and the series is that good

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.020

laughs<00:02:39.870> hang<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.319> us<00:02:40.500> probably<00:02:41.189> not<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
laughs hang with us probably not the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.759 
laughs hang with us probably not the
Cadillac<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.510> think<00:02:42.720> it's<00:02:42.840> oddly<00:02:43.170> thin<00:02:43.409> design

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
Cadillac I think it's oddly thin design

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.319 
Cadillac I think it's oddly thin design
for<00:02:44.010> people<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.519> mean<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.879> don't<00:02:44.939> want<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.209> say

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
for people I mean I don't want to say

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.649 
for people I mean I don't want to say
this<00:02:45.450> all<00:02:45.659> gold<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.409> his<00:02:46.650> age<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.939> hair

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
this all gold but of his age and hair

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.899 
this all gold but of his age and hair
color<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.590> think<00:02:49.920> he's<00:02:50.040> probably<00:02:50.220> gonna<00:02:50.700> fit

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909
