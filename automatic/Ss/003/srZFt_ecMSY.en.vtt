 Today I would like to introduce one of our Film the Cat Dogs to you 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:31.249
 Serra is a half year old mixed breed dog it is a bit out 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.350
 call such a downed muzzle with basketball player and this crooked 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.100
 His legs cause him some problems that is he has a slight deformity 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.820
 on the front left foot 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.800
 that does not hinder him yet, but of course that can be done with increasing 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.310
 Age leads to problems Serra is a very clever Likes same and 2 the arms 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.980
 alive around and playing with everything that gets in his way 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.080
 however, due to his disability, he should rather be calmer 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.870
 Employment opportunities are utilized for this serves the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.190

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.510
 steer stressful activities such as quick retrieving or on the bike

 but very hard print 22 pounds on the scales and this spot would jump 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.830
 Of course, his legs burden overall is a very friendly and 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.970
 Also a very human-related dog should not work to smaller ones 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.430
 Children because he is much charged for energy 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.280
 with Open he is quite well tolerated one or the other complaints he seeks 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.420
