00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
intervals requires a lot of

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.980 
intervals requires a lot of
concentration<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.390> really<00:01:48.140> melting<00:01:48.830> of<00:01:49.070> this

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
concentration and really melting of this

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.630 
concentration and really melting of this
three<00:01:52.600> contrasting<00:01:53.600> parts<00:01:54.170> at<00:01:54.680> every<00:01:55.160> at<00:01:55.430> each

actually<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:27.550> legatus<00:03:27.820> or<00:03:28.090> not<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.480> very<00:03:28.750> very

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
actually the legatus or not is very very

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.580
