00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.180
 Hi there, this is the third release of answers 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.049
 developers questions players 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.760
 he came out so late because 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.960
 the developer is very rare for some reason 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.070
 answers the questions 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.080
 although there is a minimum for it 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.820
 half a dozen community managers note 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.770
 my commitment is not fulfilled somehow 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.109
 I rarely know what I donâ€™t do but 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.480
 since we are lucky that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.340
 recently did not answer the questions let's 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.570
 analyze and find out what 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.640
 interesting can tell 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.199
 the developer will skip immediately the answer to 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.779
 common questions that repeat 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.730
 constantly here we see from interesting 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.030
 got people ask when fixed bug 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.250
 that i am a very low gi 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.410
 break through and even puts it at zero strength 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.360
 answer that the mechanics of the poison will change it 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.820
 quite funny because the problem 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.469
 known developer did not set the condition 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.660
 that trick can go into minus 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.850
 instead of putting it 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.480
 restriction they decided to change the mechanics 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.250
 and damages 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.110
 what not to do so trick is not 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.480
 may become negative i am not 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.670
 the balance is also understandable 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.739
 ask why money and so fast 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.780
 blown away all answer that up to spruce 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.700
 rewards will not be blown away 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 mind saw it that far were 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.240
 normal only the first week 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.710
 and then there was a solid gloom and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.510
 monotony they are really very 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310
 quickly blown away and developer one 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.229
 loudly announced that they are finally 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 entered the daily task of the task 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.850
 absolutely not thought out excluded horribly 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.650
 not shaft worked on assignments on these 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.570
 weekend and really corrected gave 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.810
 random talents and the golden age 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.759
 but you can do it all the time 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.159
 one week interesting assignments then 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.500
 shove every slag like 10,000 resources 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.329
 with the same type of tasks further steve 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.460
 tells that the foot no longer has 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.799
 such as the survival had earlier this 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.570
 the balance suits them quite funny 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.500
 because I made out, too, you changed 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.439
 on i'm methane 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.720
 with 300 articles changed about theft 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.149
 by 20 if this steve is called strong 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.520
 press and survival they are again 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.680
 sorry for the balance of the game and that's what we still see 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.930
 interesting what he have they plan 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.180
 change the prices of the bundles that they are now 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.009
 are actively working on the economy and in 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.840
 principle, we ourselves have seen how they work 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.700
 over the economy it is almost every 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.649
 week introduces some kind of share to people 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.569
 more donati in my opinion now 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.120
 developer trying to make the most 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.590
 I donâ€™t even know my players why 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.569
 caught up sharply but if you 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.640
 look now concentration of stocks 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.370
 very big and where are they going 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.599
 so you spend all your stocks afterwards 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.580
 to take advantage of the stock you 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.410
 I had to donate if I honestly do not believe 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.519
 that the developer is seriously engaged 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.040
 game economics 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.230
 further from the interesting asked were you 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.299
 the mobile version of the castle steve answers that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.670
 about a year ago they thought about it but 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.250
 so far nothing can say but on 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.709
 actually about this developer brewed 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.349
 much longer this two or three years 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.569
 back and said that so be talked 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.760
 what so far say deadlines and can and 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.799
 as we see not really perfect 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.690
 it did not take immediately from his by say 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.459
 ca n't and what's the funny thing are 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.349
 programmers who want for themselves 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.090
 made the application under android and 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.340
 use it to collect resources from 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.260
 I was so in the clan did not say that he 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.239
 asked his friend but that one 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.790
 wrote literally 1 or two days 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.780
 there is not really hard work 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.970
 the developer can not do now 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.829
 very passionate about seeing various stocks 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.170
 and try to somehow beat the players 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.150
 instead of entering the necessary feature 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.310
 the developers didn't even make intelligible 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.200
 calculator with the hero and did not explain to us 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.540
 so far okay the mechanics are all that we 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.519
 we have this player side calculator 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.500
 talent is made by player and formula 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.480
 Bred players before this people are very 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.579
 many asked to do it but the developer 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.739
 did nothing so most likely we 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.450
 before we wait for the mobile lock too 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.230
 some third-party person than from 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.060
 deval himself 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.829
 and then steel is responsible for the next 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.049
 dad colors and are not going to do on 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.380
 This week, well, this is the same 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.389
 the question is probably interesting to many by the way 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.250
 if you notice i have pink nickname 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.599
 and dekol glamorous is actually right 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.730
 on the eve still hanging 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.380
 I'll ask you when I'm going to 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.359
 take a straight hole because i'm not writing 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.310
 it is not known how many and the reasons are not 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.560
 giving him a hole was not because steve 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.389
 I could not answer in the same topic 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.400
 prove that there was some kind of wine behind me 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:07.769
 just jumped into the question and merged 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.130
 that ask us will be charged 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.130
 wise 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.340
 the word in the next issue will see 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.930
 will my post go through premoderation 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.930
 it will be interesting to see 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.160
 This is how my message looks to me 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.770
 They say that it will not be shown yet 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.020
 the moderator will not check it and some 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.730
 the message was probably waiting half a week 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.620
 maybe even more I thought that they 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.570
 missed harmless messages to this 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.240
 Moderators just so active 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.710
 they are very long checks and messages 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.290
 natural chat on the forum under 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.400
 can't 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.230
 thank you all for watching wait
