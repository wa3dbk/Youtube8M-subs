around<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.790> camera<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.329> also<00:01:48.600> speak

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
around the camera but you can also speak

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.469 
around the camera but you can also speak
into<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.369> person<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.850> hear<00:01:51.119> what<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
into it and the person can hear what you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.429 
into it and the person can hear what you
say<00:01:51.720> now<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> front<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.520> are<00:01:53.670> LEDs<00:01:54.439> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
say now on the front there are LEDs so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.050 
say now on the front there are LEDs so
this<00:01:55.590> thing<00:01:55.799> does<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> low<00:01:56.250> light<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.820> can

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
this thing does a low light it can

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.999 
this thing does a low light it can
actually<00:01:57.780> turn<00:01:58.020> an<00:01:58.229> image<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.680> black<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
actually turn an image into black and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
actually turn an image into black and
white<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.610> total<00:02:00.210> darkness<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.020> see

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
white in total darkness so you can see

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
white in total darkness so you can see
it<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.890> has<00:02:02.040> an<00:02:02.159> LED<00:02:02.310> sensor<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.329> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it and it has an LED sensor in there to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.569 
it and it has an LED sensor in there to
let<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.259> let<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> camera<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:05.009> when

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
let you know or let the camera know when

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.760 
let you know or let the camera know when
it<00:02:05.700> needs<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.350> smart<00:02:07.710> enough

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it needs to do that so it's smart enough

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.580 
it needs to do that so it's smart enough
to<00:02:07.950> recognize<00:02:08.250> when

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
to recognize when

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.290 
to recognize when
you<00:02:09.709> know<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:09.920> needs<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.459> switch<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.090> low

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
you know it needs to switch to that low

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.449 
you know it needs to switch to that low
light<00:02:11.660> setting<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.560> base<00:02:12.830> which<00:02:13.129> is<00:02:13.160> right

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
light setting the base which is right

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.800 
light setting the base which is right
here<00:02:13.489> like<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:13.940> mentioned<00:02:14.300> there<00:02:14.390> these<00:02:14.510> four

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
here like I mentioned there these four

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.949 
here like I mentioned there these four
mounting<00:02:15.170> screws<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.069> can<00:02:16.310> use<00:02:16.519> to

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
mounting screws that you can use to

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.750 
mounting screws that you can use to
mount<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.709> would<00:02:18.860> say<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.610> pretty

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
mount this and I would say it pretty

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.910 
mount this and I would say it pretty
much<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.239> to<00:02:20.420> because<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:21.080> won't<00:02:21.319> stand<00:02:21.620> up

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
much have to because it won't stand up

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.040 
much have to because it won't stand up
because<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:22.670> top-heavy<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.599> you're

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
because it's so top-heavy so you're

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.150 
because it's so top-heavy so you're
definitely<00:02:24.140> going<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.560> want<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.769> mount<00:02:24.980> this

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
definitely going to want to mount this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.670 
definitely going to want to mount this
in<00:02:25.370> some<00:02:25.610> sort<00:02:25.879> of<00:02:25.940> position<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:27.379> only<00:02:27.560> other

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
in some sort of position the only other

and then the WPS button on your router

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.370 
and then the WPS button on your router
to<00:02:42.319> join<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.130> two<00:02:43.340> together<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:44.930> did<00:02:45.140> so

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
to join the two together and I did so

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.259 
to join the two together and I did so
and<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.590> took<00:02:45.739> me<00:02:45.860> only<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.190> couple<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.790> minutes

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
so let's head over to my computer so we

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.330 
so let's head over to my computer so we
walk<00:02:50.360> around<00:02:50.510> my<00:02:50.810> office<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.829> I<00:02:51.890> can<00:02:51.950> show<00:02:52.280> you

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
walk around my office so I can show you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.050 
walk around my office so I can show you
exactly<00:02:53.230> kind<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.349> how<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.590> software<00:02:55.160> you

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
exactly kind of how the software you

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.250 
exactly kind of how the software you
know<00:02:56.180> works<00:02:56.599> on<00:02:57.500> my<00:02:58.840> desktop<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.019> then<00:03:00.140> we'll

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
know works on my desktop and then we'll

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.740 
know works on my desktop and then we'll
look<00:03:00.349> at<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.500> laptop<00:03:01.010> version<00:03:01.250> two<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:02.329> let's

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
look at the laptop version two so let's

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.559 
look at the laptop version two so let's
say<00:03:02.989> it's<00:03:03.170> swing<00:03:03.500> over<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.890> where<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.310> have<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
say it's swing over to where I have the

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.229 
say it's swing over to where I have the
desktop<00:03:06.049> software<00:03:06.260> running<00:03:06.739> right<00:03:07.220> here<00:03:07.670> so

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
desktop software running right here so

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.420 
desktop software running right here so
this<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.870> way<00:03:09.079> it<00:03:09.620> looks<00:03:09.650> when<00:03:10.250> you're

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
this is the way it looks when you're

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.430 
this is the way it looks when you're
viewing<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.940> camera<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.870> see<00:03:12.049> I'm<00:03:12.140> viewing

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
viewing the camera and see I'm viewing

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.530 
viewing the camera and see I'm viewing
it<00:03:12.620> right<00:03:12.799> now<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.310> basically<00:03:13.790> there<00:03:14.510> are

it right now and basically there are

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.500 
it right now and basically there are
some<00:03:15.500> controls<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:16.400> some<00:03:16.940> settings<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.420> you

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
let's say to be in HD and 720p because

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.530 
let's say to be in HD and 720p because
that<00:03:43.160> does<00:03:43.340> require<00:03:43.639> you<00:03:43.970> know<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.120> really<00:03:44.359> good

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
that does require you know a really good

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.270 
that does require you know a really good
internet<00:03:44.780> connection<00:03:45.349> you<00:03:45.769> could<00:03:45.950> lower<00:03:46.160> it

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
internet connection you could lower it

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.240 
internet connection you could lower it
down<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.579> VGA<00:03:47.120> or<00:03:47.239> q<00:03:47.599> VGA<00:03:47.930> if<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.709> wanted<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.099> do

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
down to VGA or q VGA if you wanted to do

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.920 
down to VGA or q VGA if you wanted to do
that<00:03:49.459> there<00:03:50.000> are<00:03:50.090> other<00:03:50.239> settings<00:03:50.569> that<00:03:50.810> you

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
that there are other settings that you

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.900 
that there are other settings that you
can<00:03:51.079> tinker<00:03:51.440> with<00:03:51.470> as<00:03:51.769> well<00:03:51.950> there's<00:03:52.849> a

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
can tinker with as well there's a

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.030 
can tinker with as well there's a
control<00:03:53.299> panel<00:03:53.569> here<00:03:53.959> unfortunately<00:03:54.919> this

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
control panel here unfortunately this

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.520 
control panel here unfortunately this
camera<00:03:55.519> does<00:03:56.030> not<00:03:56.060> have<00:03:56.450> pan<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.019> tilt<00:03:57.230> so

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
camera does not have pan and tilt so

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.379 
camera does not have pan and tilt so
these<00:03:58.040> controls<00:03:58.519> are<00:03:58.639> useless<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.239> only

happen and you can adjust the
sensitivity<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:31.430> SD<00:04:31.729> card<00:04:31.969> is<00:04:32.060> actually

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
sensitivity the SD card is actually

hidden underneath the camera and screwed

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.040 
hidden underneath the camera and screwed
in<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.580> it's<00:04:35.090> not<00:04:35.210> like<00:04:35.360> someone<00:04:35.630> could<00:04:35.780> remove

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
in so it's not like someone could remove

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.450 
in so it's not like someone could remove
it<00:04:36.229> and<00:04:36.349> steal<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.650> unless<00:04:36.979> they<00:04:37.130> knew<00:04:37.280> where

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460

it<00:04:37.490> was<00:04:37.640> on<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.940> screwdriver<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:39.200> can<00:04:39.650> also<00:04:39.919> add

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:40.219 
it was on a screwdriver you can also add

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.040 
it was on a screwdriver you can also add
multiple<00:04:40.400> cameras<00:04:41.060> in<00:04:41.210> this<00:04:41.330> view<00:04:41.599> so<00:04:41.659> if<00:04:41.960> you

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
multiple cameras in this view so if you

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.750 
multiple cameras in this view so if you
wanted<00:04:42.260> to<00:04:42.320> have<00:04:42.409> more<00:04:42.440> than<00:04:42.620> one<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.400> can<00:04:43.580> set

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
wanted to have more than one you can set

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.390 
wanted to have more than one you can set
that<00:04:43.940> up<00:04:43.969> as<00:04:44.240> well<00:04:44.479> there<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.260> also<00:04:45.560> as<00:04:45.979> I<00:04:46.099> pan

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
that up as well there is also as I pan

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.690 
that up as well there is also as I pan
over<00:04:46.430> an<00:04:47.060> iOS<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.320> Android<00:04:48.500> companion<00:04:49.490> type

over an iOS and Android companion type
app<00:04:49.969> which<00:04:50.539> offers<00:04:51.050> similar<00:04:51.580> functionality

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
app which offers similar functionality

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.450 
app which offers similar functionality
for<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.570> iOS<00:04:53.990> app<00:04:54.229> it's<00:04:54.440> more<00:04:54.710> about<00:04:54.919> just<00:04:55.280> the

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
for the iOS app it's more about just the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.219 
for the iOS app it's more about just the
viewing<00:04:55.849> and<00:04:56.030> interacting<00:04:56.599> with<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.840> camera

viewing and interacting with the camera

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.050 
viewing and interacting with the camera
as<00:04:57.380> opposed<00:04:57.979> to<00:04:58.159> playing<00:04:58.370> with<00:04:58.520> the<00:04:58.640> settings

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
as opposed to playing with the settings

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.060 
as opposed to playing with the settings
you<00:04:59.510> can<00:04:59.659> see<00:04:59.900> down<00:05:00.110> here<00:05:00.380> you<00:05:00.530> do<00:05:00.680> have<00:05:00.710> things
