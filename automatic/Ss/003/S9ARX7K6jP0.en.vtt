00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
game or anything but it was probably the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.550 
game or anything but it was probably the
funnest<00:02:17.689> game<00:02:17.959> on<00:02:18.140> here

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
there to hook you to keep playing so if

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.190 
there to hook you to keep playing so if
you're<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.879> fan<00:02:32.090> maybe<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.569> want<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.870> check<00:02:33.049> it

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
you're a fan maybe you want to check it

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.330 
you're a fan maybe you want to check it
out<00:02:33.349> but<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.650> know<00:02:33.920> what<00:02:34.040> you're<00:02:34.190> probably

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
out but you know what you're probably

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.699 
out but you know what you're probably
better<00:02:34.760> off<00:02:34.849> just<00:02:35.299> try<00:02:35.599> one<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.049> console

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
better off just try one of the console

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.649 
better off just try one of the console
or<00:02:37.010> handheld<00:02:37.549> titles<00:02:37.909> which<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.329> would<00:02:38.480> say<00:02:38.629> are

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
or handheld titles which I would say are

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.809 
or handheld titles which I would say are
probably<00:02:38.989> better<00:02:39.349> than<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.680> one<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.129> but

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
probably better than this one is but

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.789 
probably better than this one is but
anyway<00:02:41.299> there<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.140> Power<00:02:42.379> Rangers

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799
