00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.599
 two 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.920
 they also have to look at the part 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.020
 feminine that there are many teams and many 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.130
 girls who every day are playing more 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.240
 football and that we also deserve our 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.100
 reward so to speak of both 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.100
 Daily work and so much effort 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.850
 I always preferred the ball to the dolls 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.160
 since I've always liked chiquitita 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.660
 play with children at school and 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.420
 well he always sent me to the goal or 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.610
 the fact say the goal is encouraged 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.540
 but good and to decide when the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.110
 sporting that the goal was my thing 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.900
 would define me as a good goalkeeper under 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.790
 sticks that also for my height and for my 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.610
 I have a lot of scope when it comes to 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.840
 go to air balloons and yes that is 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.580
 true that it has always cost me a lot 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.590
 the game with the foot 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.870
 as it seems I would not be like 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.370
 iker boxes I've always said it has 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.260
 been my role model 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.880
 and yes it is true that I have been 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.710
 time working to get me the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.810
 I have been in my years of 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 bench working and day by day it 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.330
 get what they ultimately want 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.770
 my notes as they say my parents are 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.990
 those who have more kilometers traveled 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.170
 of all Spain because each end of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.330
 week to barcelona to valencia to madrid to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.250
 wherever you have to know how 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.950
 organize yourself how to think things over and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.720
 also sacrifice a bit the subject of 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.940
 go out with friends to go see the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.160
 family or to make your life normal by 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.680
 so to say it and on the other hand yes that is 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.390
 true that raises good I'm 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.310
 losing things but on the other hand I'm 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.320
 winning many 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.740
 win the queen's cup so it would be 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.810
 another dream also see that a stadium 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.689
 is full of people cheering you on and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.159
 supporting your team that right now 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.760
 in day that in women's football is 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.980
 unthinkable 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.570
 they always say that if your child is a 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.590
 step you have to keep that what 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.790
 important is not to go up 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.840
 I've come this far but I do not 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.840
 I agree but I keep working
