chicken teriyaki has the sweet flavor

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.259 
chicken teriyaki has the sweet flavor
that's<00:03:20.049> why<00:03:20.260> I<00:03:20.290> add<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.799> sugar<00:03:21.069> in<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.730> the

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.770 

so

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.930 
so
basically<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.709> just<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.490> spin<00:03:32.760> up
