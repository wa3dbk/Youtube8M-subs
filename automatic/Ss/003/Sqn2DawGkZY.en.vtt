00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.320
 so animals live in dauerstress 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.840
 crammed together in a few 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.150
 square cages lying surface mostly 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.070
 emphasize on markets are a 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.349
 constant back and forth suspended between 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.300
 deadly boredom on the one hand the 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.149
 always determined the same everyday routine 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.910
 and gives them no opportunity ort 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.770
 to meet your own needs 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.079
 on the other hand, under tension 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.510
 masses of people mean the unsteady and 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.910
 noisy day by day on them 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.579
 pass by without losing his chance 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:49.100
 would have to retire or to 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.870
 Escape believes all that they do 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.079
 the animals live in the area 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.199
 zoo mentally ill the total attack 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.850
 on their nature they are exposed to 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.850
 drives you straight into madness 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.820
 It has long since become a separate technical term 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.830
 caused for captivity 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.740
 Behavioral disorders established the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.340
 so-called too high trousers composed 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.750
 from the understood so and psychose as 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.330
 Collective term for disturbed 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.370
 Behavior of zoo animals that 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.370
 Do not show the same kind in freedom 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.270
 and in that respect to the imprisonment 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.240
 im is due 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.550
 movement stereotypes about permanent 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.130
 wobble with the upper body or with the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.890
 head or constant in circles or go 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.310
 pace off certain distances 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.420
 inside the cages and cherished or 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.700
 also agitate 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.020
 eating disorders such as the so-called 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.280
 recuperation of the animals already 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.310
 taken and swallowed food 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.330
 vouch for and record again 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.560
 in constant circulation 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.560
 about aggressiveness in cases of violence 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.970
 against other occupants of the cages and 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.580
 self- motivation is the injured 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.400
 of the own body about the tear out 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.760
 hair bloody skin damage 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.600
 or even the constant biting of the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:27.350
 own arms or legs too 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.350
 anxiety apathy depression etc 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.610
 the talk project was initiated in 1993 by 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.010
 the philosopher paula cavaliere and 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.830
 Peter Singer includes the claim 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.830
 the great ape orangutans 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.880
 gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.890
 because of their great genetic 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.320
 similarity with humans and theirs 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.830
 similarly complex cognitive affective 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.540
 social and communicative skills 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.400
 to grant certain fundamental rights 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.830
 the only people so far 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.040
 reserved for homo sapiens 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.510
 the fundamental right to live on 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.230
 individual freedom and on 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.560
 physical as well as mental 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.959
 integrity or by virtually all 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.800
 The people are open 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.910
 it can relate to people says 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.360
 wiltfang circus lab tests as well 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.269
 destroying their habitats the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.360
 actually thought of our relationship 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.510
 should be allowed to apes the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.700
 We are allowed to own it 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.880
 decide if they live or die 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.110
 and that are being analyzed today and so on 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.540
 it should be the big ape of the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.780
 same moral and legal too 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.760
 Protect that means enforceable 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.000
 legal status to come to a person 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.610
 all people belongs 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.320
 that's actually the core of the great 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.210
 ape project of the project big 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.160
 monkeys because it's just about the 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:02.920
 ask if also nonhuman animals 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.920
 could be legally persons 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:12.370
 so should start in general 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.250
 no animals to breed any 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.090
 chimpanzees to breed more and then 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.820
 because animals are dying out try with 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.100
 animals from the zoos replenish the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.770
 Do not think that improvement is possible 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.259
 and everyone else should be those of them 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.539
 give up kept animals 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:35.080
 and they would have to be brought together 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.729
 which was not in a large protected area 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.410
 easy to find but you could 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.289
 Imagine that, for example 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.340
 an island would be there and then 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.669
 just hundreds of apes 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.260
 held together and managed and 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.780
 could be that way if that 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.940
 Well done would be a reasonably 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.110
 leading a dignified life then always 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.270
 still decades 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.160
 Of course, it takes ape 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.410
 actually live as long as humans 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.690
 in 2011, the in oberwesel 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.669
 resident is a brunner foundation of 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.130
 great ape project on your agenda 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.470
 lifted in the order of the foundation I have 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.000
 the living conditions of the local zoos 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.610
 trapped courses people 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.380
 hope examines the results of the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.610
 are now in 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.070
 book form 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.830
 the book sheds light on this until today 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.150
 with the utmost naturalness 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.840
 operated display of animals 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.699
 in zoos the focus is on 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.479
 the big people often on the gorillas 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.720
 orang utans the chimpanzees and bonobos 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:43.240
 the captive behind iron bars 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.280
 armored glass and electric fences in 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.990
 especially blatantly wrong 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.030
 makes it clear that it means others 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.639
 creatures and here also ours 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.159
 fears kinship a life long 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.010
 to incarcerate needs your freedom 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:06:02.669
 robbed of her would be deprived of her 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.669
 self-determination robbed of your life
