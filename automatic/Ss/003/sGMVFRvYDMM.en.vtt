changing about the video and what I'm

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.089 
changing about the video and what I'm
going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.140> I'm<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.710> drag

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
going to do is I'm just going to drag

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.930 
going to do is I'm just going to drag
them<00:00:29.310> right<00:00:29.519> onto<00:00:30.260> stupid<00:00:31.260> me<00:00:31.380> right<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.460> top

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
them right onto stupid me right on top

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.860 
them right onto stupid me right on top
of<00:00:33.149> each<00:00:33.270> other<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:35.030> now<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.510> actually

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
of each other and now this is actually

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.690 
of each other and now this is actually
probably<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:37.739> bit<00:00:38.070> more<00:00:38.250> simple<00:00:38.489> than

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
probably a little bit more simple than

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700 
probably a little bit more simple than
you<00:00:38.730> might<00:00:38.940> think<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.140> right<00:00:40.469> here

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you might think all it is is right here

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.930 
you might think all it is is right here
I'll<00:00:40.920> give<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.370> linear<00:00:42.300> wipe<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I'll give you that linear wipe this is a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000 
I'll give you that linear wipe this is a
quite<00:00:45.450> simple<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.170> drag<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
quite simple thing to do drag it on the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.279 
quite simple thing to do drag it on the
top<00:00:47.820> clips<00:00:48.239> because<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.719> bottom<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.170> just

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
top clips because the bottom is just

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.139 
top clips because the bottom is just
going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> sit<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> raw<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.460> only<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
going to sit in the raw you only have to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.720 
going to sit in the raw you only have to
cut<00:00:51.449> these<00:00:51.690> out<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.260> allow<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.699> the

cut these out to allow you to see the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.490 
cut these out to allow you to see the
other<00:00:53.969> ones<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> makes<00:00:54.840> any<00:00:54.930> sense<00:00:55.079> it'll

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
other ones if that makes any sense it'll

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.770 
other ones if that makes any sense it'll
be<00:00:55.559> self<00:00:55.770> explanatory<00:00:55.890> soon<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.239> first<00:00:57.539> go

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
be self explanatory soon now we first go

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.720 
be self explanatory soon now we first go
to<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.050> top<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.980> order<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.550> able<00:00:59.640> to

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
see the bottom one when we move the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.870 
see the bottom one when we move the
transition<00:01:03.180> over<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.780> which<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.769> here

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
transition over here which is right here

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.330 
transition over here which is right here
the<00:01:05.880> transition<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.619> drag<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.189> up

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the transition you can just drag it up

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
the transition you can just drag it up
and<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:08.909> automatically<00:01:09.420> bring<00:01:09.630> this

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and it will automatically bring this

and it will automatically bring this
slider<00:01:10.140> thing<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
slider thing you can kind of see it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.920 
slider thing you can kind of see it
across<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> screen<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.630> bring<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the transition on this so we can slide

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.109 
the transition on this so we can slide
this<00:01:22.439> over<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.820> here's<00:01:24.030> the

difficulty you see this pole here let's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.390 
difficulty you see this pole here let's
come<00:01:26.790> through<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.950> bit<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:32.250> can

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
messed it up for that anyways now just

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.070 
messed it up for that anyways now just
to<00:02:24.620> finish<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:25.070> off<00:02:25.340> all<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:26.150> have<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.600> do<00:02:26.780> is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
to finish this off all you have to do is

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.230 
to finish this off all you have to do is
use<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.770> little<00:02:28.190> bit<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.400> feathering<00:02:28.790> because

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
use a little bit of feathering because

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.190 
use a little bit of feathering because
of<00:02:29.390> course<00:02:29.630> it's<00:02:30.610> kind<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.730> easy<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.210> see<00:02:32.960> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
of course it's kind of easy to see the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.920 
of course it's kind of easy to see the
line<00:02:33.410> some<00:02:34.220> places<00:02:34.610> now<00:02:34.760> here's<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.060> deal<00:02:35.180> you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
line some places now here's the deal you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.350 
line some places now here's the deal you
do<00:02:36.050> not<00:02:36.080> want<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.830> feather<00:02:37.460> this<00:02:37.700> out<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.240> know

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
do not want to feather this out you know

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.940 
do not want to feather this out you know
like<00:02:38.510> crazy<00:02:38.840> because<00:02:39.230> then<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.620> can<00:02:39.770> see<00:02:39.920> that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
like crazy because then you can see that

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.420 
like crazy because then you can see that
you<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:40.970> see<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.330> kind<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:42.340> changing<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
you can see it kind of changing the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.250 
you can see it kind of changing the
opacity<00:02:43.550> on<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.270> people<00:02:44.600> making<00:02:44.930> them<00:02:45.050> fade

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
opacity on the people making them fade

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.770 
opacity on the people making them fade
so<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:45.980> would<00:02:46.490> usually<00:02:46.730> go<00:02:47.150> around<00:02:47.270> with<00:02:47.630> like

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
so I would usually go around with like

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.830 
so I would usually go around with like
15<00:02:48.260> unless<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.800> have<00:02:49.010> like<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.250> kind<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.180> like<00:02:50.450> a

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
15 unless you have like a kind of like a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.690 
15 unless you have like a kind of like a
huge<00:02:51.170> amount<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.620> room<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:51.950> between<00:02:51.980> them<00:02:52.490> I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
huge amount of room in between them I

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.940 
huge amount of room in between them I
just<00:02:53.570> go<00:02:54.080> with<00:02:54.200> something<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.590> little<00:02:54.860> bit

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
just go with something a little bit

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.790 
just go with something a little bit
lower<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:55.250> let<00:02:55.700> me<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:55.970> feather<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.660> up<00:02:56.900> but

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
lower so let me just feather that up but

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.190 
lower so let me just feather that up but
not<00:02:57.950> too<00:02:58.190> much<00:02:58.490> let's<00:02:59.330> see<00:02:59.630> you<00:02:59.750> know<00:02:59.810> I'll

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
not too much let's see you know I'll

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.920 
not too much let's see you know I'll
just<00:03:00.230> leave<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.590> around<00:03:00.650> here<00:03:01.600> anyways<00:03:02.600> guys

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
just leave it around here anyways guys

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.790 
just leave it around here anyways guys
so<00:03:03.260> that's<00:03:03.620> basically<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:05.500> basics<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.650> all

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
so that's basically the basics of all

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.060 
so that's basically the basics of all
this<00:03:07.010> nothing<00:03:07.640> much<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.380> simple<00:03:09.380> as<00:03:09.500> that

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
this nothing much to it simple as that

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.900 
this nothing much to it simple as that
and<00:03:10.959> there<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.170> go<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.440> know<00:03:12.709> just<00:03:12.980> sorry

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
and there you go you know just sorry

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.160 
and there you go you know just sorry
it's<00:03:14.090> really<00:03:14.270> laggy<00:03:14.600> I'm<00:03:14.810> just<00:03:14.990> kind<00:03:15.140> of

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
it's really laggy I'm just kind of

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.509 
it's really laggy I'm just kind of
scrolling<00:03:15.530> through<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.100> with<00:03:16.340> this

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
scrolling through it and with this

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.880 
scrolling through it and with this
recorder<00:03:17.060> going<00:03:17.090> that's<00:03:17.840> difficult<00:03:18.050> anyways

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
recorder going that's difficult anyways

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.009 
recorder going that's difficult anyways
I<00:03:19.160> hope<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.180> helped<00:03:20.450> enough<00:03:20.660> if<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:20.900> have
