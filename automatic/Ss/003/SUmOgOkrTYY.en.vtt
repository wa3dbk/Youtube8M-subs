 recipe voter gamer do not get 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.290
 with me is what the people of drive say 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.600

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.460
 next I feel very frustrated at 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.610
 know that we are delaying 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.470
 to the patch for ps and export that 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.580
 then to the people of taiz in tangier 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.680
 blame myself for the 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.590
 frustration at not being able to remove the patch 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.150
 simultaneous for consoles and pc so 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.180
 that in the xbox a little more patience 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.890
 to people and give strength is in doubt 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.690
 he tries hard and with this patch I think 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.720
 He has shut our mouths to many 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.090
 people who depend on the camera like this 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.520
 that nothing no patience people I said 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.710
