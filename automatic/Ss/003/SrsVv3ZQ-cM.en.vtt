00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.210
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.690
 alexey wanna tell you today about 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.860
 This system unit is generally what it is 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.620
 for the system unit 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.800
 Originally it was stock stock 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.849
 stock system with the usual 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.999
 intel and quad core 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.650
 voice did not want to say snapdragon quadr 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:27.399
 core and intel 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.649
 something there is 8,600 something common 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.100
 principle and stretched toys but not on 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.210
 high settings far 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.539
 gradually, too, crap like 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.910
 most ordinary computers here we are 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:43.120
 installed a new motherboard 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.210
 cooling set four operational 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.489
 memory was added before 40 because 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.640
 CPU still fps was 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.429
 not good at all because it 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.710
 looks like a normal 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.910
 the system is not the body of course now we are you 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.179
 just hooked up 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.640
 still it all hangs hanging in general 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.870
 just to check 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.510
 here is this motherboard installed 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.580
 this is the processor we go somewhere 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.430
 apply generally here now 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.900
 installed such children's fees from 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.260
 psay companies on chipset b 85th roughly 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.900
 saying b85 and all the way just 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.760
 logo yourself or 3 class 4 you yourself 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.980
 know what it is and if you don't know 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.840
 Generally look on the Internet I want you 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.690
 say we purchased maternal 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.590
 fee literally for around two s 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.750
 more than about 3000 micro format very tx 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.840
 me for acceleration of course but in my opinion she 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.140
 and can handle him not quite there 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.750
 before melting to disperse well, it's something you can 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.000
 do it in general, I want to say that 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.060
 motherboard at a time which 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.540
 costs so much money just such 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.690
 chic bells that but really cool i 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.360
 hoped to make it a lot worse and a little bit 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.730
 I will quickly talk about this building here 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.970
 we have a power supply as you see the company 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.890
 a bit so cooling deepcool from in 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.370
 forest 2 according to mine 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:17.520
 Well, the most important thing here is first 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.640
 7950 graphics card with three gigabytes bus 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.459
 830 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 800 384 bit and what's in this video card 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.660
 such a steep but I would note that here 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.670
 this button is admissible which is just 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.380
 cool button while playing there 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.170
 computer time if you need more 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.260
 Once the Ursa video card, we click just 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.739
 wing it lights up and adds more 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.940
 about five frames installed here 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.130
 RAM 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.209
 I will try to show, we hardly see 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.730
 from the company corsair 4 gigabyte two 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.650
 the bracket stands and the motherboard itself is well 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.800
 and of course covers it all 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.550
 the processor is not covering then manages everything 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.910
 this concert is intel core i5 4570 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.280
 without kay and so everything is fine with him in 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.690
 principle here already patsanski 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.940
 installed hard drive 2 5 1 and there 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.890
 2 more 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.980
 a kind of antediluvian drives still need 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.450
 remove in general but also as if hard itself 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.840
 Drive Western Digital Blue Series Tests 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.079
 there will be a video polygon soon 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.600
 general what can he do what is that 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.950
 for those kidneys this system unit and how he 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.489
 I will show myself but I want you 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:47.200
 say that gta 5 already we ran on 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.660
 ultra settings 60 frames sagged in 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.920
 most such moments without pontovyh to 40 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:59.500
 but stable 60-70 with the power button in 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.920
 area 65-75 somewhere in general 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.930
