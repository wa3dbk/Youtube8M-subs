you can see the teeth on the bottom of
the<00:01:10.450> head<00:01:10.990> will<00:01:11.290> keep<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:11.650> in<00:01:11.710> place<00:01:11.770> once<00:01:12.220> it's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
the head will keep it in place once it's

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.270 
the head will keep it in place once it's
put<00:01:12.550> back<00:01:12.730> in<00:01:13.290> we'll<00:01:14.290> set<00:01:14.530> this<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:15.010> that<00:01:15.159> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
put back in we'll set this so that the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.090 
put back in we'll set this so that the
arrow<00:01:15.750> goes<00:01:16.750> down<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.200> right<00:01:17.380> side<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.950> our

edge of our area sidewalk is also our
left<00:01:26.320> edge<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:27.520> we'll<00:01:27.700> twist<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.120> turret<00:01:28.420> to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
left edge so we'll twist the turret to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.500 
left edge so we'll twist the turret to
check<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.900> adjustment<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.409> our<00:01:29.560> spray<00:01:30.510> and

you can see that it's not going far

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.399 
you can see that it's not going far
enough<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:34.210> this<00:01:34.420> point<00:01:34.540> we'll<00:01:34.870> use<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.229> key

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
enough at this point we'll use the key

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.560 
enough at this point we'll use the key
to<00:01:35.590> make<00:01:35.740> further<00:01:35.950> adjustments<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:37.390> make
