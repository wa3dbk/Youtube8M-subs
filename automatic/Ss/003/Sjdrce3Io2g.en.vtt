00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.069
 the enemy has captured the captain who 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.770
 He has caught in one of its cruises 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.389
 truth and reconciliation 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.190
 the ship currently maintains its position 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.570
 about 300 meters above in the other 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.700
 side of the track 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.010
 and how will we enter the ship if it is in 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.180
 the air the body has given me a rifle not 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.920
 wings 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.480
 there is a gravity elevator that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.370
 transports troops and supplies from the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.370
 ship to the surface so we will enter 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.540
 this has been a recklessness the two what 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.380
 they know very well 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.380
 Thank you 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.340
 Marines prepare and carry their weapons 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.340
 ready to move very well sir 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.900
 while the pact had us here 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.300
 locked up they heard the guards talking 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:10.180
 over that ring-shaped world what 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.180
 call the lord 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.479
 according to the data of your networks 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.400
 the ring is of great importance 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.870
 religious 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.900
 if I'm not wrong 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.770
 cleared is a kind of weapon a weapon 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.770
 of immense power 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.060
 then it is true the pact did not stop 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.260
 say that whoever controls halo will control 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.320
 the fate of the universe 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.910
 now I understand it and intercepted a 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.680
 series of messages about a team the 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.530
 pact that is looking for a room 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.090
 control I thought I was looking for the bridge 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.680
 of a cruise ship that I left unused 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.600
 during the battle on top of the ring 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.860
 but they must be looking for the rooms 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.680
 control leave it 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.870
 bad news and halo is a weapon and the 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.270
 agreement is made with their control they will use it 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.409
 against us and annihilate all the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.590
 human race 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 boss cut I have a new mission to 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.239
 we have to arrive before the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.229
 agreement to the control room leaves the 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.229
 marines forward 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.360
 You are in the lead 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.500
 to everyone above we go on board 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.150
 a moment that connects me to the 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.610
 ship controls 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.630
 I do not need this bird I take it out 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.520
 single 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.520
 hunter captain 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 safe 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.439
 very well sr now they are going to pay us 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.140
 the pact believes that the cartographer 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.090
 silent is below this island is 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.490
 a map room that will guide us to the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.730
 jane control center 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.990
 with various structures and facilities 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.990
 that there is no engine room 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.230
 analyzing the control center halo 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.060
 is here that structure seems to be a 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.840
 kind of sanctuary temple if I have not 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.840
 misinterpreted 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.300
 let's go hammer there 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.300
 central coordinates of good 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.790
 the pact with this lie no one dead 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.790
 they left in the tournament 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.760
 the positive side yellow the last thing 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.150
 the waiting pact is a low air strike 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.150
 land 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.099
 ah 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.889
 and now we'll see how to get to the center 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.900
 control 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.900
 luck hammer command 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.680
 this is the control center 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.540
 s the test ends 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.889
 you are well better than ever you do not 

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:54.129
 you imagine how much information of 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:58.849
 incredible knowledge so fast 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:06:02.569
 glorious what kind of weapon is what 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:05.179
 you talk let's concentrate halo how how 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.659
 we use against the covenant the ring is not 

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:12.529
 a beast batter is something else a lot 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:13.769
 most important the pact was right this 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:17.780
 is 

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:20.420
 precursor is a second that access 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.590
 if the predecessors built this 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.190
 fortress world for 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.050
 inspire 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.550
 it is not possible 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.610
 damn covenant they knew it had 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.849
 safe signals 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:38.210
 I do not follow the covenant found something in 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:41.569
 this ring something horrible and now it has 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.180
 buried fear where the captain has to 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:47.409
 stop the captain who is to use 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:52.039
 more you are looking for are not you should not go in there 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:56.469
 I do not understand the time you leave here 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.469
 case of zeal will not be late
