 Today's video tutorial filler will cover the taskbar or the bar 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.880
 of the windows 7 applications that as you can see with respect to the previous ones 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.269
 versions changed first is slightly higher and centers 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:31.150
 commercial I love at the first start of our system the icons we can 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.960
 note that they will be the largest and will not be like where you were 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.489
 also see keller guitar of herbs the icon that I opened for example if 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.199
 devoid 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.580

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.809
 sending a note on the icon who has none left it with a Sicilian sutta 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:59.620

 two mozzilla icons dofox apart 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.500
 3d there is a way for now 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 for lullabies to bring back our taskbar as the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.040
 previously on windows vista best method is really very simple and 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.580
 takes little time 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.520
 to do this, just right click and the property on the toolbar 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.660
 applications 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:34.650
 now nn we check the box use small icons and then excel on the push button bar 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.490
 of the applications we select not to combine 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.130
 once we will also michela on tax applied to the cockpit to note that 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.160
 taskbar cost is back as low as that of windows 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.100
 view but also the icons related to the quick start will be without 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.070
 let's say erm text while the ones we're going to open 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.710
 will cause those of news 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.570
 ie meliconi films that you like but are displayed with the appropriate button then 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.119
 q with mozzilla farefox 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.469
 it is the same thing for the folders that will be opened once they are opened 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.340
 displayed with a bridge with a 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.779
 and our land and our text 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:21.059
 otherwise all this remains unchanged and therefore as a god 7 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:25.509
 the also the start menu and therefore will remain identical to go back to the 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:26.799
 overdoing property 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.069

 110 of alisa reflections, however, nevertheless held at the central limit of the 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.629
 conical however I like it a lot 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.730

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.579
 salicone 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.930
