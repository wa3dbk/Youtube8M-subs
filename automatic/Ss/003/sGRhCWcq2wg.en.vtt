00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.470
 tomorrow will use all still have some 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.470
 Chemical Weapons 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.540
 here's pretty much what's going on in 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.689
 syria for two and a half years bachar al 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.279
 assad kill people with rifles on 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.239
 world does not say much I told you 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.340
 that my daughter was pregnant 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:26.140
 bachar al assad kill people with 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.849
 bombs the world does not care a bit 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.130
 then on August 21 last according to any 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.090
 likelihood bachar al assad killed 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.090
 people with gas 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.170
 and there I'm scared barak 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.729
 Syrian events have shown that this 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.589
 which is inadmissible from the point of view of 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.539
 the international community this is 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.710
 not to kill civilians is to use 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.260
 chemical weapons 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.180
 the question is, what is this 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.969
 which makes these weapons more shocking than the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.159
 others we can mention at least two 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.539
 reasons first of all for a hundred 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.059
 of years the international community 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.500
 tries to ban the use of weapons 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.509
 say non-discriminant 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.240
 ie weapons that by nature do not 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.490
 do not make the difference between soldiers and 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.020
 civilians 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.850
 chemical weapons are part of it but 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.799
 also the bacteriological weapons and 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.209
 nuclear weapons and antipersonnel mines the 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.830
 second reason is the status 

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:22.750
 particular chemical weapons 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.880
 since the trauma of the first 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.709
 world war where 90 thousand soldiers are 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.869
 dead gas and they were used that 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.880
 by Italy in 1935 to conquer 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.979
 Ethiopia by Japanese troops 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.750
 during the Sino-Japanese war and by 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.549
 saddam hussein against iran and the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.899
 Kurdish 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.149
 even hitler who owned them yet 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.179
 enormously never used it on 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.920
 the battlefield and this very rare 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.599
 use of chemical weapons a 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.090
 helped make them more and more 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:53.709
 taboo but in 1993 five years after the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.190
 Saddam Hussein's attack on the Kurds 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.989
 Iraqi 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.060
 most countries in the world have 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:01.599
 committed by treaty to dismantle their 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.550
 arsenal for more than 80% of the stocks of 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.069
 declared combat gas in the world have 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.899
 been destroyed under the pressure of the 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.519
 international community syria has 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.869
 announced that it would also give up 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.180
 its chemical arsenal and that she 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.560
 would sign the treaty 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.420
 which will certainly not prevent bachar 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.080
 to come back to more atrocities 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.080
 conventional 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.519
 I mean if I was you I want 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.329
 to say I subscribe ray what after this is a 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.579
 personal choice 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:35.200
 finally good if you want to click 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.200
 within the framework provided for this purpose
