00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.190
 Welcome to our channel 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.719
 happy kaleo today I show you as you 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.859
 your dog is sitting when you bring 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.470
 you can do it the clicker 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.180
 use yes the whole is actually 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.199
 pretty easy and one of the first 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.879
 actually tricks you every dog 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:30.860
 teaches and I will actually 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:33.260
 first without saying anything and 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.930
 the dog then later in the course of the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.590
 training then additionally this word 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.620
 Teach what I do I use 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.620
 Just make sure the dog is fixed on it 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.410
 the little thing in my hand is and 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.910
 move your hand towards him to the dog 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.280
 Of course, I would like to have more delicious food in the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.530
 keep eye and actually makes almost 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.970
 always a seat so he goes 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.160
 either back or he does sit but 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.719
 most dogs if you have this 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.670
 move skilfully across your eyes 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.149
 then head then leads 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.649
 already gone 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.880
 and of course you can do that directly 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.880
 reward him by giving him that little something 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.990
 gives or clicks and gives the yummy 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.090
 and then the dog actually has it in 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.249
 shortest time out so some dogs like that 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.840
 some puppies also have that 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.549
 they already know ten times 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.560
 exactly what this hand movement means 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.909
 then you just need that hand, too 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.609
 to move and then get started 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.670
 then the next step will be 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:31.069
 really the word is sitting on this 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.289
 to add movement and then the 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.959
 hand movement continues to reduce 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.549
 this is a pure meat thing and 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.969
 will then be on yours over time 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.969
 dog understood 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.640
 Well 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.989
 yes he has it in a short video 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.030
 seen what that looks like 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.110
 I think we should just go 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.390
 Trying out that will really be 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.590
 work incredibly fast and 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.900
 if you do it with the clicker then 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.900
 you will become your dog too 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.670
 Continue this click rewarding trip 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.230
 intensified and that is up 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.910
 Every case helpful for some others 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.280
 Tricks later at the timing one 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.510
 important role plays yes I hope that 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.330
 video you liked you have one 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.739
 a little something learned and would be me 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.870
