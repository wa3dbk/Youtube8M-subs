scrooge strike next is the heal macros

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.510 
scrooge strike next is the heal macros
now<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> heal<00:01:19.560> macros<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.340> good

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
life and they also both you pair now if

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.630 
life and they also both you pair now if
you<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.320> shadow<00:01:25.530> infusion<00:01:26.070> does<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you know what shadow infusion does it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.429

when you use diet transformation it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.810 
when you use diet transformation it
doubles<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.509> damage<00:01:30.720> within<00:01:31.110> 5<00:01:31.439> stacks<00:01:31.890> now

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
doubles the damage within 5 stacks now

now<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:02.970> quality<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.450> life<00:04:03.660> microwaves<00:04:04.170> are

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
now the quality of life microwaves are

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.860 
now the quality of life microwaves are
really<00:04:04.560> good<00:04:04.709> guys<00:04:04.739> because<00:04:05.610> basically<00:04:05.880> they

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
put a ton of micros all in one and it

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.390 
put a ton of micros all in one and it
just<00:04:09.269> saves<00:04:09.480> time<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:10.049> effort<00:04:10.350> so<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:11.190> is

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
just saves time and effort so this is

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.970 
just saves time and effort so this is
the<00:04:11.549> pet<00:04:11.760> raised<00:04:12.000> when<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.620> it<00:04:13.620> when<00:04:13.860> your

at the pet leap but I haven't got this
in<00:05:12.290> here<00:05:12.500> because<00:05:12.710> my<00:05:12.919> macros<00:05:13.370> messed<00:05:13.669> up<00:05:13.880> and

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
in here because my macros messed up and

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.210 
in here because my macros messed up and
I<00:05:14.450> did<00:05:14.690> have<00:05:14.810> a<00:05:14.900> mine<00:05:15.110> freeze<00:05:15.380> one<00:05:15.590> as<00:05:15.740> well<00:05:15.919> but

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
I did have a mine freeze one as well but

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.770 
I did have a mine freeze one as well but
it's<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.490> same<00:05:16.700> for<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:16.970> pet<00:05:17.150> leap<00:05:17.330> instead

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
it's the same for the pet leap instead

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.740 
it's the same for the pet leap instead
of<00:05:17.900> been<00:05:18.139> Castle<00:05:18.950> nor<00:05:19.160> you<00:05:19.520> put<00:05:19.789> the<00:05:20.060> pet<00:05:20.510> leap

next<00:05:29.120> up<00:05:29.240> is<00:05:29.449> the<00:05:29.570> hill<00:05:29.720> micros<00:05:30.169> now<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.560> have

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
next up is the hill micros now you have

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.740 
next up is the hill micros now you have
the<00:05:30.979> leech<00:05:31.160> born<00:05:31.520> which<00:05:32.030> we<00:05:32.270> know<00:05:32.450> heals

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
the leech born which we know heals

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.510 
the leech born which we know heals
returned<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:33.470> we<00:05:33.620> also<00:05:33.800> have<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.160> conversion

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
returned and we also have the conversion

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.790 
returned and we also have the conversion
which<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.180> have<00:05:35.300> here<00:05:35.539> now<00:05:36.320> I<00:05:36.350> have<00:05:36.620> two

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
which I have here now I have two

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.409 
which I have here now I have two
conversions<00:05:37.340> I<00:05:37.520> have<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.700> normal<00:05:37.910> conversion

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
conversions I have the normal conversion

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.240 
conversions I have the normal conversion
so<00:05:38.630> I<00:05:38.660> can<00:05:38.780> turn<00:05:38.930> off<00:05:39.169> and<00:05:39.770> then<00:05:39.889> I<00:05:40.010> have<00:05:40.130> the

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
so I can turn off and then I have the

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.830 
so I can turn off and then I have the
one<00:05:40.280> which<00:05:40.639> I've<00:05:40.820> been<00:05:40.940> spammed<00:05:41.330> down<00:05:41.539> below

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
one which I've been spammed down below

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.240 
one which I've been spammed down below
I'll<00:05:42.349> show<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.830> difference<00:05:43.220> between

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
I'll show you the difference between

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.900 
I'll show you the difference between
them<00:05:43.729> now<00:05:44.320> so<00:05:45.320> basically<00:05:45.470> with<00:05:46.220> this<00:05:46.430> one<00:05:46.669> I

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
them now so basically with this one I

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.930 
them now so basically with this one I
put<00:05:47.419> on<00:05:47.570> it<00:05:47.919> conversion<00:05:48.919> but<00:05:49.280> this<00:05:49.490> time

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
put on it conversion but this time

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.580 
put on it conversion but this time
this<00:05:50.360> is<00:05:50.510> conversion<00:05:50.990> without<00:05:51.110> it<00:05:51.380> it's

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
this is conversion without it it's

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.700 
this is conversion without it it's
taking<00:05:51.830> 25k<00:05:52.669> now<00:05:53.240> if<00:05:53.300> I<00:05:53.450> put<00:05:53.690> this<00:05:53.720> on<00:05:54.050> while

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
taking 25k now if I put this on while

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.620 
taking 25k now if I put this on while
pressing<00:05:55.039> my<00:05:55.250> macro<00:05:55.580> I<00:05:55.880> can<00:05:56.180> get<00:05:56.330> two<00:05:56.479> at<00:05:56.599> a

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
pressing my macro I can get two at a

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.120 
pressing my macro I can get two at a
time<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:57.080> can<00:05:57.110> see<00:05:57.380> the<00:05:57.500> two<00:05:57.650> hills<00:05:57.830> coming

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
time you can see the two hills coming

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.490 
time you can see the two hills coming
off<00:05:58.250> okay<00:05:59.180> this<00:05:59.450> means<00:05:59.630> I<00:05:59.840> get<00:06:00.020> more<00:06:00.200> healing

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
off okay this means I get more healing

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.379 
off okay this means I get more healing
quickly<00:06:00.800> I<00:06:01.160> put<00:06:01.760> these<00:06:01.849> micros<00:06:02.270> in

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
quickly I put these micros in
