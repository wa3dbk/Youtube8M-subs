 when we run well 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.980
 oxygen is delivered to the brain and this 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.570
 means we start thinking 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.650
 better to think clearly we appear 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.580

 internal organs are internal 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.400
 massage to the organ in our internal organs 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.140
 peristalsis also works well 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.540
 intestines also strengthen muscles 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.970
 not only the internal muscles there cardiac 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.590

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.170
 different process and is broken 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.270
 child-bearing functions of occupation ran 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.050

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.980
 processes improve blood supply in 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.670
 the pelvic area is generally a lot of peak 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.630
 helps

 I can run 10 kilometers with 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.269
 the same breath with the same heart rhythm 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.870
 easy calm days not 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.870
 accelerated as if I am these 10 kilometers 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.800
 just passed that is so good 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.800
 an organism 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.019
 strengthened in general as a whole even that 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.170
 it is very good in our everyday 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.849

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.670
 more tolerant and tasks will be or 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.480
 problems to overcome 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.800
 better you will be more positive and 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.650
 cheerful so do the run 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.769
 advice for those who have poor health 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:21.090
 or even to run may not start running 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.010
 very slowly, not that it is not necessary 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.840
 competition when you objects for yourself 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.240
 don't go behind them when 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.670
 decided to start running slowly 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.130
 how much do you want for those who do 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.310

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.880
 run like this the main thing to run 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.220
 nearly 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.580
 move there move run on 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.860

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.220
 No, and you can run even on the spot 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.650

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:12.210
 on the internal organs on the heart 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:15.090
 the system is much in general therefore 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.120
 run barefoot more often if it's summer 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.080
