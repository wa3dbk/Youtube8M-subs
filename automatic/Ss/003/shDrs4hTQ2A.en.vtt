fire were super fast reload works except
for<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.549> have<00:04:19.729> noticed<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:20.419> can't<00:04:20.750> turn

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
for I have noticed that you can't turn

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.990 
for I have noticed that you can't turn
it<00:04:21.109> off<00:04:21.199> I<00:04:21.530> get<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.400> figure<00:04:22.669> out<00:04:22.789> why<00:04:22.970> it

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
it off I get to figure out why it

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.920 
it off I get to figure out why it
doesn't<00:04:23.570> turn<00:04:23.660> off<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.680> it<00:04:24.919> doesn't<00:04:25.310> I<00:04:26.060> figure

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
doesn't turn off but it doesn't I figure

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.450 
doesn't turn off but it doesn't I figure
out<00:04:27.080> some<00:04:27.320> way<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.500> get<00:04:27.770> that<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.130> turn<00:04:28.310> off

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
out some way to get that to turn off

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.980 
out some way to get that to turn off
I've

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990
