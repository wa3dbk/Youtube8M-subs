00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.690
 hello you are 100 slim and today it is 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.480
 go about your loved ones and mine too 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.309
 timberland boots these boots have become 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.690
 very popular and like any other 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.299
 popular product 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 they began to be faked often 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.070
 understand how to still distinguish the original 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.050
 from fake 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.240
 didn't want to be for my revenge no way 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.910
 can you go and find out 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.580
 the first sign of the original is reasonable 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.650
 the price is natural that real leather 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.410
 world famous brand shoes 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.100
 can not cost a penny guided 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.350
 on prices in proven stores 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.399
 the second sign of the original is quality 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 materials present order would be produced 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.770
 from high quality nubuck which 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.680
 differs in high wear resistance if 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.020
 touch fake that stuff to the touch 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.710
 will remind rather thick rubber they 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.719
 soft nubuck didn't want to be home together 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.750
 and you can't take likes 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.630
 throw out the third sign of the original 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.450
 solid sole only original 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.140
 tempo outsole has no transitions between 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.610
 in layers it is a monolithic 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.530
 material composition of which is rubber 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.320
 such a sole well absorbs 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.930
 unlike the sole that is molded 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.200
 on fake plus there is a transition between 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.060
 layers are very noticeable that will serve 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.170
 signal for you the fourth sign 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.600
 of the original 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:44.220
 these are nylon laces such laces and 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:49.100
 cost much more than usual therefore 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.100
 in handicrafts you are unlikely to meet them and 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.880
 the fifth sign of the original 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.530
 stainless accessories during production 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.520
 original pace used 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.960
 stainless steel hardware she 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.259
 securely fastened to the boots and looks 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.870
 significantly more solid than made of 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.290
 soft metal strokes for laces on 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.290
 necks 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.480
 wanted to be home together well you can't 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.300
 remove likes 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.989
 spill out should also pay attention 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.599
 on the quality of seams 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:35.519
 as you can see in the original seams 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:40.950
 perfectly smooth fake so quality 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:43.260
 can not boast the next sign 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.050
 original this country is manufacturer 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.480
 before timberland were produced only in 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:55.260
 Us but now production has been moved to 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.550
 Dominican Republic and China in fakes sometimes 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.069
 indicates us as country of origin 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.560
 this model 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.970
 this pair is made 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:14.970
 Dominican Republic is unenviable whether 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:18.330
 you another feature of the original is 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.870
 branded leather label it is attached to 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.200
 the right shoe shows the logo 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.230
 timberland and the inscription UAH tit here and proof 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.069
 if you have a pair of shoes with cardboard 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.019
 tags or labels then this fake 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.590
 in real shoes only used 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.230
 one this leather label unfortunately its 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.220
 I can only show in the photo as it 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.379
 picked up a friend as a keychain and would like to 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.920
 be home together but you can't take 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.020
 splash out 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.390
