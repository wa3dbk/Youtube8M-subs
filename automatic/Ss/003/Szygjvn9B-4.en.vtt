musically<00:01:57.920> we<00:01:58.130> thought<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.520> there<00:01:58.670> was

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
musically we thought that there was

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.880 
musically we thought that there was
something<00:01:59.000> really<00:01:59.300> relatable<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.170> we<00:02:00.530> and

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
something really relatable and we and

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.890 
something really relatable and we and
for<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> lot<00:02:01.550> of<00:02:01.610> years<00:02:01.880> there<00:02:02.240> wasn't<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.600> lot<00:02:02.750> of

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
for a lot of years there wasn't a lot of

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.930 
for a lot of years there wasn't a lot of
people<00:02:03.170> who<00:02:03.320> thought<00:02:03.530> thought<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.460> probably

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
people who thought thought that probably

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.910 
people who thought thought that probably
just<00:02:05.240> because<00:02:05.480> they<00:02:05.690> were<00:02:05.930> in<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.470> bathing<00:02:06.620> suit

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
just because they were in a bathing suit

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.639 
just because they were in a bathing suit
and<00:02:07.160> playing<00:02:07.490> guitar<00:02:07.580> but<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:08.260> this<00:02:09.260> is<00:02:09.380> getting
