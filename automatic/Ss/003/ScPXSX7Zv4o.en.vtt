00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 It is the sixth of november 2012 and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.730
 if you wanted to be pathetic then 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.020
 One could say today is one 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.480
 historical day 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.980
 It is chosen in the USA by the way 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.259
 not just a new president, but 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.610
 something is also going on in the congress 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.240
 But that's not what it should be 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.340
 be a topic 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.170
 important in the presidency 2 barack 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.640
 obama only with rangnick you can do it 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.109
 make you smart again 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.090
 that's what it's all about here as well 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.609
 news to go also have a message 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.650
 from berlin around the so-called 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.140
 Breakdown airport 's something new and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.270
 of course the number of the day 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.760
 Let's start with the topic at all 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.180
 light of the us presidential election of the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.980
 we will know that today, hopefully 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.480
 night maybe we know it too 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.210
 not that is related to that 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.149
 This time the race is so close where you are 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.070
 do not really know if it's like that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.949
 usually is usually at least 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.699
 at the end of the elections it is already clear who 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.469
 and the winner is 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.030
 it could be that you are 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.770
 have to look at the whole thing again 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.120
 that you have to check that both sides 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.309
 already have so many 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.830
 lawyers who are looking for that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.630
 Everything is right but it is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.760
 Of course we can do that today 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.049
 night already have a result today 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.510
 night because of that so far 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.430
 time difference usa and so and so 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.200
 Only the results of a 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 state if 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.820
 you are all polling stations closed and 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.159
 this also in the us to different 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.049
 Of course, there are also time zones 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.250
 here different from the times and 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.710
 to secure the results 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.540
 gradually by so far you can 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.549
 Of course, no tendency to foresee 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.350
 because still no polling place but so off 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.030
 Around 6 pm, there are the first ones 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.560
 Results I got you that very much 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.390
 good ones I find mirrors online 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.220
 live-ticker links as you learn 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.570
 Everything important and in this place can 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 I'll tell you something here now 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.200
 have considered and if I have 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.420
 Actually, that's what I do today 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.490
 after the backup put in very early 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 I'll get up and a little video 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.700
 turn for you so 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.990
 the morning before leaving home 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.299
 just go once briefly a computer 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.670
 you can find out who is newer 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.710
 us president is provided that he already there 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.600
 So it's hard not to get stuck early 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.509
 Do you take a look there is then one 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.960
 little special to the 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.970
 us presidential elections rejoice me 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.250
 if you look at it message number 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.959
 two comes today from Germany the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.370
 already said from berlin 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.250
 there is supposed to be a new airport 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.050
 arise or it arises all the time 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.280
 but actually he should already 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.569
 be done long ago that you have 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.330
 probably will get this 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.010
 drama around the metropolitan airport 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.290
 actually in June it should be done 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.900
 but it was not known shortly before 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.170
 Finished there were supposedly only problems with 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.400
 any fire protection regulations 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.209
 has turned out the child a lot 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.920
 more problems 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.019
 then one said in the autumn winter 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.599
 finished and eventually became known 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.440
 Maybe next fall is true 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:49.890
 not mister 2012 but october 2013 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.599
 So for more than a year, the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.250
 Opening for airport postponed 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.230
 that there is nothing new that you know now 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.630
 but is new that air berlin so the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.700
 airline air berlin the operator of 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.049
 Capital City sued for this 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.190
 actually we would have a whole again 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.320
 lots of money through the rag 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.060
 we assumed that we were in 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.900
 can depart this year already and 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.880
 can fly to 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.220
 and that does not work now 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.260
 we have big losses and that 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.049
 prospects that this suit succeeds 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.359
 they are also very good because it is her 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.250
 probably actually the operators that 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.840
 the airport I finished is necessary 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.609
 look how it goes on but I think 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.200
 quite exciting that it is actually now 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.579
 legal steps available at 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.440
 originally looked like at first 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.880
 would not you go now is that 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.519
 number of the day and the number of the day 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.530
 is the 5 yes this is again its own 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.239
 message but because today is the sac 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.799
 I use this opportunity very brash 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.240
 to do a short advertising for one 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.220
 video that I am today 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.170
 has uploaded tomorrow is always so 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.880
 that you have a little longer on Tuesdays 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.710
 explained video gets to either one 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.790
 historical or political topic 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.090
 or something else 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.130
 and this time there are five steps 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.210
 whom you without problems to the Abitur comes 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.950
 check it out here 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.450
 it is also for Aldi real school graduation 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.950
 I can do or graduate from high school 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.210
 apply to everything and for all those 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.860
 already have indeed also times 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.580
 purely because they are very funny 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.470
 things in it 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.570
 not from me but from at 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.070
 Just have a look and 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.240
 now at the end still has to be lovely 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.500
 even my favorite comment below 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.030
 the video of yesterday in which I 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.080
 forgot to ask a question 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.580
 I then as you may 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.080
 was seen was still so 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.090
 not fully aware of who you would be 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.680
 you choose if you could and that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.390
 what you wrote so covers that 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.860
 actually ask yourself with the others 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.510
 in germany, there is everything very much 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.180
 very clear majority of all german 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.530
 would barack obama sake for that I have 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.940
 now no message selected 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.010
 but the message to another 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.930
 thing I found very good looking potty 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.410
 hey I'm 18 recently 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.270
 become 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.040
 Congratulations later and would be great 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.960
 like to go bear because otherwise I agreed 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.890
 yes, in any case, without the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.570
 agree 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.910
 Well, I do not know what I mean 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.800
 So in any case, I think 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.900
 it just so difficult to get me right 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.520
 inform which party represents what 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.320
 and so on you could maybe 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.960
 sum up the video to do it 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.330
 such a rough overview that would be great 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.860
 hey look potty like it related 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.300
 I have planned exactly that, so I have 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.850
 to make a video in three weeks 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.650
 I'll tell you something about that 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.480
 most important politician in germany her 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.020
 what kind of minister do we ever experience 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.300
 to have 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.040
 who has something to say here with us and 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.530
 if you want to know what they are 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.090
 have individual parties for programs 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.740
 then you look at this video in there 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.880
 I'll explain a little something to you 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.650
 I have already done that and 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.600
 Of course , this will be one of the Bundestag elections 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.700
 the next year also appropriate 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.260
 Just give me videos 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.070
 let's see if I then a holder 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.320
 or could 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.820
 not from many thanks for this 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.860
 comment this time do not forget you 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.260
 to ask a question and ask the question 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.360
 I asked you this time , too 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.190
 to do the US one last time now 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.690
 you actually find that in us 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.280
 the media too much about the usa 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.470
 I'm told I 'm doing yes 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.150
 also a lot about the usa or said that 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.950
 is a big country there you can do that 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.210
 Do what you think you do 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.710
 can you also like to criticize her 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.410
 can make the holy jerk off what 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.140
 very easy to talk about other countries 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.720
 your opinion, the usa are too omnipresent 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.870
 in the german media about youtube 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.940
 or not curious what you say we are 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.350
 see us again tomorrow morning 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.350
 I do not hear the baker
