00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello to all i'm happy to you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.970
 find in this new basic course 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.280
 free today i'm going to you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.030
 learn to improvise on a 2 5 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.030
 a minor 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.619
 my 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.660
 there is 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.660
 my 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.190
 m 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.910
 so before you start I invite you 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.890
 to download the tablature that is 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.050
 available on my website low morineau 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.380
 dot com or by clicking directly on 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.390
 the link below the video 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.600
 so first what is a 2.5 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.640
 it's a concatenation 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.060
 this grid that I propose to you is in 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.300
 f minor and the degree 2 of F minor is going 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.000
 give us the following agreement five 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.620
 minors that of flights 5 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.220
 degree 5 will give us a back is 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:24.350
 and the degree an infamous 1:07 and this 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.180
 concatenation will be identical in 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.330
 any tonality let's imagine by 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.050
 example of a tale is a 2 5 1 in C 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.250
 minor degree 2 will give us a re 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.250
 minor this pole 5 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:46.320
 degree 5 a single set and degree 1 a 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.270
 domino recipe since we are in 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.160
 below and so on for all 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.970
 the other tone we will always have a 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.800
 minor chord 7 followed by a degree 7 of a 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.770
 but force is forgiveness and agreement 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.850
 minor 7 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 so to improvise on this 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.280
 linking is very simple we are going 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.030
 use a single range the range of fa 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.460
 harmonic minor for a 2 5 ha finally 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.760
 if we have a 2 5 1 in C will be able to use 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.090
 the harmonic minor C range 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.550
 so what is the minor scale 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.570
 harmonic the harmonic 1h range and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.660
 makes following notes tuff at the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.590
 soil tonic 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.320
 the second major of the lab and steals the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.230
 Third Minors May 6th Soft Map 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:45.590
 back the fifth or duration flat the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.590
 sicsbt minors born in the 7th major 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.330
 if we have 2 5 1 in C we will have the same 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:04.980
 fingering water nothing we re e flat 20 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.129
 soles the flat so of oroumieh so of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.129
 after 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.890
 and so the plan that is available in 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.890
 the tablature is the following 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.940
 or 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:32.440
 first measure mi fa sol or play 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.930
 ben ameur so we will play the me 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.430
 Lacoeuilhe normally but we will play 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.430
 do it the ground with the left hand 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.610
 we will then have the lab is soft the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:04:00.980
 cinema the lab is soft the soil but the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:04:03.690
 lighthouse on the second on a day to him 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:10.230
 the reverend or 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:14.030
 the back the cinema the flat the cinema the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.030
 back he's me 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.250
 you play the first two 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:34.110
 third and fourth measurement where the floor 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:46.740
 anemone or soil or a woman's back 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.159
 me so flat off from an abbot theft and 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.979
 then I make a climax during 1 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:57.749
 hour so a very fast sequence 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:05:01.080
 from B flat to glass back I play 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:03.860
 the cyber hall and very quickly I'm doing 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.860
 a link to the whole thing 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:14.040
 and the complete sequence will give or 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.060
 2 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.860
 we 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.139
 with the playback then there I was at 120 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.310
 after three more years 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.310
 we are at 96 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.270
 because 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.070
 he 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.070
 the fastest at 106 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.639
 me 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.639
 or 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.660
 116 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.450
 quick 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.890
 m 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.220
 136 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.740
 146 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.479
 and we can continue to try 156 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:02.979
 and would have finished at 166 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.570
 so that's when you have a 2 5 a 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.790
 minor is still quite common 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.060
 you simply take the range 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.830
 minor harmonic of the tone 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.540
 here I wish you a good weekend 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.230
 and I'll see you soon for a new 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.230
 free courses
