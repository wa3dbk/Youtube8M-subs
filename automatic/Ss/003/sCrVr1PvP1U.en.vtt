hard<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> mod<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> mean<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.170> four

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
hard to do the mod I mean with four

hard to do the mod I mean with four
wires<00:00:25.680> fuck<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:26.609> solder<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.140> you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
wires fuck if you can solder you can you

wires fuck if you can solder you can you
can<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
can do it

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
can do it
I<00:00:28.650> mean<00:00:29.310> well<00:00:29.609> they're<00:00:29.849> not<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.480> that

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
I mean well they're not actually that

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.610 

this<00:00:35.730> motherboard<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.960> fact<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.440> look

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
this motherboard and in fact if we look

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.250 
this motherboard and in fact if we look
on<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> bottom<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.660> this<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> has<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
on the bottom here this is one it has a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.660 
on the bottom here this is one it has a
two<00:00:40.820> NTSC<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.920> right<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.520> has<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
two NTSC you like right there it has a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.180 
two NTSC you like right there it has a
two<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:46.079> battery<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:46.739> camera<00:00:47.070> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
two and my battery on my camera is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.690 
two and my battery on my camera is
already<00:00:47.430> about<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.910> die<00:00:48.410> hkt<00:00:49.410> 30<00:00:49.980> 20<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> think

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
already about to die hkt 30 20 I think

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.910 
already about to die hkt 30 20 I think
that's<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> same<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.840> has<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> first<00:00:52.469> model

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that's the same it has the first model

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.450 
that's the same it has the first model
yeah<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.239> has<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.660> there<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:56.129> most

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
yeah this one has a one there and most

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.160 
yeah this one has a one there and most
of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> tutorials<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.239> found<00:00:57.449> online<00:00:57.570> were<00:00:57.960> for

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
of the tutorials I found online were for

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.779 
of the tutorials I found online were for
the<00:00:58.260> ones<00:00:58.579> like<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> when<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.460> looking

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.210 
the ones like that so when I was looking
all<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.719> parts<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> tour<00:01:04.680> toriel's<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
all the parts on the tour toriel's and I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.130 
all the parts on the tour toriel's and I
saw<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> need<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> steal<00:01:06.240> whatever<00:01:06.750> from

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
saw that you need to steal whatever from

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.530 
saw that you need to steal whatever from
like<00:01:07.590> power<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.100> stuff<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> top

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
like power and stuff are all on the top

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.380 
like power and stuff are all on the top
and<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.229> around<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.680> chip<00:01:11.390> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and it's all right around this chip and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.730 
and it's all right around this chip and
on<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.840> motherboard<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:14.280> true<00:01:15.740> let's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
on this motherboard it's not true let's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
on this motherboard it's not true let's

the<00:02:02.790> fuck<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.270> aren't<00:02:03.450> remember<00:02:04.040> it's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the fuck that is aren't remember it's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.620 
the fuck that is aren't remember it's
got<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> positive<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.909> negative<00:02:05.939> side<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
got a positive and a negative side the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.720 
got a positive and a negative side the
positive<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.170> clearly

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
positive is clearly

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.940 
positive is clearly
but<00:02:08.000> it's<00:02:08.180> back<00:02:08.420> here<00:02:08.750> on<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:09.290> back<00:02:09.320> of<00:02:09.800> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
but it's back here on the back of the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.900 
but it's back here on the back of the
motherboard<00:02:11.020> kind<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.140> next<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.130> where<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
motherboard kind of next to where the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.760 
motherboard kind of next to where the
actual<00:02:14.150> chip<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.630> on<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.020> other<00:02:15.110> side<00:02:15.380> as<00:02:15.620> you

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
actual chip is on the other side as you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.060 
actual chip is on the other side as you
can<00:02:15.890> see<00:02:16.240> kind<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.270> where<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.140> blank<00:02:18.620> spot<00:02:18.860> is

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
can see kind of where a blank spot is

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.140 
can see kind of where a blank spot is
and<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.000> yellow<00:02:20.240> wire<00:02:21.280> which<00:02:22.280> I've<00:02:22.910> also

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
and then the yellow wire which I've also

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.670 
and then the yellow wire which I've also
seen<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.570> yellow<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.020> green<00:02:24.170> wires<00:02:24.440> be

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
seen the yellow and the green wires be

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.200 
seen the yellow and the green wires be
reversed<00:02:25.070> on<00:02:25.310> depending<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> couple

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
reversed on depending on a couple

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.520 
reversed on depending on a couple
different<00:02:26.300> launch<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.170> might<00:02:27.320> want<00:02:27.470> to

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
different launch if so you might want to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.010 
different launch if so you might want to
definitely<00:02:27.950> pay<00:02:28.220> attention<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:29.020> right

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
definitely pay attention to that right

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.570 
definitely pay attention to that right
over<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.900> you'll<00:02:33.110> see<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.980> label<00:02:34.400> I

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
over here if you'll see the label I

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.400 
over here if you'll see the label I
should<00:02:34.850> actually<00:02:35.030> be<00:02:35.240> a<00:02:35.270> macro<00:02:35.840> I'm<00:02:36.110> gonna<00:02:36.260> go

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
should actually be a macro I'm gonna go

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.180 
should actually be a macro I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.620> do<00:02:36.770> there's<00:02:37.610> these<00:02:37.820> three

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
ahead and do there's these three

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.350 
ahead and do there's these three
components<00:02:40.190> here<00:02:40.580> actually<00:02:40.880> there's<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.090> blank

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
components here actually there's a blank

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.050 
components here actually there's a blank
spot<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.980> actual<00:02:43.250> labels<00:02:43.610> for<00:02:43.790> them<00:02:43.940> are

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
spot and the actual labels for them are

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.260 
spot and the actual labels for them are
right<00:02:44.240> here<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.590> says<00:02:45.850> fuck<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:47.000> don't<00:02:47.180> know

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
right here and it says fuck I don't know

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.540 
right here and it says fuck I don't know
somethin<00:02:48.110> 512<00:02:48.800> D<00:02:49.520> 503<00:02:50.210> and<00:02:50.480> D<00:02:50.690> 501<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.370> D

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
somethin 512 D 503 and D 501 and the D

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.610 
somethin 512 D 503 and D 501 and the D
501<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.690> one<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:53.990> you<00:02:54.110> need<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.410> be

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
501 is the one that you need to be

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.530 
501 is the one that you need to be
stealing<00:02:55.160> whatever<00:02:55.640> from<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.120> think<00:02:56.300> it's<00:02:56.420> a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
stealing whatever from I think it's a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.990 
stealing whatever from I think it's a
voltage<00:02:56.930> regulator<00:02:57.260> or<00:02:57.710> I<00:02:58.160> don't<00:02:58.610> fucking

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
voltage regulator or I don't fucking

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.420 
voltage regulator or I don't fucking
know<00:02:59.350> I'm<00:03:00.350> not<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.710> good<00:03:00.860> at<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.100> sort<00:03:01.310> of

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
know I'm not that good at that sort of

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.870 
know I'm not that good at that sort of
stuff

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
stuff

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.960 
stuff
it<00:03:01.940> says<00:03:02.150> S<00:03:02.420> 5<00:03:02.810> on<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.670> you're<00:03:04.790> stealing

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
it says S 5 on it and you're stealing

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.350 
it says S 5 on it and you're stealing
that<00:03:05.240> from<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.510> bottom<00:03:05.870> left<00:03:06.140> leg<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:07.360> the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
that from the bottom left leg of the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.540 
that from the bottom left leg of the
little<00:03:08.660> triad<00:03:09.110> there<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.860> here's<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.340> other

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
little triad there and here's the other

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.870 
little triad there and here's the other
one

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
one

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.340 
one
you<00:03:11.750> see<00:03:12.050> e-50<00:03:12.890> 2<00:03:13.330> which<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.810> think<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.260> a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
you see e-50 2 which is I think it's a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.150 
you see e-50 2 which is I think it's a
capacitor<00:03:16.070> actually<00:03:16.520> maybe<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:18.010> think<00:03:19.010> is

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
capacitor actually maybe I think is

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.320 
capacitor actually maybe I think is
right<00:03:20.320> capacitor<00:03:21.320> diode<00:03:21.740> I<00:03:22.010> don't<00:03:22.190> know<00:03:22.330> but

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
right capacitor diode I don't know but

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.540 
right capacitor diode I don't know but
that's<00:03:23.930> basically<00:03:24.440> what<00:03:24.709> I'm<00:03:24.860> showing<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.220> is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
that's basically what I'm showing you is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.460 
that's basically what I'm showing you is
where<00:03:26.239> those<00:03:26.420> components<00:03:26.870> are<00:03:26.959> in<00:03:27.170> case<00:03:27.350> you

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
where those components are in case you

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.430 
where those components are in case you
cannot<00:03:27.709> find<00:03:28.040> them<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.630> like<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.110> said<00:03:30.170> other

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
cannot find them and like I said other

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.040 
cannot find them and like I said other
than<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.220> other<00:03:31.489> side<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.239> green<00:03:32.780> wire

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
than that the other side the green wire

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.470 
than that the other side the green wire
on<00:03:33.080> line<00:03:33.590> going<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.640> pin<00:03:34.910> fuck<00:03:35.630> 23<00:03:36.489> 24<00:03:37.489> 25<00:03:37.790> 26<00:03:37.940> 27

28<00:03:38.840> pin<00:03:39.830> 28<00:03:40.220> it's<00:03:40.880> like<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.780> sixth<00:03:42.110> one<00:03:42.290> from

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
28 pin 28 it's like the sixth one from

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.949 
28 pin 28 it's like the sixth one from
the<00:03:42.620> right<00:03:42.800> top<00:03:43.390> if<00:03:44.390> you're<00:03:44.510> looking<00:03:44.750> at<00:03:44.840> it

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
the right top if you're looking at it

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.020 
the right top if you're looking at it
like<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.610> it's<00:03:46.610> in<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.850> same<00:03:46.970> spot

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
like that it's in the same spot

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.050 
like that it's in the same spot
obviously<00:03:47.840> it's<00:03:47.989> just<00:03:48.200> sitting<00:03:48.440> on<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.620> top

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
obviously it's just sitting on the top

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.370 
obviously it's just sitting on the top
but

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
but

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.210 
but
yep<00:03:51.220> that's<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.360> four<00:03:52.960> wires<00:03:53.200> that's<00:03:53.980> where

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
yep that's it four wires that's where

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.620 
yep that's it four wires that's where
they<00:03:54.280> are<00:03:54.310> on<00:03:54.610> this<00:03:54.730> motherboard<00:03:55.000> like<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:55.420> said

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
they are on this motherboard like I said

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.690 
they are on this motherboard like I said
this<00:03:55.780> is<00:03:56.790> version<00:03:57.790> 2.1<00:03:58.480> or<00:03:58.840> whatever<00:03:59.580> looks<00:04:00.580> a

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
this is version 2.1 or whatever looks a

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.680 
this is version 2.1 or whatever looks a
little<00:04:00.820> bit<00:04:01.030> different<00:04:01.150> than<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.570> other

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
little bit different than the other

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.470

back here this has a two and I always

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.750 
back here this has a two and I always
thought<00:04:08.590> maybe<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:09.010> twos<00:04:09.220> didn't<00:04:09.580> read

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760

just<00:04:38.170> a<00:04:38.320> specific<00:04:38.860> way<00:04:38.980> that<00:04:39.010> it<00:04:39.250> has<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.490> be

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
just a specific way that it has to be

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.440 
just a specific way that it has to be
burned<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.960> lot<00:04:41.140> of<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.410> self<00:04:41.800> boot<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:43.060> OS

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
burned and a lot of the self boot is OS

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.120

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:04.809 
was a bit of a bummer and I was

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:06.689 
was a bit of a bummer and I was
listening<00:06:05.319> to<00:06:05.349> it<00:06:05.499> it<00:06:05.740> wouldn't<00:06:05.949> boot<00:06:06.129> boot<00:06:06.520> my

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:10.029 
sounds like it you know it checks the

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:11.519 
sounds like it you know it checks the
table<00:06:10.360> of<00:06:10.419> contents<00:06:10.930> and<00:06:11.020> makes<00:06:11.229> a<00:06:11.349> little

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
table of contents and makes a little

don't think there'd be a better spot to

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:39.779 
don't think there'd be a better spot to
take<00:06:37.719> it<00:06:37.870> from<00:06:38.050> but<00:06:38.289> I<00:06:38.529> don't<00:06:39.430> know<00:06:39.490> who<00:06:39.669> -<00:06:39.759> I

know<00:06:39.909> I<00:06:40.149> didn't<00:06:40.389> make<00:06:40.449> the<00:06:40.599> mod<00:06:40.749> ship<00:06:41.020> I<00:06:41.110> just

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:41.259 
know I didn't make the mod ship I just

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.499 
know I didn't make the mod ship I just
fucking<00:06:41.559> put<00:06:41.680> it<00:06:41.830> on<00:06:41.919> there<00:06:42.419> obviously<00:06:43.419> you

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
fucking put it on there obviously you

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:44.939 
fucking put it on there obviously you
want<00:06:43.659> to<00:06:43.689> wrap<00:06:43.870> these<00:06:44.020> in<00:06:44.199> electrical<00:06:44.740> tape

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
want to wrap these in electrical tape

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.049 
want to wrap these in electrical tape
and<00:06:45.099> probably<00:06:45.430> actually<00:06:45.550> tape<00:06:45.879> them

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:46.059 
and probably actually tape them

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:48.779 
and probably actually tape them
somewhere<00:06:46.360> in<00:06:46.419> there<00:06:46.749> cuz<00:06:47.550> you<00:06:48.550> know<00:06:48.639> what

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:48.789 
somewhere in there cuz you know what

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.879 
somewhere in there cuz you know what
that<00:06:48.939> flop<00:06:49.210> around<00:06:49.389> like<00:06:49.659> -<00:06:50.169> I<00:06:50.409> kind<00:06:50.620> of<00:06:50.649> got<00:06:50.800> it

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
that flop around like - I kind of got it

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.260 
that flop around like - I kind of got it
jammed<00:06:51.159> in<00:06:51.279> the<00:06:51.339> corner<00:06:51.669> so<00:06:51.819> it<00:06:51.879> -<00:06:52.029> can't<00:06:52.180> be

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
jammed in the corner so it - can't be

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.959 
jammed in the corner so it - can't be
good<00:06:52.710> but<00:06:53.710> anyway<00:06:54.159> take<00:06:54.430> it<00:06:54.520> easy<00:06:54.610> hope

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:54.969 
good but anyway take it easy hope
