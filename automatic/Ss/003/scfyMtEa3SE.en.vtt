00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
needs to go in a certain order and if

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.580 
needs to go in a certain order and if
you<00:03:51.239> don't<00:03:52.239> do<00:03:52.480> things<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:52.989> that<00:03:53.140> certain

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
order then you may have to just kind of

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.020 
order then you may have to just kind of
turn<00:03:55.810> off<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.050> Machine<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:57.000> retrace<00:03:58.000> your

turn off the Machine and retrace your

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.800 
turn off the Machine and retrace your
steps<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.959> all<00:03:59.440> your<00:03:59.890> steps

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
steps so that all your steps

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.850 
steps so that all your steps
automatically<00:04:01.810> happen<00:04:02.110> correctly<00:04:02.260> it's<00:04:02.590> it's

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
automatically happen correctly it's it's

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.560 
automatically happen correctly it's it's
no<00:04:03.040> big<00:04:03.250> deal<00:04:03.459> really<00:04:03.670> I<00:04:03.850> just<00:04:03.940> had<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:04.330> kind<00:04:04.450> of

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
no big deal really I just had to kind of

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.690 
no big deal really I just had to kind of
figure<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:04.930> out<00:04:05.580> so<00:04:06.580> now<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.180> think<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.900> takes

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
figure that out so now I think it takes

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.370 
figure that out so now I think it takes
you<00:04:09.700> know<00:04:09.790> maybe<00:04:10.030> two<00:04:10.390> or<00:04:10.540> three<00:04:10.600> minutes<00:04:10.900> for

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
you know maybe two or three minutes for

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.460 
you know maybe two or three minutes for
it<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.530> heat<00:04:11.800> up<00:04:11.830> so<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.730> will<00:04:15.660> pause<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:17.350> movie

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
it to heat up so I will pause the movie

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.909 
it to heat up so I will pause the movie
for<00:04:17.890> now<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.340> then<00:04:18.520> we'll<00:04:18.880> edit<00:04:19.870> it<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.350> speed

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
for now and then we'll edit it and speed
