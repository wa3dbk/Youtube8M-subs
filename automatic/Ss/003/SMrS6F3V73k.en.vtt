00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.530
 called for this tablet blog.de I have 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.589
 so brought me into the acer iconia 1 that 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.839
 in germany now 489 euro available 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.580
 is then you want that new tablet 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.470
 over a month ago in new york 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.869
 A press conference was announced 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.339
 and in this video we want the acer 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.169
 iconia a100 we see the packaging 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.869
 are different than the previous ones 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:34.140
 tablet by acer is so brown reminiscent 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.640
 a little bit to the new packaging of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.539
 samsung but good paper 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.430
 more likely to be driving here 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:46.140
 it is such a quick guide 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 on the side then I have her the acer 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.750
 iconia 1 was therefore also short to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.820
 page 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.949
 if we look at what I still here 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.800
 hides in the box is again the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.100
 adapter for such power supplies and here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.989
 with one the power supply itself then one 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.080
 detailed manual as well as one 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.040
 Guarantee certificate and of course 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.210
 another USB 2.0 to micro-usb port 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.340
 so you can use the tablet with yours 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.260
 sync computer or that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.460
 just here comes netstal otherwise 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.760
 good edge that is the packaging of the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.680
 iconia 1 for more interests us though 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.650
 of course the tablet itself that we 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.700
 as I said there are nine inches 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.060
 big and has a resolution of 1024x 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.650
 768 pixel is an ips display and the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.920
 display at the resolution to you 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.070
 Of course, very much the ipad mini we have 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.080
 also a webcam then here on 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.120
 down a micro usb connection and 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.960
 of course, the one exit for that 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.300
 audio kinderseite then nothing more 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.760
 power button up there and here its 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.960
 rocker for the volume micro usb micro 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.540
 sd cards slot untypical company den 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.460
 the microphone and then another 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.590
 hdmi output if you have the acer iconia 1 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.180
 want to connect to a fence because 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.720
 it is quite possible this too 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.740
 tablet 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.420
 to play videos in full-hd 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.820
 Display resolution like that on the tray 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.500
 text not so much sense if now synonymous 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.540
 a TV then outputs but already 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.090
 in the back we still have a 5 megapixel 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.460
 camera and a nice white housing 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.770
 of course, but for the plastic 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.510
 processing of acer iconia 1 is 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.270
 significantly better really much better 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.610
 as the predecessor of the acer iconia b1 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.770
 that will of course be 7 inches tall now 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.020
 but also a revised version in 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.959
 this design will appear in one 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.120
 about the month I think and yes afterwards holds 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.240
 here was especially the back and the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.320
 less memory against everything 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.970
 full of scratches I do not know if it 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.620
 can see a video but it is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.600
 The result was not so well processed 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.280
 the acer iconia 1 as soon as I have 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.500
 in any case it was already possible to see 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.360
 a bit better processed and has 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.910
 also much better as have the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.530
 green 12 ghz core processor of 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.800
 mediatek as well as a gigabyte 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.820
 Memory and 16 GB flash memory 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.959
 As I said, the US will cost 189 euros 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.430
 Also a model with eight gigabytes 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.410
 memory 469 0 169 us dollars appear 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.480
 This version has been Germany so far 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.209
 but not announced and me 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.280
 doubt that the cheaper model 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.560
 because even her great comes but what 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.709
 is coming is a 3d variant that 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.900
 then I should cost my 239 euros and 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.709
 Sometime in June in our stores 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.790
 will stand 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.970
 good as much though had the acer iconia 1 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.220
 Let's switch on the tablet so there I am 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.890
 I have the acer iconia 1 again 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.110
 switched on and with the wlan and in 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.790
 Connected to a google account and 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.650
 also here below a power supply 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.090
 put that in a bit shaky 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.870
 it is not the tablet but the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.970
 power adapter 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.620
 because the batteries empty here one 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.690
 usually it's that too 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.239
 was not the case now but that should be 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.160
 Do not bother us further what the software 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.299
 here the owner sue fast 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:16.139
 want to watch 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:19.669
 here is android 4.2.2011 by r 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.530
 the only one available right now is good 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.240
 and otherwise it has its surface sets 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.360
 not really as good as nothing 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.990
 we have changed only a few 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.419
 widgets here the clock the budget and the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.430
 weather widget here again and else 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.310
 a surface was not changed 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.900
 it just like normal android jelly 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.889
 bean 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.680
 besides, of course, a few are now 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:49.889
 works like tune inn radio battery 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:52.289
 weather the esa cloud.com digital no 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.330
 Great world moving apps you 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:59.039
 now absolutely mcafee security needs 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.080
 is still on it yes it should be hers 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.210
 home as documents so mainly 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.979
 the google apps and a few of your own 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.939
 esa but as I said nothing 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.639
 earth-shattering 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.949
 we just want the browser here 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.439
 start google chrome and then we go 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.099
 now to test if tablet blog.de the 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:19.560
 we have to have it here 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.810
 that should load relatively fast and at 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.539
 scrolling ground so on it should also 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.520
 there are no problems and there is 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.740
 neither 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.520
 boils times liquid me quickly 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.360
 in axel tenant is also there we play 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.729
 now of course I have the 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.560
 display brightness straight down 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.509
 so you're outside of the tablet too 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.379
 rather a bit of what they do not do 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.909
 everything is dark 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:46.500
 but I can screw up the painters 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:49.110
 Grad does not seem to have any sun outside though 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.930
 at the latest tomorrow when the weather is not 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.500
 plays little check if you are on 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.000
 the s1 outside can read 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.149
 as far as I can see it is not quite 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.759
 as bright as the ipad mini but on everyone 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:08.370
 fall in order for such a device yes that 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:13.830
 was a quick hands-on and unboxing 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.389
 by acer iconia a100 at youtube 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.729
 channel here and of course tablet 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.909
 blog.de for a more detailed test 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.189
 over and above all ours 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.620
 compare if it is not the same 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:29.400
 but rewarding lord for lexus to grab back 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.610
 euro costs more if we see then 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.600
 this is slightly wider in 7.92 january than 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.350
 not to pull that 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.620
 well i am i have for tablet pcs too 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.620
 see
