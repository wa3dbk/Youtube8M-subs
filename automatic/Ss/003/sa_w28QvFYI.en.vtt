00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.370
 finish line lead on saturday now 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 already a country hostess meeting in Minsk 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.450
 so out of the non-handshake for the west 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.889
 last dictator of europe alexander 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.079
 Lukashenko has now become 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.240
 but really what he became that 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:18.630
 conceived so now already a fragment 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 from our interview with him c hot 1 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.609
 protocol puzzle order flags 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.500
 wax set what is belarusian 1 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.949
 it's worth it is reasonably different countries 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.070
 and then Russia Germany is not in alphabetical order 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:36.539
 once we turned off one woman 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.149
 one woman and two chief presidents 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:44.780
 characters 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.780
 Well, we are with Peter already so to speak figures 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.309
 that the German fact is in the middle to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.750
 white angel merkel but one woman 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.129
 she should be with Russian with 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 Belarus because sai but we 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.539
 friends we are friends i will be noticed when 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.210
 we became i speak at jewish.ru 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.480
 okay that we are waiting for it very 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.129
 rightly said that if we go deeper 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.810
 look at this problem 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.510
 her guard is kinda curious 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.460
 statistics though on 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.710
 such a imaging story is very 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.780
 uneasy last chapter germanskogo 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.510
 the state visited the Belarusian 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.410
 earth was hitler in forty second year 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.160
 middle head of the French state 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.290
 Generally on the Belarusian was Napoleon 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.300
 1812 now I had a long break in 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.870
 communicating with western leaders what are you 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.100
 seemed mercalli holland honest to you 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:37.370
 I did not expect that I will say good-natured but Hollande 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.560
 ok interesting very good 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.640
 sociable and not really seemed 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.930
 cautious person 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.080
 concerning 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.970
 Angela Merkel, her humanness is 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.310
 ahead of all other qualities though she has 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.260
 these qualities are enough but you are not 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.450
 will deny that thanks to her motor 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.030
 Nastya including and motor Nastya and 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.579
 Compliant Sea Putin achieved 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.409
 final results come on pretty 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.390
 certainly the fact that 11 fourth year 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.280
 Clinton last pass of Belarus to 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.379
 such fun climate leaders first 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.900
 such a but really had was it was 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.550
 with our opposition ninety-third and 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.489
 fourth, I do not remember the year 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.910
 if in the ninety-fourth the day before 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.660
 presidential election just 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.180
 tinting now having established relationships 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.180
 Western leaders are not tempted 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.580
 equal distances away I know so 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.940
 did not say that we have somehow adjusted 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.560
 relationship with them and so on I'm not here 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.569
 line no hope 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.370
 I am absolutely sincere and honest to you 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.730
 Thanks for asking this question 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.360
 I want to say I'm not at that age 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.849
 When people 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.049
 shy away make sharp sharp turns 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:50.150
 and so on I have already seen this and 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.400
 so you know dizzy from what 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.700
 actually my head was spinning from 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.470
 that I was asked to be assigned to 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.080
 after all organize it 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.400
 event 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.490
 God be with you I do not exaggerate the role here 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.800
 Belarus its role as usual not 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.300
 exaggerating so if you think 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.520
 what is the reason for me to turn somewhere 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.710
 get it out of your head with Russian muscles 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.500
 people are much more than lying down and probably 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.390
 not least how would you not think about 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.000
 our relationship with the president of russia we 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.120
 friends are not only my brothers brothers 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.390
 friends here come from this and therefore 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.010
 if someone out there tries to blame me 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.740
 track after our dialogue 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.570
 journalist is not that Lukashenko wants to go out 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.959
 from the Eurasian Union 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.060
 god everything is much easier with you 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.030
 the country does not sign the contract but from 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.430
 which can not go out so if 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.930
 very painful and garlic that is any 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.880
 the contract can be withdrawn including 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.610
 Eurasian accused me 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.880
 but it's usual for me that Lukashenko 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.580
 wants to get out of this contract why should we 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.740
 he is very profitable we are profitable we see 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.650
 perspective in this or some there 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.620
 other insinuations about the Hami ball 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.180
 What a ball Hamitovich thanks for the interview 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.860
 thank you music for hospitality and 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.019
 feel very glad that 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.840
 reporters liked it 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.180
 when a journalist works he hanged here 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.830
 slightly nailed again camera hands 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.270
 went to work next time colleagues 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.120
 to persuade them to sleep a little 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.500
 because we're all here 28 minutes and here i am 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.500
 glad you gave me sleep 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.950
 perceptions
