they<00:02:16.700> almost<00:02:16.880> look<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.420> know<00:02:17.570> very<00:02:18.440> identical

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
they almost look you know very identical

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.750 
they almost look you know very identical
except<00:02:20.000> these<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.360> more<00:02:20.570> privacy<00:02:21.700> points<00:02:22.700> to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
except these have more privacy points to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.160 
except these have more privacy points to
where<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.120> connect<00:02:23.420> our<00:02:23.720> screw<00:02:24.050> your

just snap in like that and then screw
hole<00:02:30.440> lines<00:02:30.740> perfectly<00:02:31.340> I'm<00:02:31.940> pretty<00:02:32.180> much

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
hole lines perfectly I'm pretty much

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.280 
hole lines perfectly I'm pretty much
perfect<00:02:32.860> enough<00:02:33.860> leeway<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:35.630> know<00:02:35.750> get<00:02:36.080> in

perfect enough leeway to you know get in

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.540 
perfect enough leeway to you know get in
there<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.650> then<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:36.860> screw<00:02:37.070> down<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.400> that's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
there and then you screw down and that's

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.930 
there and then you screw down and that's
about<00:02:37.640> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
about it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.740 
about it
so<00:02:38.150> speakers<00:02:38.750> gonna<00:02:38.930> sit<00:02:39.140> right<00:02:39.170> there<00:02:40.750> allows

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
so speakers gonna sit right there allows

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.810 
so speakers gonna sit right there allows
the<00:02:41.930> speaker<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.470> sit<00:02:42.830> out<00:02:42.980> with<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.160> bit<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.550> I

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
the speaker to sit out with a bit so I

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.980 
the speaker to sit out with a bit so I
don't<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.240> worry<00:02:44.420> about<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.720> window

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
don't have to worry about the window

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.110 
don't have to worry about the window
actually<00:02:45.220> rubbing<00:02:46.220> up<00:02:46.400> against<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> magnet

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
actually rubbing up against the magnet

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.730 
actually rubbing up against the magnet
which<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.420> didn't<00:02:47.720> before<00:02:48.230> when<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:48.530> try<00:02:48.709> to

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
which it didn't before when we try to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.610 
which it didn't before when we try to
fit<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.100> speaker<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.550> without<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.590> I

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
fit the speaker and without it so I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.720 
fit the speaker and without it so I
