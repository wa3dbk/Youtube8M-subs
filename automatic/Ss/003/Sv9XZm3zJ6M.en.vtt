00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
I'm not sure the how users will actually

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.229 
I'm not sure the how users will actually
frankly<00:04:02.860> hold<00:04:03.160> up<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.580> this<00:04:04.380> sort<00:04:05.380> of<00:04:05.410> heat<00:04:06.239> but

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
frankly hold up to this sort of heat but

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.479 
frankly hold up to this sort of heat but
everything<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:07.989> connected<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:09.900> very<00:04:10.900> well<00:04:11.080> a

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
everything is connected and very well a

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.210 
everything is connected and very well a
few<00:04:12.489> rubber<00:04:13.150> bands<00:04:13.390> there<00:04:13.660> because<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
few rubber bands there because that the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.150 
few rubber bands there because that the
joints<00:04:16.000> wouldn't<00:04:16.239> fit<00:04:16.829> pissing<00:04:17.829> out<00:04:17.950> all<00:04:18.130> over

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
joints wouldn't fit pissing out all over

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.200 
joints wouldn't fit pissing out all over
bottom<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.660> here<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.320> other<00:04:20.350> side<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:22.030> see

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
bottom and here the other side you see

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.420 
bottom and here the other side you see
all<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.419> ducting<00:04:23.020> gets<00:04:23.350> done<00:04:23.560> with<00:04:23.800> 22

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
all the ducting gets done with 22

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.480 
all the ducting gets done with 22
millimeter<00:04:24.910> copper<00:04:25.270> piping<00:04:26.340> some<00:04:27.340> heat

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
millimeter copper piping some heat

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.270 
millimeter copper piping some heat

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
shielding on the exhaust there and also

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.480 
shielding on the exhaust there and also
so<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.460> can't<00:04:30.760> not<00:04:30.910> seal<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.180> holes<00:04:31.419> in<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:31.750> and

crap<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.040> worn-out<00:05:24.460> or<00:05:25.650> combination<00:05:26.650> of<00:05:26.710> that

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
crap and worn-out or combination of that

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.650 
crap and worn-out or combination of that
and<00:05:27.040> being<00:05:27.190> too<00:05:27.520> big<00:05:27.820> for<00:05:28.030> the<00:05:28.120> bike<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.540> be

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
and being too big for the bike to be

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.470 
and being too big for the bike to be
able<00:05:28.720> to<00:05:28.870> actually<00:05:28.960> turn<00:05:29.290> over<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:30.420> so<00:05:31.420> it

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
able to actually turn over and so it

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.200 
able to actually turn over and so it
just<00:05:31.690> doesn't<00:05:31.870> really<00:05:32.110> work
