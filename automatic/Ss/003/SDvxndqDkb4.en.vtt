00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
did before you don't want to go in too

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.680 
did before you don't want to go in too
deep<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.350> want<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> come<00:00:37.800> out

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
deep because you don't want to come out

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.860 
deep because you don't want to come out
just<00:00:39.690> go<00:00:39.870> down<00:00:40.079> about<00:00:40.350> an<00:00:40.530> inch<00:00:41.540> all<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.600> way

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
just go down about an inch all the way

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.279 
just go down about an inch all the way
around<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.989> then<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:47.969> begin<00:00:48.289> cutting

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
around and then you can begin cutting

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.090 
around and then you can begin cutting
out<00:00:50.510> sections<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.750> fruit<00:00:52.079> maybe<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.680> wider

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
out sections of fruit maybe a wider

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.580 
out sections of fruit maybe a wider
knife<00:00:53.460> wood<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.960> better<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.379> this

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
knife wood is a little better for this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.340 
knife wood is a little better for this
because<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.100> pull<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.520> out<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.350> then

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
because you can pull that out and then

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.899 
because you can pull that out and then
cut<00:00:59.420> the<00:01:00.420> pieces<00:01:00.899> into<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.350> bowl<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.430> cut

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
cut the pieces into a bowl you just cut

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.200 
cut the pieces into a bowl you just cut
out<00:01:06.060> sections<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:08.060> using<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
out sections like this using the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.399 
out sections like this using the
different<00:01:09.600> knives<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.320> make<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.740> easier<00:01:12.409> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
different knives that make it easier to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:32.450 
different knives that make it easier to
to<00:01:13.950> pull<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.490> sections<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> fruit<00:01:21.259> okay

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.670
