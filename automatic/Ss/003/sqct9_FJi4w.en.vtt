00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.570

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.820

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.829
 how to plant it when the time is right 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.140
 so when he stands on the windowsill he 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.359
 let roots and and cars you from this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.570
 Total 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.729
 try to choose and find the most 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.170
 suitable interesting which you have 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.680
 having made it these are the roots that got out 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.130
 with the cutting find the most constructive 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.860
 one that is already ready for landing in 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.950
 open ground and well i'm all trite thing 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.130
 the hoop cut off spilled 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.530
 ground up 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.490
 Vodichkoy tuned certainly not from under 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.939
 Crane for this soil prepared with 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 peat 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:48.000
 for the bag for weathered and everything is trite 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.960
 spilled spilled some water from below you 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.829
 pilots holes for someone else added 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.049
 some water in case of earth must be false 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.320
 I found the most developed 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:06.720
 who are also ready to 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.890
 but the Rusanov variety is what happens 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.450
 After all, these roots are already good ready for 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:19.400
 landing and growth here is significant 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.400
 trite I take 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.550
 and everyone always wears hundreds 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:41.010
 then take a spoon 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:49.230
 great birth it happened just 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:52.440
 put it here they put down 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:03:00.440
 poured winters and put the right to 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:04.160
 south and put on a bright place like this 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.760
 stupid corny removed tomato 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.030
 Two weeks passed, and real estate investors cook mill 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.230
 now we can kill it 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.610
 the reality is that the list could be 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:24.320
 land in the open ground early and 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.320
 it does not hurt so much you all and daughter
