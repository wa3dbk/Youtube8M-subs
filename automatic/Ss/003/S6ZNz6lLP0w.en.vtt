00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.600
 it was necessary everyone is simon c 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.190
 is at exclusive 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.350
 today you will be taught to do a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.380
 case and the few we just have a few 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.389
 info to tell you before then both 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.210
 it's just that for the 100 subscribers we 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.320
 we're going to make a little surprise it's 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.990
 make the head 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.949
 we showed top of mind because for 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.039
 the moment you have not seen anything 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.140
 so that's when we reach and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.570
 no cap o will make this little surprise 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.019
 a new friend will increase our heads 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 so here's more for the job 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.230
 we will tell you two small three 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.460
 advice and after we will do a time lapse 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.559
 to provide what will start and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.149
 after we do a little demo here 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.629
 go jo so the job at first looks like 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.969
 to that's the idea so if you 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.890
 want it going to be two I pass you 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.930
 see but here to dig vertically 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.699
 history that all this land is there 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.079
 more than that makes a hole once 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.399
 you will have made this hole you are going 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.090
 have to put sticks we will you 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.090
 show right away 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.539
 t 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.030
 oh there so we have to finish the hole then 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.820
 that a little advice if you ever have 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.130
 flat terrain if it will force a 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.049
 trenched as we did the story that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.520
 when I arrived at jump bah in fact 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.390
 you would already be deep down 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.189
 make a hill 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.380
 while yeah if for example I know 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.970
 no you have big goal going up and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.360
 it is flat on the floor you 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.340
 no need 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.229
 you jump like this while 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 view that it's flat ground did 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.819
 a trench and after we do the job 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.270
 so now we're going to go to 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.909
 dom so to show you we took 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.560
 sticks like that what you have 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.060
 done first is do you go 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.670
 fill like that tightly a lot 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.080
 a lot of sticks here really 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.299
 a lot a lot you're going to put back 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.319
 a good layer of soil once 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.670
 you will have put the right layer of earth 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.110
 what you are going to do is put back 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.840
 a stick layer but a little less 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.000
 our good fat layer of earth a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.670
 little bit of stick and after a really 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.519
 very beautiful groen after really good 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.500
 layer of land so here after a 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.760
 once you've done that the problem 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.500
 it's going to be that it's going to settle 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.239
 so in this case you will pass 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.100
 to pass it gets cup and it gets cup and 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.220
 you are going to put a lot of land at 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.019
 As it was happening and 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.670
 after a while it will take time 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.019
 better after a while it will be 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.959
 so much you have and that it will be packed 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:40.850
 more what so that's so will increase the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:43.500
 final result is good we finished our 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.340
 so only problem is that one bladi 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.640
 at first we 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.950
 we got there it's sand 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.420
 that's the way we did a little thing about 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.790
 the video you have nothing to see what that 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.959
 hide the keys the only problem we're going 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.930
 tell you right away it's see the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.590
 job is here and we it's flat had 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.620
 no descent 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.700
 but if you do a job is done of 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.470
 to make an inda stone in your skin is 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.330
 than to leave you a flat place to 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.040
 jump and after you go down because 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.760
 like it's not good scratch a 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.120
 flat ground so that's what is it 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.140
 to say others said no to the sea at 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.569
 la rochelle where a new tutorial one jose 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:27.690
 that still is the job but 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.519
 it's a little I do not like so you're 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.519
 lets watch the demo go to more
