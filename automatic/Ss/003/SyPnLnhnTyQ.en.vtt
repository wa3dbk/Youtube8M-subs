00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.129
 make legs 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.110
 besides moreno costanzo who is allowed 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.889
 not contractually against his ex-club 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.769
 play 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.759
 first example why right if necessary 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:25.990
 after 39 seconds forgives bad joke 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.140
 this chance the idea goalie vokoun 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.810
 allows 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.809
 aarau puts enormous pressure into the first 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.780
 Minutes again so a ball in the 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:40.340

 this time , fifth minute will be 1 0 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.180
 first super league goal hits hard 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.480
 be on again or not hard to 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.000
 trends do not see the tall one 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.239
 kroate sits down against ebase 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.429
 highly praised internal defense you from mountains 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.429
 such as lotus super through 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:11.420
 uli forte looks and marvels at the twentieth 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.950
 minute free kick repelled and attention 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.710
 djuric with his leg outstretched 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.490
 steffen referee jaccottet hesitates 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 no moment and shows the sweden red 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.530
 memories of this foul on yapi 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.360
 be awake luckily, djuric still sees 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.230
 a bit back but very clear that is one 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.869
 Red card 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.910
 Djuric over-motivated Steffen can after 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.479
 short care to continue happiness 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.860
 but also aarau comes to ten against the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.520
 weak defense to chance 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.380
 radio and sneak gomez header the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.840
 Ebay did not get caught 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.960
 after 33 minutes will be the first time 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:07.530
 dangerous eckball data guide nuzzolo 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.160
 and bertone shifts yesterday became the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.780
 midfielder 21 of fc aarau acts 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.340
 very agile even in a few extinguishers 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.430
 gigas is catching up 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.459
 Knaller strokes the goal from the individual 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.030
 and 1000 leadership is deserved and too 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.900
 just 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.340
 uli forte must be extremely extreme in the cabin 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.410
 said what ever the ib trainer 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.620
 then it shows effect for the time being 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.590
 shortly after the break, it is like the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.000
 aaraus goalie makes the ball a first 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.000
 parade forces 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.130
 in front of the young boys all have now 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.120
 but owns Chris's fc aarau game very much 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.849
 solidary leaves little to bioware high 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.640
 this remains absolutely ineffective 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.650
 barely usable balls are still a good one 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.790
 quarter of an hour is now inspired 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.890
 play the bernern 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.140
 that is the last act and I finally 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.250
 It can also be good in scene 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.160
 put 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.950
 but given the fact that out of it 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.480
 One of the 20 minutes is outnumbered 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.459
 is that too little compliment but at the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.800
 fc aarau for a very dedicated 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:32.590
 performance defensive 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:37.020
 At the last moment you can throw the 0 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.920
 2 again prevent the young boys 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:50.080
 87 minutes are played 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:53.620
 basta woman balancing who else wlan 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.420
 guide finds the gap finds the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.930
 french one to one now only can 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.560
 Love to exercise pressure properly 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:10.330
 betrayed toni long 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:14.160
 give it to trees is too late 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.530
 just a case for the young boys in aarau 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.750
 Reactions and 2000 area love you 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.400
 but also not convincing and therefore 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.400
 always at the end of the point accept 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.210
 have two days here with the point 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.890
 try this looseness 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.560
 Contributed to what contributed 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.060
 talk and bring meaning to fun 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.230
 that they get confidence again very much 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.960
 a lot of practice where you have many goals 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.130
 do and I think that's the beginning of 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.169
 something nice and that is now 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.270
 Actually , that's what we say slowly 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.919
 build up so many chances but no goal 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.110
 made and knew that someday 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.370
 the band is and it happens today and 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:52.220
 that pleases me very much 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.220
 Aarau and eBay share the points
