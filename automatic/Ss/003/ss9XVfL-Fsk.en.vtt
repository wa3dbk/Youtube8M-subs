I'm actually really loving it I've used

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.320 
I'm actually really loving it I've used
it<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> few<00:01:22.170> times<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.460> feel<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.299> my

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it a few times and I feel like with my

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.719 
it a few times and I feel like with my
hair<00:01:24.720> being<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.170> fine<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.830> got<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.369> really

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
hair being so fine I got to be really

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.130 
hair being so fine I got to be really
careful<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> products<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.930> this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
careful with the products like this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710 
careful with the products like this
because<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.070> hair<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.549> tend<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:29.970> really

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
because my hair can tend to be really

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.569 
because my hair can tend to be really
really<00:01:30.840> heavy<00:01:31.350> or<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:31.920> limp<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
really heavy or be really limp and it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.580 
really heavy or be really limp and it
won't<00:01:32.759> curl<00:01:33.060> very<00:01:33.360> well<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.530> tell

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
won't curl very well but as you can tell

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.560 
won't curl very well but as you can tell
I<00:01:35.040> still<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.729> bit<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.030> movement<00:01:36.240> in

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
I still have a little bit of movement in

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480 
I still have a little bit of movement in
some<00:01:36.810> body<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.320> my<00:01:37.409> hair<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.250> definitely

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
some body to my hair so it definitely

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
some body to my hair so it definitely
didn't<00:01:39.030> leave<00:01:39.150> my<00:01:39.360> hair<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.840> weighted

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
didn't leave my hair really weighted

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.789 
didn't leave my hair really weighted
down<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.610> hair<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.899> frizzy<00:01:43.590> or

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
down so if your hair is really frizzy or

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.330 
down so if your hair is really frizzy or
curlier<00:01:44.610> or<00:01:45.229> maybe<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.409> blonde<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.130> but

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
curlier or maybe it's blonde as well but

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
curlier or maybe it's blonde as well but
it's<00:01:47.490> thicker<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.329> could<00:01:48.509> probably<00:01:48.750> use<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it's thicker you could probably use it a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
it's thicker you could probably use it a
little<00:01:49.590> bit<00:01:49.799> more<00:01:49.979> often<00:01:50.159> than<00:01:50.610> me<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
little bit more often than me but like I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
little bit more often than me but like I
said<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.930> always<00:01:52.110> tricky<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:52.890> hair

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
said it's always tricky with my hair

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.370 
said it's always tricky with my hair
because<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.820> fine<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.170> would

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
because it's so fine so I would

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.429 
because it's so fine so I would
definitely<00:01:55.860> use<00:01:56.600> just<00:01:57.600> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.869> fill<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> out

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
definitely use just kind of fill it out

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.139
