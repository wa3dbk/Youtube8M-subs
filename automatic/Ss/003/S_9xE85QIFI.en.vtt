 you will see that the guitar is a world 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.099
 fascinating the guitar is with us 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.689
 from loneliness from the company 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.570
 sad joys if something I learned 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.910
 with the years of playing guitar is that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.500
 already at the time of knowing never to run 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 we will be able to get rid of it 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.309
 here in this video I'll show you what 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.649
 What are the guitar parts? 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.809
 different types of guitar and uses 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.010
 most common that are given to each type of 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.210
 guitar ok 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 so well let's start well before 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.379
 to start I want to remember you too 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.870
 that this course can be found in 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.969
 dvd for those who want to see it in their 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.920
 house more comfort and they are also going to 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.379
 find on this dvd what videos are 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.180
 extras and extra exercises ok effect 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.520
 Let's start by the parties of the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.729
 guitar all guitars without 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.350
 matter if it's acoustic electric have 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.700
 the following parts the first thing that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.250
 let's find part of the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.820
 guitar that is basically the most 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.400
 great is the body this part 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.300
 which is the one that gives the resonance to all the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.990
 guitar ok 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.600
 this is the body or the box is known from 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.760
 two ways later we have more to the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.970
 seen also what the mast would be 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.090
 mast is all this all this long that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.509
 come is the mast and then we have the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.080
 head or the pegbox now we have the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.080
 ropes 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.340
 we now have what are the frets that 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.259
 all these parts are the bars and 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.350
 finally we have what are the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.240
 pegs well we already know the parts of 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.759
 the guitar now what we 're going to know 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.030
 are the two different types of guitar 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.250
 what is there and its uses to acoustic guitar and 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.200
 good guitar electric guitar 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.030
 acoustics is more commonly known as 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.330
 is 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.490
 the one that has metal cords the body 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.750
 is big 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.940
 and it is reinforced what is the most 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.840
 guitar is used more as for what 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.270
 they are rock styles this folk since 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.020
 It has a brighter sound with more 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.020
 body 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.439
 we also have what would be the guitar 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.499
 classic Spanish the mi is already a little 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:51.319
 really, I taught myself a lot in 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:53.840
 this type of guitar started even 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.700
 with these as well maybe its sound 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.150
 it's not so vibrant it's a sound more 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.400
 soft more calm and there is the difference 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.120
 well, many always ask 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.969
 You can put metal strings and really 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.829
 so you can put it if you can but 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.469
 we can hurt our guitar 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.799
 since the mast does not come reinforced 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:18.230
 even these guitars are lighter 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.689
 and it has nylon strings really the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.359
 side is more occupied as for what they are 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.750
 ballads and others but this does not imply that 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:29.510
 you can not also learn songs from 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.310
 rock and others since maybe it can be 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.669
 easier for those who start having 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:39.189
 one of these since its price is also 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.189
 lower and are more accessible to find 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.830
 ah 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.190
 we can also do the same 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.190
 rhythms 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.090
 really maybe I heard them so 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.459
 brilliant but these guitars really 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.980
 They are very soft and as I say they are very 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.040
 easy to get it ok this leads to 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.450
 strings of what nylon is are very 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.459
 soft 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.099
 and finally we have the guitar 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.599
 electric the electric guitar 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.120
 it really requires a little more 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.489
 budget since apart from buying 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.590
 only the guitar, we need 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.480
 an amplifier and many times also 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.810
 we are what are effect pedals 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.500
 to make those riffs that sound more 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.630
 potent more fluently more punch 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.960
 if they really dominate the guitar 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.030
 acoustic what are rivers and others the 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.450
 past of an acoustic an electric 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.540
 really well it's a piece of cake because 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.060
 the electric is very very smooth and even 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.270
 the mast comes thinner then it 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:53.760
 It makes it easier for us to spend 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.760
 what is the fastest riffs 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.930
 i 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.900
 perfect today we learn then what 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.389
 are the fundamental parts of the 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.889
 guitar and what are the differences in 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.740
 guitar and do we have guitar 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.780
 acoustic that the acoustic guitar is 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.690
 divided into what it is to be Spanish or 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.340
 classic that is and the other that is 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.710
 metal strings we have guitar 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.360
 electrical also the theory is going to be the 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.460
 same in the next video I'm going to 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.889
 teach how to fine tune your 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.320
 guitar since it is the first step that 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.110
 we will give to be able to later learn 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.479
 to play certain rhythms so you can 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.970
 see here in this annotation what is the 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.950
 video to go to the next lesson and 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.530
 also from subscribing here 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.440
 I leave a link so you do not miss every 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:55.240
 video and each lesson so perfect 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.240
 see you in the next video
