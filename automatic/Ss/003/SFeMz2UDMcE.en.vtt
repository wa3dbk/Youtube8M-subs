to be doing my project on so if we pan
down<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:10.920> see<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.309> just<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
Stratocaster sheet body the three single

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.849 
Stratocaster sheet body the three single
coil<00:00:14.549> pickups<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.289> cream<00:00:16.500> body<00:00:16.680> at

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
coil pickups and it's a cream body at

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.560 
coil pickups and it's a cream body at
the<00:00:16.949> moment<00:00:17.279> we're<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.640> white<00:00:17.850> scratch<00:00:18.150> plate

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the moment we're the white scratch plate

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.010 
the moment we're the white scratch plate
I<00:00:18.600> bought<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:18.990> secondhand<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.619> 2005<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> I'm

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I bought this secondhand in 2005 so I'm

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.570 
I bought this secondhand in 2005 so I'm
not<00:00:22.199> sure<00:00:22.260> if<00:00:22.439> everything<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.189> stock

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
not sure if everything is the stock

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.550 
not sure if everything is the stock
hardware<00:00:23.850> I'm<00:00:24.390> pretty<00:00:24.689> sure<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> pickups<00:00:25.350> are

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
hardware I'm pretty sure the pickups are

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.200 
hardware I'm pretty sure the pickups are
I<00:00:25.769> think<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.160> tuning<00:00:26.519> pegs<00:00:26.730> might<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.090> been

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
I think the tuning pegs might have been

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.490 
I think the tuning pegs might have been
changed<00:00:27.539> at<00:00:27.599> some<00:00:27.630> point<00:00:27.990> because<00:00:28.199> there<00:00:28.349> are

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
changed at some point because there are

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.019 
changed at some point because there are
some<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> holes<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.310> been<00:00:29.340> drilled<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.849> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
some of the holes have been drilled in I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.310 
some of the holes have been drilled in I
haven't<00:00:30.330> got<00:00:30.449> any<00:00:30.570> experience<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.170> all<00:00:31.260> with

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
haven't got any experience at all with

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
guitar I've just been looking on the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.830 
guitar I've just been looking on the
internet<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:45.290> fur<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.740> all<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.180> guidance

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
internet for fur and all the guidance

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.319 
internet for fur and all the guidance
that's<00:01:49.020> how<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.149> should<00:01:51.299> be

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that's how to do it so this should be

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.660 
that's how to do it so this should be
interesting<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.140> all<00:01:52.320> together<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.009> the

interesting it's all together and the
pickup<00:01:53.880> does<00:01:54.210> work<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.930> there's<00:01:55.140> this

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
pickup does work but there's this

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
horrible hum that comes from it which

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.420 
horrible hum that comes from it which
shouldn't<00:01:58.229> work<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.070> humbucker

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
shouldn't work because it's a humbucker

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.990 
shouldn't work because it's a humbucker
pickup<00:02:00.049> now<00:02:01.049> I've<00:02:01.140> looked<00:02:01.259> online<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.850> it's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
pickup now I've looked online and it's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.880 
pickup now I've looked online and it's
something<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> grounding<00:02:04.439> issue<00:02:04.770> or

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
something to do a grounding issue or

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.330 
something to do a grounding issue or
something

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
something

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.490 
something
every<00:02:05.820> time<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.030> touch<00:02:06.329> anything<00:02:06.600> metal<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
every time I touch anything metal on the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.460 
every time I touch anything metal on the
guitar<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.369> hum<00:02:08.610> increases<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:10.080> basically

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
guitar the hum increases so basically

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.800 
guitar the hum increases so basically
the<00:02:10.770> hole<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> guitar<00:02:11.819> everything<00:02:12.360> metal

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the hole of the guitar everything metal

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.920 
the hole of the guitar everything metal
it<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.170> part<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> circuit<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.300> what<00:02:15.810> I'm

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
it is part of the circuit so what I'm

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.160 
it is part of the circuit so what I'm
going<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.140> do<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:17.450> take<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> tool<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.840> pieces

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
going to do is take a tool to pieces

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.089 
going to do is take a tool to pieces
again<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:20.400> we'll<00:02:21.209> see<00:02:21.800> see<00:02:22.800> who<00:02:22.920> can

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
again and then we'll see see who can

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.790 
again and then we'll see see who can
solve<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.520> problem<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:25.020> first<00:02:25.349> things<00:02:25.680> first

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
solve the problem so first things first

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.570 
solve the problem so first things first
I<00:02:26.340> need<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.580> take<00:02:26.760> these<00:02:26.910> strings<00:02:27.300> off<00:02:27.480> again

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
I need to take these strings off again

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.330 
I need to take these strings off again
now<00:02:29.580> these<00:02:29.760> are<00:02:30.030> really<00:02:30.300> old<00:02:30.450> strings<00:02:31.340> it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
now these are really old strings it

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.400 
now these are really old strings it
sound<00:02:32.580> horrible<00:02:32.760> some<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.330> them<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.750> fact<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
sound horrible some of them in fact the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.050 
sound horrible some of them in fact the
top<00:02:34.620> strings<00:02:34.980> come<00:02:35.250> off<00:02:35.400> completely<00:02:35.580> it

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
top strings come off completely it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.420 
top strings come off completely it
snapped<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.860> yep<00:02:38.510> undo<00:02:39.510> those<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.160> here

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
snapped so yep undo those and so here

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.259 
snapped so yep undo those and so here
I'm<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.580> taking<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.560> last<00:02:43.560> screws<00:02:44.519> out<00:02:45.140> and

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
I'm just taking the last screws out and

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.590 
I'm just taking the last screws out and
hope<00:02:48.269> for<00:02:48.660> me<00:02:49.580> we'll<00:02:50.580> be<00:02:50.700> able<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.180> inside

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
hope for me we'll be able to see inside

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.830 
hope for me we'll be able to see inside
it<00:02:51.840> now<00:02:52.250> try<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.310> figure<00:02:53.489> out<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> problem<00:02:53.840> so

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it now try and figure out the problem so

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720 
it now try and figure out the problem so
I've<00:02:55.350> just<00:02:55.410> run<00:02:55.769> through<00:02:55.950> all<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> bits<00:02:56.549> we've

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
I've just run through all the bits we've

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.479 
I've just run through all the bits we've
got<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.060> here<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.319> these<00:02:58.590> are<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.890> two<00:02:59.099> single

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
got in here so these are the two single

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.330 
got in here so these are the two single
coils<00:03:00.349> this<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> new<00:03:01.769> humbucker<00:03:02.250> I've

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
coils this is the new humbucker I've

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.490 
coils this is the new humbucker I've
installed<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.560> Seymour<00:03:04.560> Duncan<00:03:04.769> one<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:08.120> so

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
installed the Seymour Duncan one and so

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.970 
installed the Seymour Duncan one and so
these<00:03:10.500> are<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:11.840> tone<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.049> volume<00:03:13.170> parts<00:03:13.709> here

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
these are the tone and volume parts here

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.349 
these are the tone and volume parts here
and<00:03:14.989> volume<00:03:15.989> maintained<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:19.760> my<00:03:20.760> soldering

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
and volume maintained and my soldering

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.940 
and volume maintained and my soldering
is<00:03:21.540> really<00:03:21.900> bad<00:03:22.079> because<00:03:22.350> I've<00:03:22.440> never<00:03:22.560> done<00:03:22.680> it

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
is really bad because I've never done it

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.440 
is really bad because I've never done it
before<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.609> don't<00:03:23.700> know<00:03:23.880> if<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.150> could<00:03:24.390> be

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
before so I don't know if that could be

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.910 
before so I don't know if that could be
the<00:03:24.600> problem<00:03:25.730> but<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.000> mean<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.769> haven't<00:03:28.769> touched

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
the problem but I mean I haven't touched

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.300 
the problem but I mean I haven't touched
these<00:03:29.220> two<00:03:29.519> here<00:03:30.380> so<00:03:31.380> it's<00:03:31.530> obviously

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
these two here so it's obviously

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.809 
these two here so it's obviously
something<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.760> do<00:03:32.880> with<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.209> one<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:35.430> seem

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
something to do with this one you seem

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:43.430 
something to do with this one you seem
to<00:03:36.060> be<00:03:36.180> connected<00:03:37.340> unless<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:42.139> haven't<00:03:43.139> put<00:03:43.290> one

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
to be connected unless I haven't put one

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.259 
to be connected unless I haven't put one
of<00:03:43.530> these<00:03:43.650> Y's<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.250> right<00:03:44.430> place<00:03:44.730> because

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
of these Y's in the right place because

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.960 
of these Y's in the right place because
one<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.780> them<00:03:45.900> came<00:03:46.079> off<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:47.519> stuck<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.940> back

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
one of them came off and I stuck it back

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.449 
one of them came off and I stuck it back
on<00:03:48.299> there<00:03:48.600> unless<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:49.560> supposed<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.889> go<00:03:50.100> back

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
on there unless it's supposed to go back

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.809 
on there unless it's supposed to go back
on<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.700> bit<00:03:51.090> oh<00:03:51.889> it<00:03:52.889> could<00:03:53.160> be<00:03:53.190> something<00:03:53.700> to

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
on that bit oh it could be something to

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.099 
on that bit oh it could be something to
do<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.480> output<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:55.200> read<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:57.109> the

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
do with the output I read that it's the

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.039 
do with the output I read that it's the
the<00:03:58.590> output<00:03:58.769> needs<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.700> be<00:03:59.850> like<00:04:00.060> reversed<00:04:00.750> or

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
the output needs to be like reversed or

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.250 
the output needs to be like reversed or
something<00:04:01.670> I'm<00:04:02.670> not<00:04:02.819> quite<00:04:03.060> sure<00:04:03.170> but<00:04:04.170> anyway

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
something I'm not quite sure but anyway

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.500 
something I'm not quite sure but anyway
I'm<00:04:04.739> going<00:04:04.889> to<00:04:04.950> have<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> look<00:04:05.250> now<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.639> see<00:04:05.700> if

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
I'm going to have a look now and see if

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.750 
I'm going to have a look now and see if
I<00:04:06.600> can<00:04:06.810> figure<00:04:07.079> out<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.319> problem<00:04:07.730> okay<00:04:08.730> I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
I can figure out the problem okay I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.740 
I can figure out the problem okay I
think<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.359> figured<00:04:09.780> out<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.049> problem<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:11.750> for

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
think I figured out the problem and for

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.559 
think I figured out the problem and for
a<00:04:12.810> start<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.620> whole<00:04:13.799> wire<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.310> freed<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:15.299> that

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
a start the whole wire is freed so that

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:22.190 
a start the whole wire is freed so that
needs<00:04:15.750> redoing<00:04:17.419> this<00:04:18.419> bit<00:04:18.930> here<00:04:20.959> it's<00:04:21.959> also

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
needs redoing this bit here it's also

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.820 
needs redoing this bit here it's also
kind<00:04:23.039> of<00:04:23.130> fraying<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:24.690> bit

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
kind of fraying and this bit

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.760 
kind of fraying and this bit
little<00:04:26.159> silver<00:04:26.759> wire<00:04:28.400> seems<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.669> have<00:04:30.770> come

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
little silver wire seems to have come

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.450 
little silver wire seems to have come
off<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.400> solder<00:04:32.879> so<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.889> probably<00:04:35.340> the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
off the solder so that is probably the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.409 
off the solder so that is probably the
problem<00:04:36.020> so<00:04:37.729> okay<00:04:38.729> I'm<00:04:38.909> going<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.150> go<00:04:39.270> ahead

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
problem so okay I'm going to go ahead

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.050 
problem so okay I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:39.690> try<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.080> fix<00:04:40.289> it<00:04:40.500> I'm<00:04:41.250> going<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.610> re

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
and try and fix it I'm going to re

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.439 
and try and fix it I'm going to re
solder<00:04:42.690> all<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.259> bits<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.530> I've<00:04:43.680> done<00:04:43.949> just

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
solder all the bits that I've done just

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:50.089 
solder all the bits that I've done just
going<00:04:45.449> to<00:04:45.599> remove<00:04:48.289> the<00:04:49.289> Y's<00:04:49.470> I've<00:04:49.770> already

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
going to remove the Y's I've already

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:57.320 
going to remove the Y's I've already
sold<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:51.710> redo<00:04:52.710> them<00:04:52.919> and<00:04:55.970> reconnect<00:04:56.970> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
sold it and redo them and reconnect the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.020 
sold it and redo them and reconnect the
little<00:04:57.569> bit<00:04:57.720> that<00:04:57.870> come<00:04:58.110> off<00:04:58.259> and<00:04:59.030> hopefully

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
little bit that come off and hopefully

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.730 
little bit that come off and hopefully
it<00:05:00.270> should<00:05:00.479> all<00:05:00.569> work<00:05:00.599> and<00:05:01.199> I'm<00:05:01.289> going<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.500> tidy

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
it should all work and I'm going to tidy

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.219 
it should all work and I'm going to tidy
up<00:05:01.860> these<00:05:01.979> wires<00:05:02.280> here<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:03.750> I'm<00:05:03.810> just<00:05:03.870> going<00:05:04.169> to

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
up these wires here so I'm just going to

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.070 
up these wires here so I'm just going to
melt<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:04.979> bit<00:05:05.219> of<00:05:05.280> solder<00:05:05.629> so<00:05:06.629> I've<00:05:06.750> managed

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
melt this bit of solder so I've managed

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.240 
melt this bit of solder so I've managed
to<00:05:07.110> D<00:05:07.800> solder<00:05:08.340> this<00:05:08.669> green<00:05:08.969> wire<00:05:09.180> here<00:05:09.629> and<00:05:10.250> I'm

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
to D solder this green wire here and I'm

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.709 
to D solder this green wire here and I'm
just<00:05:11.280> going<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:12.979> cut<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:15.840> end<00:05:16.020> off<00:05:16.229> and

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
just going to cut the the end off and

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:27.709 
just going to cut the the end off and
rewire<00:05:18.719> it<00:05:19.909> just<00:05:20.909> gonna<00:05:21.090> oh<00:05:24.500> okay<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:26.719> I'm

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
rewire it just gonna oh okay and I'm

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.730 
rewire it just gonna oh okay and I'm
going<00:05:27.870> to<00:05:27.930> peel<00:05:28.229> back<00:05:28.289> some<00:05:28.469> fresh<00:05:29.039> Y<00:05:29.280> for<00:05:29.580> this

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
going to peel back some fresh Y for this

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.570 
going to peel back some fresh Y for this
I'm<00:05:31.740> going<00:05:31.949> to<00:05:32.039> be<00:05:32.159> solder<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:34.310> green<00:05:35.310> wire

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
I'm going to be solder the green wire

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.629 
I'm going to be solder the green wire
and<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.509> bare<00:05:36.719> wire<00:05:37.020> silver<00:05:37.680> one<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:38.460> the

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
and the the bare wire silver one to the

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.689 
and the the bare wire silver one to the
top<00:05:39.210> volume<00:05:39.419> pot<00:05:39.840> here<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.259> then<00:05:41.159> I<00:05:41.490> don't

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
top volume pot here and then I don't

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.269 
top volume pot here and then I don't
need<00:05:41.880> these<00:05:42.060> two<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.979> red<00:05:43.979> or<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.159> white

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
need these two the red or the white

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.950 
need these two the red or the white
because<00:05:44.610> I<00:05:44.789> haven't<00:05:45.029> got<00:05:45.150> a<00:05:45.180> push<00:05:45.389> switch<00:05:45.690> and

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
because I haven't got a push switch and

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.939 
because I haven't got a push switch and
then<00:05:46.680> put<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.610> black<00:05:48.180> one<00:05:48.360> back<00:05:48.659> to<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:49.080> 5-way

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
then put the black one back to the 5-way

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.010 
then put the black one back to the 5-way
switch<00:05:49.979> ivory<00:05:50.940> soldered<00:05:51.449> all<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.870> these

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
switch ivory soldered all of these

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.149 
switch ivory soldered all of these
connections<00:05:52.650> so<00:05:53.219> two<00:05:53.639> here<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:54.949> the<00:05:55.949> green

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
connections so two here and the green

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.809 
connections so two here and the green
and<00:05:56.219> silver<00:05:56.940> one<00:05:57.270> to<00:05:57.509> the<00:05:58.080> volume<00:05:58.590> pot<00:05:58.819> so

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819 
and silver one to the volume pot so

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.640 
and silver one to the volume pot so
hopefully<00:06:00.330> it<00:06:00.599> should<00:06:00.870> all<00:06:01.020> work<00:06:01.169> now<00:06:01.409> and

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
hopefully it should all work now and

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.990 
hopefully it should all work now and
I've<00:06:01.740> just<00:06:01.770> added<00:06:02.099> that<00:06:02.279> these<00:06:02.430> wires<00:06:02.669> round

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
I've just added that these wires round

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.260 
I've just added that these wires round
here<00:06:03.360> and<00:06:04.310> so<00:06:05.310> I<00:06:05.340> just<00:06:05.490> need<00:06:05.639> to<00:06:05.669> now<00:06:05.909> put<00:06:06.180> it

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
here and so I just need to now put it

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.650 
here and so I just need to now put it
all<00:06:06.360> together<00:06:06.509> and<00:06:06.900> test<00:06:07.409> it
