00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
okay so there's half of the pods radish

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.810 
okay so there's half of the pods radish
pods<00:01:41.300> I<00:01:41.960> was<00:01:42.440> really<00:01:42.770> amazed<00:01:43.070> when<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.370> seen

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
pods I was really amazed when I seen

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.660 
pods I was really amazed when I seen
these<00:01:44.090> pods<00:01:44.390> come<00:01:44.720> on<00:01:44.870> these<00:01:45.080> plants<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:46.490> was

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
these pods come on these plants it was

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.670 
these pods come on these plants it was
really<00:01:47.120> something<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.660> watch<00:01:47.780> them<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:48.500> watch

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
really something to watch them and watch

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.860 
really something to watch them and watch
them<00:01:48.890> grow<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:50.180> guess<00:01:50.390> they<00:01:50.630> are

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
them grow and and I guess they are

them grow and and I guess they are
edible<00:01:51.110> early<00:01:51.740> on<00:01:51.890> when<00:01:52.160> in<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.490> green<00:01:52.730> stage

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
edible early on when in the green stage

take me a long time to go through all

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.310 
take me a long time to go through all
these<00:03:12.050> pods<00:03:13.360> I'm<00:03:14.360> not<00:03:14.540> gonna<00:03:14.720> worry<00:03:14.959> about<00:03:15.170> the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
these pods I'm not gonna worry about the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.470 
these pods I'm not gonna worry about the
pod<00:03:15.530> when<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:15.980> plant<00:03:16.370> them<00:03:16.489> I'll<00:03:17.060> just<00:03:17.120> probably

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
pod when I plant them I'll just probably

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.500 
pod when I plant them I'll just probably
open<00:03:17.840> them<00:03:17.959> up<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.290> throw<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.830> ground

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
cuz they'll be just fine just a little

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.670 
cuz they'll be just fine just a little
bit<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.459> trash<00:03:22.780> won't<00:03:23.780> hurt<00:03:24.110> when<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.410> plant

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
bit of trash won't hurt when you plant

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.630 
bit of trash won't hurt when you plant
them

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.869 

so<00:03:28.640> yeah<00:03:28.879> they're<00:03:29.209> there<00:03:29.920> they<00:03:30.920> look<00:03:31.129> nice<00:03:31.400> the

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
so yeah they're there they look nice the

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.550 
so yeah they're there they look nice the
radish<00:03:32.180> seeds<00:03:32.510> look<00:03:32.810> real<00:03:33.080> good<00:03:35.410> looks<00:03:36.410> like

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
radish seeds look real good looks like

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.150 
radish seeds look real good looks like
there's<00:03:36.739> three<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:37.129> four<00:03:37.370> in<00:03:37.580> each<00:03:37.730> pod<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:39.500> far

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
there's three to four in each pod so far

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.759 
there's three to four in each pod so far
I<00:03:40.660> suppose<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.810> bigger<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.200> pod<00:03:42.379> you<00:03:42.620> know

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
I suppose the bigger the pod you know

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.770 
I suppose the bigger the pod you know
the<00:03:42.980> more<00:03:43.190> seeds<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.879> smaller<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.540> father

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
the more seeds and smaller and father

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.710 
the more seeds and smaller and father
less<00:03:45.140> seeds<00:03:45.849> so<00:03:46.849> as<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.120> can<00:03:47.239> see<00:03:47.299> I'm<00:03:47.540> gonna

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
less seeds so as you can see I'm gonna

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.770 
less seeds so as you can see I'm gonna
have<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.900> lot<00:03:48.140> of<00:03:48.170> cherry<00:03:48.709> bell<00:03:48.950> radish<00:03:49.400> seeds

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780
