00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
like the Scarlet Witch effects this does

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.510 
like the Scarlet Witch effects this does
really<00:01:37.900> take<00:01:38.229> in<00:01:38.380> light<00:01:38.620> very<00:01:38.950> well<00:01:39.010> and

this<00:03:03.310> kind<00:03:03.519> of<00:03:03.670> weird<00:03:03.909> but<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.510> doesn't<00:03:04.810> look

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
this kind of weird but it doesn't look

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.780 
this kind of weird but it doesn't look
bad<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.680> something's<00:03:06.219> just<00:03:06.340> weird

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
bad it's just something's just weird

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.460 
bad it's just something's just weird
with<00:03:06.939> the<00:03:07.060> eyes<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.629> don't<00:03:07.780> know<00:03:08.019> let<00:03:08.290> me<00:03:08.349> know

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
with the eyes I don't know let me know

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.199 
with the eyes I don't know let me know
what<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.709> think<00:03:08.889> but<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.730> think<00:03:09.939> the<00:03:10.000> flesh

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
what you think but I think the flesh

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.490 
what you think but I think the flesh
tone<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.569> a<00:03:10.599> little<00:03:10.840> on<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:10.959> light-colored

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
tone is a little on the light-colored

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.740 
tone is a little on the light-colored
side<00:03:11.919> which<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.400> guess<00:03:12.549> is<00:03:12.669> OK<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.389> mystic

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
side which I guess is OK for the mystic

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.899 
side which I guess is OK for the mystic
arts<00:03:13.930> master<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.980> then<00:03:15.310> right<00:03:15.519> here<00:03:15.549> on<00:03:15.700> the

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
arts master and then right here on the

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.970 
arts master and then right here on the
side<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.239> have<00:03:16.269> his<00:03:16.510> gray<00:03:16.750> hairs<00:03:17.079> and<00:03:17.290> some

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
side you have his gray hairs and some

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.379 
side you have his gray hairs and some
black<00:03:18.220> mixed<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:18.730> there<00:03:18.879> too

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
black mixed in there too

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.509 
black mixed in there too
just<00:03:19.810> looking<00:03:20.049> okay<00:03:20.349> you<00:03:20.560> know<00:03:20.680> not<00:03:20.950> sure<00:03:20.980> that

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
just looking okay you know not sure that

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.309 
just looking okay you know not sure that
that's<00:03:21.730> on<00:03:21.909> purpose<00:03:22.269> or<00:03:22.389> not<00:03:22.419> but<00:03:22.840> doesn't

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
that's on purpose or not but doesn't

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.869 
that's on purpose or not but doesn't
look<00:03:23.379> bad<00:03:23.620> there's<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.069> look<00:03:24.189> at<00:03:24.340> our<00:03:24.430> brand<00:03:24.760> new

upper<00:03:25.180> torso<00:03:25.419> over<00:03:25.870> here<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.260> think<00:03:26.319> this

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
upper torso over here and I think this

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.740 
upper torso over here and I think this
is<00:03:26.769> brilliant<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.250> really<00:03:27.790> like<00:03:27.969> this<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.209> lot<00:03:28.540> it

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
is brilliant I really like this a lot it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.020 
is brilliant I really like this a lot it
just<00:03:28.780> matches<00:03:29.319> dr.<00:03:29.680> strange<00:03:29.980> very<00:03:30.280> well<00:03:30.549> they

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
just matches dr. strange very well they

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.729 
just matches dr. strange very well they
could<00:03:31.209> use<00:03:31.389> this<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.750> different<00:03:31.900> figures<00:03:32.409> -

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
could use this for different figures -

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.020 
could use this for different figures -
you<00:03:32.950> know<00:03:33.069> because<00:03:33.310> dr.<00:03:33.579> strange<00:03:33.790> isn't

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
you know because dr. strange isn't

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.369 
you know because dr. strange isn't
supposed<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.299> be<00:03:34.419> scrawny<00:03:34.810> but<00:03:35.200> he's<00:03:35.290> not

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
supposed to be scrawny but he's not

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.229 
supposed to be scrawny but he's not
supposed<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.650> be<00:03:35.769> ultra<00:03:36.189> yoked<00:03:36.609> you<00:03:36.939> know<00:03:37.060> and

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
supposed to be ultra yoked you know and

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.640 
supposed to be ultra yoked you know and
you<00:03:37.359> still<00:03:37.599> get<00:03:37.719> the<00:03:37.870> wrinkles<00:03:38.230> right<00:03:38.379> there

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
you still get the wrinkles right there

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.229 
you still get the wrinkles right there
so<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:38.919> looks<00:03:38.979> like<00:03:39.159> he's<00:03:39.370> wearing<00:03:39.549> a<00:03:39.790> jacket

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
so it looks like he's wearing a jacket

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.789 
so it looks like he's wearing a jacket
or<00:03:40.269> whatever<00:03:40.659> I<00:03:40.930> think<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.530> is<00:03:41.650> really

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
or whatever I think this is really

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.469 
or whatever I think this is really
cool-looking<00:03:42.129> I<00:03:42.669> think<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:42.970> paint<00:03:43.209> came<00:03:43.329> out

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:43.479 
cool-looking I think the paint came out

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.089 
cool-looking I think the paint came out
pretty<00:03:43.690> good<00:03:43.900> too<00:03:44.199> so<00:03:44.440> they<00:03:44.560> got<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.739> couple<00:03:45.010> of

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
pretty good too so they got a couple of

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.830 
pretty good too so they got a couple of
coats<00:03:45.310> on<00:03:45.549> there<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:46.060> know<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.389> it's<00:03:46.540> not<00:03:46.629> too

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
coats on there you know so it's not too

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.930 
coats on there you know so it's not too
bad<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.379> like<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.799> looking<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.549> back<00:03:48.729> of<00:03:48.849> it

bad I like it looking on the back of it

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.129 
bad I like it looking on the back of it
there's<00:03:49.090> no<00:03:49.150> paint<00:03:49.449> or<00:03:49.599> anything<00:03:49.750> but<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.049> can

I like how it you can see the definition

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.099 
I like how it you can see the definition
of<00:03:53.859> his<00:03:53.979> back<00:03:54.220> even<00:03:54.609> through<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.540> cloth<00:03:55.780> you

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.420 
of his back even through the cloth you
know<00:03:56.229> I<00:03:56.260> mean<00:03:56.590> he's<00:03:56.739> doesn't<00:03:56.889> have<00:03:57.129> actual

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430

know I mean he's doesn't have actual
cloth<00:03:57.639> over<00:03:57.849> here<00:03:58.150> but<00:03:58.659> it<00:03:58.900> has<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.439> effect<00:03:59.620> of
