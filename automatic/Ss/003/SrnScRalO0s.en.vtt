enable<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.579> super

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
enable I really this is like super

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.630 
enable I really this is like super
important<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.860> very<00:00:38.250> easy<00:00:39.980> in<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.219> case<00:00:41.430> I

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
important it's very easy in my case I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.489 
important it's very easy in my case I
reduce<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> camera<00:00:42.390> rotation<00:00:42.870> speed<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:43.499 
reduce the camera rotation speed to

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.380 
reduce the camera rotation speed to
lower<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.399> found<00:00:44.579> too<00:00:44.850> fast<00:00:45.120> for

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
lower because I found too fast for

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.110 
lower because I found too fast for
nothing<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.929> the<00:00:46.350> camera<00:00:46.620> max<00:00:46.859> distance<00:00:47.309> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
nothing and the camera max distance you

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.750 
nothing and the camera max distance you
can<00:00:48.239> release<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.809> usually<00:00:49.289> set<00:00:49.499> around<00:00:49.859> 65%<00:00:50.339> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
can release I usually set around 65% you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.700 
can release I usually set around 65% you
can<00:00:50.909> set<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.569> want<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:52.019> really

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
can set more if you want to be really

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.770 
can set more if you want to be really
far<00:00:52.920> behind<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.550> really<00:00:53.819> necessary<00:00:54.300> my

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
far behind it's not really necessary my

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.439

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
instead of using the lock quick slit

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.990 
instead of using the lock quick slit
over<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:52.380> use<00:01:52.620> in<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.310> bar<00:01:53.460> itself<00:01:53.790> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
over here just use in the bar itself you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.240 
over here just use in the bar itself you
have<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.150> lock<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.260> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.680> click<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.100> and

have a lock so you can just click it and
I<00:01:56.370> click<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.060> much<00:01:57.360> easier<00:01:57.690> than<00:01:57.840> just

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
I click it it's much easier than just

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.570

need this unless you're actually a Dark
Jedi<00:03:43.979> or<00:03:44.729> something<00:03:45.139> so<00:03:46.139> yeah<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:46.709> our

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
Jedi or something so yeah and our

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.069 
Jedi or something so yeah and our
shoulder<00:03:47.370> gets<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.639> bar<00:03:47.819> alright<00:03:48.540> now<00:03:48.780> for<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
shoulder gets a bar alright now for the

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:49.969 
shoulder gets a bar alright now for the
legacy<00:03:49.560> title

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
legacy title

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.460 
legacy title
I<00:03:50.329> guess<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.449> bar<00:03:51.629> you<00:03:51.720> can<00:03:51.810> actually<00:03:52.169> turn<00:03:52.319> it

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
I guess the bar you can actually turn it

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.960 
I guess the bar you can actually turn it
off<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.709> guess<00:03:52.739> because<00:03:53.129> it's<00:03:53.459> gonna<00:03:53.609> use<00:03:53.819> this

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
off I guess because it's gonna use this

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.399 
off I guess because it's gonna use this
right<00:03:54.150> now<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.569> shows<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:55.229> what
