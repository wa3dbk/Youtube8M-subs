00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540 

-<00:00:00.329> look<00:00:00.570> at<00:00:00.780> how<00:00:01.350> information<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:02.250> processed

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
- look at how information is processed

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.670 
- look at how information is processed
and<00:00:02.970> from<00:00:03.179> where<00:00:03.389> it's<00:00:03.540> flowing<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.290> this

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
and from where it's flowing and this

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.470 
and from where it's flowing and this
makes<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.069> difference<00:00:05.100> what<00:00:05.940> researchers

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
makes a difference what researchers

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.059 
makes a difference what researchers
found<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.080> between<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.529> prefrontal

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
found is that between the prefrontal

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.669 
found is that between the prefrontal
cortex<00:00:08.130> for<00:00:08.940> rational<00:00:09.360> processing<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
cortex for rational processing and the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.490 
cortex for rational processing and the
limbic<00:00:10.920> system<00:00:11.070> there's<00:00:12.059> lots<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.929> lots<00:00:13.019> and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
limbic system there's lots and lots and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.839 
limbic system there's lots and lots and
lots<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.889> connections<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.700> these

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
lots of connections and these

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.269 
lots of connections and these
connections<00:00:15.330> are<00:00:15.450> fast<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:16.949> whatever

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
connections are fast so whatever

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.950 
connections are fast so whatever
happened<00:00:17.699> fear<00:00:18.000> will<00:00:18.270> influence<00:00:18.720> what

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
happened fear will influence what

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.390 
happened fear will influence what
happens<00:00:18.990> there<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.800> other<00:00:19.949> way<00:00:20.070> around

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
happens there and the other way around

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.759 
happens there and the other way around
but<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> influence<00:00:21.750> from<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> limbic<00:00:22.410> system

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
but the influence from the limbic system

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.970 
but the influence from the limbic system
is<00:00:22.920> stronger<00:00:23.460> there's<00:00:24.150> two<00:00:24.390> things<00:00:24.830> that<00:00:25.830> have

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
is stronger there's two things that have

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.390 
is stronger there's two things that have
been<00:00:26.160> really<00:00:26.840> scientifically<00:00:27.840> proven<00:00:28.410> lately

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
been really scientifically proven lately

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.810 
been really scientifically proven lately
and<00:00:29.640> there's<00:00:30.179> no<00:00:30.449> doubt<00:00:30.840> about<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.820> when

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and there's no doubt about it when

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.020 
and there's no doubt about it when
people<00:00:33.180> are<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.450> reward<00:00:33.870> state<00:00:34.910> dopamine<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
people are in a reward state dopamine is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.389 
people are in a reward state dopamine is
released<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> very

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
released and this will have a very

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.479 
released and this will have a very
positive<00:00:38.760> impact<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.800> functioning<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
positive impact on the functioning of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.639 
positive impact on the functioning of
the<00:00:41.700> prefrontal<00:00:42.090> cortex<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.870> people<00:00:43.260> who<00:00:43.410> are

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the prefrontal cortex so people who are

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.340 
the prefrontal cortex so people who are
in<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.950> good<00:00:44.129> mood<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:44.879> feeling<00:00:45.360> well<00:00:45.570> will

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
in a good mood and are feeling well will

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.220 
in a good mood and are feeling well will
perform<00:00:46.890> better<00:00:47.480> obviously<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.989> take<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
perform better obviously you take a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.100 
perform better obviously you take a
stupid<00:00:49.559> person<00:00:50.070> put<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> person<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.809> good

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
stupid person put that person in a good

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.630 
stupid person put that person in a good
mood<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.350> won't<00:00:52.829> help<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.399> performance

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
mood that won't help your performance

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.510 
mood that won't help your performance
you<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:55.199> based<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:55.949> personal

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you it's based on your personal

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.369 
you it's based on your personal
potential<00:00:57.000> ok<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.690> saying<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.050> makes<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
potential ok I'm not saying it makes you

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.930 
potential ok I'm not saying it makes you
smarter<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.100> saying<00:00:59.309> based<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.730> what

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
smarter I'm just saying based on what

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.009 
smarter I'm just saying based on what
you<00:01:00.090> got<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.930> makes<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.410> function<00:01:01.859> better<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
you got it makes you function better and

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.980 
you got it makes you function better and
the<00:01:04.339> sad<00:01:05.339> thing<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.150> when<00:01:06.299> people<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.810> in

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the sad thing is that when people are in

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.320 
the sad thing is that when people are in
a<00:01:07.110> threat<00:01:07.409> mode<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.430> often<00:01:08.880> people<00:01:09.090> at

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
a threat mode and very often people at

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
a threat mode and very often people at
work<00:01:09.479> are<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:09.960> red<00:01:10.200> mode<00:01:10.409> because

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
work are in this red mode because

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
work are in this red mode because
there's<00:01:10.890> lots<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.280> unpleasant<00:01:11.930> stressful

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
there's lots of unpleasant stressful

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.880 
there's lots of unpleasant stressful
situations<00:01:17.960> once<00:01:18.960> you're<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.290> threat<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.770> your

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
situations once you're in threat to your

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.370 
situations once you're in threat to your
prefrontal<00:01:20.280> cortex<00:01:20.790> shuts<00:01:21.030> off<00:01:21.240> why<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
prefrontal cortex shuts off why is that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.539 
prefrontal cortex shuts off why is that
so<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.280> threat<00:01:23.580> situation<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
so in a threat situation we have a

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.289 
so in a threat situation we have a
mechanism<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.729> think<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.270> have

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
mechanism that I think you all have

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.120 
mechanism that I think you all have
heard<00:01:27.600> about<00:01:27.780> fight<00:01:28.500> or<00:01:28.740> flight<00:01:29.040> or<00:01:29.340> freeze

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
heard about fight or flight or freeze

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
heard about fight or flight or freeze
when<00:01:32.130> you're<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.520> dangerous<00:01:32.909> situation

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
when you're in a dangerous situation

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.030 
when you're in a dangerous situation
it's<00:01:33.810> important<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> make<00:01:34.590> quick<00:01:35.009> decisions

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it's important to make quick decisions

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.550 
it's important to make quick decisions
you<00:01:35.820> don't<00:01:36.000> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> think<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.720> ten<00:01:37.259> different

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you don't want to think of ten different

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
you don't want to think of ten different
solutions<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.490> escaping<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.060> tiger<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.600> just

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
solutions of escaping a tiger you just

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.609 
solutions of escaping a tiger you just
run<00:01:40.250> okay<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> social<00:01:42.299> situations<00:01:42.990> kick<00:01:43.380> off

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
run okay and social situations kick off

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.120 
run okay and social situations kick off
our<00:01:44.159> threat<00:01:44.780> circuit<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.680> they<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:46.979> not

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
our threat circuit but they are not

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
our threat circuit but they are not
really<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.640> danger<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.180> our<00:01:48.329> life<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.110> we

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
really a danger to our life but we

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.410 
really a danger to our life but we
experience<00:01:49.979> them<00:01:50.159> our<00:01:50.280> brain<00:01:50.610> processes<00:01:51.149> them

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
experience them our brain processes them

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.469 
experience them our brain processes them
just<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.530> somebody<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.280> about<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.000> kill<00:01:54.240> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
just as if somebody is about to kill you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.270 
just as if somebody is about to kill you
you<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:55.259> experience<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.829> bad<00:01:56.009> relationship

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
you can experience a bad relationship

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.679 
you can experience a bad relationship
like<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> threat

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
like a threat

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.350 
like a threat
and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.380> brain<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:59.369> dis<00:01:59.790> activate

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and then your brain will dis activate

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.420 
and then your brain will dis activate
the<00:02:00.540> prefrontal<00:02:00.869> cortex<00:02:00.960> thinking<00:02:01.920> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the prefrontal cortex thinking you
