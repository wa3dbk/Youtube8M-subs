bit where you can reach around to the
other<00:00:23.820> side<00:00:23.910> now<00:00:25.070> you'll<00:00:26.070> always<00:00:26.279> get<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
other side now you'll always get a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.839 
other side now you'll always get a
little<00:00:26.730> bit<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.060> wear<00:00:27.210> spots<00:00:27.570> around<00:00:27.779> here<00:00:28.849> so

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
little bit of wear spots around here so

you want to and the doorknobs are
designed<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.360> there's<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> little<00:00:33.899> bit<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
designed that there's a little bit of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.780 
designed that there's a little bit of
play<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:34.920> they<00:00:35.070> will<00:00:35.250> move<00:00:35.430> up<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
play in them so they will move up and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.410 
play in them so they will move up and
down<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.180> they<00:00:36.300> are<00:00:36.420> loose<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:38.149> what<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> want

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
of the doorknob with your hand now if

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
of the doorknob with your hand now if
I'm<00:00:45.360> right-handed<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.350> me<00:00:46.590> use<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.890> left<00:00:47.160> hand

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
I'm right-handed so me use my left hand

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to hold the back side and then I can

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.910 
to hold the back side and then I can
position<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.100> door<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.559> covering

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
position that door so that it's covering

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.299 
position that door so that it's covering
up<00:00:53.100> anywhere<00:00:53.730> rings<00:00:54.469> that<00:00:55.469> are<00:00:55.649> caused<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

up anywhere rings that are caused on the
surface<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> door<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.449> don't<00:00:57.840> want

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
surface of the door so we don't want

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.439 
surface of the door so we don't want
that<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.289> show<00:00:58.500> after<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:58.980> tighten<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.340> up

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
that to show after we tighten that up

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.930 
that to show after we tighten that up
now<00:01:00.449> most<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.350> doorknob<00:01:02.010> handles<00:01:02.699> are

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

such as this which is just a standard
screwdriver<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:41.180> then<00:01:42.180> we'll<00:01:42.420> work<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.810> one

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
screwdriver and then we'll work on one

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.380 
screwdriver and then we'll work on one
side<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.619> keeping<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.180> located<00:01:45.180> where<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
side so keeping it located where you

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.840 
side so keeping it located where you
want<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.960> want<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.220> tighten<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> up

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
want it you want to just tighten that up

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.630 
want it you want to just tighten that up
so<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.420> snug<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:49.229> important<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> over

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so it's snug it's important not to over

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.410 
so it's snug it's important not to over
tighten<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.810> don't<00:01:52.020> want<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:54.390> don't

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
tighten this you don't want to you don't

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.539 
tighten this you don't want to you don't
want<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.780> strip<00:01:54.960> out<00:01:55.170> these<00:01:55.380> screws<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.340> make

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
want to strip out these screws and make

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.670 
want to strip out these screws and make
them<00:01:56.700> difficult<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.170> want<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.530> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
them difficult so what you want to do is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080 
them difficult so what you want to do is
you<00:01:58.799> want<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> put<00:01:59.159> enough<00:01:59.369> pressure<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you want to put enough pressure and you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.910 
you want to put enough pressure and you
want<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.540> snug<00:02:00.810> these<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.770> so

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
want to just snug these up just so

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.520 
want to just snug these up just so
there's<00:02:02.130> no<00:02:02.340> more<00:02:02.579> movement<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.320> then<00:02:04.320> also

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
there's no more movement and then also

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.350 
there's no more movement and then also
before<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.159> close<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.670> door<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> good

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
before you close the door it's a good

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.260 
before you close the door it's a good
idea<00:02:06.719> once<00:02:06.930> you've<00:02:07.110> snug<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:08.000> go<00:02:09.000> ahead

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
idea once you've snug this up go ahead

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.880 
idea once you've snug this up go ahead
and<00:02:09.360> rotate<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.899> few<00:02:10.080> times<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.800> make

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
and rotate it a few times just to make

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.960 
and rotate it a few times just to make
sure<00:02:11.009> there's<00:02:11.430> not<00:02:11.610> any

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
sure there's not any

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.300 
sure there's not any
binding<00:02:12.390> if<00:02:12.600> there<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.320> some<00:02:13.560> binding<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.220> you

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
binding if there is some binding and you

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.920 
binding if there is some binding and you
close<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> door<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.510> be<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> little

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
close the door it can be a little

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.100 
close the door it can be a little
difficult<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.800> get<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.550> door<00:02:17.820> back<00:02:18.030> open<00:02:18.110> so

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
difficult to get that door back open so

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.960 
difficult to get that door back open so
in<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.380> case<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.850> doorknob<00:02:21.270> rotates<00:02:22.200> freely

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
in this case the doorknob rotates freely

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.160 
in this case the doorknob rotates freely
go<00:02:23.970> ahead<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.300> close<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.720> door<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:24.960> we

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
go ahead and close the door and we

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.200 
go ahead and close the door and we
double<00:02:25.590> check<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.130> sure<00:02:26.370> enough<00:02:26.400> it's

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
double check it and sure enough it's

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.080 
double check it and sure enough it's
nice<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.750> tight<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.380> not<00:02:28.560> moving<00:02:29.090> I'm

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
nice and tight and it's not moving I'm

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.000 
nice and tight and it's not moving I'm
Tim<00:02:30.390> Gipson<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.020> that's<00:02:31.110> how<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.560> tighten<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
Tim Gipson and that's how to tighten the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.370 
Tim Gipson and that's how to tighten the
doorknob
