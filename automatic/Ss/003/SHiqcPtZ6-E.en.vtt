the backwards is done the first one is
the<00:02:04.079> X<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.950> queue<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.369> flatten

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
on the fur on the green lane and we'll

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.350 
on the fur on the green lane and we'll
throw<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.760> red<00:02:12.120> lane<00:02:12.540> as

throw it on the red lane as

the picture is set here it's a bit messy

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.960 
the picture is set here it's a bit messy
but<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.630> way<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.810> do<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.290> X<00:02:17.670> Q<00:02:18.670> flash

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
but that is the way to do the X Q flash

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.080 
but that is the way to do the X Q flash
with<00:02:19.180> ROM<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.600> then<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.440> backwards<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.850> Q

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
with ROM and then the backwards is the Q

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.090 
with ROM and then the backwards is the Q
in<00:02:22.210> front<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.840> then<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.140> flash<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.680> bit

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
in front of you and then you flash a bit

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.070 
in front of you and then you flash a bit
ahead<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:25.000> will<00:02:25.120> throw<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> queue<00:02:25.750> behind

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
ahead so you will throw the queue behind

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.650 
ahead so you will throw the queue behind
you<00:02:26.440> as<00:02:26.710> we<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:27.010> see<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.520> red<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
you as we can see with the red and the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.140 
you as we can see with the red and the
green<00:02:28.810> lanes<00:02:29.200> we<00:02:29.710> gotta<00:02:29.890> we<00:02:30.550> gotta<00:02:30.580> throw<00:02:31.000> it

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
green lanes we gotta we gotta throw it

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.080 
green lanes we gotta we gotta throw it
to<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.570> red<00:02:31.750> one<00:02:31.990> but<00:02:32.490> initially<00:02:33.490> what's<00:02:34.000> on

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
to the red one but initially what's on

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.820 
to the red one but initially what's on
the<00:02:34.180> green<00:02:34.360> one<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.320> bit<00:02:35.440> tricky<00:02:35.710> where

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
the green one it's a bit tricky where

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.100 
the green one it's a bit tricky where
there<00:02:35.980> that's<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.610> two<00:02:36.760> way<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.000> use<00:02:37.750> with<00:02:37.930> bomb

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
there that's a two way to use with bomb

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.800 
there that's a two way to use with bomb
then<00:02:38.710> Cassiopeia<00:02:39.160> Cassiopeia<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> good<00:02:40.630> way

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
then Cassiopeia Cassiopeia is a good way

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.660 
then Cassiopeia Cassiopeia is a good way
to<00:02:40.840> Alta<00:02:41.560> mate<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.800> enemy<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.280> his<00:02:42.460> face

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
to Alta mate the enemy on his face

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.300 
to Alta mate the enemy on his face
because<00:02:43.120> no<00:02:43.150> one<00:02:43.510> will<00:02:43.690> expect<00:02:44.020> that<00:02:44.260> rains<00:02:44.860> so

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
because no one will expect that rains so

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.250 
because no one will expect that rains so

you start charging the ultimate in the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.800 
you start charging the ultimate in the
moment<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.860> see<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.370> ultimate<00:02:48.670> throwing<00:02:49.420> you

moment you see the ultimate throwing you

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.450 
moment you see the ultimate throwing you
have<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.110> fast<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.530> front<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.800> him<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.220> then

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
have to fast in front of him and then

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.880 
have to fast in front of him and then
the<00:02:51.580> work<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.000> do<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.570> ultimate<00:02:53.050> on<00:02:53.230> his<00:02:53.650> face

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
the work you do to ultimate on his face

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.680 
the work you do to ultimate on his face
so<00:02:54.280> he<00:02:54.310> has<00:02:54.490> no<00:02:54.640> time<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:54.910> reaction<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.570> that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
so he has no time to reaction to that

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.110 
so he has no time to reaction to that
and<00:02:55.870> that's<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.500> cool<00:02:56.740> way<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:56.920> use<00:02:57.130> kill<00:02:57.820> people

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
and that's a cool way to use kill people

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.170 
and that's a cool way to use kill people

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.990 
next position a same with Sivir exactly
the<00:03:20.200> same<00:03:20.350> with<00:03:20.500> saver<00:03:20.709> we<00:03:21.100> throw<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.430> q<00:03:21.670> from

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
the same with saver we throw the q from

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.750 
the same with saver we throw the q from
another<00:03:22.270> direction<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:24.340> next<00:03:24.490> one<00:03:24.670> is

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
another direction the next one is

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.130 
another direction the next one is
Savannah<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.180> is<00:03:25.420> completely<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.930> same<00:03:25.990> as

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
Savannah that is completely the same as

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.560 
Savannah that is completely the same as
Raven<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.160> silver<00:03:27.670> we<00:03:28.060> throw<00:03:28.240> away<00:03:28.300> from

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
Raven and and silver we throw away from

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.600 
Raven and and silver we throw away from
another<00:03:28.750> way<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.200> then<00:03:29.530> with<00:03:29.680> lux<00:03:30.340> we<00:03:30.490> have

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
another way and then with lux we have

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.900 
another way and then with lux we have
two<00:03:30.790> styles<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.510> one<00:03:32.100> from<00:03:33.100> work<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.670> we<00:03:33.790> can

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
two styles the one from work that we can

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.880 
two styles the one from work that we can
cast<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.360> enemy<00:03:34.600> we<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.810> CC<00:03:35.170> we<00:03:35.530> are<00:03:35.650> splash

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
cast the enemy we the CC we are splash

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.620 
cast the enemy we the CC we are splash
in<00:03:36.040> front<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.310> him<00:03:36.459> we<00:03:36.730> cast<00:03:36.970> with<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.180> q<00:03:37.390> and

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
in front of him we cast with the q and

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.120 
in front of him we cast with the q and
then<00:03:37.750> we<00:03:37.870> can<00:03:37.990> combo<00:03:38.320> or<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.770> other<00:03:38.890> one<00:03:39.040> is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
then we can combo or the other one is

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.800 
then we can combo or the other one is
the<00:03:39.280> x<00:03:39.550> way<00:03:40.240> to<00:03:40.300> lux

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
the x way to lux

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.540 
the x way to lux
so<00:03:41.170> if<00:03:41.410> there<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.650> minion<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.220> champion

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
so if there is a minion that is champion

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.490 
so if there is a minion that is champion
or<00:03:42.610> something<00:03:42.910> new<00:03:43.030> q<00:03:43.450> then<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.020> flatten<00:03:44.230> the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
or something new q then you flatten the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.380 
or something new q then you flatten the
direction<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.190> q<00:03:45.640> will<00:03:45.760> go<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.270> other

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
direction and the q will go to the other

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.630 
direction and the q will go to the other
direction<00:03:46.590> with<00:03:47.590> DES<00:03:47.830> Lee<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.100> same<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.490> can

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
direction with DES Lee the same you can

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.710 
direction with DES Lee the same you can
just<00:03:48.790> flash<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:49.209> his<00:03:49.240> face

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
just flash in his face

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.870 
just flash in his face
q<00:03:50.020> in<00:03:50.140> his<00:03:50.290> face<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.680> do<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.130> damage<00:03:51.340> so

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
q in his face and do the damage so

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.690 
q in his face and do the damage so
that's<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.270> fast<00:03:52.990> way<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.500> hit<00:03:53.890> him<00:03:54.070> with<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.310> Q

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
that's a fast way to hit him with the Q

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.730 
that's a fast way to hit him with the Q
even<00:03:54.970> with<00:03:55.120> after<00:03:55.630> that<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:56.020> can<00:03:56.170> even<00:03:56.440> him

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
even with after that you can even him

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.980 
even with after that you can even him
and<00:03:56.920> combo<00:03:57.250> him<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:57.970> he<00:03:58.360> will<00:03:58.450> never<00:03:58.600> expect

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990
