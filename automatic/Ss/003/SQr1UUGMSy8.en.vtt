00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hi guys, how are you? What's up? 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.560
 and today's video is not a criticism is not 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.070
 daily stress 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.200
 no releases is a tag until 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.530
 fairy in a little while after 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.530
 violent 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:35.090
 So, folks, it's the dicro singer. 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.649
 because of the neo-chemical fairies 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.170
 characterize to seem like a fairy because 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.780
 I do not think it's how long it takes 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.230
 I received from the publisher this thought. 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.449
 superfood book here what is the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.289
 talking to the wheels and in that 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.170
 booklet every page so it's not a 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.280
 story book is a narrative he 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.450
 has, for example, a fairy and has 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 an inspiring text an agile text that 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.790
 help is kind of self help but it 's very cute 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.310
 and the designs are beautiful and watercolor 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.659
 this book inspired me to make a tag 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.850
 for you guys 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.619
 there are even those who are not only based on this book 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.259
 so that the person can actually do 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.659
 if you have not read it but it was him who me 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.140
 made me want to do this until then let's go 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.479
 over there 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.360
 the first question if you could 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.619
 to create a fairy as she would and what 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.090
 would be its function 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:40.770
 well I thought about it and I would create 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.079
 fairy of time and the fairy of time she she 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.119
 stop I have to you to be able to finish 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.790
 all the tasks of the day 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.340
 this would be perfect fault and it would be 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.340
 A little fairy, I finally finished. 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.390
 to enjoy all this and her hair and the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.240
 Sergio and why I like and she would have 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.060
 several hangers so hung up 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.670
 the pocket only the collar and 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.840
 watch ring and her opinion 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.680
 would be a pointer of numbers anyway and she 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.329
 I would pay for my own time 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.689
 people can do their 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:19.840
 day and be able to fulfill everything you need 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.459
 The second question, what is your fairy? 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.730
 favorite literary 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.310
 oh I do not know, I thought 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.010
 A little bit about it and I really like the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.530
 titania which is the queen of the fairies 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.010
 I dream of a summer night and I even 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.840
 I tried theater year too full to know the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.019
 titanium I loved it was an experience 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.090
 very cool and I also like the fairy 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.540
 blue because the blue fairy love, right? 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.959
 she is a person fairy love but yes 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.750
 movie asks question number 3 if it had 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.810
 a fairy and describe is not a question is 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.849
 a request at last when choosing fairy tinkle 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.739
 because I think it would be very annoying 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:05.469
 make a fairy tag and not talk about 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.810
 The little bell and the little bell she is in her is very 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:10.659
 more warm and grumpy 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.709
 Only I adore her, I think she is. 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.260
 jealous 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.000
 the bell so she went there or mud 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.699
 she complains a lot then that's why she 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.709
 be jealous, not even gloomy things 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:23.019
 Does it have to be her way? 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.139
 I do not know I like her very much question 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.680
 number 4 if you could be a fairy already 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:32.109
 what you would be the one I chose 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.370
 the tooth fairy because I was thinking 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.389
 On that day there is pratteln and such and I thought 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.310
 my 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.489
 children are losing a lot is 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.859
 believe and I do not believe in fairy anymore 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.019
 I think it would be nice if the 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.639
 children still believe for a long time. 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.459
 time until the product continues to lend 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.049
 the tooth fairy because it is a concept 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.599
 very cool to make a child 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.729
 have the courage to make a 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.759
 to win a reward just not 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:02.889
 I would give money I would give a reward 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:06.759
 I do not know, I think every kind of 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.350
 child I would realize that of the child 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.390
 is 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.120
 and then I would give her a gift for her 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.710
 You want to remember forever that you talk about 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.010
 tooth has been with her 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.040
 then it would be tooth fairy 5 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.530
 create a fado I do not know if I know the name but 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.700
 I put it so make a boy fairy 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.190
 mec not my boy's father and departs from 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.270
 videogame see more that means the fact 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.610
 of video games 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.210
 for more than girls also already video game 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.700
 I'd like to geninho fadinho 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.750
 it would give you the power to pass the 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.710
 phases 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.650
 I do not know and he HEAI maceiÃ³ it is power 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.410
 get the kids to play in the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.980
 day to day I know but not violent games 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.560
 smoke you and I put mushrooms like this 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.420
 on the street so that they catch and keep 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.330
 will be to transform children's lives 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.020
 boys and girls and a sixth game and 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.610
 which is actually a request to the 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.320
 mix of two-fault functions 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.360
 forming a new 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.310
 I took fairy functions from this book. 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.350
 was based on the team but if you do not 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.230
 are afraid and want to invest functions 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.050
 Other than that, I got the fairy from 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.580
 magic and lack of inspiration 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.770
 the lack of inspiration described here 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.740
 so open to the world of infinites 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.540
 possibilities and magic speech 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.610
 the magic has a way of playing the 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.520
 Heart draw strength from class 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.370
 so I think people are 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.110
 losing some of the inspiration and I 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.760
 I speak for myself sometimes I wanted to 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.980
 do something and I do not come in 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.810
 and I like to finally create the 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.290
 speaks of the inspiration of magic fate 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.140
 would form a fairy that would bring magic 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.090
 to the mind of the people to be able to arise 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.550
 a really cool inspiration to do the 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.600
 things then an inspiration to decorate 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.250
 your home to create a clothing collection 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.700
 In case I need to put it on my 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.460
 life to write a book all this with 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:12.480
 a touch of magic to inspire 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:16.530
 But to be able to have more I can not say 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.780
 a word yes a special taste but 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.409
 day always gives a special things 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.839
 So 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:23.819
 magic inspiration creating a fairy that 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:26.339
 leaves people never inspired by 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:29.159
 that there are infinite possibilities of 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:31.110
 Infinite things are special I hope 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.719
 You liked it and I hope that you 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.249
 have also liked my fairy look 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.800
 I wanted to know what's your name. 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:40.769
 Would you tell me what would be mine? 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.729
 and if you like my look 

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:46.889
 cute fairy shark is this is cdu 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.839
 they voted I make the tag in the matter of speaking 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.339
 That's what I created here in my hair. 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:53.219
 to link the land 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:55.050
 original is and they talk around spreading 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:58.139
 the world is to know that it is I found a 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.419
 I love love love fate and magic is it 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.839
 I liked it visit favorite video sites 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:06.239
 but stresses miguel a fairy kiss 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:08.599
 much can speak of the brightness of the village of 

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:08.599
 you
