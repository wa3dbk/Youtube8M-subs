DC all of cylinders go out on Doug close
car<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.800> just<00:01:20.130> basically<00:01:20.490> lights<00:01:21.120> up

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479

Doug<00:01:22.290> had<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> very<00:01:22.830> good<00:01:23.130> run<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.810> 392<00:01:24.810> year

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
hour and I think it probably blew up

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.660 
hour and I think it probably blew up
just<00:01:28.380> past<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.860> finish<00:01:29.160> line<00:01:29.310> he<00:01:29.400> saw<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
to go to the whim if he does so it'll be

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.400

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
started mixing up just a little bit

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.870
