00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
drama but I think coloring in your brows

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.820 
drama but I think coloring in your brows
is<00:03:47.360> a<00:03:47.390> must<00:03:47.750> especially<00:03:47.900> when<00:03:48.410> you<00:03:48.530> have<00:03:48.680> this

is a must especially when you have this
much<00:03:49.040> makeup<00:03:49.220> on<00:03:49.490> your<00:03:49.640> eyes<00:03:49.670> your<00:03:50.330> eyebrows

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.860 
so now because I have four all set we'll
just<00:05:00.180> use<00:05:00.450> a<00:05:00.750> mineral<00:05:01.380> rice<00:05:01.770> powder<00:05:02.040> I'm<00:05:02.580> using
