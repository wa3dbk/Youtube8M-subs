00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
don't have to worry about that so--but

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.050 
don't have to worry about that so--but
uptime<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.979> lot<00:01:38.369> faster<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.940> lot

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
uptime is a lot faster and a lot

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.410 
uptime is a lot faster and a lot
smoother<00:01:39.720> than<00:01:40.440> Windows<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.460> legally

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
smoother than Windows which is legally

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:54.070 
smoother than Windows which is legally
run<00:01:42.660> which<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.110> stupid<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:44.040> think<00:01:44.280> anyway

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080
