00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello to all my subscribers with you gra 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.980
 and today we have what's right mod by 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.690
 whom everyone was waiting for a lot of time well for 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.240
 details of this delay can 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.340
 refer to my group link somewhere 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.359
 under the video or else where there will be a market for 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.430
 Well, in general, the screen is now rather 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.000
 just this mod pack will not appear not on 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.400
 channel fanny in fact we still 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.769
 because that because the channel would plan it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.219
 administration ignores me ignores me 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.430
 wargaming itself throws in the screed and 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:37.620
 in fact, even the res-mods site is already the second 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.540
 version one they rejected the second 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
 starting from the fifth to this day 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.450
 there was no approval that is they even 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.879
 didn't watch 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.899
 Well, to hell with them someone from pasta and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.260
 monster judge 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.750
 and here everything will be very simple 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.120
 Download from the google disk all the same 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.000
 good old archivist unpack it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.070
 and the internal two files detected without 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.230
 Differences what appeared run in any 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.000
 In this case, you will be taken to the installer window. 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.610
 which you will need to specify the path to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 folder world of tanks is standard this shop 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.630
 games world of tanks 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.000
 further you wait quite long 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.340
 time not to scare you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.189
 in fact at this stage can 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.530
 easily hang somewhere for 10 minutes 10 15 20 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.430
 when the installer told you that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.610
 everything is complete and everything is ok you go folder 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.799
 world of tanks with bye jess and find 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.890
 there is a file of the install 9.20 9.2 well in 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.509
 overall there will not be much 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.720
 run it a window appears old 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.700
 Good by with in this window we are waiting very 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.450
 for a very long time, squeeze everything 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.060
 inscriptions 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.250
 according to my humble calculations and several 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.950
 test this window can even hang 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.100
 an hour in general after she disappeared 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.860
 everything is good and everything is fine, you can calmly 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.560
 enter the game client and play your own 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.180
 pleasure about the system 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.549
 requirements additional information 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.710
 until all changes are given 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.799
 same as previous time 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.020
 compressed interface textures sounds why 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.670
 no changes yes because i don't 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.650
 wanna go my way potato 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.660
 employers former employers and not 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.040
 going to just hang a bunch of extra 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.950
 and additional chips 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.080
 just to every time 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.650
 I got something new I really want 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.780
 bring to mind what has already been done 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.940
 about how it will develop 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.370
 the further fate of this modpack 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.920
 actually earlier wargaming though 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.330
 a little but financed me remaining 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.370
 without his support, I will be enough 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.810
 difficult to allocate any additional 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.280
 time to make 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.120
 new modpak 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.430
 That is, most likely some updates 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.870
 that is something but in this new texture 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.290
 some some 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.760
 parts of it are remodeling and stuff 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.010
 everything will be put on the back burner 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.620
 because really everyone wants 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.090
 eat all need money and how would 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.390
 do it free from work 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.610
 time to me you really are not many 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.640
 so of course every patches will 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.040
 try to update this version but 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.930
 I promise nothing for speed for 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.300
 do you want to help a little project 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.010
 help first of all how he damn project 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.020
 help me because I'm alone doing myself 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.630
 crap this i'm no studio team 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.730
 developers in general if you want 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.530
 so that this project develops if it is for you 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.430
 like and you want to support my 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.810
 initiative 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.120
 then under the link in the video description in 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.300
 channel description and now on screen you 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.970
 see the details of the webmoney wallets and 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.830
 Yandex Money Kerry wallet I have to 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.920
 Unfortunately, no, I do not like to use it 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.670
 because a very large percentage is taken 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.620
 on withdrawal of funds if required 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.239
 bank details ie for right at 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.239
 bank transfer someone questions 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.000
 write to me in lichku group in contact where 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.890
 please shorter though sky I write to you 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.530
 I can give the necessary props 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.910
 to be transferred payment 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.230
 statistics will always be located in 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.480
 group that is, you can always go 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.600
 to see how much at what the purse was 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.370
 transferred money well and in general if 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.359
 speak for some noise that's there 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.340
 I'm going to pick something up 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.320
 some updates can wait 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.200
 only after i appear 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.230
 at least there 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.690
 well, something like money seriously on 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.060
 really happy about everything 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.680
 so don't forget the pedal about 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.810
 Additional system requirements 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.970
 compression as I said above if suddenly 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.970
 I will be happy to have time 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.920
 do it but as they say time 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.240
 money oh well no need me 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.470
 equate to the same Masonic 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.600
 government especially some 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.580
 reptiloid when we unfortunately do not have 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.370
 no relation though honestly 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.230
 I would like oh well on this perhaps 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.210

 in money I will be there as scrooge McDuck
