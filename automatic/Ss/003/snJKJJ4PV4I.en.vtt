over<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.560> couple<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.830> things<00:00:16.920> first<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
over a couple of things first this is a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.849 
over a couple of things first this is a
tech<00:00:17.789> demo<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.930> expect<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.320> very

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
tech demo so you can expect very very

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.140 
tech demo so you can expect very very
very<00:00:20.130> little<00:00:20.580> from<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
very little from it this is a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.849 
very little from it this is a
proof-of-concept<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:22.199> prove<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.740> can

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
proof-of-concept to prove that we can

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.529 
proof-of-concept to prove that we can
just<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.250> made<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.820> technology<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
just we made this technology that

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.839 
just we made this technology that
actually<00:00:24.750> works<00:00:25.170> I'll<00:00:26.160> explain<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> little<00:00:26.670> bit

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
actually works I'll explain a little bit

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240 
actually works I'll explain a little bit
more<00:00:27.000> about<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.180> when<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.630> inside<00:00:28.250> also

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
more about that when we get inside also

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.120 
more about that when we get inside also
this<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.820> member<00:00:30.390> only<00:00:30.539> thing<00:00:31.529> for

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
same room at the same time but that's it

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.450 
same room at the same time but that's it
that<00:05:42.110> that<00:05:42.440> is<00:05:42.500> what<00:05:42.800> you<00:05:42.889> can<00:05:43.010> expect<00:05:43.310> from

that that is what you can expect from

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.930 
that that is what you can expect from
our<00:05:43.639> tech<00:05:43.820> demo<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:45.460> none<00:05:46.460> of<00:05:46.490> you<00:05:46.669> will<00:05:46.910> be

our tech demo and none of you will be

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.500 
our tech demo and none of you will be
able<00:05:47.120> to<00:05:47.270> play<00:05:47.419> it<00:05:47.539> on<00:05:47.660> mobile<00:05:48.139> yet<00:05:48.740> but<00:05:49.580> if<00:05:49.970> we

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
able to play it on mobile yet but if we

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.560 
able to play it on mobile yet but if we
stress<00:05:50.960> test<00:05:51.200> this<00:05:51.320> thing<00:05:51.530> and<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.820> tech<00:05:53.270> demo

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
stress test this thing and the tech demo

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.750 
stress test this thing and the tech demo
goes<00:05:53.810> like<00:05:54.260> we<00:05:54.410> hope<00:05:54.590> and<00:05:54.770> there's<00:05:55.130> not<00:05:55.280> a<00:05:55.340> huge

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
goes like we hope and there's not a huge

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.700 
goes like we hope and there's not a huge
amount<00:05:55.910> of<00:05:56.090> like<00:05:56.240> crashes<00:05:56.720> doesn't<00:05:57.289> set<00:05:57.590> our

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
amount of like crashes doesn't set our

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.920 
amount of like crashes doesn't set our
servers<00:05:58.039> on<00:05:58.160> fire<00:05:58.400> then<00:05:59.120> you<00:05:59.240> can<00:05:59.389> expect<00:05:59.660> more

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
servers on fire then you can expect more

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.890 
servers on fire then you can expect more
from<00:06:00.440> this<00:06:00.710> in<00:06:00.950> the<00:06:01.130> future<00:06:01.330> right<00:06:02.330> now<00:06:02.389> it's

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
from this in the future right now it's

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.779
