00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
knife would be if you were to push this

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.990 
knife would be if you were to push this
trigger<00:00:40.020> down<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.820> do

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
trigger down right here and what you do

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.580 
trigger down right here and what you do
is<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> notice<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> top<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> knife

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
is if you notice on the top of the knife

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.069 
is if you notice on the top of the knife
right<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:43.910> it<00:00:44.910> got<00:00:45.030> some<00:00:45.239> gimping<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.750> there

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
right there it got some gimping on there

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.860 
right there it got some gimping on there
so<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.370> way<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.640> opened<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.420> push<00:00:48.629> this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
so the way it's opened is you push this

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.549 
so the way it's opened is you push this
down<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:51.110> run<00:00:52.110> your<00:00:52.230> finger

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
back like that and that'll open the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.939 
back like that and that'll open the
knife<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> run<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> through<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> Gympie

they<00:03:53.010> didn't<00:03:53.370> skeletonize<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.330> inside<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.989> it

they didn't skeletonize the inside of it
but<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.830> don't<00:03:56.130> think<00:03:56.340> there'd<00:03:56.880> be<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.000> problem

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.770 
but I don't think there'd be a problem
or<00:03:57.570> why<00:03:58.049> they<00:03:58.290> would<00:03:58.530> because<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.850> know<00:03:59.970> as

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
open your knife but I don't see why you

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.790 
open your knife but I don't see why you
would<00:04:48.300> use<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.570> because<00:04:48.960> it's<00:04:49.350> much<00:04:49.590> faster

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800
