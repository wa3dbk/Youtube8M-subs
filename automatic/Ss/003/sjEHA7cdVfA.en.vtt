00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:24.830
 looked at the products turns 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:28.250
 beets are not available and in the final 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:33.890
 finally decided to sour still meat 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:37.130
 boil everything soars smoking but speech 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.620
 today will not go about shah and in general I 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.620
 shoot the process as I prepare and not 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.410
 there is no such desire at all 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.180
 so start with this here 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.280
 book collection compilation recipes 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.270
 called 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:04.600
 collection of recipes is a very good book 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.039
 can you say my favorite book 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.009
 collection of recipes of dishes and culinary 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.689
 products 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:16.729
 technology is described here 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.700
 cooking soups and main dishes and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.880
 many things and many what dishes 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.789
 as a matter of fact ideally should be prepared 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.820
 these dishes here have a layout which 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.439
 products how many grams everything is described 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.049
 specifically here let's say borscht 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:41.780
 bar 6 eat more with cabbage ordinary 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:43.749
 borsch more with potatoes more with 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.639
 prunes and mushrooms 

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:49.399
 more you saved here are the main 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:52.939
 borscht exists of course and other borscht 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:57.139
 in each region is prepared in different ways and 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:00.799
 soup and what I say all this to the fact 

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:01.210
 that there are standard preparations 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.909
 dishes 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:10.179
 any dishes but in the end of course no one 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.750
 this book does not prepare does not comply here 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.240
 Here is this layout and let's look at 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.520
 youtube and what a video like any 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:27.069
 girl or someone cooks borscht and read 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.450
 there are comments that i usually salt there 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.720
 add at the end 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:37.630
 or else there is wrong there useful 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:41.470
 cabbage is not at that moment carrots there 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.900
 I put in the soup a little more out there other 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.690
 writes that I am higher there at the end of preparation 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.989
 In this more I spit to he there 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.850
 sarvaristey was another writes that yes not that 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.769
 bullshit 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.489
 can you stock this one more so that he still 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:02.050
 tasted better and here are all sorts of tips 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.959
 give some cooking not 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.230
 just borscht any dishes any even there 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.650
 plov can generally separate topic 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.350
 separate topic their god exists 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.340
 probably 80 species 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.380
 or maybe even 180 species if here i am 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.840
 I will place under the video I have these videos 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.829
 about pilaf as I cook pilaf and who is there 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.950
 all sorts of advice were you 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.250
 will advise 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:36.190
 and say that you do not cook properly and 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:40.000
 pilaf or whatever you cook like that 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.269
 that here is such a small video about 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 that everyone has different tastes and everyone cooks 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.500
 in my own way, let's say I am today 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.930
 I will cook soup 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.720
 I like the whole cabbage 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.329
 slightly undercooked such odintsovskogo 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.880
 kind and not that when its only debt on 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:01.900
 there everything is already spreading spreading 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:06.359
 already gently gently I like her to 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.940
 there was such a bit of a sprinkle 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:13.329
 so this is a book for every cook 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.170
 or a man who studied at the cook 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.780
 must be 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.299
 in the household is a very useful book 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.750
 useful to refresh some knowledge 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.669
 look there and I generally read further 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.889
 its just open the dish i read watch 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:34.540
 layout how many what products and even 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:38.610
 such content delivers this book with 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.180
