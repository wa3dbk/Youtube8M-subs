00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
don't need to do this part this pins a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.150 
don't need to do this part this pins a
bit<00:00:32.610> odd<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:34.380> feed<00:00:34.590> comes<00:00:34.860> out<00:00:35.040> like

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
bit odd and that the feed comes out like

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.060 
bit odd and that the feed comes out like
this<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:36.180> let's<00:00:36.360> pretend<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.829> how

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
this but let's pretend that this is how

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.830 
this but let's pretend that this is how
it<00:00:38.160> goes<00:00:38.309> okay<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.059> doesn't<00:00:39.239> because<00:00:39.629> this

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it goes okay it doesn't because this

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.360 
it goes okay it doesn't because this
part<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.350> needs<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> middle<00:00:41.250> for

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
part here needs to be in the middle for

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.639 
part here needs to be in the middle for
that<00:00:41.460> shape<00:00:41.670> or<00:00:41.850> pin<00:00:42.000> anyways<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.840> work<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.620> all

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that shape or pin anyways to work so all

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.029 
that shape or pin anyways to work so all
you<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.219> take<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> blade<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:45.570> this

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
you do is you take a blade like this

you do is you take a blade like this
preferably<00:00:47.039> an<00:00:47.160> exact<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> start<00:00:48.090> with

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
preferably an exact I have to start with

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
cut it too much I've been told there's a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.139 
cut it too much I've been told there's a
chance<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.490> drip<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:05.880> dribble

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.540 
chance that it can drip or dribble
anyways<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:07.290> basically<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.099> does<00:02:08.160> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
anyways but basically all this does is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.199 
anyways but basically all this does is
allow<00:02:08.819> more<00:02:09.239> air<00:02:09.300> into<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
allow more air into the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.610 
allow more air into the
in<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:12.430> can<00:02:12.730> also<00:02:13.180> allow<00:02:13.689> too<00:02:13.840> much<00:02:14.109> area

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
in and it can also allow too much area

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.709 
in and it can also allow too much area
in<00:02:14.709> too<00:02:14.859> much<00:02:14.980> area<00:02:15.370> equals<00:02:15.939> too<00:02:16.120> much<00:02:16.299> ink<00:02:16.510> out

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:16.719 
in too much area equals too much ink out

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.280 
in too much area equals too much ink out
and<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.500> could<00:02:17.620> be<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.799> mess<00:02:18.099> if<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:19.230> go<00:02:20.230> too

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
and it could be a mess if you go too

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.030 
and it could be a mess if you go too
fast<00:02:20.680> too<00:02:21.069> far<00:02:21.280> too<00:02:21.430> fast<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.750> anyways<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.739> is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
fast too far too fast so anyways that is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.750 
fast too far too fast so anyways that is
um<00:02:24.280> how<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.700> hack<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.480> feed<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.430> could<00:02:27.579> also

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
um how to hack a feed but you could also

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.470 
um how to hack a feed but you could also
make<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.120> pin<00:02:28.450> right<00:02:28.719> wetter<00:02:29.849> by<00:02:30.849> spreading<00:02:31.269> the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
make a pin right wetter by spreading the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.140 
make a pin right wetter by spreading the
times<00:02:31.750> stop<00:02:32.319> don't<00:02:32.829> do<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.159> by<00:02:33.849> spreading

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
times stop don't do that by spreading

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.640 
times stop don't do that by spreading
the<00:02:34.299> times<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:36.310> need<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.700> get<00:02:36.849> back<00:02:37.030> together

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
the times you need to get back together

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.929 
the times you need to get back together
I'm<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:38.709> being<00:02:39.010> too<00:02:39.129> careful<00:02:39.310> because<00:02:39.700> it's

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
I'm not being too careful because it's

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.089 
I'm not being too careful because it's
strong<00:02:40.239> enough<00:02:40.269> look<00:02:41.260> at<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.500> it's<00:02:41.709> like<00:02:41.739> a

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
strong enough look at that it's like a

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.730 
strong enough look at that it's like a
man<00:02:44.730> Christmas
