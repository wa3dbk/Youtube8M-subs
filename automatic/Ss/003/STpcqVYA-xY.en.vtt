00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello everyone I 'm parca 333 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.880
 good 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.880
 The purpose of this video is that 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.509
 at first- well, saying it 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.980
 simple and clear way recently I entered 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.470
 in my third semester of the university 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.320
 and I need to make more of this 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.619
 semester to get more than 85 which is 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.570
 my current average good I guess not 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.099
 I have to give more explanations of why 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.309
 what will not upload videos with much 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.309
 frequency 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.460
 however for those who are 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.350
 interested in following my fanfics can 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.690
 go through my account in fan fiction in 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.219
 where example the moonlight fanfic already 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.219
 it's up to chapter 15 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.739
 because if it's already written up to 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.010
 chapter 15 I have only climbed up to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.589
 chapter 7 in simple youtube in my 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 university studio audiovisuals so 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.370
 that the editing programs that I have 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.619
 they are always busy with jobs 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 school thing that prevents me from converting 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.240
 the chapters in videos but this 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.950
 it also allows me to continue the fanfics 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.259
 because I have to wait for the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.690
 work finish loading something that goes 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.119
 2 to 4 hours time that took advantage of 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.799
 write chapters of my fanfics and it's 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.920
 that's why fan fiction is more 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.899
 updated on some fanfics so 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.030
 If you do not resist the urge to know what is 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.399
 what happens next, pacense for me 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.560
 account in fan fiction where they are more 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.560
 advanced most of my fans and c's 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.730
 third 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.860
 will not rise blood brothers in my 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.410
 channel so do not ask me 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.650
 the reasons are several but I will tell you the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.240
 main the main one is that you consume 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.880
 a lot of my time and space on my channel 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.920
 first as I just told you the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.350
 to scream at the moment I can not 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.930
 I do not have much time to edit given 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.360
 my school duties 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.580
 the fanfic is too long and before 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.190
 do even the video I have to read it 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.050
 everything to know what music to put him 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.850
 I am slow reading so I consumed 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.340
 much my time sitting down to read the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.380
 fanfic if I will focus on getting up easy 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.090
 I would not upload more videos of any other 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.519
 kind for a long time 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.900
 another reason is that the funk end is not 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.060
 relevant to the project 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 multiuniverse so it will be losing my 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.349
 valuable free time in working on this 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.599
 besides that this fax and that is a saga 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.489
 of four books and I already have a lot 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.170
 over like to put me to work in 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.330
 this 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.640
 if they want so much to know what it is that 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.920
 happens with black and draco go to the channel 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.020
 dragon faction where I think the 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.440
 fan is about to finish or I do not know if 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.440
 finished 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.230
 fourth notice the sleeve of mlb it 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.879
 postpone same case as with brothers of 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.849
 blood and with my fix fans but 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.340
 multiplied by 10 edit the videos 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.739
 of the manga of glp is a very big task 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.750
 it requires a lot of my time and 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.209
 patience it takes me two weeks to do 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.269
 the video and because of my studies I do not have 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.099
 I'll have that time I'll work on that video 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.269
 when I have a vacation or I settled 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.269
 better with my studies 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.590
 Well that's all I had them 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:27.950
 say I hope you understand 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.950
 I'm parca 333 until next time
