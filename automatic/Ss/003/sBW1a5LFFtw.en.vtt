00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.730
 hello friends we are again with 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.400
 you in this opportunity I am going to 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.250
 teach how to add the official size 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.809
 in the print window is talking 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.450
 of the canon and it was 1024 and series for 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:33.489
 we need to enter the printer 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:36.290
 installed let's start 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:40.230
 devices and printers 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 and we make a right click 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.220
 to the printer in question that is 10 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.860
 2010 24 and 25 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.350
 canon truth we all click right 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.140
 and the next window does not come up with 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.910
 many options and we choose preferences 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.530
 of impression 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:04.239
 of the canon and you are 24 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.239
 we get the next window 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.090
 as you will see here we have several 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.090
 paper sizes 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.940
 none of them becomes size 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.240
 trade or the sls that we use or by 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.970
 eight and a half by thirteen so much what 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.890
 we have him 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 the right paper size 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.420
 so 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.570
 let's go to the customize size option 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.570
 paper 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.430
 we click 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.200
 and we put the name already to the size of 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.420
 paper that we will customize in this 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.340
 case as we had set our 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.790
 copier the size of the office size 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.620
 trade as free size now you 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.620
 we put the same name 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.970
 free good 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.460
 similarly we select if it is going to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.550
 be in inches or millimeters 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.010
 the width already asks us to configure the width 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.140
 it's like 210 we're going to 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.140
 set as 216 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.260
 6 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.720
 the height 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.829
 set the size and the ex officio 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.370
 we use that it would become 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.370
 330 true 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.270
 330 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.540
 once done set the width the 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:53.270
 height we need 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:56.120
 is registered and as you will see here it appears 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.960
 in the paper size options and 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.130
 the free size appears 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:07.540
 216 by 330 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.050
 and we just press the ok option 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.720
 good is already 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.720
 if we search here for the moment to print 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.069
 let's find the free size that 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.200
 would become this option 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.069
 and then we want to print on trades 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.069
 we print 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.930
 in office and we simply sent in 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.010
 accept truth 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.010
 another option 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.530
 that you have to take into account so that 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.830
 we can have a safer job is 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.280
 that the a4 we have to change it by 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.280
 letter 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.830
 and we are going to predetermine them 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.049
 and apply and accept then the ether has 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.230
 stayed as default once 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.730
 you already want to make the impressions 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.340
 directly for the e3 they do not need 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.330
 set in enter to choose the 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.950
 good paper size that's all 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.080
 as you will see it has been very simple 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.510
 configure and I hope it will serve you a lot 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.720
 well do not forget to visit our 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.720
