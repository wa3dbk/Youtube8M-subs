already have an inherent energy about

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.970 
already have an inherent energy about
them<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:55.960> you<00:00:56.019> don't<00:00:56.170> have<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.379> work<00:00:56.530> hard<00:00:56.800> in

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
them into into three dimensions you put

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.350 
them into into three dimensions you put
a<00:01:01.900> soul<00:01:02.170> inside<00:01:02.440> of<00:01:02.589> it<00:01:02.680> so<00:01:02.860> you<00:01:02.920> kind<00:01:03.729> of<00:01:03.820> allow
