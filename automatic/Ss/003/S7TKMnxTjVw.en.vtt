the<00:00:43.469> fastest<00:00:44.399> i<00:00:44.579> think<00:00:45.000> elite<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:46.379> they

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the fastest i think elite because they

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.959 
the fastest i think elite because they
don't<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.920> carry<00:00:47.160> those<00:00:47.309> heavy<00:00:47.370> weapons

instead<00:00:48.390> they<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> plasma<00:00:49.620> sword<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
instead they have a plasma sword so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.090 
instead they have a plasma sword so
they're<00:00:51.750> pretty<00:00:52.020> freaking<00:00:52.410> dangerous<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100

colored<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.140> become<00:01:04.470> uncanny<00:01:04.979> flage

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
colored when they become uncanny flage

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.289 
colored when they become uncanny flage
but<00:01:05.489> other<00:01:05.640> than<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:07.250> invisibility

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
but other than that the invisibility

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.789 
but other than that the invisibility
enhancements<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.630> replace<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
enhancements they have replace the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.380

shield enhancements all the other elite

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
shield enhancements all the other elite
have<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.530> kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.920> good<00:01:14.010> trade-off

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
have so it's kind of a good trade-off

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.010 
have so it's kind of a good trade-off
however<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.360> cheap<00:01:15.659> shot<00:01:15.869> on

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020

you if you're not paying close attention

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.270 
you if you're not paying close attention
and<00:01:17.900> lastly<00:01:18.900> you're<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and lastly you're going to see on the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.200 
and lastly you're going to see on the
last<00:01:20.490> level<00:01:20.759> de<00:01:21.000> ma<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.470> black<00:01:22.470> elite<00:01:23.430> they<00:01:24.060> have

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
last level de ma a black elite they have

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.440 
last level de ma a black elite they have
black<00:01:24.479> armor<00:01:24.979> these<00:01:25.979> ones<00:01:26.189> are<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> lot<00:01:27.119> faster

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
black armor these ones are a lot faster

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
black armor these ones are a lot faster
I<00:01:27.869> believe<00:01:28.500> they're<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> lot<00:01:28.890> stronger<00:01:29.189> they

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
I believe they're a lot stronger they

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.660 
I believe they're a lot stronger they
have<00:01:29.610> better<00:01:29.840> strategy<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.189> they<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.430> throw

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
have better strategy and they can throw

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.700 
have better strategy and they can throw
grenades<00:01:33.079> whereas<00:01:34.079> all<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.259> other<00:01:34.380> elite

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
grenades whereas all the other elite

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.149 
grenades whereas all the other elite
cannot<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.900> best<00:01:37.110> way<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> kill<00:01:37.619> an<00:01:37.770> elite<00:01:37.979> in

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
cannot the best way to kill an elite in

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.620 
cannot the best way to kill an elite in
my<00:01:38.310> opinion<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> stick<00:01:39.210> them<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.509> stick

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
my opinion is to stick them with a stick

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
my opinion is to stick them with a stick
of<00:01:39.869> Rene<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.380> unfortunately<00:01:41.250> some<00:01:41.549> people

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
of Rene but unfortunately some people

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
of Rene but unfortunately some people
are<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.060> capable<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.600> doing<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
are not capable of doing that and so the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.200 
are not capable of doing that and so the
best<00:01:44.040> thing<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.340> give<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.729> take<00:01:45.090> out

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
best thing I can give you is take out

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.520 
best thing I can give you is take out
your<00:01:45.360> assault<00:01:45.630> rifle<00:01:45.990> take<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.350> their

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
your assault rifle take out their

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.109
