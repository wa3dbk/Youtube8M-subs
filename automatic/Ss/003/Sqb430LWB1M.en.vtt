00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello everyone I find 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.719
 today for a new video on 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.650
 the theme of beauty and today I 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.139
 talking to you is a little bit of my 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.460
 sun routine so unfortunately I 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.840
 I 'm not bronze yet and so 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.189
 makes a very credible faux pas that I 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.380
 talk about that but actually I decided to 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.949
 make this video before the summer or rather 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.599
 before the intense summer because there like 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.150
 I am in the south of France we have 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.160
 still have beautiful days that are 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.820
 already behind us and who continues to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 continue 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.750
 so when I know in the west of the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.309
 France is not it's not necessarily 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.600
 towards the summer so I decided to do 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.600
 this video to show you a little 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.030
 little how I prepare my skin in the sun 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.950
 this is my routine from a to z and then well 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.149
 sure there I presented you the products 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.379
 in the video but do not hesitate to 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.719
 click on the link in the bar 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.940
 information to go to the article that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.890
 attached this video and articles that is 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.379
 on my blog that will give you info 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.579
 complementary small tips 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.830
 feeding and other care in 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.979
 made for connection with martine soleil 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.420
 so then first of all actually for 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.520
 prepare my skin in the sun what I 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.850
 do is that I do a lot of 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.340
 scrub so usually I do it a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.049
 twice a week for the body 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.990
 I was using a homemade scrub that is 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.900
 base of coffee grounds and sugar 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.790
 and if not for the face I use the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.500
 sodium bicarbonate so the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.090
 bicarbonate food that you find 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.250
 in any large area 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.049
 I have a little bit in the palm of my hand 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.670
 a little water I mass between my 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.409
 hands and then I massage my face 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.880
 so why make scrubs 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.740
 it's because it's going to allow you 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 to eliminate dead skin and so you 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.060
 have a more uniform tan 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.970
 simply the sun is better 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.470
 take on on your skin it will be this 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.710
 will be a good use more beautiful and more 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.049
 regular then so I'm going to start 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.760
 by my morning routine simply 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.590
 so 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.030
 in the morning I do not talk about my routine 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.800
 face I'm going to make a video on 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.540
 my face routine later where I you 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.860
 were talking about my layering currently 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.270
 since I go regularly 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.610
 dayz since when my products are 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.320
 finished I always have new ones 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.380
 so I'll make you a video more 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.730
 late but otherwise so for my body I 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.860
 regularly put oil 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.460
 finally massage with carrot oil 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.070
 so what I have here comes from centifolia 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.530
 frozen for some time now and 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.300
 I order it as soon as it's over 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.830
 I find it's a product a 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.890
 product that really satisfies 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.180
 the smell is not particularly 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.450
 interesting but it does not smell very strong 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.740
 so it's not embarrassing and it allows 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.450
 to have a nice tan actually 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.570
 prepare the tanned skin so I put 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.990
 really a movie about on my legs on 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.120
 my arms 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.360
 and that's it when I'm not going 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.340
 necessarily in the sun but just to 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.200
 great day to day history of 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.940
 prepare the skin in the sun and prepare 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.010
 tanning 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.440
 then if I go to the sun and when I 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.850
 the sun I put a sunscreen on 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.739
 the body so there is a sunscreen 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.690
 that I had last year that I did 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.310
 not finished that do not use since she 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.290
 is obviously outdated george 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.930
 it was way too much in French for 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.120
 me last year but I had this 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.570
 brand cream coiled acquired and without 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.950
 paraben 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.440
 she is not organic I thought she 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.670
 was organic so if you have creams 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.010
 solar for the body to advise me 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.650
 who are organic and who are in 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:29.010
 protection 15 or 20 it's enough for me to 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.570
 body anyway I want you well 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.480
 give me references and that's no 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.580
 for the face right now I'm using the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.310
 cream fitz fidh solar protection 30 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.530
 so the naturama foot site send 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.910
 so I thank them very much because 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.459
 it was a very nice discovery for 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.230
 me this creation very good they 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.560
 penetrate my skin in any case 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.390
 it suits me very well 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.489
 I used it regularly that I 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.200
 vale summer sun on my face and on 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.030
 the very sensitive areas where I take 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.140
 easily in the sun like for example 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.690
 upper chest here or else 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.370
 the belly in some places when I 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.050
 red and more easily jose I use 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.310
 this cream for the most places 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.470
 sensitive so really very very good 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.120
 cream here you can find it on 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.090
 the site bio nature to the link will be in 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.720
 the info bar and on my blog is 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.820
 for for the after sun since in fact 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.760
 after being exposed to the sun it's 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.070
 very important to repair your skin a 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.310
 Once your shower is taken I will 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.280
 really invites to use bombers 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.050
 plants so to feed the skin me 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.270
 I use shea butter again and 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.640
 always it's really my 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.930
 essential beauty coconut oil and 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.180
 Shea butter is what I 'm going 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.530
 try this I believe the most so the 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.090
 shea butter that comes here from 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.919
 amazon you can find a little 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.190
 little everywhere and now on on 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.260
 any organic site is really 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.820
 excellent game but that I take a small 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.590
 hazelnut I had it in the hollow 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.810
 with my hand I spread and then I put that 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.240
 on my legs on my arms on my back 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.400
 on my belly by all that is exposed 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.919
 in the sun and for the face I do my 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.240
 face routine that you will see later 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.100
 there are others anyway that 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.530
 I had already posted before 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.240
 and here it is the oil that 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.850
 I use this moment most often 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.580
 it's jojoba oil that comes here from 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.440
