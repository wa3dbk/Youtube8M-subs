all<00:00:12.610> right<00:00:12.760> now<00:00:12.910> I<00:00:13.179> just<00:00:13.269> wanted<00:00:13.780> to<00:00:13.870> do<00:00:13.960> a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
all right now I just wanted to do a

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.250 
all right now I just wanted to do a
brief<00:00:14.320> update

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
brief update

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.429 
brief update
it's<00:00:17.220> been<00:00:17.490> 10<00:00:17.730> days<00:00:18.020> since<00:00:19.020> I've<00:00:19.230> had<00:00:19.380> my

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
it's been 10 days since I've had my

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.910 
it's been 10 days since I've had my
dissertation<00:00:19.800> running<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.590> I've<00:00:22.590> had<00:00:22.770> it

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
dissertation running and I've had it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.300 
dissertation running and I've had it
plugged<00:00:23.189> into<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:24.380> kilowatt<00:00:25.380> meter<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
plugged into a kilowatt meter and I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.650 
plugged into a kilowatt meter and I
don't<00:00:26.369> know<00:00:26.610> if<00:00:26.730> you've<00:00:26.880> ever<00:00:27.180> used<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
don't know if you've ever used a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540 
don't know if you've ever used a
kilowatt<00:00:28.050> meter<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.340> does

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
kilowatt meter but what it does

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.600 
kilowatt meter but what it does
basically<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.329> registers<00:00:31.369> how<00:00:32.369> much

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
basically is registers how much

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.390 
basically is registers how much
electricity<00:00:33.559> whatever<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.739> put<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.190> an

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
electricity whatever you put just for an

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.900 
electricity whatever you put just for an
example<00:00:35.960> how<00:00:36.960> much<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.769> is<00:00:38.010> costing<00:00:38.250> me<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
example how much this is costing me to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.890 
example how much this is costing me to
run<00:00:39.089> this<00:00:39.300> Nass<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:41.210> ten<00:00:42.210> days<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.600> figured

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
run this Nass and ten days I figured

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.979 
run this Nass and ten days I figured
would<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.199> easier<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.890> could<00:00:44.879> easily<00:00:45.510> divide

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
would be easier you could easily divide

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.869 
would be easier you could easily divide
that<00:00:46.199> into<00:00:46.470> 30<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.129> figure<00:00:47.400> out<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.730> it's

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that into 30 and figure out what it's

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.270 
that into 30 and figure out what it's
going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.059> cost<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.780> run<00:00:48.989> per<00:00:49.800> month<00:00:50.010> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
going to cost you to run per month and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.500 
going to cost you to run per month and
I'm<00:00:51.149> pretty<00:00:51.510> pretty<00:00:52.320> surprised<00:00:53.239> how<00:00:54.239> little

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
I'm pretty pretty surprised how little

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
I'm pretty pretty surprised how little
little<00:00:55.500> energy<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.100> thing<00:00:56.340> actually<00:00:56.550> takes

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
little energy this thing actually takes

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.869 
little energy this thing actually takes
to<00:00:57.180> run<00:00:57.420> which<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.370> one<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.640> selling

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
to run which is one of the selling

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.190 
to run which is one of the selling
points<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.960> NASS<00:01:05.750> I'm<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.020> show

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
points for the NASS I'm going to show

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.430 
points for the NASS I'm going to show
you<00:01:07.259> quick<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.580> picture<00:01:09.179> basically<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.289> has

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
you quick the picture basically this has

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.889 
you quick the picture basically this has
been<00:01:10.649> 10<00:01:10.890> days<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.490> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.240> it

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
been 10 days you can kind of see here it

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.100 
been 10 days you can kind of see here it
just<00:01:13.259> hit<00:01:13.500> 10<00:01:13.770> days<00:01:14.090> slightly<00:01:15.090> over<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:15.899> much

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
just hit 10 days slightly over not much

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.660 
just hit 10 days slightly over not much
and<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:17.250> gonna<00:01:18.860> show<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.039> little<00:01:20.190> bit<00:01:20.369> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and I'm gonna show you a little bit of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.449 
and I'm gonna show you a little bit of
the<00:01:21.030> kilowatt<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.740> we'll<00:01:22.740> figure<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.130> I'm

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459 
the kilowatt and we'll figure out I'm

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.680 
the kilowatt and we'll figure out I'm
paying<00:01:23.729> 15<00:01:24.209> cents<00:01:24.780> per<00:01:25.310> kilowatt<00:01:26.310> hour<00:01:26.690> here

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
paying 15 cents per kilowatt hour here

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.350 
paying 15 cents per kilowatt hour here
it<00:01:27.959> may<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:29.099> California<00:01:29.849> and<00:01:29.970> stuff<00:01:30.179> is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
it may be I know California and stuff is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.440 
it may be I know California and stuff is
a<00:01:30.390> lot<00:01:30.599> more<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:31.739> electricity<00:01:32.160> but<00:01:32.640> I'm<00:01:33.300> just

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a lot more for electricity but I'm just

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.969 
a lot more for electricity but I'm just
going<00:01:33.690> to<00:01:33.720> kind<00:01:33.959> of<00:01:34.050> throw<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> number<00:01:34.679> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
going to kind of throw up a number of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.820 
going to kind of throw up a number of
what<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.550> use<00:01:35.940> or<00:01:36.330> what<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.959> cost<00:01:37.229> me<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:37.679> run

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
what I use or what it's cost me to run

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.550 
what I use or what it's cost me to run
this<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.280> 10<00:01:38.459> days<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.110> from<00:01:40.110> there<00:01:40.349> we'll

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
this for 10 days and from there we'll

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.919 
this for 10 days and from there we'll
kind<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.340> figure<00:01:41.550> out<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> will<00:01:42.119> cost<00:01:42.450> run

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
kind of figure out what it will cost run

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.460 
kind of figure out what it will cost run
for<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.289> whole<00:01:43.440> year<00:01:47.989> all<00:01:48.989> right<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.349> you're

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
for the whole year all right what you're

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.100 
for the whole year all right what you're
seeing<00:01:49.679> here<00:01:50.099> is<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.970> picture<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.599> kilowatt

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
seeing here is a picture of the kilowatt

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.900 
seeing here is a picture of the kilowatt
and<00:01:52.729> I'm<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.209> hit<00:01:55.520> this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.729> how

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
and I'm just going to hit this is how

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.510 
and I'm just going to hit this is how
much<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.330> consuming<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.050> now<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.590> it's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
much it's consuming right now and it's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.699 
much it's consuming right now and it's
it's<00:01:59.940> actually<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.509> service<00:02:00.989> right<00:02:01.080> now<00:02:01.259> so

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
it's actually in service right now so

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.800 
it's actually in service right now so
it's<00:02:01.830> using<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.459> following<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.539> uses

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
it's using I following that it uses

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.749 
it's using I following that it uses
about<00:02:04.670> 44<00:02:05.670> -<00:02:05.970> 45<00:02:06.300> watts<00:02:07.250> when<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
about 44 - 45 watts when it's up and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.180 
about 44 - 45 watts when it's up and
running<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.709> then<00:02:10.709> when<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:12.920> basically<00:02:13.920> when

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
running and then when it basically when

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.070 
running and then when it basically when
it<00:02:14.280> goes<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.670> sleep<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:15.209> found<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:15.930> about

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
it goes to sleep I found that it's about

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.440 
it goes to sleep I found that it's about
25<00:02:16.709> watts<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:18.620> now<00:02:19.620> I'm<00:02:19.739> gonna<00:02:19.860> hit<00:02:20.450> kilowatt

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
25 watts and now I'm gonna hit kilowatt

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.140 
25 watts and now I'm gonna hit kilowatt
per<00:02:22.170> hour<00:02:22.319> this<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:23.129> has<00:02:23.310> been<00:02:23.550> registered

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
per hour this this has been registered

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.440 
per hour this this has been registered
for<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.480> last<00:02:24.659> ten<00:02:24.930> days

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
for the last ten days

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.080 
for the last ten days
and<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.620> far<00:02:27.830> I've<00:02:27.950> used<00:02:28.160> nine<00:02:28.400> point<00:02:28.790> four

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
and so far I've used nine point four

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.449 
and so far I've used nine point four
four<00:02:29.360> kilowatts<00:02:30.319> which<00:02:32.530> at<00:02:33.530> my<00:02:33.950> 15<00:02:34.640> cents<00:02:36.459> so
