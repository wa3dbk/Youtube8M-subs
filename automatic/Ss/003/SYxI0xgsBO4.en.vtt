straightened out Don Johnson again you
see<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:57.110> factor<00:01:57.440> of<00:01:57.560> speed<00:01:57.830> entering<00:01:58.340> into<00:01:58.520> it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
see the factor of speed entering into it

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.840 
see the factor of speed entering into it
that's<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.930> very<00:02:00.200> important<00:02:00.680> factor<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:01.610> can

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
that's a very important factor you can

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.760 
that's a very important factor you can
see<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.120> ball<00:02:02.300> hits<00:02:02.780> very<00:02:03.050> light<00:02:03.350> or<00:02:03.500> what<00:02:03.650> we

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
see the ball hits very light or what we

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.890 
see the ball hits very light or what we
call<00:02:04.010> thin<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.910> barely<00:02:05.270> touches<00:02:05.870> the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
call thin just barely touches the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.560 
call thin just barely touches the
headpin<00:02:06.470> but<00:02:06.920> because<00:02:07.280> it's<00:02:07.460> slow<00:02:07.790> it<00:02:08.119> gives

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
headpin but because it's slow it gives

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.630 
headpin but because it's slow it gives
the<00:02:08.720> pins<00:02:08.960> a<00:02:09.080> chance<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.590> mix<00:02:09.860> back<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.399> forth

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the pins a chance to mix back and forth

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.130 
the pins a chance to mix back and forth
off<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.180> sideboard<00:02:13.420> since<00:02:14.420> Don<00:02:14.630> Johnson

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
off of the sideboard since Don Johnson

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.130 
off of the sideboard since Don Johnson
uses<00:02:15.650> more<00:02:15.860> hook<00:02:16.070> plays<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.490> wider<00:02:16.850> angle<00:02:17.210> you

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
uses more hook plays a wider angle you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.260 
uses more hook plays a wider angle you
see<00:02:18.380> he's<00:02:18.530> standing<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.130> extreme<00:02:19.670> left<00:02:19.940> on

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
see he's standing to the extreme left on

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.970 
see he's standing to the extreme left on
the<00:02:20.450> approach<00:02:20.720> catching<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.440> track<00:02:21.680> much

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
the approach catching the track much

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.289 
the approach catching the track much
later

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.610 

well<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.329> think<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.689> groan<00:02:31.959> from<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.379> crowd

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
well I think the groan from the crowd

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.130 
well I think the groan from the crowd
tells<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.189> story

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
tells a story

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.839 
tells a story
speaking<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.290> catching<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.890> track<00:02:36.129> later<00:02:36.489> the

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
speaking of catching the track later the

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.670 
speaking of catching the track later the
ball<00:02:37.060> did<00:02:37.480> break<00:02:37.780> too<00:02:38.170> late

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
ball did break too late

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.369 
ball did break too late
therefore<00:02:39.069> you<00:02:39.159> see<00:02:39.189> it<00:02:39.430> deflect<00:02:40.379> drastically

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
therefore you see it deflect drastically

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.190 
therefore you see it deflect drastically
to<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.620> right<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.939> deflecting<00:02:43.540> does<00:02:44.019> not

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
to the right and in deflecting does not

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.319 
to the right and in deflecting does not
get<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.560> proper<00:02:44.950> pin<00:02:45.189> action<00:02:45.609> you<00:02:46.060> can<00:02:46.209> see

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
get the proper pin action you can see

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.630 
get the proper pin action you can see
