right<00:00:07.340> now<00:00:07.460> I<00:00:07.490> got<00:00:07.700> to<00:00:07.819> show<00:00:07.939> me<00:00:08.090> that<00:00:08.269> struts

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
right now I got to show me that struts

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.509 
right now I got to show me that struts
leaking<00:00:09.019> this<00:00:09.740> is<00:00:09.860> a<00:00:09.920> little<00:00:10.099> difficult

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
leaking this is a little difficult

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.879 
leaking this is a little difficult
because<00:00:10.610> it's<00:00:10.910> wet<00:00:11.540> and<00:00:11.570> you<00:00:12.110> know<00:00:12.379> everything

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
because it's wet and you know everything

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.279 
because it's wet and you know everything
quite<00:00:13.249> bad<00:00:13.490> because<00:00:13.789> of<00:00:13.879> the<00:00:13.940> snow<00:00:14.179> but<00:00:14.480> right

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
quite bad because of the snow but right

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.420 
quite bad because of the snow but right
there<00:00:15.469> we<00:00:15.589> can<00:00:15.679> kind<00:00:15.829> of<00:00:15.860> see<00:00:15.950> no<00:00:16.129> there's<00:00:16.309> no

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
there we can kind of see no there's no

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.060 
there we can kind of see no there's no
real<00:00:17.420> Slugger<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:17.869> he<00:00:18.050> built<00:00:18.260> up<00:00:18.380> on<00:00:18.590> there<00:00:18.800> so

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.580 
real Slugger and he built up on there so
the<00:00:19.189> struts<00:00:19.460> are<00:00:19.609> okay<00:00:20.240> shape

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
that if there is something needs to be

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.749 
that if there is something needs to be
advised<00:01:08.240> pretty<00:01:08.600> soon<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:10.340> vehicle

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
advised pretty soon so this vehicle

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.550 
advised pretty soon so this vehicle
though<00:01:10.880> seems<00:01:11.210> like<00:01:11.390> we're<00:01:11.630> looking<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:12.350> a

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
though seems like we're looking like a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.230 
though seems like we're looking like a
know<00:01:12.860> five<00:01:13.100> weeks<00:01:14.439> the<00:01:15.439> front<00:01:15.680> also<00:01:16.240> while

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
know five weeks the front also while

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.640 
know five weeks the front also while
we're<00:01:17.390> under<00:01:17.479> here<00:01:17.750> will<00:01:17.960> inspect<00:01:18.290> fluid

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
we're under here will inspect fluid

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.020 
we're under here will inspect fluid
conditions<00:01:19.070> of<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.280> few<00:01:19.430> things<00:01:19.640> I'll<00:01:19.820> go<00:01:19.909> ahead

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
conditions of a few things I'll go ahead

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.819 
conditions of a few things I'll go ahead
and<00:01:20.210> pop<00:01:20.329> this<00:01:20.570> transfer<00:01:21.020> case<00:01:21.200> offering<00:01:21.680> that

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
and pop this transfer case offering that

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.000 
and pop this transfer case offering that
because<00:01:21.979> it's<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.790> easiest<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.240> inspect

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
because it's the easiest to inspect

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
because it's the easiest to inspect
we're<00:01:26.010> just<00:01:26.100> gonna<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.370> ahead<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.580> pop<00:01:26.790> the

we're just gonna go ahead and pop the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.420 
we're just gonna go ahead and pop the
fill<00:01:27.360> plug<00:01:27.570> off<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.830> this<00:01:29.010> right<00:01:29.280> here

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.530 

will

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
will

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:47.020 
will
a<00:01:39.310> little<00:01:40.310> sample<00:01:40.730> out<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:41.000> there<00:01:45.760> this<00:01:46.760> one

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
a little sample out of there this one

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.270 
a little sample out of there this one
and<00:01:47.420> kind<00:01:47.660> of<00:01:47.690> see<00:01:47.930> just<00:01:48.380> from<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.650> residue<00:01:49.040> a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
and kind of see just from the residue a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.120 
and kind of see just from the residue a
little<00:01:49.790> black<00:01:50.150> kind<00:01:50.750> of<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:51.710> know<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.980> little

little black kind of you know a little

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.400 
little black kind of you know a little
bit<00:01:52.250> darker<00:01:52.610> color<00:01:52.850> things<00:01:53.180> like<00:01:53.330> that<00:01:53.570> this

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
bit darker color things like that this

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.990 
bit darker color things like that this
is<00:01:54.710> probably<00:01:54.950> due<00:01:55.250> for<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> transmission

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
is probably due for a transmission

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.810 
is probably due for a transmission

on<00:02:09.740> that<00:02:11.050> tighten<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.140> back<00:02:12.350> up<00:02:12.590> here<00:02:16.360> go

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
on that tighten that back up here go

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.050 
on that tighten that back up here go
back<00:02:17.540> here<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.870> rear<00:02:18.080> yeah<00:02:18.700> check<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.730> out

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
back here the rear yeah check it out

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.060 
back here the rear yeah check it out
real<00:02:20.270> quick<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.780> see<00:02:21.050> how<00:02:21.440> they're<00:02:21.590> looking

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.320 

again<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.220> rear<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.520> front<00:02:25.640> difference<00:02:26.180> are

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
again the rear and front difference are

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.360 
again the rear and front difference are
both<00:02:26.510> things<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:27.560> also<00:02:27.709> do<00:02:27.980> service

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
both things that we also do service

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.699 
both things that we also do service
almost<00:02:28.580> 30<00:02:29.000> 60<00:02:29.480> 90<00:02:29.510> thousand<00:02:30.050> mile<00:02:30.170> services

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
almost 30 60 90 thousand mile services

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.820 
almost 30 60 90 thousand mile services
that<00:02:30.980> will<00:02:31.670> come<00:02:31.820> about<00:02:31.970> later<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:33.650> just

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
that will come about later we just

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.380 
that will come about later we just
always<00:02:33.980> want<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.310> every<00:02:34.610> time<00:02:34.790> here<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.150> for<00:02:35.300> an

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
always want to every time here in for an

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.880 
always want to every time here in for an
oil<00:02:35.450> change<00:02:35.600> we<00:02:35.930> inspect<00:02:36.260> these<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.590> make<00:02:36.680> sure

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
oil change we inspect these to make sure

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.210 
oil change we inspect these to make sure
the<00:02:37.040> fluids<00:02:37.400> did<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.030> proper<00:02:38.360> level<00:02:42.220> sample

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the fluids did the proper level sample

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.699 
the fluids did the proper level sample
there<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:44.660> one's<00:02:44.870> actually<00:02:45.019> real<00:02:45.350> clean

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
there this one's actually real clean

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.860 
there this one's actually real clean
can't<00:02:46.310> see<00:02:46.430> really<00:02:46.550> any<00:02:46.700> dark<00:02:47.120> fluid<00:02:47.570> or

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
can't see really any dark fluid or

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.690 
can't see really any dark fluid or
anything<00:02:48.170> like<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.440> lighting<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.459> kind<00:02:49.640> of

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
anything like that lighting is kind of

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.210 
anything like that lighting is kind of
bad<00:02:49.880> apologize<00:02:50.480> for<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.980> we'll<00:02:51.980> go<00:02:52.130> ahead

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.479 

all<00:03:05.879> right<00:03:06.560> one<00:03:07.560> thing<00:03:07.709> back<00:03:07.920> here<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.250> also

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
all right one thing back here we also

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.119 
all right one thing back here we also
check<00:03:08.730> with<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.269> suspension<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.080> our<00:03:10.260> shocks

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
check with that suspension is our shocks

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.839 
check with that suspension is our shocks
back<00:03:11.940> here<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:13.230> right<00:03:13.830> now<00:03:13.860> as<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.730> can<00:03:14.790> see

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
back here and right now as you can see

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.210 
back here and right now as you can see
we<00:03:15.060> don't<00:03:15.209> really<00:03:15.330> have<00:03:15.510> any<00:03:15.720> moisture<00:03:16.290> coming

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
we don't really have any moisture coming

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.470 
we don't really have any moisture coming
off<00:03:17.430> these<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:17.849> these<00:03:17.940> sharks<00:03:18.180> are<00:03:18.239> still<00:03:18.390> in

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
off these so these sharks are still in

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.820 
off these so these sharks are still in

actually got a bad one over back here by

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.350 
actually got a bad one over back here by
my<00:03:21.900> toolbox<00:03:25.220> what<00:03:26.220> we<00:03:26.310> look<00:03:26.519> for<00:03:26.549> as<00:03:26.909> far<00:03:27.180> as

my toolbox what we look for as far as

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.890 
my toolbox what we look for as far as
shocks<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.440> are<00:03:28.500> blown<00:03:28.860> out<00:03:29.129> leakage<00:03:29.790> as<00:03:30.690> you

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
shocks that are blown out leakage as you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.140 
shocks that are blown out leakage as you
can<00:03:31.019> see<00:03:31.170> on<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> one<00:03:31.530> all<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.819> buildup

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
can see on this one all that buildup

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.180 
can see on this one all that buildup
right<00:03:33.390> there<00:03:33.629> is<00:03:33.750> leakage<00:03:33.959> out<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:34.560> strug

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
right there is leakage out of this strug

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.729 
right there is leakage out of this strug
I<00:03:35.220> mean<00:03:35.670> shock<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.540> apologize<00:03:36.959> for<00:03:37.079> that<00:03:37.140> this

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
a good shock that hasn't been leaking I

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.479 
a good shock that hasn't been leaking I
can't<00:03:42.750> push<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.109> together<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.829> shock<00:03:44.099> I<00:03:44.310> can

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
can't push that together the shock I can

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.920 
can't push that together the shock I can
do<00:03:45.000> whatever<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.420> want<00:03:45.450> look<00:03:45.810> because<00:03:46.019> it's<00:03:46.170> bad

that's<00:03:48.930> what<00:03:49.049> we<00:03:49.170> inspect<00:03:49.470> full<00:03:49.620> on<00:03:49.739> these

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
that's what we inspect full on these

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.400 
that's what we inspect full on these
suspension<00:03:50.400> components<00:03:50.849> so<00:03:51.840> now<00:03:52.109> that<00:03:52.170> we've

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
suspension components so now that we've

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.339 
suspension components so now that we've
kind<00:03:53.069> of<00:03:53.190> gone<00:03:53.280> through<00:03:53.340> all<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.349> see

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
kind of gone through all that you see

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.780 
kind of gone through all that you see
what<00:03:55.470> we<00:03:55.590> basically<00:03:55.829> look<00:03:56.220> for<00:03:56.250> underneath

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
what we basically look for underneath

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.610 
what we basically look for underneath
the<00:03:56.879> vehicle<00:03:57.030> inspector<00:03:57.690> leaks<00:03:57.930> inspect<00:03:58.349> the

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
the vehicle inspector leaks inspect the

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.699 
the vehicle inspector leaks inspect the
exhaust<00:03:59.180> respect<00:04:00.180> strut<00:04:00.690> suspension<00:04:00.870> tie

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
exhaust respect strut suspension tie

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.710 
exhaust respect strut suspension tie
rods<00:04:01.980> things<00:04:02.340> like<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.389> we're<00:04:03.510> gonna<00:04:03.599> go

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
rods things like that so we're gonna go

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.180 
rods things like that so we're gonna go
ahead<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:03.870> lower<00:04:04.079> this<00:04:04.200> down<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.829> next<00:04:05.040> step

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
ahead and lower this down the next step

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.830 
ahead and lower this down the next step
we<00:04:05.340> do<00:04:05.489> as<00:04:05.760> we're<00:04:05.970> lowering<00:04:06.299> their<00:04:06.510> vehicle

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
we do as we're lowering their vehicle

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.690 
we do as we're lowering their vehicle
back<00:04:07.019> down<00:04:07.319> or<00:04:07.709> actually<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.130> our<00:04:08.220> speed<00:04:08.519> bay

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
back down or actually in our speed bay

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.220 
back down or actually in our speed bay
usually<00:04:09.120> there's<00:04:09.299> another<00:04:09.599> technician<00:04:09.900> that

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
usually there's another technician that

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.870 
usually there's another technician that
will<00:04:10.380> do<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.739> forcing<00:04:11.250> wall<00:04:11.459> someone's

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
will do this forcing wall someone's

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.809 
will do this forcing wall someone's
draining<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.269> oil<00:04:12.299> it's<00:04:12.780> okay<00:04:13.049> always<00:04:14.010> check

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
draining the oil it's okay always check

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.240 
draining the oil it's okay always check
for<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.329> tire<00:04:15.510> pressures<00:04:16.019> we<00:04:16.799> rotate<00:04:17.160> them

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
for the tire pressures we rotate them

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.610 
for the tire pressures we rotate them
