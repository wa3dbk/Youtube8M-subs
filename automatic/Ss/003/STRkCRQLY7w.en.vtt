00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.240
 Today 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.279
 opens in the singer's show 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.270
 fun morning the first to pass 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.270
 this girl 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.010
 what is your name 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.010
 and then it's the turn of quickie 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.670
 the problem is the problem 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.220
 what is the problem 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.460
 it's time that I can not 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.120
 and if it also appears to focus 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.390
 interpreting a son of Vicente 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.390
 fernandez 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.229
 I do not 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.610
 and we put all kinds of madness part 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.400
 of what you see are the evidence of 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.470
 us and weapons with a comic touch what 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.360
 we come to light and suddenly arms 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.500
 all the ruckus here and for that the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.500
 people have fun to the fullest 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.040
 they are all part of moral productions 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.000
 the mere mere are the brothers copó and 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.680
 cookie and quickie in this life laugh 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.780
 from one this work to make fun of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.850
 God is not one and the truth then 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.900
 I also feel good because I already 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.570
 I used to that risk 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.000
 while they were saved they bothered 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.020
 much to cars inkling for having a body 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.020
 of few pounds 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.729
 and I admit for his stature 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.280
 to interview danielito we're going to 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.000
 keep quiet to be at his height 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.730
 weakened against I felt bad being there 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.870
 do not do to God not the most annoying thing that 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.870
 I felt when people say goodbye 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.670
 the morals are also fans of 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.620
 code 21 and they have a segment where 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.620
 they present very peculiar news 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.430
 Y 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.239
 it's my land 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.620
 of course with all these occurrences 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.620
 the audience did not stop laughing 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.920
 it's excellent 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.950
 where are we looking 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.080
 want to vote a little bit of stress and 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.330
 have fun visit the park the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.360
 family on Sundays is undoubtedly the 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.600
 will go big next to these 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.770
 ambassadors of laughter to warm urías 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.770
 code 21 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.340
 for others
