it<00:01:14.980> up<00:01:15.070> now<00:01:15.550> one<00:01:15.820> thing<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:16.090> notice<00:01:16.750> here

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
it up now one thing to notice here

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.340 
it up now one thing to notice here
obviously<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.310> tolerances<00:01:19.180> on<00:01:19.509> this<00:01:20.049> cutout

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
obviously the tolerances on this cutout

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.789 
obviously the tolerances on this cutout
or<00:01:20.649> extremely<00:01:21.610> tight<00:01:22.329> so<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:22.990> only<00:01:23.229> chord

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
or extremely tight so the only chord

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.499 
or extremely tight so the only chord
you're<00:01:23.979> probably<00:01:24.250> going<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:24.670> fit<00:01:24.939> in<00:01:24.970> here<00:01:25.360> is

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
you're probably going to fit in here is

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.980 
you're probably going to fit in here is
the<00:01:26.200> original<00:01:26.579> lightning<00:01:27.579> adapter<00:01:27.990> if

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
the original lightning adapter if

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.289 
the original lightning adapter if
there's<00:01:29.259> something<00:01:29.590> out<00:01:29.740> there<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:29.979> is<00:01:30.490> well

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
there's something out there that is well

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.359 
there's something out there that is well
let's<00:01:31.719> be<00:01:31.899> honest<00:01:32.200> it's<00:01:32.409> got<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.710> be<00:01:32.799> exactly

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
let's be honest it's got to be exactly

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.080 
let's be honest it's got to be exactly
like<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.630> Lightning<00:01:35.439> port<00:01:35.649> for<00:01:36.159> lightning

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
like the Lightning port for lightning

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.389 
like the Lightning port for lightning
adapter<00:01:37.329> for<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.200> iphone<00:01:38.530> 5<00:01:38.770> as<00:01:38.979> you<00:01:39.130> can<00:01:39.250> see

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
adapter for the iphone 5 as you can see

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.550 
adapter for the iphone 5 as you can see
the<00:01:39.579> opening<00:01:39.939> is<00:01:40.119> just<00:01:40.630> large<00:01:40.869> enough<00:01:41.020> for<00:01:41.259> the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the opening is just large enough for the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.499 
the opening is just large enough for the
lightning<00:01:41.890> adapter<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.340> go<00:01:42.460> through<00:01:42.789> so<00:01:43.299> once

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
lightning adapter to go through so once

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.550 
lightning adapter to go through so once
you<00:01:43.600> get<00:01:43.689> that<00:01:43.840> in<00:01:44.020> there<00:01:44.170> you're<00:01:44.350> going<00:01:44.469> to

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
you get that in there you're going to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.959 
you get that in there you're going to
tighten<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.039> screw<00:01:45.340> down<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.700> it's<00:01:45.789> going<00:01:45.909> to

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
tighten the screw down and it's going to

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.959 
tighten the screw down and it's going to
give<00:01:46.180> you<00:01:46.360> a<00:01:46.570> nice<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.140> nice<00:01:47.979> solid<00:01:48.310> feel<00:01:48.729> there

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
give you a nice a nice solid feel there

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.910 
give you a nice a nice solid feel there
now<00:01:49.119> probably<00:01:49.390> should<00:01:49.869> be<00:01:50.079> more<00:01:50.560> close<00:01:50.890> to

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
now probably should be more close to

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.609 
now probably should be more close to
laying<00:01:51.729> flat<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.360> there<00:01:52.570> but<00:01:53.079> I<00:01:53.110> did<00:01:53.320> put<00:01:53.439> it<00:01:53.560> up

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
laying flat in there but I did put it up

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.920 
laying flat in there but I did put it up
a<00:01:53.740> little<00:01:53.860> bit<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.490> do<00:01:54.549> move<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.119> piece<00:01:55.689> in

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
a little bit and I do move the piece in

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.899 
a little bit and I do move the piece in
here<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.320> little<00:01:56.710> bit<00:01:56.890> because<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.399> a<00:01:57.430> naked

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
tried that out you probably would want

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
to set the lightning adapter a little

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.859 
to set the lightning adapter a little
bit<00:02:06.159> higher<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.789> give<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.420> little<00:02:07.659> bit<00:02:07.780> of

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
bit higher to give you a little bit of

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.100 
bit higher to give you a little bit of
room<00:02:08.050> for<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.380> case<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.680> slide<00:02:09.190> over<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.670> and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
room for the case to slide over that and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.780 
room for the case to slide over that and
you<00:02:11.110> messing<00:02:11.740> with<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:12.250> then<00:02:12.370> moving<00:02:12.610> it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
you messing with it and then moving it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.940 
you messing with it and then moving it
around<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.840> might<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.230> something<00:02:14.650> just

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
around it might be just something just

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.590 
around it might be just something just
easier<00:02:15.280> just<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.520> lay<00:02:15.730> flat<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.180> take<00:02:16.390> your

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
easier just to lay flat and take your

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.660 
easier just to lay flat and take your
case<00:02:16.840> off<00:02:17.110> while<00:02:17.350> you're<00:02:17.530> doing<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.580> if

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
case off while you're doing that but if

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.830 
case off while you're doing that but if
you're<00:02:18.760> going<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.000> be<00:02:19.150> having<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.450> case<00:02:19.660> on

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
you're going to be having a case on

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.930 
you're going to be having a case on
there<00:02:19.990> or<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.350> same<00:02:20.590> case<00:02:20.920> most<00:02:21.490> of<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.730> time

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
there or the same case most of the time

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.850 
there or the same case most of the time
then<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.570> probably<00:02:22.780> could<00:02:23.170> set<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.470> up<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.770> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
then you probably could set it up to the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.580 
then you probably could set it up to the
way<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.280> want<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.290> boom<00:02:26.290> you're

just<00:03:05.650> fine<00:03:05.819> did<00:03:06.819> test<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.239> out<00:03:07.299> a<00:03:07.360> little<00:03:07.510> bit

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
just fine did test it out a little bit

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.850 
just fine did test it out a little bit
there<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.049> that's<00:03:08.200> not<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.380> problem<00:03:08.680> with<00:03:08.830> that

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
there so that's not a problem with that

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.660 
there so that's not a problem with that
but<00:03:09.610> design<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.420> very<00:03:10.750> basic<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:12.310> will<00:03:12.519> not

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
but design is very basic it will not

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.059 
but design is very basic it will not
move<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.840> looks<00:03:14.080> good<00:03:14.290> they<00:03:14.709> do<00:03:14.769> have

move and it looks good they do have

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.640 
move and it looks good they do have
other<00:03:15.220> colors<00:03:15.519> available<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.450> this<00:03:17.230> bad<00:03:17.440> boy
