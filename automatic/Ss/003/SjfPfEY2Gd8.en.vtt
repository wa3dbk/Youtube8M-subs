00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
all right we're going to do a little

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.210 
all right we're going to do a little
flight<00:00:10.740> today<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.339> the<00:00:11.519> horizon<00:00:12.360> hobbies<00:00:12.959> for

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
flight today of the horizon hobbies for

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.210 
flight today of the horizon hobbies for
RC<00:00:14.880> which<00:00:15.180> are<00:00:15.420> four<00:00:15.720> channel<00:00:16.080> coax<00:00:16.560> choppers

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
RC which are four channel coax choppers

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.540 
RC which are four channel coax choppers
that<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.580> these<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.860> machine<00:00:19.860> guns<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
that have these little machine guns and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.540 
that have these little machine guns and
a<00:00:20.580> little<00:00:20.820> speaker<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> controller

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
a little speaker and the controller

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.590 
a little speaker and the controller
tells<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.730> when<00:00:23.880> you're<00:00:24.029> shooting<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.540> it

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
tells you when you're shooting and it

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.200 
tells you when you're shooting and it
flashes<00:00:25.230> they<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.310> fight<00:00:26.550> each<00:00:26.730> other<00:00:26.939> they

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
flashes they can fight each other they

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.530 
flashes they can fight each other they
come<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.540> a<00:00:27.570> set<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.820> it's<00:00:29.820> got<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> swash<00:00:30.270> plate

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
come as a set and it's got a swash plate

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.680 
come as a set and it's got a swash plate
with<00:00:31.500> nice<00:00:31.710> precise<00:00:32.400> controls<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.360> we'll<00:00:33.510> take

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
with nice precise controls so we'll take

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.580 
with nice precise controls so we'll take
it<00:00:33.780> out<00:00:33.900> for<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.770> test<00:00:35.070> spin<00:00:39.290> as<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> can

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it out for a little test spin as you can

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.330 
it out for a little test spin as you can
see<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:42.170> solid<00:00:43.170> flying<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
see it's just a really solid flying you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.970 
see it's just a really solid flying you
can<00:00:44.550> adjust<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.750> trims<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.290> little<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.740> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
can adjust the trims a little bit and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.840 
can adjust the trims a little bit and
other<00:00:47.340> nuts<00:00:47.700> hands<00:00:48.120> off<00:00:48.450> right<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:49.850> strong

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
other nuts hands off right there strong

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:09.250 
other nuts hands off right there strong
gyro<00:00:51.240> and<00:00:51.510> nice<00:00:52.260> precise<00:00:52.950> controls

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.770 

to<00:01:09.830> show<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.130> how<00:01:10.400> how<00:01:10.700> maneuverable<00:01:10.970> this<00:01:11.540> is

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
to show you how how maneuverable this is

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.920 
to show you how how maneuverable this is
this<00:01:12.020> particular<00:01:12.350> one<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:12.770> move<00:01:13.160> the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
this particular one I move the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.100 
this particular one I move the
swashplate<00:01:14.930> balls<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:16.790> their<00:01:17.210> longer

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
swashplate balls to their longer

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.600 
swashplate balls to their longer
position<00:01:18.650> which<00:01:18.800> gives<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.160> a<00:01:19.250> little<00:01:19.430> bit

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
position which gives it a little bit

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.660 
position which gives it a little bit
more<00:01:20.500> speed<00:01:21.500> but<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:21.860> can<00:01:22.010> see<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:22.340> that's

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
more speed but you can see it's that's

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.950 
more speed but you can see it's that's
full<00:01:22.940> throttle<00:01:23.390> forward<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:24.890> scoots<00:01:25.250> around

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
full throttle forward it scoots around

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
full throttle forward it scoots around
but<00:01:27.640> definitely<00:01:28.640> indoor<00:01:29.120> only<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:30.440> so<00:01:30.800> let's

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
but definitely indoor only and so let's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.010 
but definitely indoor only and so let's
just<00:01:31.190> see<00:01:31.370> how<00:01:31.550> controllable<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.570> is<00:01:32.720> in<00:01:32.900> all

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
just see how controllable it is in all

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.050 
just see how controllable it is in all
directions<00:01:33.200> i<00:01:33.800> was<00:01:33.890> practicing<00:01:34.130> this<00:01:34.580> before

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
directions i was practicing this before

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.590 
directions i was practicing this before
let's<00:01:35.180> see<00:01:35.390> if<00:01:35.480> i<00:01:35.540> can<00:01:35.690> do<00:01:36.050> it<00:01:36.170> again

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.440 

oh<00:01:42.979> I'm<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.130> totally<00:01:44.310> clean<00:01:44.820> let's<00:01:45.119> try<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
oh I'm not totally clean let's try it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.690 
oh I'm not totally clean let's try it
this<00:01:45.540> way

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:03.670 

there<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.799> try<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.860> sideways

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:14.179 

and<00:02:04.070> how<00:02:04.490> about<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:06.710> way

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.699 

yeah<00:02:15.189> all<00:02:15.549> right<00:02:15.790> now<00:02:16.689> I've<00:02:16.840> set<00:02:17.109> up<00:02:17.140> over<00:02:17.560> on

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
yeah all right now I've set up over on

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.030 
yeah all right now I've set up over on
the<00:02:18.659> table<00:02:19.659> over<00:02:19.959> there<00:02:19.989> in<00:02:20.439> front<00:02:20.769> of<00:02:20.920> that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
the table over there in front of that

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.940 
the table over there in front of that
wouldn't<00:02:21.609> share<00:02:21.909> a<00:02:22.569> little<00:02:22.900> ground<00:02:23.260> target

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
wouldn't share a little ground target

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.589 
wouldn't share a little ground target
well<00:02:24.099> see<00:02:24.250> how<00:02:24.310> accurate<00:02:24.909> this<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.359> that's

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
well see how accurate this is that's

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.839 
well see how accurate this is that's
about<00:02:25.689> probably<00:02:26.650> 20<00:02:26.950> feet<00:02:27.159> away<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.459> that's

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
about probably 20 feet away so that's

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:36.229 
about probably 20 feet away so that's
dead-on<00:02:28.290> will<00:02:29.290> fire<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.989> now<00:02:33.209> how<00:02:34.209> about<00:02:34.420> now

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
dead-on will fire it now how about now

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.699 
dead-on will fire it now how about now
now<00:02:37.239> it's<00:02:37.420> been<00:02:37.569> on<00:02:37.689> for<00:02:37.719> a<00:02:37.959> while<00:02:38.019> it's<00:02:38.409> trying

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
now it's been on for a while it's trying

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.259 
now it's been on for a while it's trying
to<00:02:38.799> reset<00:02:39.219> that<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.730> ground<00:02:42.969> tired

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
to reset that this is the ground tired

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.409 
to reset that this is the ground tired
let's<00:02:43.420> make<00:02:43.569> sure<00:02:43.599> it's<00:02:43.840> working<00:02:45.060> all<00:02:46.060> right

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:46.419 
let's make sure it's working all right

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.920 
let's make sure it's working all right
that<00:02:46.750> was<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:46.959> hit<00:02:47.260> tip<00:02:47.829> this<00:02:48.099> up<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.930> we'll

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
that was a hit tip this up and we'll

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.379 
that was a hit tip this up and we'll
come<00:02:50.169> back<00:02:50.200> here<00:02:50.709> again<00:02:50.859> just<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:52.090> one<00:02:52.359> I

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
come back here again just this one I

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.960 
come back here again just this one I
also<00:02:52.689> i<00:02:52.900> think<00:02:53.109> i<00:02:53.379> change<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.859> range<00:02:54.189> to<00:02:54.849> make

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
also i think i change the range to make

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.789 
also i think i change the range to make
it<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.120> little<00:02:55.239> bit<00:02:55.450> tighter<00:02:55.780> spread<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.620> a

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
it a little bit tighter spread and a

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.530 
it a little bit tighter spread and a
little<00:02:57.340> more<00:02:57.430> difficult<00:02:57.669> to<00:02:58.060> hit<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:58.389> let's

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
little more difficult to hit so let's

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.229 
little more difficult to hit so let's
try<00:02:58.750> it<00:03:01.349> all<00:03:02.349> right<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:02.889> here<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.579> should<00:03:04.000> be

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
try it all right so here this should be

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.009 
try it all right so here this should be
a<00:03:04.269> Miss<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:06.069> is<00:03:06.370> now<00:03:06.969> let's<00:03:07.269> get<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.019> dead-on

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
a Miss it is now let's get it dead-on

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.750 
a Miss it is now let's get it dead-on
that<00:03:11.019> was<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.260> hit<00:03:11.590> let's<00:03:12.189> bring<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.549> back<00:03:12.579> a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
that was a hit let's bring it back a
