merging from those questions it's about

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.090 
merging from those questions it's about
expansion<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.750> about<00:02:56.900> hiring<00:02:57.319> it's<00:02:57.920> about

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
expansion it's about hiring it's about

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.949 
expansion it's about hiring it's about
growth<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.900> now<00:03:00.739> we<00:03:00.799> look<00:03:01.069> at<00:03:01.190> 2012<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.420> we're

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
growth so now we look at 2012 and we're

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.170 
growth so now we look at 2012 and we're
seeing<00:03:03.170> quite<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.440> different<00:03:03.950> scenario<00:03:04.250> what

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
seeing quite a different scenario what

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.630 
seeing quite a different scenario what
are<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.390> types<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.780> questions<00:03:05.840> that
