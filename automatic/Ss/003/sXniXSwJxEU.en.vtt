00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
I'm a little reluctant it's looking like

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.600 
I'm a little reluctant it's looking like
it's<00:02:49.989> going<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.140> be<00:02:50.260> one<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.530> those<00:02:50.709> we're

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
it's going to be one of those we're

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.250 
it's going to be one of those we're
gonna<00:02:51.730> put<00:02:52.030> leather<00:02:52.299> on<00:02:52.570> them<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.110> they're

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
gonna put leather on them and they're

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.410 
gonna put leather on them and they're
going<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.470> be<00:02:53.620> running<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.220> lot<00:02:54.430> kind<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.180> things

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
going to be running a lot kind of things

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.289 
going to be running a lot kind of things
and<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.260> little<00:02:57.160> worried<00:02:57.549> because<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:58.150> thing

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
and a little worried because the thing

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.580 
and a little worried because the thing
about<00:02:58.450> arrow<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.019> said<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> little<00:02:59.380> bit

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
about arrow is it said a little bit

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.520 
about arrow is it said a little bit
realistically<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.840> we<00:03:01.840> have<00:03:01.989> some<00:03:02.260> sort<00:03:02.440> of

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
realistically so we have some sort of

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.500 
realistically so we have some sort of
basis<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.100> go<00:03:03.220> on<00:03:03.400> but<00:03:03.970> when<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.209> mix<00:03:04.360> in

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
basis to go on but when you mix in

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.110 
basis to go on but when you mix in
superpowers<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.320> live<00:03:05.500> action<00:03:06.010> sometimes<00:03:06.970> it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
superpowers and live action sometimes it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.979 
superpowers and live action sometimes it
gets<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.269> little<00:03:07.390> bit<00:03:07.570> tricky<00:03:07.840> especially

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
gets a little bit tricky especially

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.940 
gets a little bit tricky especially
live-action<00:03:08.680> TV<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:10.319> keeping<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.380> going

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
live-action TV so keeping that going

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.979 
live-action TV so keeping that going
