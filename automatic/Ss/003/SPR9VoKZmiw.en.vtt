longer accessible via that means which
is<00:01:00.930> interesting<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.590> wonder<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.010> means

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.340 
is interesting I wonder if that means
that<00:01:02.609> somewhere<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.300> Skyrim<00:01:03.840> there's<00:01:04.140> another

that somewhere in Skyrim there's another
portal<00:01:05.840> also<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.110> interesting

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
portal also I think it's interesting

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.570 
portal also I think it's interesting
