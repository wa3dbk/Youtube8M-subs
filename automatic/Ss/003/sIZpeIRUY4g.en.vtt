00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:22.619
 big does not go into what we are going to be able to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 is to teach everything we have here 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.179
 because we have asked for more things 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.880
 additional the camera has a cost of 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.189
 $ 599 but here we have 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.039
 order there was a package for 649 dollars 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.150
 they sent us to make a case there 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.840
 is 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.190
 we have here more than one battery 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.950
 additional to do all that for the 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.960
 649 dollars paypal 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.780
 and 49 dollars more to be able to have all 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.310
 these extras more 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:03.020
 we have here with the battery 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.770
 here we have a protector 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.670
 here we have in control I do not know if 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.550
 you have been able to see everything that is 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.989
 teaching them here we have the card and it 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.500
 it takes the one that possibly falls short 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.610
 with that we already have a protector for the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.610
 LCD screen 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.980
 and taking out the things that we have most 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.980
 here 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.870
 to dependents a few small appointments that 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:35.960
 we can place it in your hand here 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:40.190
 we have the revol st3 camera and part of 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.830
 something else documentation let's do it and 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.370
 that's it now we're going to open the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.090
 little box that you think we're going to uncover 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.630
 the and simple documentation more 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.520
 manual documentation I will have to 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.810
 read it because for me all this is new 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.330
 also we have 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.430
 we have the stable to have it in the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:07.000
 stable neck to connect it to 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.180
 TV in the case of seeing directly 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.360
 a bigger screen I imagine this 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.740
 it's for the computer us 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.710
 and this since it looks usb and we go to the 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.140
 battery charger 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:27.040
 we have the battery here 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.990
 which comes from the factory here we have another 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.480
 tablet that is not to charge the battery 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.430
 commented 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.590
 to the battery connector as the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.720
 battery charger here we have the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.720
 customer includes 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.660
 of 135 millimeters you have it 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:53.069
 so we have suffered this 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.069
 and here we have 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.569
 the box 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.569
 here we have 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.930
 the camera and what we're going to do now 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.220
 is to talk about the specifications 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.200
 we just put the lens with 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.160
 you can appreciate and this model 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.900
 I repeat is canon clock 63 and lives with the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.860
 18 megapixel camera here you go to 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.450
 have the flash and then the lens is 18 135 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.850
 millimeters the screen comes with a 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.490
 screen on the back of lcd's 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.860
 3 inches you earn can close 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.540
 unfortunately, being here is not here 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.260
 the model t 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.760
 4 and is the one that comes with touch screen 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.760
 I wanted to buy that mentally the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.990
 they have discontinued and we are not going to 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.720
 have to simply handle the menu 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.990
 using these buttons is capable of 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.690
 record video at 1080p and is also capable 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.729
 to take continuous pictures up to 3 points 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.860
 7 continuous photos per second 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.050
 as I mentioned at the beginning, we are here 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.479

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.460
