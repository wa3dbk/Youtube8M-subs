00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.090
 characters of Solomon king the extenders if 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.910
 the key aspect of the new assassin creed 2 the guild of assassins in 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.990

 combat system we wanted to make fighting more dynamic for 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.720
 sure cianci share giving life to the city of rome was an incredible challenge 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.539
 the biggest city we have 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.560
 images create digital music fest in size is three times more 

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:47.230

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.670
 very self ex 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.790
 undoubtedly one of the most complex buildings to be recreated was the Colosseum 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.810
 because of the circular shape and if then for the multitude of arechi also for 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.290
 Italian building 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.250
 they are possible if you think about half a million polygons in Rome 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 of the main city but it is not the only one present in the game there will be others 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.340
 city 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.190
 now I do not want to reveal too many monstrous for example they will return 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.670
 then we will visit Naples 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.819
 for a specific mission while the fans of the series will be surprised to find out 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.910
 the missions set in florence in venice august so we will also return to 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.840
 these two murderous cities of the beginning I knew that this was the environment in which 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.870
 I wanted to work is nice when you have a dream as a kid and you find yourself the way to 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.970
 making it happen I consider myself very lucky because I could not have imagined it for 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.130

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:44.410
 the other 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.940
 for what compelled perceived a bit in all guys of the ubisoft team 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.280
 montreal and I think it is a fundamental thing with it you must give life to 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.389
 something really complex like a modern videogame 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.489

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:02.469
 I lost 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.109
 but what would I like to start immediately from the initiatives that preceded the launch of 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.829
 this assassin's creed in varadero from initiatives that give a measure 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.019
 of the importance of this brenta for arai ubisoft for example you have 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.809
 organized a fan of the 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:19.339

 contemporary art hosts an exhibition dedicated to a single by biagio 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.889
 partitina we write Prato plays a fundamental role we have heard 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.209
 the interview with developers a great job that required reconstruction 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.309

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.719
 not just because I have tried other dates I only say this hotel 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.999
