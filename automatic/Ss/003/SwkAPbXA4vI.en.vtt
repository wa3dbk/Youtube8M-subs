this is a quick tutorial and I have to

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.030 
this is a quick tutorial and I have to
take<00:00:23.720> out<00:00:23.840> there<00:00:24.020> John<00:00:24.200> DMC<00:00:24.910> it's<00:00:25.910> on<00:00:26.119> Nephilim

so<00:00:28.040> hard<00:00:28.279> and<00:00:29.110> the<00:00:30.110> trick<00:00:30.410> is<00:00:30.770> really<00:00:31.460> to<00:00:31.820> just

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
so hard and the trick is really to just

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.080 
so hard and the trick is really to just
do<00:00:32.810> what<00:00:33.200> you<00:00:33.350> don't<00:00:33.650> want<00:00:33.980> to<00:00:34.100> do<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:34.640> that<00:00:35.060> is

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
do what you don't want to do and that is

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.930 
do what you don't want to do and that is
take<00:00:35.510> your<00:00:35.720> time<00:00:35.900> first<00:00:36.829> time<00:00:37.010> I<00:00:37.040> bought

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
take your time first time I bought

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.689 
take your time first time I bought
Virgil<00:00:38.420> I<00:00:38.630> think<00:00:39.590> I<00:00:39.710> was<00:00:39.920> just<00:00:40.040> fashion<00:00:40.520> around

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
Virgil I think I was just fashion around

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.430 
Virgil I think I was just fashion around
like<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.030> kind<00:00:41.300> of<00:00:41.359> dodged<00:00:41.570> them<00:00:41.840> as<00:00:41.989> a<00:00:42.020> tan<00:00:42.260> X

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
like this kind of dodged them as a tan X

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.400 
like this kind of dodged them as a tan X
but<00:00:43.420> what<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.480> do<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:44.780> got<00:00:45.050> less<00:00:45.170> like<00:00:45.379> you

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
but what you do that got less like you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.680 
but what you do that got less like you
are<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:46.550> actually<00:00:46.820> find<00:00:47.059> another<00:00:47.300> thing<00:00:47.510> and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
are to actually find another thing and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.020 
are to actually find another thing and
this<00:00:48.649> is<00:00:48.890> all<00:00:49.070> about<00:00:49.280> trial<00:00:49.519> now<00:00:49.760> just

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
this is all about trial now just

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.790 
this is all about trial now just
learning<00:00:50.390> what<00:00:50.420> moves<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:51.289> does<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:51.710> what

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
learning what moves you does and what

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.020 
learning what moves you does and what
news<00:00:51.980> he<00:00:52.129> likes<00:00:52.309> to<00:00:52.399> do<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:52.670> when<00:00:52.789> he<00:00:52.879> does

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
news he likes to do and when he does

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.229 
news he likes to do and when he does
them<00:00:54.309> but<00:00:55.309> hopefully<00:00:55.760> I<00:00:55.820> could<00:00:56.000> point<00:00:56.090> out

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
them but hopefully I could point out

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.450 
them but hopefully I could point out
some<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.480> his<00:00:56.600> moves<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.050> tell<00:00:57.829> you<00:00:57.920> how<00:00:58.399> to

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
some of his moves and tell you how to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.650 
some of his moves and tell you how to
count<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.730> seconds<00:00:59.030> like<00:00:59.210> whatever<00:00:59.600> you

run the risk we get in there hit by a
projectile<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:27.049> of<00:01:27.409> course<00:01:27.590> when<00:01:27.740> he<00:01:27.799> does

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
projectile and of course when he does

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.830 
projectile and of course when he does
that<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:30.939> straight<00:01:31.939> move

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.910 

they<00:01:35.840> tries<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.170> attack<00:01:36.350> your<00:01:36.470> head<00:01:36.620> on<00:01:36.740> you

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
they tries to attack your head on you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.220 
they tries to attack your head on you
can<00:01:37.160> point<00:01:37.760> out<00:01:37.850> like<00:01:38.060> somebody<00:01:38.210> does<00:01:38.390> it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.080 

again<00:01:41.950> just<00:01:42.160> kind<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.550> sticking<00:01:42.790> out<00:01:42.970> this

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
again just kind of sticking out this

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.030 
again just kind of sticking out this
week<00:01:43.300> I<00:01:43.630> think<00:01:43.960> it's<00:01:44.050> this<00:01:44.260> move<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.650> you<00:01:44.800> can

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
week I think it's this move that you can

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.550 
week I think it's this move that you can
actually<00:01:46.530> you've<00:01:47.530> got<00:01:47.650> a<00:01:47.680> decent<00:01:47.830> angle<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
actually you've got a decent angle you

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.360 
actually you've got a decent angle you
can<00:01:50.770> as<00:01:51.010> you<00:01:51.160> grapple<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.580> grab<00:01:52.390> his<00:01:52.420> back<00:01:52.690> and

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
can as you grapple and grab his back and

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.800 
can as you grapple and grab his back and
you<00:01:54.370> can<00:01:54.490> never<00:01:54.580> go<00:01:54.820> towards<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.360> more<00:01:55.510> bring

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
you can never go towards a more bring

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.000 
you can never go towards a more bring
him<00:01:55.930> towards<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:57.090> let's<00:01:58.090> move<00:01:58.210> here<00:01:58.590> yep<00:01:59.590> I

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.040 

will<00:02:03.010> always<00:02:03.280> use<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.030> fist<00:02:04.390> over<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.870> axe

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
will always use the fist over the axe

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.280 
will always use the fist over the axe
every<00:02:05.380> time<00:02:05.590> because<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:07.000> powerful<00:02:07.540> maybe

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
every time because the powerful maybe

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.570 
every time because the powerful maybe
not<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:08.530> powerful<00:02:08.680> as<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:08.980> axe<00:02:09.130> but<00:02:09.400> the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
not as powerful as the axe but the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.570 
not as powerful as the axe but the
quicker<00:02:09.880> and<00:02:10.290> I<00:02:11.290> just<00:02:11.800> think<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.100> axe<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.400> just

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
quicker and I just think the axe is just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.930 
quicker and I just think the axe is just
waitin<00:02:12.910> fo<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.300> it's<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.570> same<00:02:13.840> with<00:02:14.940> simp

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
waitin fo and it's the same with simp

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.310 
waitin fo and it's the same with simp
decipher<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.450> week<00:02:16.600> lets<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.840> select<00:02:16.960> that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
decipher this week lets you select that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.480 
decipher this week lets you select that
moves<00:02:17.860> they're<00:02:18.070> always<00:02:18.400> jump<00:02:18.790> for<00:02:20.190> if<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.340> can

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
moves they're always jump for if you can

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.830 
moves they're always jump for if you can
get<00:02:21.610> behind<00:02:21.910> him<00:02:22.000> great

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.789 

and<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.900> might<00:02:30.049> noticed<00:02:30.319> I'm<00:02:30.439> kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.650> just

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
and you might noticed I'm kind of just

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.229 
and you might noticed I'm kind of just
using<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.069> semi<00:02:31.310> was<00:02:31.400> over<00:02:31.609> and<00:02:31.730> over<00:02:31.819> again<00:02:31.939> and

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
using a semi was over and over again and

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.660 
using a semi was over and over again and
that's<00:02:33.019> okay<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.799> can<00:02:33.829> get<00:02:34.069> as<00:02:34.249> pretty<00:02:34.489> easily

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
that's okay you can get as pretty easily

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.259 
that's okay you can get as pretty easily
just<00:02:35.569> by<00:02:35.599> using<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.930> same<00:02:36.109> areas<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.530> think<00:02:37.269> if

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
just by using the same areas I think if

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.599 
just by using the same areas I think if
you<00:02:38.329> can<00:02:38.510> get<00:02:38.629> to<00:02:38.659> an<00:02:38.840> S<00:02:39.049> in<00:02:39.319> one<00:02:39.499> combo<00:02:39.859> pretty

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
you can get to an S in one combo pretty

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:46.340 
you can get to an S in one combo pretty
much<00:02:40.760> set

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.230 

and<00:02:47.350> you've<00:02:47.680> got<00:02:47.770> your<00:02:47.890> triple<00:02:48.190> s<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:52.030> moves

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
and you've got your triple s this moves

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.270 
and you've got your triple s this moves
that<00:02:52.330> he<00:02:52.390> does<00:02:52.540> here<00:02:52.810> can<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.770> have<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.070> time<00:02:54.250> it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
that he does here can I have to time it

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.560 
that he does here can I have to time it
right<00:02:54.430> you'll<00:02:54.670> probably<00:02:54.910> do<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.120> about<00:02:55.180> two<00:02:55.480> or

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
right you'll probably do it about two or

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.370 
right you'll probably do it about two or
three<00:02:55.720> times<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.680> what<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:56.890> knew<00:02:57.220> yeah<00:02:58.380> don't

three times and what I knew yeah don't
try<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.680> attack<00:02:59.950> on<00:03:00.070> what<00:03:00.160> he's<00:03:00.250> doing<00:03:00.460> that

try and attack on what he's doing that

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:20.270 
try and attack on what he's doing that
because<00:03:00.760> you're<00:03:01.720> royally<00:03:02.200> screw<00:03:02.950> over

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.809 

yeah<00:03:20.910> whenever<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.300> can't<00:03:21.540> see<00:03:21.720> Virgil<00:03:21.930> just

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.000

alright yes yeah double gang a bit don't
be<00:03:44.070> intimidated<00:03:44.190> cause<00:03:44.640> there's<00:03:44.850> two<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.000> them

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
be intimidated cause there's two of them

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.590 
be intimidated cause there's two of them
but<00:03:47.340> do<00:03:48.240> be<00:03:48.360> wary<00:03:48.660> because<00:03:49.640> it<00:03:50.640> is<00:03:51.020> harder<00:03:52.340> but

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
but do be wary because it is harder but

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.820 
but do be wary because it is harder but
the<00:03:54.600> chances<00:03:54.960> are<00:03:55.080> good<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.320> whatever

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
the chances are good that whatever

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.580 
the chances are good that whatever
Virgil<00:03:56.280> does<00:03:56.460> is<00:03:57.000> doppelganger<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:58.020> the<00:03:58.380> same

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
Virgil does is doppelganger do the same

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.790 
Virgil does is doppelganger do the same
so<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.610> remember<00:03:59.790> of<00:04:00.210> what<00:04:00.450> his<00:04:01.140> moves<00:04:01.410> sets

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
so just remember of what his moves sets

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:13.860 
so just remember of what his moves sets
are<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.720> should<00:04:03.930> be<00:04:03.960> okay

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.940 

top<00:04:14.870> seeds<00:04:15.080> were<00:04:15.170> doing<00:04:15.380> very<00:04:15.410> well<00:04:15.740> in<00:04:15.770> terms

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
top seeds were doing very well in terms

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.730 
top seeds were doing very well in terms
of<00:04:16.100> style<00:04:16.310> points<00:04:16.550> with<00:04:17.410> 37,000<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:18.560> think

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:18.740 
of style points with 37,000 and I think

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.120 
of style points with 37,000 and I think
you<00:04:18.800> need<00:04:18.890> at<00:04:19.040> least<00:04:19.070> over<00:04:19.790> 40<00:04:20.360> 45<00:04:21.350> thousand

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
you need at least over 40 45 thousand

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
you need at least over 40 45 thousand
for<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.430> mess<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:23.090> could<00:04:23.720> be<00:04:23.840> wrong<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:28.460> once

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
for a mess I could be wrong and once

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.910 
for a mess I could be wrong and once
this<00:04:29.330> double<00:04:29.720> going<00:04:29.870> this<00:04:29.960> girl<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:33.800> won't
