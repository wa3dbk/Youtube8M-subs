tracks<00:03:11.480> might<00:03:11.870> not<00:03:12.110> have<00:03:12.379> any<00:03:12.739> jumps<00:03:13.250> if

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
tracks might not have any jumps if

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.449 
tracks might not have any jumps if
they're<00:03:13.580> even<00:03:13.730> though<00:03:14.030> 400<00:03:14.720> plus<00:03:14.930> feet<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:16.400> you

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
they're even though 400 plus feet so you

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.580 
they're even though 400 plus feet so you
guys<00:03:16.700> just<00:03:16.940> saw<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.360> be<00:03:17.599> careful<00:03:18.080> about<00:03:18.290> that

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
you I'm gonna keep looking for a track

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.770 
you I'm gonna keep looking for a track
so<00:03:26.599> I<00:03:26.780> want<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.110> prove<00:03:27.319> a<00:03:27.440> point<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.829> you<00:03:27.980> guys

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
so I want to prove a point to you guys

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.979 
so I want to prove a point to you guys
finding<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:30.140> track<00:03:30.709> with<00:03:31.010> 400<00:03:31.549> plus<00:03:31.819> feet<00:03:32.180> it

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
finding a track with 400 plus feet it

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.170 
finding a track with 400 plus feet it
can<00:03:33.049> still<00:03:33.620> have<00:03:33.860> no<00:03:34.099> jumps<00:03:34.489> on<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:34.819> so<00:03:35.030> we're

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
can still have no jumps on it so we're

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.170 
can still have no jumps on it so we're
gonna<00:03:35.299> continue<00:03:35.510> searching<00:03:36.819> so<00:03:37.819> that's<00:03:37.940> four

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
gonna continue searching so that's four

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.729 
gonna continue searching so that's four
hundred<00:03:38.209> forty<00:03:38.659> nine<00:03:38.690> feet<00:03:39.110> but<00:03:39.319> that<00:03:39.440> has<00:03:39.590> no

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
hundred forty nine feet but that has no

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.130 
hundred forty nine feet but that has no
jumps<00:03:40.099> so<00:03:40.910> let's<00:03:41.060> keep<00:03:41.209> searching<00:03:41.420> for<00:03:41.690> four

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
jumps so let's keep searching for four

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:52.360 
jumps so let's keep searching for four
hundred<00:03:42.290> plus<00:03:42.620> feet<00:03:50.200> yeah<00:03:51.200> 300<00:03:51.920> plus<00:03:52.129> feet

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
hundred plus feet yeah 300 plus feet

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.099 
hundred plus feet yeah 300 plus feet
won't<00:03:52.519> do<00:03:53.120> anything<00:03:53.359> you<00:03:53.510> need<00:03:53.780> four<00:03:54.019> hundred

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
won't do anything you need four hundred

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.000 
won't do anything you need four hundred
feet<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.560> have<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.799> jumps<00:03:56.049> there<00:03:57.049> we<00:03:57.230> go<00:03:57.379> all

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
feet to have the jumps there we go all

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.369 
feet to have the jumps there we go all
right

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
right

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.410 
right
entering<00:04:00.379> this<00:04:01.040> one<00:04:01.310> might<00:04:01.609> have<00:04:01.879> jumps<00:04:02.299> this

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
entering this one might have jumps this

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.619 
entering this one might have jumps this
one<00:04:02.659> might<00:04:03.319> possibly<00:04:03.590> have<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.129> jokes<00:04:04.629> four

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
one might possibly have the jokes four

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.770 
one might possibly have the jokes four
hundred<00:04:06.019> twenty<00:04:06.200> three<00:04:06.799> point<00:04:07.599> twenty<00:04:08.599> three

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
hundred twenty three point twenty three

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.360 
hundred twenty three point twenty three
point<00:04:09.019> six<00:04:09.200> feet<00:04:09.470> all<00:04:09.890> right<00:04:09.950> this<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.340> just

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
point six feet all right this is just

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.259 
point six feet all right this is just
this<00:04:10.640> one<00:04:10.849> out<00:04:10.970> guys<00:04:11.530> okay<00:04:12.530> if<00:04:13.099> this<00:04:13.819> one's<00:04:14.090> the

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
this one out guys okay if this one's the

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.970 
this one out guys okay if this one's the
track<00:04:14.569> then<00:04:14.900> just<00:04:15.139> keep<00:04:15.290> looking<00:04:15.560> for<00:04:15.590> tracks

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
track then just keep looking for tracks

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.159 
track then just keep looking for tracks
that<00:04:16.190> look<00:04:16.340> almost<00:04:16.609> exactly<00:04:16.880> like<00:04:17.840> this

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
that look almost exactly like this

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.830 
that look almost exactly like this
that's<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.280> oldest<00:04:19.910> we'll<00:04:20.150> be<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.419> only<00:04:20.570> way

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
that's the oldest we'll be the only way

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.080 
that's the oldest we'll be the only way
for<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.289> figure<00:04:21.470> out<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:22.070> make<00:04:22.250> a<00:04:22.520> jump

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
for you to figure out to make a jump

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:32.270 
for you to figure out to make a jump
track<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:23.510> let's<00:04:23.539> see<00:04:23.780> if<00:04:23.900> this<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.380> one

all righty guys the Mansi there you go
that's<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.500> pretty<00:05:22.890> much

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
that's it pretty much

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.000 
that's it pretty much
I've<00:05:24.210> finally<00:05:24.750> proven<00:05:25.290> the<00:05:25.380> point<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.770> all<00:05:25.980> of

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
I've finally proven the point to all of

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.730 
I've finally proven the point to all of
you<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:27.030> this<00:05:27.180> is<00:05:27.240> what<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.750> have<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.110> find<00:05:28.350> at

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
you so this is what you have to find at

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.700 
you so this is what you have to find at
least<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:29.880> type<00:05:30.150> of<00:05:30.180> track<00:05:30.600> this<00:05:31.080> track<00:05:31.140> will

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
least this type of track this track will

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.300 
least this type of track this track will
have<00:05:31.950> one<00:05:32.490> ginormous<00:05:32.940> jump<00:05:34.010> I'm<00:05:35.010> gonna<00:05:35.160> make<00:05:35.280> a

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
have one ginormous jump I'm gonna make a

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.280 
have one ginormous jump I'm gonna make a
compilation<00:05:35.670> video<00:05:36.120> of<00:05:36.240> crashing<00:05:36.750> on<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.140> on

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
compilation video of crashing on the on

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.910 
compilation video of crashing on the on
jump<00:05:37.560> tracks<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:38.150> yeah<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.840> here<00:05:39.990> you<00:05:40.050> go<00:05:40.200> this

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
jump tracks and yeah so here you go this

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.860 
jump tracks and yeah so here you go this
is<00:05:40.980> the<00:05:41.190> elevation<00:05:41.760> of<00:05:41.880> how<00:05:42.030> much<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.480> is<00:05:42.510> and

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
is the elevation of how much it is and

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.140 
is the elevation of how much it is and
what<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.140> track<00:05:43.380> looks<00:05:43.410> like<00:05:43.740> remember<00:05:44.640> seven

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
what the track looks like remember seven

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.050 
what the track looks like remember seven
complexity<00:05:45.840> seven<00:05:46.530> sections<00:05:47.100> of<00:05:47.490> complexity

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
complexity seven sections of complexity

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.720 
complexity seven sections of complexity
and<00:05:48.180> make<00:05:48.390> it<00:05:48.480> all<00:05:48.630> zip<00:05:49.470> alright<00:05:50.400> thank<00:05:50.640> you
