00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.080 
understand it's just there's a lot of
depth<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.109> this<00:03:07.290> story<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.919> that<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.849> touches

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
depth to this story that that it touches

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.699 
depth to this story that that it touches
on<00:03:09.359> it<00:03:09.389> that<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.260> don't<00:03:10.409> even<00:03:10.530> think<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
on it that I don't even think the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.399 
on it that I don't even think the
trailer<00:03:10.950> even<00:03:11.189> gets<00:03:11.700> into<00:03:11.939> too<00:03:12.060> much<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
trailer even gets into too much but and

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.309 
trailer even gets into too much but and
I<00:03:13.500> think<00:03:13.709> potentially<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.970> movie<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.480> I

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
I think potentially this the movie is I

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.899 
I think potentially this the movie is I
think<00:03:16.799> we<00:03:16.889> already<00:03:17.040> know<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.340> ruffalo<00:03:17.819> is

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
think we already know that ruffalo is

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.210 
think we already know that ruffalo is
capable<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.900> lot<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.079> great<00:03:19.650> stuff<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.190> I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
capable of a lot of great stuff and I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.490 
capable of a lot of great stuff and I
think<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:20.579> potentially<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.329> game<00:03:22.109> changer

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
think it's potentially a game changer

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.259 
think it's potentially a game changer
for<00:03:22.530> for<00:03:23.040> Tatum<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.400> certainly<00:03:23.760> for<00:03:23.940> corel

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
for for Tatum and certainly for corel

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.629 
for for Tatum and certainly for corel
who<00:03:24.750> looks<00:03:25.409> I<00:03:25.680> mean<00:03:25.979> he's<00:03:26.099> just<00:03:26.250> going<00:03:26.370> places

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
who looks I mean he's just going places

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.539 
who looks I mean he's just going places
that<00:03:26.940> we've<00:03:27.090> never<00:03:27.299> seen<00:03:27.599> him<00:03:27.959> go<00:03:28.139> before<00:03:28.549> and

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
that we've never seen him go before and

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.640 
that we've never seen him go before and
so<00:03:30.000> I'm<00:03:30.629> really<00:03:30.870> excited<00:03:30.959> about<00:03:31.379> it<00:03:31.620> really

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
so I'm really excited about it really

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.809 
so I'm really excited about it really
excite<00:03:31.979> about<00:03:32.129> seeing<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.370> three<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.639> them

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
excite about seeing the three of them

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.610 
excite about seeing the three of them
what<00:03:32.970> they<00:03:33.090> do<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.449> what<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:34.049> story<00:03:34.530> is

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
what they do and what this story is

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.619 
what they do and what this story is
about<00:03:34.799> this<00:03:35.549> director<00:03:35.970> has<00:03:36.120> made<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.299> couple<00:03:36.540> of

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
about this director has made a couple of

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.569 
about this director has made a couple of
great<00:03:37.109> movies<00:03:37.319> before<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.310> think

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
great movies before this I think

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.080 
great movies before this I think
Moneyball<00:03:39.180> was<00:03:39.389> are<00:03:39.510> really<00:03:39.930> sort<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.319> under

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
Moneyball was are really sort of under

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.800 
Moneyball was are really sort of under
underrated<00:03:42.090> because<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.419> got<00:03:42.510> great<00:03:42.690> reviews

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
underrated because it got great reviews

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.050 
underrated because it got great reviews

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
but kind of an underappreciated film

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.110 
but kind of an underappreciated film

this trailer as a follow up trailer goes
I<00:04:02.250> think<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.519> did<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.639> great<00:04:02.849> job<00:04:02.879> of<00:04:03.409> giving<00:04:04.409> a

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
I think it did a great job of giving a

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.009 
I think it did a great job of giving a
little<00:04:05.040> bit<00:04:05.250> more<00:04:05.629> information<00:04:06.629> about<00:04:06.810> the

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
little bit more information about the

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.839 
little bit more information about the
characters<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.859> world<00:04:08.189> that<00:04:08.489> that's

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
characters and the world that that's

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.479 
characters and the world that that's
being<00:04:09.379> explored<00:04:10.379> here<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.680> think<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:11.310> did<00:04:11.430> a

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
being explored here I think it did a

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.280 
being explored here I think it did a
great<00:04:11.699> job<00:04:11.729> of<00:04:12.090> again<00:04:12.689> you've<00:04:12.840> all<00:04:12.959> mentioned

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
great job of again you've all mentioned

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.990 
great job of again you've all mentioned
the<00:04:13.379> creepiness<00:04:13.709> but<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.189> very<00:04:14.400> visceral

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
the creepiness but it's very visceral

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.729 
the creepiness but it's very visceral
there's<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.239> ferocity<00:04:15.659> in<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.109> performances

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
there's a ferocity in the performances

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.349 
there's a ferocity in the performances
and<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.919> think<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.489> really<00:04:17.759> get<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.909> sense<00:04:18.000> of

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
and I think you really get a sense of

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.539 
and I think you really get a sense of
that<00:04:18.570> when<00:04:19.079> you<00:04:19.289> watch<00:04:19.530> this<00:04:19.709> trailer<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.130> also

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
that when you watch this trailer I also

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.209 
that when you watch this trailer I also
feel<00:04:20.969> like<00:04:21.139> you<00:04:22.139> know<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.260> love<00:04:22.500> sports<00:04:22.800> movies

feel like you know I love sports movies

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.760 
feel like you know I love sports movies
I<00:04:23.370> grew<00:04:23.520> up<00:04:23.550> on<00:04:23.729> slap<00:04:23.969> shot<00:04:24.210> I'm<00:04:24.389> from<00:04:24.539> Montreal

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
I grew up on slap shot I'm from Montreal

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.379 
I grew up on slap shot I'm from Montreal
part<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:26.009> my<00:04:26.099> blood<00:04:26.340> but<00:04:26.550> but<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:27.060> sports

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
part of my blood but but the sports

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.990 
part of my blood but but the sports
movies<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.960> me<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.349> really<00:04:28.979> transcend<00:04:29.759> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
movies to me that really transcend the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.670 
movies to me that really transcend the
genre<00:04:30.389> are<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.569> ones<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:30.990> used<00:04:31.199> sports<00:04:31.470> as<00:04:31.620> a

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
genre are the ones that used sports as a

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.409 
genre are the ones that used sports as a
backdrop<00:04:31.979> for<00:04:32.520> telling<00:04:32.879> a<00:04:32.940> really<00:04:33.120> compelling

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
backdrop for telling a really compelling

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.640 
backdrop for telling a really compelling
human<00:04:33.629> story<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.020> think<00:04:34.169> it's<00:04:34.289> true<00:04:34.409> for<00:04:34.560> all

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
human story I think it's true for all

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.589 
human story I think it's true for all
film<00:04:34.949> right<00:04:35.159> specifically<00:04:35.879> with<00:04:36.060> sports<00:04:36.419> I

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
film right specifically with sports I

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.869 
film right specifically with sports I
think<00:04:36.870> it's<00:04:37.470> very<00:04:37.770> clear<00:04:38.159> that<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.669> not

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
think it's very clear that this is not

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.540
