folate<00:02:58.659> which<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.230> active<00:02:59.799> form<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.689> this

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
folate which is the active form of this

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.710 
folate which is the active form of this
vitamin<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.799> these<00:03:03.069> are<00:03:03.220> all<00:03:03.459> foods<00:03:03.909> super

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
vitamin and these are all foods super

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.869 
vitamin and these are all foods super
high<00:03:04.930> in<00:03:05.079> folate<00:03:05.379> including<00:03:06.220> lentils<00:03:06.669> and

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
high in folate including lentils and

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.409 
high in folate including lentils and
avocados<00:03:07.650> folic<00:03:08.650> acid<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.220> processed<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.239> has

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
avocados folic acid is processed it has

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.270 
avocados folic acid is processed it has
to<00:03:10.540> be<00:03:10.629> processed<00:03:11.049> by<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.260> liver<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:12.129> liver

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
to be processed by the liver the liver

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.280 
to be processed by the liver the liver
doesn't<00:03:12.579> have<00:03:12.790> enzymes<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.510> really<00:03:13.750> use<00:03:14.049> it

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
doesn't have enzymes to really use it

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.860 
doesn't have enzymes to really use it
and<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:15.010> then<00:03:15.189> a<00:03:15.220> lot<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.700> women<00:03:15.970> are<00:03:16.150> deficient

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
and so then a lot of women are deficient

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.839 
and so then a lot of women are deficient
in<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.379> which<00:03:17.919> you<00:03:18.129> know<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.459> forms<00:03:18.729> the

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
in this which you know it forms the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.059 
in this which you know it forms the
baby's<00:03:19.150> brain<00:03:19.419> stem<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.930> neural<00:03:20.229> tube<00:03:20.440> so

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
baby's brain stem the neural tube so

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.399 
baby's brain stem the neural tube so
folate<00:03:21.699> is<00:03:22.060> really<00:03:22.840> what<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.049> want<00:03:23.229> to<00:03:23.290> look

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
folate is really what you want to look

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.189 
folate is really what you want to look

your advice to not have too much salt in
pregnancy<00:04:09.370> bread<00:04:09.759> that's<00:04:09.939> sodium<00:04:10.479> chloride

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
pregnancy bread that's sodium chloride

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.099 
pregnancy bread that's sodium chloride
that's<00:04:10.959> table<00:04:11.680> salt<00:04:11.919> that<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.459> not<00:04:12.759> this

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
that's table salt that is not this

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.589 
that's table salt that is not this
unprocessed<00:04:14.109> highly<00:04:14.919> mineralized<00:04:15.189> salt<00:04:15.939> so

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
unprocessed highly mineralized salt so

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.839 
unprocessed highly mineralized salt so
basically<00:04:17.169> salt<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.620> water<00:04:17.799> is<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.130> amniotic

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
basically salt and water is the amniotic

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.120 
basically salt and water is the amniotic
fluid<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:19.930> you're<00:04:20.079> building<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.709> amniotic

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
fluid so you're building the amniotic

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.839 
fluid so you're building the amniotic
fluid<00:04:21.639> gotcha<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:22.630> now<00:04:22.840> studies<00:04:23.440> are<00:04:23.590> saying

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
fluid gotcha and now studies are saying
