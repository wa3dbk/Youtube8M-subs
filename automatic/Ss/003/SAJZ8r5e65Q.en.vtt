00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.280 
this but when you draw you're trying
with<00:02:27.540> your<00:02:27.630> fingers<00:02:27.989> once<00:02:28.230> again<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:30.290> it's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
with your fingers once again so it's

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.910 
with your fingers once again so it's
okay<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:32.780> just<00:02:33.780> too<00:02:33.840> slow<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.890> I

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
okay but it's just too slow so I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.100 
okay but it's just too slow so I
wouldn't<00:02:35.310> recommend<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.090> use<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:37.050> a

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
wouldn't recommend it to use it like a

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.170 
wouldn't recommend it to use it like a

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
tablet if you want to use it like a

on your iPad I know it's lower
resolution<00:02:46.050> but<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> be<00:02:47.489> faster

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
resolution but it's going to be faster

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.080 
resolution but it's going to be faster
drying<00:02:48.390> then<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:49.200> up<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.920> Photoshop<00:02:50.520> but<00:02:50.940> you
