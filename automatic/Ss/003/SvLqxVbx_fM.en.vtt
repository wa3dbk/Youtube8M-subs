and a vocation and what are they and why

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.299 
and a vocation and what are they and why
are<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.390> different<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> slightly

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
are they different I can have a slightly

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
are they different I can have a slightly
different<00:01:05.489> definition<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.900> these<00:01:07.020> than<00:01:07.350> other

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
different definition of these than other

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.770 
different definition of these than other
people<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> most<00:01:08.909> part<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.270> think<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
people but for the most part I think I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
people but for the most part I think I
go<00:01:10.049> by<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.290> dictionary<00:01:10.830> definition<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
go by the dictionary definition a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.200 
go by the dictionary definition a
vocation<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.330> calling<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:13.909> inviting<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
vocation is calling up or inviting a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.960 
vocation is calling up or inviting a
spirit<00:01:15.900> or<00:01:16.080> energy<00:01:16.470> or<00:01:16.710> something<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.759> be

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
spirit or energy or something to be

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
spirit or energy or something to be
present<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.840> life<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.680> next<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
present in your life like next to you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.580 
present in your life like next to you
but<00:01:21.030> without<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:23.159> body<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.790> outside

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
but without of your body on the outside

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.170 
but without of your body on the outside
invocation<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.830> doing<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> same<00:01:26.520> thing<00:01:26.880> but

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
invocation is doing the same thing but

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
invocation is doing the same thing but
calling<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.990> spirit<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.770> entity<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:29.310> energy

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
calling that spirit or entity or energy

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.170 
calling that spirit or entity or energy
into<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.259> become<00:01:32.189> part<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.030> be

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
into you to become part of you to be

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.050 
into you to become part of you to be
within<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.400> difference<00:01:35.759> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
within you and so the difference is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.719 
within you and so the difference is
whether<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.140> thing<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.590> called<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.280> inside

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
whether the thing is called to be inside

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.380 
whether the thing is called to be inside
of<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.060> or<00:01:39.360> outside<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.170> i<00:01:40.460> evoke<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:41.850> call

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
of you or outside of you i evoke or call

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.620 
of you or outside of you i evoke or call
up<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:42.960> invite<00:01:43.829> or<00:01:44.220> ask<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.030> presence<00:01:45.479> of

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
things especially by yourself or if

taking<00:05:02.710> energies<00:05:03.280> into<00:05:03.520> yourself<00:05:04.000> could<00:05:04.630> be

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
taking energies into yourself could be

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.120 
taking energies into yourself could be
dangerous<00:05:05.080> if<00:05:05.229> you<00:05:05.320> don't<00:05:05.440> know<00:05:05.560> how<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:05.889> work

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.240 
you are the you've got this you can do
this<00:05:53.509> you<00:05:54.110> know<00:05:54.229> I<00:05:54.259> consider<00:05:54.889> that<00:05:54.949> an

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
this you know I consider that an

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.580 
this you know I consider that an
invocation<00:05:55.580> because<00:05:56.330> I'm<00:05:56.570> taking<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.229> spirit

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
invocation because I'm taking the spirit

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.620 
invocation because I'm taking the spirit
of<00:05:57.949> that<00:05:58.190> thing<00:05:58.490> into<00:05:58.820> myself<00:05:59.360> and<00:05:59.539> I'm

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
of that thing into myself and I'm

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.810 
of that thing into myself and I'm
embodying<00:06:00.199> that<00:06:00.289> and<00:06:00.680> I<00:06:00.740> am<00:06:00.889> becoming<00:06:01.340> it<00:06:01.610> and

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
embodying that and I am becoming it and

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.969 
embodying that and I am becoming it and
so<00:06:02.330> it's<00:06:03.080> not<00:06:03.199> quite<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.470> same<00:06:03.620> thing<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:03.949> I

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
so it's not quite the same thing and I

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.010 
so it's not quite the same thing and I
don't<00:06:04.039> view<00:06:04.370> that<00:06:04.430> as<00:06:04.639> being<00:06:05.180> a<00:06:05.360> dangerous

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
don't view that as being a dangerous

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.830 
don't view that as being a dangerous
thing<00:06:06.610> like<00:06:07.610> I'm<00:06:07.759> actually<00:06:08.000> taking<00:06:08.419> another

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
thing like I'm actually taking another

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.050 
thing like I'm actually taking another
spirit<00:06:09.410> into<00:06:09.740> me<00:06:09.800> it's<00:06:10.430> just<00:06:10.639> that<00:06:10.820> I<00:06:11.030> am

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
spirit into me it's just that I am

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.930 
spirit into me it's just that I am
embodying<00:06:11.990> and<00:06:12.229> bringing<00:06:12.680> forth<00:06:13.039> that<00:06:13.400> energy

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
embodying and bringing forth that energy

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.700 
embodying and bringing forth that energy
and<00:06:14.120> so<00:06:14.330> I<00:06:14.360> consider<00:06:14.900> that<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.229> same<00:06:15.409> sort<00:06:15.590> of

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
and so I consider that the same sort of

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.620 
and so I consider that the same sort of
thing<00:06:15.889> but<00:06:16.190> yeah<00:06:16.340> other<00:06:16.550> things<00:06:16.880> more<00:06:17.180> serious

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
thing but yeah other things more serious

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.180 
thing but yeah other things more serious
things<00:06:17.930> heavier<00:06:18.530> stuff<00:06:18.979> I<00:06:19.580> guess<00:06:21.069> does<00:06:22.069> it

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
things heavier stuff I guess does it

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.879 
things heavier stuff I guess does it
have<00:06:22.310> a<00:06:22.340> weight<00:06:22.550> I<00:06:22.849> don't<00:06:23.060> really<00:06:23.180> know

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
have a weight I don't really know

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.219 
have a weight I don't really know
definitely<00:06:24.889> be<00:06:25.190> careful<00:06:25.400> with<00:06:26.050> know<00:06:27.050> what

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229
