the other side the fact it turns but if

you compare this to the other DD one is

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.870 
you compare this to the other DD one is
it's<00:04:31.910> not<00:04:32.180> as<00:04:32.330> good<00:04:32.540> because<00:04:33.760> they<00:04:34.760> always

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
it's not as good because they always

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.330 
it's not as good because they always
have<00:04:35.240> really<00:04:36.050> good<00:04:36.200> articulation<00:04:36.590> in<00:04:37.100> every

that<00:04:40.520> one<00:04:40.669> these<00:04:40.970> ones<00:04:41.210> don't<00:04:41.479> remove<00:04:42.310> all<00:04:43.310> so

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
that one these ones don't remove all so

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.130 
that one these ones don't remove all so
could<00:04:43.820> this<00:04:43.940> cave<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.539> makes<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.840> really<00:04:45.050> hard

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
could this cave it makes it really hard

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.980 
could this cave it makes it really hard
to<00:04:45.440> stand<00:04:45.740> up<00:04:46.039> so<00:04:46.430> concise<00:04:47.000> but

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
to stand up so concise but

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.630 
to stand up so concise but
this<00:04:49.200> is<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.410> really<00:04:49.740> good<00:04:49.920> figure<00:04:50.280> but

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
this is a really good figure but

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.220 
this is a really good figure but
compared<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> other<00:04:51.450> digital<00:04:51.840> warriors
