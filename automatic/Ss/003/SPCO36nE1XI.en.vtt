for<00:04:41.610> this<00:04:41.760> I<00:04:41.940> believe<00:04:42.510> shadow<00:04:42.780> skill<00:04:43.080> is

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
for this I believe shadow skill is

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.900 
for this I believe shadow skill is
actually<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.710> first<00:04:43.980> anime<00:04:44.430> series<00:04:44.640> that<00:04:44.850> I

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
actually the first anime series that I

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.080 
actually the first anime series that I
ever<00:04:45.090> completed<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:46.340> there<00:04:47.340> are<00:04:47.490> some<00:04:47.850> things

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
ever completed but there are some things

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.210 
ever completed but there are some things
here<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.540> did<00:04:48.840> eight<00:04:49.050> didn't<00:04:49.680> age<00:04:49.860> very<00:04:50.130> well

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
here that did eight didn't age very well

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.340 
here that did eight didn't age very well
such<00:04:50.730> as<00:04:50.940> when<00:04:51.480> some<00:04:51.690> characters<00:04:52.080> will<00:04:52.260> be

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
such as when some characters will be

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.440 
such as when some characters will be
fighting<00:04:52.590> they<00:04:53.190> will<00:04:53.430> be<00:04:53.550> talking<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.120> lot<00:04:54.240> and

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
fighting they will be talking a lot and

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.210 
fighting they will be talking a lot and
explaining<00:04:54.870> what<00:04:55.110> their<00:04:55.290> moves<00:04:55.560> do<00:04:55.920> and<00:04:56.160> I

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
explaining what their moves do and I

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.370 
explaining what their moves do and I
kind<00:04:56.430> of<00:04:56.610> like<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:57.270> kind<00:04:57.480> of<00:04:57.540> something

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
kind of like that it's kind of something

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.110 
kind of like that it's kind of something
that<00:04:58.440> adds<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.130> hype<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.550> fights<00:04:59.910> and

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
that adds to the hype of the fights and

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.970 
that adds to the hype of the fights and
maybe<00:05:00.600> it's<00:05:00.780> just<00:05:00.870> because<00:05:01.050> I'm<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.530> fan<00:05:01.800> of

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
maybe it's just because I'm a fan of

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.040 
maybe it's just because I'm a fan of
some<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.370> older<00:05:02.760> series<00:05:03.000> but<00:05:03.510> I<00:05:03.540> like<00:05:03.840> that

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
some of the older series but I like that

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.570 
some of the older series but I like that
when<00:05:04.200> they're<00:05:04.320> naming<00:05:04.560> all<00:05:04.860> their<00:05:05.040> moves<00:05:05.310> and

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
when they're naming all their moves and

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.860 
when they're naming all their moves and
they're<00:05:05.730> just<00:05:05.910> talking<00:05:06.120> during<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.540> fights

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
they're just talking during the fights

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.630 
they're just talking during the fights
and<00:05:07.050> just<00:05:07.230> hyping<00:05:07.650> it<00:05:07.740> up<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:08.010> bit<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.400> really

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
and just hyping it up a bit I really

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.510

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
like that and the character of Le ragout

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.730 
like that and the character of Le ragout
it's<00:05:11.700> kind<00:05:11.880> of<00:05:11.970> female<00:05:12.420> lead<00:05:13.230> character<00:05:13.260> to

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.230 
really fast being in outer space without
having<00:06:16.380> to<00:06:16.500> breathe<00:06:16.710> oxygen<00:06:17.160> it<00:06:17.520> gives<00:06:17.970> them

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
having to breathe oxygen it gives them

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.590 
having to breathe oxygen it gives them
the<00:06:18.270> ability<00:06:18.510> to<00:06:19.010> shoot<00:06:20.010> energy<00:06:20.670> beams<00:06:20.940> and<00:06:21.300> it

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
the ability to shoot energy beams and it

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.700 
the ability to shoot energy beams and it
really<00:06:21.750> makes<00:06:21.960> them<00:06:22.170> sound<00:06:22.350> like<00:06:22.560> they're

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
really makes them sound like they're

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.290 
really makes them sound like they're
overpowered<00:06:23.430> but<00:06:23.640> it's<00:06:23.790> actually<00:06:24.270> really

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
overpowered but it's actually really

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.900 
overpowered but it's actually really
balanced<00:06:25.020> because<00:06:25.290> they're<00:06:25.770> very<00:06:26.550> weak

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
balanced because they're very weak

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.570 
balanced because they're very weak
physically<00:06:27.510> and<00:06:27.690> also<00:06:28.170> the<00:06:28.830> human<00:06:29.310> race

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
physically and also the human race

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.520 
physically and also the human race
that's<00:06:30.090> against<00:06:30.600> them<00:06:30.750> has<00:06:31.080> much<00:06:31.500> greater

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
that's against them has much greater

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.710 
that's against them has much greater
technology<00:06:32.310> than<00:06:32.610> them<00:06:32.940> and<00:06:33.150> they<00:06:33.510> also

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
technology than them and they also

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.719 
technology than them and they also
outnumber<00:06:34.380> them<00:06:34.560> one<00:06:35.220> quick<00:06:35.460> thing<00:06:35.669> about

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
outnumber them one quick thing about

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.159 
outnumber them one quick thing about
toward<00:06:36.210> the<00:06:36.330> Terra<00:06:36.600> that<00:06:36.780> I<00:06:36.810> wanted<00:06:37.110> to
