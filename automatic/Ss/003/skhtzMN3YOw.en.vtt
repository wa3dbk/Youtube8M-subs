yes<00:00:06.460> those<00:00:06.700> three<00:00:06.910> things<00:00:07.180> we<00:00:07.330> need<00:00:07.360> are<00:00:07.870> the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.050 
yes those three things we need are the

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.959 
yes those three things we need are the
height<00:00:08.290> the<00:00:08.890> width<00:00:09.130> and<00:00:09.460> the<00:00:09.520> sliding

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
height the width and the sliding

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.459 
height the width and the sliding
direction<00:00:10.389> of<00:00:10.450> the<00:00:10.510> screen<00:00:10.750> door<00:00:10.960> okay<00:00:11.410> so

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
direction of the screen door okay so

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.230 
direction of the screen door okay so
we're<00:00:12.370> going<00:00:12.460> to<00:00:12.520> start<00:00:12.760> off<00:00:12.880> with<00:00:12.910> the<00:00:13.059> width

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
we're going to start off with the width

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.330 
we're going to start off with the width
first<00:00:13.570> that's<00:00:14.230> measuring<00:00:14.710> from<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.040> inside

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
first that's measuring from the inside

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.609 
first that's measuring from the inside
of<00:00:15.460> this<00:00:15.580> channel<00:00:15.880> to<00:00:16.689> approximately<00:00:17.260> Center

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
of this channel to approximately Center

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.720 
of this channel to approximately Center
here<00:00:18.040> usually<00:00:18.279> 36<00:00:19.119> 48<00:00:19.689> or<00:00:19.930> 60<00:00:20.349> wide<00:00:20.529> and<00:00:20.860> people

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
here usually 36 48 or 60 wide and people

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.240 
here usually 36 48 or 60 wide and people
do<00:00:21.849> that<00:00:21.880> now<00:00:22.150> first<00:00:22.869> of<00:00:22.989> all<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.680> pocket<00:00:24.040> here

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
do that now first of all the pocket here

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.620 
do that now first of all the pocket here
want<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:24.820> go<00:00:25.000> all<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.180> way<00:00:25.329> in<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.570> pocket<00:00:27.630> so

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
want to go all the way in the pocket so

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.150 
want to go all the way in the pocket so
it's<00:00:28.810> roughly<00:00:29.250> 35<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.430> a<00:00:30.489> half<00:00:31.770> 36<00:00:32.770> would<00:00:32.950> work

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
it's roughly 35 and a half 36 would work

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.090 
it's roughly 35 and a half 36 would work
you<00:00:33.940> don't<00:00:34.300> want<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.540> go<00:00:34.600> too<00:00:34.660> wide<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.890> the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
you don't want to go too wide and the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.860 
you don't want to go too wide and the
door<00:00:36.309> won't<00:00:36.460> open<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:37.059> properly<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:37.720> you'll

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
door won't open that properly and you'll

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.070 
door won't open that properly and you'll
have<00:00:38.020> a<00:00:38.050> gap<00:00:38.380> on<00:00:38.680> this<00:00:39.610> store<00:00:39.850> we'd<00:00:40.060> go<00:00:40.270> 35<00:00:40.900> and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
have a gap on this store we'd go 35 and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.830 
have a gap on this store we'd go 35 and
a<00:00:41.140> half<00:00:41.170> on<00:00:41.830> the<00:00:41.980> width<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.360> now<00:00:43.570> we'll<00:00:43.720> do<00:00:43.810> the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
a half on the width and now we'll do the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.600 
a half on the width and now we'll do the
height<00:00:44.080> the<00:00:44.410> height<00:00:44.530> is<00:00:44.740> measured<00:00:45.100> from<00:00:45.520> the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
height the height is measured from the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.840 
height the height is measured from the
top<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:46.180> this<00:00:46.330> inside<00:00:46.720> track<00:00:47.280> down<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.640> top

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
top of this inside track down to the top

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.080 
top of this inside track down to the top
of<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.150> track<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.750> rollers<00:00:49.990> go<00:00:50.170> on<00:00:51.090> here

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
of this track the rollers go on here

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.130 
of this track the rollers go on here
we're<00:00:52.240> going<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.420> need<00:00:52.540> three<00:00:52.780> measurements

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
we're going to need three measurements

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.160 
we're going to need three measurements
here<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.940> center<00:00:55.240> beam<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.660> door<00:00:55.870> and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
here the center beam of the door and

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.030 
here the center beam of the door and
then<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.160> far<00:00:57.340> right<00:00:57.579> or<00:00:58.060> far<00:00:58.240> left<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.890> we'll

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
then the far right or far left so we'll

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.950 
then the far right or far left so we'll
start<00:01:00.310> here<00:01:00.490> on<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:01.020> lock<00:01:02.020> side<00:01:02.290> all<00:01:03.010> right

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
start here on the lock side all right

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.100 
start here on the lock side all right
all<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.199> way<00:01:05.229> up<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.590> top<00:01:05.770> of<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.009> track

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
all the way up to the top of the track

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.260 
all the way up to the top of the track
kind<00:01:08.110> of<00:01:08.229> gauge<00:01:08.439> how<00:01:08.470> tall<00:01:09.040> I<00:01:09.369> want<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.149> make

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
kind of gauge how tall I want to make

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.120 
kind of gauge how tall I want to make
sure<00:01:10.299> we<00:01:10.630> can<00:01:10.780> clear<00:01:11.020> we<00:01:11.560> don't<00:01:11.740> want<00:01:11.859> the<00:01:11.950> door

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
sure we can clear we don't want the door

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.999 
sure we can clear we don't want the door
to<00:01:12.159> be<00:01:12.340> too<00:01:12.520> big<00:01:12.700> otherwise<00:01:12.939> it<00:01:13.270> won't<00:01:13.420> go<00:01:13.569> in

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
to be too big otherwise it won't go in

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.099 
to be too big otherwise it won't go in
so<00:01:15.009> corner<00:01:15.310> my<00:01:15.460> measurements<00:01:16.060> on<00:01:16.240> this<00:01:16.840> side

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
so corner my measurements on this side

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:22.940 
so corner my measurements on this side
door<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:17.920> about<00:01:18.329> 77<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.799> 3/4<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:21.549> an<00:01:21.670> inch<00:01:21.819> tall

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
door is about 77 and 3/4 of an inch tall

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.399 
door is about 77 and 3/4 of an inch tall
always<00:01:23.950> want<00:01:24.159> to<00:01:24.280> check<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.639> middle<00:01:25.409> that's

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
always want to check the middle that's

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.039 
always want to check the middle that's
where<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.710> get<00:01:26.829> settling<00:01:27.399> so<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.090> height<00:01:28.869> of

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
where you get settling so the height of

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.569 
where you get settling so the height of
the<00:01:29.139> door<00:01:29.319> might<00:01:29.560> be<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.740> little<00:01:29.979> smaller<00:01:30.369> in

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
the door might be a little smaller in

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.029 
the door might be a little smaller in
the<00:01:30.670> middle<00:01:31.049> which<00:01:32.049> would<00:01:32.229> make<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.560> not<00:01:32.590> fit

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
the middle which would make it not fit

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.249 
the middle which would make it not fit
if<00:01:33.819> you<00:01:33.999> were<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.209> use<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.329> side<00:01:34.749> measurement

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
if you were to use a side measurement

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.830 
if you were to use a side measurement
this<00:01:36.039> one's<00:01:36.310> obviously<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.819> little<00:01:37.149> shorter<00:01:37.780> in

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
this one's obviously a little shorter in

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.230 
this one's obviously a little shorter in
the<00:01:37.869> middle<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.380> on<00:01:38.499> this<00:01:38.649> one<00:01:38.859> I'd<00:01:39.039> go<00:01:39.280> 77<00:01:40.119> and

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
the middle so on this one I'd go 77 and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.120 
the middle so on this one I'd go 77 and
a<00:01:40.270> half<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:41.229> obviously<00:01:41.560> there's<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.859> half

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
a half so obviously there's a half

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.480 
a half so obviously there's a half
quarter<00:01:42.789> inch<00:01:42.939> difference<00:01:43.689> between<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.950> ends

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
quarter inch difference between the ends

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.120 
quarter inch difference between the ends
and<00:01:45.639> the<00:01:46.600> center<00:01:46.959> and<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.530> always<00:01:47.679> want<00:01:48.039> to

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
and the center and you always want to

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.459 
and the center and you always want to
use<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.670> smaller<00:01:49.420> size<00:01:49.749> rather<00:01:50.139> than<00:01:50.380> the

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
use the smaller size rather than the

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.249 
use the smaller size rather than the
large

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
large

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.770 
large
it's<00:01:52.409> always<00:01:52.530> good<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.860> measure<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.310> three

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
it's always good to measure all three

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.499 
it's always good to measure all three
tall<00:01:54.780> size<00:01:55.939> little<00:01:56.939> wire<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> end<00:01:59.509> so

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
tall size little wire on the end so

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.779 
tall size little wire on the end so
that's<00:02:00.689> basically<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.289> now<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.219> want<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> make

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
that's basically it now we want to make

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.450 
that's basically it now we want to make
sure<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> door<00:02:03.719> slides<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.979> same<00:02:05.250> way
