00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi everyone had the welcome room in 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.540
 the episode 16 of incredible but true on 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.370
 gta 5 and on gta 5 online on begin 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.110
 right away with a scene where there is 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.730
 Cops inevitably stable always with 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.160
 the cops it's our sworn enemies in 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.350
 gta 5 the police so here we kill the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
 driver then the guy is listed 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.949
 passage sow driver side on it 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.960
 also kills the vehicle he continues 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.490
 to advance then two hypotheses be the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 dude is dead and it's super realistic 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.490
 since his foot is still on 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.750
 the accelerator or is it all 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330
 simply possess 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.850
 alas the fossil pnj and own I have 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 the impression seen as they want I 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.600
 would even say that all NPCs are 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.600
 possessed is there we arrive in a scene 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.480
 where we can say that cycling too 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.020
 is possessed so look we put the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.379
 gravity so everything is idle alas 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.030
 the bike falls to the ground and hop he gets on 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.410
 on the rear wheel so I tell you 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.340
 right now if in real life your 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.590
 bike this guy oms called an exorcist 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.680
 it's not normal a bike can not get 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.820
 put it like that in real healthy life 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.280
 next then you wonder 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.520
 how we managed to make four 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 traces also as well done as well 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.549
 drawn and yet look there the gap 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.049
 that there is between the bands we say 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.240
 we could not go back and forth 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.500
 so how could we trace that knowing 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 that we are in the story mode of which I 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.040
 I'm all alone it's not like 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 was several and we had managed to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.729
 draw perfect lines 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.960
 so you know you do not know at all 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.630
 case i'm going to show you how to do 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.090
 so it's super simple just a 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.450
 very little chance so look 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.880
 basic scene with a small slope 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.909
 accelerations and there we will be typing a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 border and hop 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.049
 and here you have four lines 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.619
 almost perfect drawn on the ground 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.729
 next scene so here I'm going to you 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.570
 show something that happens often 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.549
 in gta 5 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.560
 we go through the objects go 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.090
 understand why so little scene 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.640
 but he needed the watch is still 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.869
 knowing that it happens often 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.280
 so there you say you boxing fight 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.899
 always in front of the same hospital 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.369
 last time it was with trevor 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.930
 lhasa with franklin 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.740
 but in fact no it's not at all 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.650
 to watch 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.200
 only those who have a keen eye 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.270
 will notice what is happening you are 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.160
 ready i'll put you a slow motion 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.630
 it is here attention go back again 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.880
 still a little slow motion look at the guy 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.100
 of the hospital that went there he is 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.420
 gone at a speed even flash gordon I 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.750
 think he could not have gone too 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.970
 quick 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.890
 just awesome there you 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.960
 you say it I know what happens 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.760
 it is this girl who is stuck in this 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.960
 weird thing yeah but yeah that's not it 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.590
 Normally that's not the thing 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.850
 watch 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.100
 look at the right of the screen the woman 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.660
 who is walking very far not that she has a 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.480
 little weird could not she is 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.380
 owned all the pnj's are owned in 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.270
 GTA 5 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.300
 we get a little slow motion anyway 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.120
 for for the watch and so watch 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.370
 she walks on an imaginary floor 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.960
 leaning forward as in one of the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.280
 michael jackson's clips he too he 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.050
 was bent over as sarah sells except that 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.330
 he had fake shoes 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.320
 traffic and she I do not think she has 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.050
 false shoes she's all 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.610
 simply possess 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.770
 so it's good there ended for slow motion 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.900
 is provided that she is possessed she herself 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.630
 crushes and yes we have to eliminate the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.750
 people who are possessed and there we finish 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.750
 with
