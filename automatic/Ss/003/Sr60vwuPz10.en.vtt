00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
as well as that we also have route 11

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.670 
as well as that we also have route 11
that<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:56.939> off<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> east<00:01:57.680> completed

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that is right off to the east completed

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.490 
that is right off to the east completed
and<00:01:59.159> we've<00:02:00.090> also<00:02:00.270> gotten<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.750> lot<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.020> work<00:02:01.290> done

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
and we've also gotten a lot of work done

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.880 
and we've also gotten a lot of work done
when<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> comes<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.399> Azir<00:02:02.909> Bay<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.710> have

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
when it comes to Azir Bay so we have

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.610 
when it comes to Azir Bay so we have
most<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.460> islands<00:02:06.030> that

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
most of the islands that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.160 
most of the islands that
are<00:02:07.060> established<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.570> are<00:02:08.750> just<00:02:08.930> going<00:02:09.080> to

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
are established that are just going to

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.250 
are established that are just going to
be<00:02:09.760> like<00:02:10.760> places<00:02:11.210> for<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.780> just<00:02:12.020> dock

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
be like places for you to just dock

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.980 
be like places for you to just dock
anywhere<00:02:12.610> built<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.510> still<00:02:14.720> need<00:02:14.840> to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
anywhere built and we still need to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.960 
anywhere built and we still need to
build<00:02:15.170> some<00:02:15.470> caves<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.220> maybe<00:02:16.640> some<00:02:16.940> more

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
build some caves and maybe some more

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.850 
build some caves and maybe some more
islands<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.780> specifically<00:02:18.470> like<00:02:18.740> the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
islands and specifically like the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.640 
islands and specifically like the
shallow<00:02:19.180> water<00:02:20.180> around<00:02:20.840> those<00:02:21.020> islands<00:02:21.470> but

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
shallow water around those islands but

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.190 
shallow water around those islands but
for<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.310> most<00:02:22.430> part<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.050> pretty

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
for the most part that is that is pretty

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.950 
for the most part that is that is pretty
good<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:25.420> currently<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.510> was<00:02:26.780> actually

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
good and currently I was actually

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.740 
good and currently I was actually
working<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.620> route<00:02:28.190> 12<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.820> then<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.480> stopped

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
working on route 12 and then I stopped

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.230 
working on route 12 and then I stopped
to<00:02:29.990> record<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.800> video<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.490> that's<00:02:32.000> what<00:02:32.210> I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
to record this video so that's what I

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.710 
to record this video so that's what I
was<00:02:32.420> working<00:02:32.570> on<00:02:32.780> recently<00:02:34.120> as<00:02:35.120> well<00:02:35.360> as<00:02:35.510> that

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
was working on recently as well as that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.800 
was working on recently as well as that
we<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.140> east<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.980> lumiose<00:02:37.520> city<00:02:37.550> route<00:02:38.330> 15

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
we have east of lumiose city route 15

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.890 
we have east of lumiose city route 15
and<00:02:39.020> 16<00:02:39.440> which<00:02:39.860> are<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.550> like<00:02:40.880> kind<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.480> desert

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
and 16 which are the like kind of desert

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.070 
and 16 which are the like kind of desert
brown<00:02:42.430> autumn<00:02:43.430> looking<00:02:43.850> forest<00:02:44.420> areas<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.020> I

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
brown autumn looking forest areas and I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.210 
brown autumn looking forest areas and I
really<00:02:45.290> didn't<00:02:45.500> know<00:02:45.620> what<00:02:45.710> to<00:02:45.830> do<00:02:45.950> with<00:02:46.070> that

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
really didn't know what to do with that

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.670 
really didn't know what to do with that
so<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.550> just<00:02:46.760> had<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.300> go<00:02:48.080> with<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.410> default

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
so I just had to go with the default

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.640 
so I just had to go with the default
desert<00:02:49.310> colors<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.110> I'm<00:02:51.110> liking<00:02:51.410> how<00:02:51.500> it's

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
desert colors and I'm liking how it's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.700 
desert colors and I'm liking how it's
working<00:02:51.830> out<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.400> as<00:02:53.270> well<00:02:53.510> as<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.900> right

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
working out and as well as that right

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.340 
working out and as well as that right
next<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.130> we<00:02:55.520> have<00:02:55.550> den<00:02:56.120> DeMille<00:02:56.390> which<00:02:56.990> I

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
next to that we have den DeMille which I

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.890 
next to that we have den DeMille which I
have<00:02:57.500> established<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:58.250> platforms<00:02:58.790> for<00:02:59.090> but

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
have established the platforms for but

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.750 
have established the platforms for but
it's<00:03:00.140> gonna<00:03:00.260> need<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.710> lot<00:03:00.980> more<00:03:01.010> work<00:03:01.460> to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
it's gonna need a lot more work to

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.380 
it's gonna need a lot more work to
really<00:03:02.360> make<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.630> look<00:03:02.750> nice<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.830> up<00:03:04.790> north<00:03:05.000> we

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
really make it look nice and up north we

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.540 
really make it look nice and up north we
have<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.630> pathway<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:07.070> frost<00:03:07.310> cavern

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
have the pathway to the frost cavern

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.300 
have the pathway to the frost cavern
completed<00:03:08.290> we<00:03:09.290> pretty<00:03:09.530> much<00:03:09.680> just<00:03:09.890> need<00:03:10.100> to

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
completed we pretty much just need to

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.970 
completed we pretty much just need to
actually<00:03:10.820> work<00:03:11.180> on<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.570> cavern<00:03:11.959> but<00:03:12.260> that's

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
actually work on the cavern but that's

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.800 
actually work on the cavern but that's
normally<00:03:13.459> one<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.850> last<00:03:14.120> things<00:03:14.420> we<00:03:14.630> do

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
normally one of the last things we do

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.810 
normally one of the last things we do
honestly<00:03:15.530> whenever<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:15.980> comes<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.280> caves<00:03:16.520> is

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
honestly whenever it comes to caves is

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.500 
honestly whenever it comes to caves is
we<00:03:17.660> just<00:03:17.810> kind<00:03:18.020> of<00:03:18.080> do<00:03:18.200> those<00:03:18.850> last<00:03:19.850> because

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
we just kind of do those last because

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.660 
we just kind of do those last because
they're<00:03:20.690> always<00:03:20.840> in<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.110> ground<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.770> then

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
they're always in the ground and then

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.240 
they're always in the ground and then
finally<00:03:23.209> one<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:23.720> my<00:03:23.930> best<00:03:24.170> builders<00:03:24.620> mist<00:03:25.010> has

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
finally one of my best builders mist has

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.610 
finally one of my best builders mist has
been<00:03:25.400> working<00:03:25.820> on<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.510> lumiose<00:03:26.840> tower<00:03:27.170> the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
been working on the lumiose tower the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.620 
been working on the lumiose tower the
Eiffel<00:03:28.070> Tower<00:03:28.100> whatever<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.209> want<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.480> call

Eiffel Tower whatever you want to call

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.470 
Eiffel Tower whatever you want to call
it<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:30.020> currently<00:03:30.890> we<00:03:31.370> have<00:03:31.400> been<00:03:31.730> mixing<00:03:32.300> and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
it and currently we have been mixing and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.510 
it and currently we have been mixing and
mashing<00:03:32.780> around<00:03:33.230> with<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.770> couple<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.340> looks

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
mashing around with a couple of looks

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.820 
mashing around with a couple of looks
and<00:03:34.910> these<00:03:35.690> are<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.900> two<00:03:36.050> towers<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:36.709> are

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
and these are the two towers that are

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.880 
and these are the two towers that are
currently<00:03:37.130> built<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:38.200> yeah<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:39.709> that's

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
currently built and yeah so that's

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.340 
currently built and yeah so that's
what's<00:03:40.070> been<00:03:40.130> going<00:03:40.250> on<00:03:40.580> in<00:03:41.030> Kalos<00:03:41.840> this<00:03:42.050> time

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
what's been going on in Kalos this time

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.220 
what's been going on in Kalos this time

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
so I'm not planning on making these

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.350 
so I'm not planning on making these
videos<00:03:45.590> maybe<00:03:45.890> once<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.310> week<00:03:46.340> although<00:03:47.090> this

videos maybe once a week although this

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.630 
videos maybe once a week although this
happened<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.750> just<00:03:47.930> work<00:03:48.110> out<00:03:48.290> nicely<00:03:48.640> it
