passcode entry screen you know people

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.109 
passcode entry screen you know people
think<00:01:24.440> this<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.580> big<00:01:25.850> problem

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
think this is that this is a big problem

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.450 
think this is that this is a big problem
because<00:01:26.390> anybody<00:01:27.380> could<00:01:27.560> really<00:01:27.590> access<00:01:28.340> your

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460

because anybody could really access your
contacts<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.150> things<00:01:29.299> like<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.510> but

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
contacts and things like that but

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.960 
contacts and things like that but
basically<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.250> doesn't<00:01:31.640> really<00:01:31.729> matter

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
basically it doesn't really matter

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.640 
basically it doesn't really matter

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.369 
big deal but getting access to the file
system<00:03:44.169> is<00:03:44.290> still<00:03:44.500> much<00:03:44.889> more<00:03:45.159> of<00:03:45.579> a<00:03:45.970> risk<00:03:46.379> so

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
system is still much more of a risk so

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.589 
system is still much more of a risk so
pretty<00:03:47.590> much<00:03:47.739> what<00:03:47.889> i'm<00:03:48.010> saying<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.549> iOS<00:03:49.269> and

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
it was stolen so you know it's

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.380 
it was stolen so you know it's
these<00:04:14.920> devices<00:04:15.100> just<00:04:15.490> aren't<00:04:15.790> safe<00:04:16.030> if<00:04:16.239> that's

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
these devices just aren't safe if that's

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
these devices just aren't safe if that's
something<00:04:16.630> you're<00:04:16.810> really<00:04:16.870> worried<00:04:17.320> about

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
on losing it anywhere so usually I don't

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.780 
on losing it anywhere so usually I don't
have<00:04:25.420> a<00:04:25.450> passcode<00:04:25.750> lock<00:04:26.140> at<00:04:26.320> all<00:04:26.580> this<00:04:27.580> is<00:04:27.700> the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
have a passcode lock at all this is the

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.340 
have a passcode lock at all this is the
first<00:04:27.970> time<00:04:28.120> I've<00:04:28.390> turned<00:04:28.690> on<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:28.960> passcode

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
first time I've turned on the passcode

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.740 
first time I've turned on the passcode
lock<00:04:29.590> on<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:30.580> iphone<00:04:30.760> since<00:04:31.300> I've<00:04:31.480> purchased

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
lock on this iphone since I've purchased

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.050 
lock on this iphone since I've purchased
it<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:33.220> I'm<00:04:33.310> going<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.460> go<00:04:33.550> ahead<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:33.850> turn<00:04:33.940> it

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
it so I'm going to go ahead and turn it

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.580 
it so I'm going to go ahead and turn it
back<00:04:34.180> off<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:37.050> yeah<00:04:38.050> that's<00:04:38.230> how<00:04:38.380> I<00:04:38.410> usually

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
back off and yeah that's how I usually

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.410 
back off and yeah that's how I usually
roll<00:04:38.950> I<00:04:39.010> just<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.520> just<00:04:39.550> don't<00:04:39.910> use<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.240> pass

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
roll I just I just don't use the pass

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.380 
roll I just I just don't use the pass
code<00:04:40.630> because<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:40.960> seems<00:04:41.380> to<00:04:41.530> waste<00:04:41.710> time

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
code because it seems to waste time

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.760 
code because it seems to waste time
because<00:04:43.390> if<00:04:43.600> somebody<00:04:43.900> takes<00:04:44.080> my<00:04:44.260> phone<00:04:44.470> I

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
because if somebody takes my phone I

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.170 
because if somebody takes my phone I
know<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:45.520> if<00:04:45.670> they<00:04:45.790> know<00:04:45.910> what<00:04:46.060> they're

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
know that if they know what they're

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.550 
know that if they know what they're
doing<00:04:46.210> they<00:04:46.540> can<00:04:46.690> still<00:04:46.930> get<00:04:47.080> access<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.530> all

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
doing they can still get access to all

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.800 
doing they can still get access to all
my<00:04:47.770> stuff<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:48.820> there's<00:04:49.000> no<00:04:49.090> point<00:04:49.300> in<00:04:49.450> having<00:04:49.600> a

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
my stuff so there's no point in having a

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.570 
my stuff so there's no point in having a
passcode<00:04:50.230> lock<00:04:50.440> it<00:04:50.650> just<00:04:50.830> slows<00:04:51.040> me<00:04:51.220> down<00:04:51.250> when

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
passcode lock it just slows me down when

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.340 
passcode lock it just slows me down when
I<00:04:51.610> need<00:04:51.790> when<00:04:52.390> I<00:04:52.450> need<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.690> do<00:04:52.870> something<00:04:53.140> on

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
I need when I need to do something on

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.220 
I need when I need to do something on
there<00:04:53.560> as<00:04:53.650> well<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:54.450> that<00:04:55.450> was<00:04:55.660> my<00:04:55.690> little<00:04:55.900> rant

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
there as well so that was my little rant

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.040 
there as well so that was my little rant
on<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.770> iOS<00:04:57.040> passcode<00:04:57.940> security<00:04:58.780> hole<00:04:58.900> that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
on the iOS passcode security hole that

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.190 
on the iOS passcode security hole that
people<00:04:59.290> have<00:04:59.410> been<00:04:59.500> talking<00:04:59.650> about<00:04:59.890> lately

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
people have been talking about lately

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.480 
people have been talking about lately
basically<00:05:02.200> it's<00:05:02.770> not<00:05:02.919> a<00:05:02.950> big<00:05:03.160> deal<00:05:03.190> in<00:05:03.460> my

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
basically it's not a big deal in my

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.790 
basically it's not a big deal in my
opinion<00:05:03.850> there's<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.630> lot<00:05:04.960> more<00:05:04.990> worse<00:05:05.500> things

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
opinion there's a lot more worse things

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.140 
opinion there's a lot more worse things
that<00:05:05.890> could<00:05:06.070> happen<00:05:06.130> to<00:05:06.460> your<00:05:06.580> device<00:05:06.820> such<00:05:07.120> as

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
that could happen to your device such as

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.960 
that could happen to your device such as

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
them with stupid photos because they can

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.370
