00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello kitty the 21st ipad mini is from 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 edson then take a look at our 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.400
 first impressions 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.260
 let's start with mini ipad design 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.750
 which is a bit different from the ipad 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.980
 traditional starting with the doors here 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.630
 which are thinner 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.090
 the back also draws enough 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.770
 attention because they are a color 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.710
 so it's not the classic silver anymore 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.990
 lends iphone 5 elements in part 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.300
 from behind is the same material as the iphone 5 and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.750
 the front edges the details here in the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.420
 front are also the same as the iphone 5 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.430
 the 5 megapixel camera has no flash and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.390
 a mini ipad microphone stands in the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.760
 higher 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.940
 the volume buttons remain on the side 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.980
 below the rotation lock or has changed and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.920
 on the bottom two audio outputs 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 stereo and lighting connector and camera 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 Front is a facetime hd that makes videos 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.010
 in high definition or taking pictures of a 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.510
 2-megapixel point 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 well this is the design now let's talk one 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 this screen has seven 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.039
 9 inch stitches are almost 8 inches 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.359
 and the edges are slightly smaller in the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.670
 side that allows it to have a 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.979
 proportion equal to that of other sites 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.159
 with the result the applications open with 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.439
 exactly the same interface as the others 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.140
 ipads there is only one negative point in 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.790
 some moments buttons that were already 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.860
 small on the other ipad will stay a 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.200
 a little bit better and this may bother 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.939
 A little bit, do not you get used to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.030
 notification center for example is 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.490
 very small and although the screen does not 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.110
 be retina resolution this does not bother and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.150
 is not a problem because there are 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.320
 definition is still higher than that of 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 a normal ipad 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.650
 the normal ipad has a density of 132 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.990
 pixels per inch the retinal ipad has 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.110
 264 qix per inch now ipad mini 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.240
 has 162 pixels per inch which is not 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.340
 the retina and also is not normal then 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.810
 you have half a middle ground and no 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.299
 enough to bother enough to be a screen 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.610
 very beautiful, you can watch videos 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.600
 good to view photos with high 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.130
 level of detail 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.350
 now if you get closer to the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.899
 tablet you can see the pixels but 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.689
 not that this is a problem in terms 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.330
 performance mini ipad is 1-5 with 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.490
 512 mb of ram 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.740
 but that's what it means he's slow 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.840
 not who has an ipad2 know he is well 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.670
 fast and runs virtually every 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.620
 games that are on epe becomes a good 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.720
 so he is not slow 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.610
 ipad 3g ipad four can be one 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.200
 bit faster but does not mean 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.670
 that the mini ipad is bad 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.520
 so in terms of performance it is a 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.740
 excellent tablet by size and when 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.440
 we compare the ipad mini with the ipad 2 gives 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.500
 to see the difference that the size does 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.910
 half and weighs only 300 grams half 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.190
 ipad 2 weight 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.960
 this greatly facilitates transportation and is 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.120
 much more comfortable for those who do not 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.430
 issue of having the largest screen on the market 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.530
 this size also creates possibilities 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.690
 for new uses with the ipad 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.400
 I changed my ipad 3 by a mini ipad 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.830
 and my first impression is that it is 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.170
 as strong as the other iPads is in the 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.760
 time to read a text or change a game 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.800
 Of course it does not have the retina screen but I 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.690
 I consider the retina to be a 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.380
 luxury and then for me it did not do much 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.690
 difference 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.000
 the features remain the same as 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.440
 difference is that it is smaller and whenever 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.760
 I show mini ipad to me already 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.830
 know the ipad 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.860
 the print is the same as the head for 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.860
 low 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.500
 is finding 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:30.659
 is low and asks only that neither gives him it is 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.459
 An ipad will be ok now it will not respond. 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.330
 to the doubts that you left the video of 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.250
 boxing 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.230
 You said you made up for the ipad exchange. 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.910
 3 for ipad mini because I did not find this 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.709
 because I prefer the smaller devices 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.510
 my macbook and sic or 11 inch 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.430
 so I prefer the ipad better than it is 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.709
 easy to carry around and I noticed that 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.599
 it has the same power as the ipad2 then 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.579
 the performance is great 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.769
 it has two sound outputs a volume of 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.629
 Tall animal you can see his name. 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.760
 is not taller than the ipad 3 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.379
 although it does have a stereo sound, it is not 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.239
 more do you think that the lack of 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.980
 telegent in this first generation reaches the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.870
 be a problem I would not say it's a 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.299
 problem the screen retina for me is a 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.010
 Luxury resort I've used the ipad 3 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.590
 against him had for a long time 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.099
 I came back for the ipad 2 ipad the mini ipad 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.440
 and it was not bothering of course it is not 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.880
 excellent is not perfect but great 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.739
 It is still a great solution 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.810
 I want to know a price a kick for 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.570
 get here in Brazil promoting more 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.330
 basic wifi 16gb I kick at least a thousand 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.099
 real and at most one thousand and three hundred is a kick 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.020
 I think it's going to be there you think 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.300
 for being more like the ipad 2 the 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.070
 boy is inferior or three I do not think 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.169
 that the performance of the mini ipad is lower 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.740
 or three like I said an ipad review 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.229
 3 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.120
 the a5 x processor is much stronger 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.430
 but in graphic terms only he has 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.470
 a much higher resolution to process 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.720
 there is little left to offer more 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.270
 performance to the tablet then I 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.430
 i would say a5 on the ipad i am almost 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.410
 equivalent to 15x on ipad 3 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.120
 he has enough power to hit 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.889
 with other tablets of the same 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.900
 nexus type size 7 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.849
 we will do a comparative more 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.340
 the river is now returning with 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.830
 nexus 7 is to debate today 3 but I think 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.840
 yes he does not accompany out this box 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.240
 with the only amount has the lightning car 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.860
 and a charger has no headset 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.780
 earphone never came any ipad 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.060
 as a matter of fact 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.740
 processing, I always admired the 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.170
 when most gaming apps 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.480
 Recent catch on without work or that 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.250
 it was dangerous where it did not open 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.480
 all government applications and asks for three 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.380
 they work by taking a good 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.750
 performance 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.660
 What do you think is worth it anyway? 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.130
 swap the 9.7 inch tombini ipad 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.380
 even knowing that the greater with the 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.419
 best technical specifications and 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.280
 minimum price difference all depends 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.120
 of which you prefer to keep the larger or 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.130
 a smaller screen 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.139
 if you ever want to have the ipad more 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.090
 Then it goes fast with four 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.070
 now if you want to have an ipad that you 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.140
 more suddenly pleases the mini more 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:56.840
 business and 11 had no problem the 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:59.480
 Apple's performance written a lot can 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.160
 ironing clothes with him a lot in him and 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.400
 yesterday it does not heat as much as the 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.860
 ipad 3 bp3 who gives it here but not 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.720
 very hot did not see the ipad camera 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.790
 mini is good to take pictures and he movie 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.490
 Escape is a great camera that has the 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.950
 same ipad 3 quality then photos 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.470
 cool and david the cool but not so good 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.990
 how much iphone 4s or iphone 5 you 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.760
 you miss the retina screen, no this is 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.070
 this was ours we did a quick 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.840
 here mini ipad review soon 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.030
 we will have a complete event of the device 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.090
 but before you have a review of iphone 5 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.930
 Calm down, he's going to leave so calmly. 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.530
 be all right 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.530
 to the next
