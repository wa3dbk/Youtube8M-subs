 I bring you a new section 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.040
 entitled strange stipulations this 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 it will be a kind of compilation to the 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.289
 more crazy wrestling stipulations 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.700
 and crazy I've witnessed 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.710
 obviously there will be no reference to 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.809
 double double uy since we all know 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.789
 to perfection its stipulations more 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.460
 striking as the hell in a cell or the 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.739
 elimination chamber in this video we 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.589
 We will go to other wrestling companies in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.449
 this case has it and this company has 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.519
 characterized by having some of the 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.190
 stranger stipulations and at the same time 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.710
 striking to give you some examples 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.179
 we have the popular lethal doc down on the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.859
 which is that they are arriving 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.530
 fighters for a time limit 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.839
 estimated when they are all in the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 cage the loaded top lid is released 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.519
 of weapons to start the massacre 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.590
 there 's also the ex elevation where 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.049
 the fighters must lower a great x 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.330
 located at the top of the ring to 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.820
 get to it they have some cables 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.220
 by steel pillars located at the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.440
 four sides of the river is also the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.660
 strange stipulation called kilos of 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.700
 mounts in this stipulation the 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.530
 wrestlers involved can attack 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 with everything they want their rivals 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.510
 when the account of 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.820
 three to a fighter this is not eliminated 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.920
 instead it's taken to a kind 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.830
 of cage where it remains there for about 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.630
 minutes the victory is achieved by hanging 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.430
 the belt to win instead of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.100
 pick up what is normally 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.560
 get the victory and among all those 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.890
 strange stipulations the one that most called 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.440
 my attention is this presented them the ace 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.090
 there is one more this great structure is 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.370
 considered one of the stipulations 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.470
 most dangerous in the history of those who 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.900
 the circular structure weighs 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.810
 approximately 10 tons and measures about 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.729
 36 meters in diameter as you can see 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.190
 is sealed by the top 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.770
 having only a small hole 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.020
 to leave according to the testimony of many 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.640
 fighters this stipulation is very 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.560
 hard to win because of the few 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.989
 odds that one has to leave 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.969
 in a nutshell 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.730
 impossible to win the rules for this 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.650
 combat are the following first go 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.780
 entering an approximate number of 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.269
 fighters for obvious reasons all 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.310
 they must be light, the objective is very 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.959
 simple you must find the way to 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.689
 escape from the structure coming out 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.670
 only through the top hole but 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.799
 Of course it is very different to say it 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.019
 do it since as I said at the beginning it's 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.790
 very difficult to win this stipulation already 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.249
 that you have to be quite agile and fast 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.499
 to be able to escape this stimulation 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:52.659
 It is also very dangerous because when 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:54.790
 one is at the top of the structure 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.919
 and suddenly a rival comes to pull you 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.560
 you must hold with all your strength or 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:01.290
 you will suffer from a very hard fall this is 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.849
 one of the many stipulations 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.489
 exclusively for the division x as 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.439
 the aforementioned ex elevation in this 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.780
 great structure have passed very good 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.569
 fighters like they would marry christopher 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.659
 daniels suicide ' chris seitz wing alex 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.459
 shelley among others this stipulation is 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.889
 originally from mexico in the popular 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.530
 triple-a company where it is called 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.690
 the dome of death his debut in has and 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.450
 It was at the sacrifice 2008 event 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.460
 being called terror don went to the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.860
 event bound for glory fourth where 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.380
 he changed his nickname asylum match or acid 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.840
 Steel has long has it and now 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.820
 does not perform this type of fighting maybe 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.830
 because they find it quite difficult and 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.690
 dangerous and better chose to use more 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.630
 other stipulations like elevation 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.160
 ex wave skate match I think the 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.860
 chances of it going back to 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.080
 perform another are very low due to the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.780
 current economic crisis which is why 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.150
 passing the company but who knows such 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.490
 once someday when they have overcome that 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.950
 crisis may come back again this 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.230
 extravagant stipulation but for the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.690
 moment I invite you to see these struggles 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.370
 that the truth is pretty good and 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.150
 the best that can be seen in the 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.280
 have and good friends that's all if 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.320
 they want a new part just notify and not 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.600
 they forget to give their thumbs up and 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.360
 Press the red button to subscribe 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.860
 if they are new here good without anything 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.860
 more than add I say goodbye
