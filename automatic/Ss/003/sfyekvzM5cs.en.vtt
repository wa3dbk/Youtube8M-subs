00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.250
 Well Hello to you work the tram 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.140
 is not today another tank video like 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.490
 see show you fight on t-54 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.869
 not bad in principle with this stick a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.560
 many dozen ensk one art fireflies 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.880
 a little bit of his sleep nines critic district 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.530
 in platoon assembly yes if there are some 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.649
 there will be questions yes it is burqa eSports 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:49.399
 rows but that’s such a question and so i’m 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.500
 I decide to go to the actual position with the so-called. 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.989
 I honestly looked that in principle 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.180
 there are three of them with a point greater than 2 nobody will go 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.770
 a maximum of 71 still have seven you all 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.219
 four think now 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.979
 principle , we take out is ok now 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:11.159
 take out but actually somehow not here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:13.380
 It was as they say here our 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.390
 I will say this in strength begin to crush the year and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.340
 begin to push the mouse night 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.240
 sold to sevens so far there is not enough 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.420
 I'm starting to polish the people because 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.009
 I will not see anyone 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:31.770
 I don't dare to leave directly because 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.979
 there may be chamber poked already for me 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.890
 here i see t-62 starts to lie back 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.350
 I see leaves T-54 and T-54 71 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.689
 showing up on the horizon here already 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:54.299
 notice 68 and so here actually 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:58.439
 lichku because of a handful so as not to leave 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.450
 forward then he let our stoke go down 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.430
 not see my position is 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.740
 that some for some reason without seeing 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.210
 Then I would not go to take T62 71 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.170
 just saw 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.480
 while standing here 68 is afraid to leave and 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.000
 starts to throw ours so let's say 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.620
 so I am his saber so I hung it 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.020
 and actually turned back 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.380
 see 71 turns seven, she did not 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.330
 can i do shoot a caterpillar here 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.300
 but apparently only winning I do not knock down 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.250
 Here I do not want to risk aiming 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.660
 71 another damage here 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.940
 pull up already t-62 first before 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.650
 disassemble t-70 skirt need nasty 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.720
 I see such a tanchik, but I do not have a score of 8 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.459
 look the situation starts to squeeze everything from 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:58.019
 8 rear 2 54 volts cps then out of 8 i'm actually 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:01.350
 I do so and you are not gray not here 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.450
 I see and just the same here hang 8 night 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.980
 charge here and now it was 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.230
 drive through as much as possible 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.850
 I have to be honest I do not remember but it turns out 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.290
 if i go even if so here they are not 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.040
 have time to inflict fifty 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.739
 four eights don't look and they don't 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.750
 have time to shoot here is some trifle 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.230
 I managed to find out such ones and ricochet well 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.930
 I'm leaving 68 let's say so drove myself 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.709
 and can go after me, I understand that 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.070
 I throw seven but better there will die two 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.500
 tank than you see that 6 from 8 to send 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:42.510
 or here they start to drive off they 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.160
 aim at the gym then I start to drive off 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.040
 so far this middle as no matter how 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.959
 strange but still gives a very long time 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.329
 mice are not table our four thin 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.810
 the features of the mouse i'm here now somehow bad 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.820
 I see I see a green dot breaking through 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.160
 the muscles are very bad on the cherries but there are corpses 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:05.579
 I interfere so on let's say this but in skidochku 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.560
 I just throw the mouse through and start 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.900
 comes back support our 60 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.980
 eighths 1 as you can see already killed us 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:19.840
 pulled up and 4 206 8 object plus we 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.810
 in the rock they are worth a vase now i also 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:28.870
 here we will go on alternate because 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.639
 how will it be very very unpleasant they 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.139
 if they get distracted, let's go 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.729
 Now throw the lift if they are 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.940
 get distracted by support over it catch up 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.770
 I mean, there are some 36 tanks right here 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.010
 we have here 3 3 tanks 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:48.130
 but we are very colorful vase not believe 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:51.430
 the vase was already blown away from the point of starting 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.100
 crush but here ttk whole drove up but 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.880
 never need to push when you have two 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.100
 fri-shki 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.590
 You see, when two crumbs you 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.669
 support for the torus left that's why 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.800
 she went to me 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.199
 although I'll just say thank you laptop 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.840
 ineptly merged this 50 four too 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.600
 ineptly merged eight only 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.760
 noticed the presence of the little birds 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.760
 only noticed two corpses well slop. 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:23.010
 I shoot it off notice bye 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:27.039
 pretty dangerous enough anyway 98 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.539
 yet I will say this, we did not win but do not 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.320
 merged enough all interesting though 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:34.539
 now and not say so one nedobitki 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.490
 we are more than me whole I'm starting 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:42.000
 let's say spend your hp leave already 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:45.490
 so arrogant without fear that I will still take 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.590
 I wanted to take the eight from the platform 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.460
 I got up that is, but put on the edge 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.880
 passed back 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:06:00.630
 sex on them already scattered and left alone 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.630
 Art slightly accelerate 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.580
 and here I actually do n't remember a bit 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.370
 no wedding without causing yourself pain warrior 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:18.040
 but actually lost in principle 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:24.340
 not bad, I threw 4000 but actually 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:25.930
 the essence of the video is not that there is a Nagu 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.750
 or something else here bend strong not 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.150
 it was with 4000 not so much every 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:35.050
 the second quietly sells itself sense 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:37.840
 the fact that sometimes do not be afraid to throw their 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.720
 that is, I neglected the seven 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.660
 but nevertheless we were able to drag in because 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.300
 as if I would have stayed well, it would have given 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.070
 2 photo 3 can on object all 8 I would 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.800
 climbed into the seven and then it was 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.900
 not all heaped into 6 trunks and 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.670
 taken away moves from eighths and then they 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:59.530
 4 and would calmly have a base 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:03.390
 so we had a base plus one barrel 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:07.180
 there was there was a shootout like that 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:09.220
 cruciform i mean i was there like 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.380
 annoying x plus like venus is not very 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.990
 your sting is distracted by me 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:17.170
 Laura to write the four of the eight of the torus all 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:20.080
 4 lots immediately threw back the sneakers you measure 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.460
 only then noticed n basically more 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.820
 less interesting this would be exactly 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:27.430
 competently tactical but my opinion is 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.870
 principle cheese so thank you all who 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.760
 watched subscribe to the channel 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.340
 I think the next video will be on the object 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.460
 140 when I have gained experience today 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.320
 patch comes out more precisely, he will start today 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.020
 go out and have a breakfast beer kind to mind 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.670
 finish all thanks to all and
