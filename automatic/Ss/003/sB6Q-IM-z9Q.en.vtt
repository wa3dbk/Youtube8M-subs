00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
were really good at pressing until we

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.460 
were really good at pressing until we
until<00:02:35.970> they<00:02:36.090> inevitably<00:02:36.330> did<00:02:36.630> concede<00:02:37.260> by

until they inevitably did concede by
form<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.980> thought<00:02:38.250> um<00:02:38.460> really<00:02:39.450> did<00:02:39.690> play<00:02:39.900> well

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
form I thought um really did play well

for<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.350> first<00:02:40.650> half<00:02:40.950> an<00:02:41.250> hour<00:02:41.340> surprised

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
for that first half an hour surprised

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.610 
for that first half an hour surprised
how<00:02:42.120> poor<00:02:42.510> they<00:02:42.750> did<00:02:42.990> would<00:02:43.050> they<00:02:43.110> went<00:02:43.410> after

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
how poor they did would they went after

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.280 
how poor they did would they went after
after<00:02:44.430> um<00:02:44.790> after<00:02:45.270> they<00:02:45.510> concede<00:02:45.870> i<00:02:45.900> think<00:02:46.230> i

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
after um after they concede i think i

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.780 
after um after they concede i think i
would<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.530> expected<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:47.070> lot<00:02:47.190> more<00:02:47.250> from<00:02:47.610> them

not entirely sure I'm not entirely
convinced<00:03:34.380> he<00:03:34.830> does<00:03:34.980> make<00:03:35.190> small<00:03:35.670> errors<00:03:35.970> at

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
convinced he does make small errors at

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.460 
convinced he does make small errors at
times<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:36.600> he<00:03:36.959> was<00:03:37.080> good<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.290> see<00:03:37.410> an

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
times but he was good to see an

times but he was good to see an
improving<00:03:37.950> was<00:03:38.160> only<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.430> second<00:03:38.700> game<00:03:38.790> back

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850

from<00:03:39.000> injury<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.720> do<00:03:40.350> still<00:03:40.530> think<00:03:40.709> we<00:03:40.950> should

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
from injury I do still think we should

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.040 
from injury I do still think we should
try<00:03:41.280> will<00:03:41.580> share<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.000> Ramsey<00:03:42.360> pivot<00:03:42.750> some

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
try will share and Ramsey pivot some

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.470 
try will share and Ramsey pivot some
point<00:03:43.290> especially<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.770> 24<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.160> 31<00:03:44.490> I<00:03:44.880> certainly

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
point especially in 24 to 31 I certainly

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.400 
point especially in 24 to 31 I certainly
think<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.690> something<00:03:46.020> that<00:03:46.050> could<00:03:46.200> work

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
think that something that could work

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.720 
think that something that could work
with<00:03:46.590> one<00:03:46.770> of<00:03:46.860> them<00:03:46.980> occupying<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.580> more

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
with one of them occupying a more

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.060 
with one of them occupying a more
defensive<00:03:48.300> role<00:03:48.570> or<00:03:48.780> even<00:03:49.380> alternating<00:03:49.950> in<00:03:49.980> a

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
defensive role or even alternating in a

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.230 
defensive role or even alternating in a
box-to-box<00:03:50.370> midfielder<00:03:50.459> or<00:03:51.060> that's

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
box-to-box midfielder or that's

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.580 
box-to-box midfielder or that's
something<00:03:51.540> I'd<00:03:51.660> really<00:03:51.780> like<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.020> see<00:03:52.290> at<00:03:52.380> some

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
something I'd really like to see at some

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.699 
something I'd really like to see at some
point<00:03:52.830> but<00:03:53.730> Arteta<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.840> meantime<00:03:55.020> he<00:03:55.560> did

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
point but Arteta in the meantime he did

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.290 
point but Arteta in the meantime he did
okay<00:03:56.100> today<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:56.610> when<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.850> comes<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.120> playing

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
okay today but when it comes to playing

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.880 
okay today but when it comes to playing
in<00:03:57.450> bigger<00:03:57.630> games<00:03:57.930> I'm<00:03:58.260> not<00:03:58.590> entirely

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
in bigger games I'm not entirely

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.120 
in bigger games I'm not entirely
convinced<00:03:59.040> you'll<00:03:59.520> be<00:03:59.580> able<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.790> live<00:04:00.000> up<00:04:00.120> to

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
convinced you'll be able to live up to

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.830 
convinced you'll be able to live up to
the<00:04:02.130> conditions<00:04:02.610> surrounding<00:04:03.150> him<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.690> that

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
the conditions surrounding him in that

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.690 
the conditions surrounding him in that
current<00:04:04.140> situation<00:04:04.650> for<00:04:04.830> having<00:04:05.130> 30<00:04:05.340> minutes

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
current situation for having 30 minutes

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.040 
current situation for having 30 minutes
of<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.820> game<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:06.090> think<00:04:06.270> we<00:04:06.360> really<00:04:06.600> struggled

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
of the game I think we really struggled

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.270 
of the game I think we really struggled
to<00:04:07.140> break<00:04:07.290> Villa<00:04:07.560> down<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.070> was<00:04:08.220> our

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
to break Villa down and that was our

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.610 
to break Villa down and that was our
main<00:04:08.520> problem<00:04:09.060> during<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.989> patch<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.410> again

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
main problem during that patch it again

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.199 
main problem during that patch it again
but<00:04:10.739> once<00:04:10.950> we<00:04:11.130> scored<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.520> for<00:04:11.700> we<00:04:11.820> looks<00:04:11.970> really

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
but once we scored I for we looks really

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.090 
but once we scored I for we looks really
good<00:04:12.330> in<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.510> bull<00:04:12.750> villa<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:13.620> think<00:04:13.800> explain

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
good in the bull villa I think explain

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.930 
good in the bull villa I think explain
more<00:04:14.250> from<00:04:14.430> them<00:04:14.550> you've<00:04:14.670> got<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.820> remember
