00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
okay what I noticed would be possibly a

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.160 
okay what I noticed would be possibly a
problem<00:01:59.150> is<00:01:59.330> a<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.970> have<00:02:02.150> this<00:02:02.330> contour<00:02:02.900> this

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
problem is a you have this contour this

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.350 
problem is a you have this contour this
little<00:02:03.500> lip<00:02:04.310> here<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:06.170> fits<00:02:06.620> inside<00:02:07.360> the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
little lip here that fits inside the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.590 
little lip here that fits inside the
contour<00:02:09.080> right<00:02:09.290> here<00:02:09.580> but<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:11.090> continues<00:02:11.570> down

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
contour right here but it continues down

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.280 
contour right here but it continues down
the<00:02:11.900> side<00:02:12.140> so<00:02:13.040> whenever<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.580> put<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.850> in<00:02:14.000> there

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
the side so whenever you put it in there

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.010 
the side so whenever you put it in there
if<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.500> have<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.710> bar<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.220> there<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.720> be
