so we're a digital agency in Surrey

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.190 
so we're a digital agency in Surrey
Hills<00:00:35.059> refocuses<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
Hills refocuses and what is the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560 
Hills refocuses and what is the
connected<00:00:37.590> car<00:00:37.739> um<00:00:38.340> well<00:00:38.910> basically<00:00:39.270> we

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
connected car um well basically we

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.959 
connected car um well basically we
wanted<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.260> able<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.620> track<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.730> entire

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
wanted to be able to track the entire

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
wanted to be able to track the entire
trip<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.809> got<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> guy's<00:00:43.140> driving<00:00:43.680> across

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
trip as they got a guy's driving across

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.970 
trip as they got a guy's driving across
Australia<00:00:44.809> now<00:00:45.809> traditionally<00:00:46.379> there's<00:00:46.649> very

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
Australia now traditionally there's very

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889 
Australia now traditionally there's very
little<00:00:47.160> mobile<00:00:47.460> signal<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> outback<00:00:48.329> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
little mobile signal in the outback so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.069 
little mobile signal in the outback so
2g<00:00:49.590> 3G<00:00:50.100> 4G<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.120> doesn't<00:00:51.390> work<00:00:51.539> for

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
2g 3G 4G it really doesn't work for

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.560 
2g 3G 4G it really doesn't work for
large<00:00:52.500> parts<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> journey<00:00:53.570> satellite

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
large parts of the journey satellite

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.869 
large parts of the journey satellite
broadband<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.199> ridiculously<00:00:56.039> expensive<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
broadband is ridiculously expensive and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.910 
broadband is ridiculously expensive and
as<00:00:57.329> we're<00:00:57.480> doing<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.840> charity<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.739> can

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
as we're doing this for charity we can

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.279 
as we're doing this for charity we can
we<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.489> fund<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.420> actually<00:01:01.079> managed<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
we can fund that so actually managed to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.920 
we can fund that so actually managed to
find<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.100> way<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.789> sending<00:01:03.210> short<00:01:03.510> messages

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
find a way of sending short messages

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.350 
find a way of sending short messages
through<00:01:04.140> satellite<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> Iridium<00:01:06.030> network

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
through satellite on the Iridium network

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600 
through satellite on the Iridium network
using<00:01:06.720> short<00:01:06.960> bursts<00:01:07.140> data<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.400> came<00:01:08.580> up

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
using short bursts data so we came up

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.179 
using short bursts data so we came up
with<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> protocol<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.750> our<00:01:09.869> own<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.950> actually

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
with a protocol of our own to actually

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.060 
with a protocol of our own to actually
talk<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:12.510> car<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> send<00:01:13.710> messages<00:01:14.040> back

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
talk to the car and send messages back

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
talk to the car and send messages back
so<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.479> find<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.020> things<00:01:16.229> like

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so we can we can find out things like

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.929 
so we can we can find out things like
the<00:01:16.500> car<00:01:16.680> temperature<00:01:17.220> how<00:01:17.400> fast<00:01:17.700> they're

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the car temperature how fast they're

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
the car temperature how fast they're
going<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.290> send<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> messages<00:01:19.860> back

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
going and we can send the messages back

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.010 
going and we can send the messages back
saying<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.520> people<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.850> pledging<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
saying when people are pledging to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.380 
saying when people are pledging to
change<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.470> tracklist<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.759> say<00:01:24.060> turn<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
change the tracklist or to say turn the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.719 
change the tracklist or to say turn the
air<00:01:24.479> conditioning<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.960> enough<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.549> idea

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
air conditioning on enough so this idea

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.090 
air conditioning on enough so this idea
started<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.659> your<00:01:28.439> team<00:01:28.650> leading<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
started with your team leading to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.609 
started with your team leading to
communicate<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> car<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.350> seems

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
communicate with the car but it seems

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230 
communicate with the car but it seems
like<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.130> evolved<00:01:32.579> into<00:01:32.759> something<00:01:32.909> that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
like it's evolved into something that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
like it's evolved into something that
the<00:01:33.329> people<00:01:33.600> at<00:01:33.689> home<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.470> into<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.829> well

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the people at home can get into as well

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
the people at home can get into as well
absolutely<00:01:35.970> i<00:01:36.000> mean<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.240> wanted<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.780> an

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
absolutely i mean we wanted it to be an

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.410 
absolutely i mean we wanted it to be an
interactive<00:01:37.530> experience<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:39.090> set<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
interactive experience so we set up a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
interactive experience so we set up a
website<00:01:39.600> rally<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> future<00:01:40.590> calm<00:01:41.009> delay<00:01:41.250> you

website rally the future calm delay you
where<00:01:41.909> people<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.299> actually<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.930> they

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
where people can actually go and they

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.410 
where people can actually go and they
can<00:01:43.170> pledge<00:01:43.409> they<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.250> things<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.579> pick
