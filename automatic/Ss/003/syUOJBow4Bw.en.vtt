00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
there was a ton of grown-up jokes but

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.170 
there was a ton of grown-up jokes but
really<00:01:44.010> I<00:01:44.040> didn't<00:01:44.550> see<00:01:44.670> them<00:01:44.820> until<00:01:45.150> maybe

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
really I didn't see them until maybe

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.770 
really I didn't see them until maybe
near<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.840> end<00:01:46.370> stop<00:01:47.370> with<00:01:47.790> that

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.789 

I<00:01:52.000> guess<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.150> only<00:01:53.330> main<00:01:53.900> problem<00:01:54.440> I<00:01:54.590> have

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
I guess the only main problem I have

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.859 
I guess the only main problem I have
with<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:55.070> is<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.610> story<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:55.940> a<00:01:56.119> touch<00:01:56.570> too

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
with it is that the story is a touch too

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.810 
with it is that the story is a touch too
predictable<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.770> mean<00:01:58.070> once<00:01:58.280> again<00:01:58.610> we're

quite<00:02:16.550> strong<00:02:16.970> enough<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.480> make<00:02:17.690> up<00:02:17.900> for<00:02:17.930> such

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
quite strong enough to make up for such

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.830 
quite strong enough to make up for such
a<00:02:18.380> lackluster<00:02:19.340> part<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.790> movie<00:02:20.150> but<00:02:20.690> like
