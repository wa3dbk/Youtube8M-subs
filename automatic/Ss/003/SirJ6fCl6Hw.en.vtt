here and as you can see ours is

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.089 
here and as you can see ours is
completely<00:02:42.549> broken<00:02:42.790> off<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.420> rod<00:02:43.889> broke<00:02:44.889> off

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
completely broken off the rod broke off

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.490 
completely broken off the rod broke off
from<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.400> plastic<00:02:45.880> piece<00:02:46.090> here<00:02:46.380> which<00:02:47.380> is

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
from this plastic piece here which is

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.039 
from this plastic piece here which is
why<00:02:47.620> it's<00:02:47.799> not<00:02:47.859> working<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.660> then<00:02:52.810> we<00:02:52.900> have<00:02:53.019> a

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
why it's not working and then we have a

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.979 
why it's not working and then we have a
rod<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:54.549> here<00:02:54.700> we<00:02:54.790> have<00:02:54.910> our<00:02:55.000> new<00:02:55.540> fuel<00:02:55.840> door

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
rod so here we have our new fuel door

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.339 
rod so here we have our new fuel door
actuator<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.739> rod<00:02:57.160> actually<00:02:57.549> goes<00:02:57.700> down<00:02:58.000> and

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
actuator this rod actually goes down and

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.170 
actuator this rod actually goes down and
actuate<00:02:59.349> sit<00:02:59.560> this<00:02:59.859> two<00:03:00.609> Phillips<00:03:01.120> screws

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
actuate sit this two Phillips screws
