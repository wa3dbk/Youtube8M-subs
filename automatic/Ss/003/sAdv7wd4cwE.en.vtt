00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:53.629 
that to the end play you know it's a

that to the end play you know it's a
good<00:04:53.780> thing<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:53.930> he<00:04:54.080> put<00:04:54.259> that<00:04:54.439> because<00:04:54.770> some

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
good thing that he put that because some

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.890 
good thing that he put that because some
said<00:04:55.490> but<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:55.729> could<00:04:55.879> still<00:04:56.090> go<00:04:56.389> some<00:04:56.659> in<00:04:56.750> this

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
said but you could still go some in this

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.300 
said but you could still go some in this
summon<00:04:57.169> Redmond<00:04:57.469> random<00:04:57.770> can<00:04:57.919> still<00:04:58.099> summon

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
summon Redmond random can still summon

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.290 
summon Redmond random can still summon
something<00:04:58.580> else<00:04:58.879> so<00:04:59.270> that'd<00:04:59.419> still<00:04:59.750> be<00:04:59.810> game

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
something else so that'd still be game

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.459 
something else so that'd still be game
and<00:05:02.300> like<00:05:02.449> I<00:05:02.539> said<00:05:02.719> it<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.169> could<00:05:03.349> do<00:05:03.439> a

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
and like I said it you could do a

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:07.540 
and like I said it you could do a
substitute<00:05:04.129> you<00:05:04.520> can<00:05:04.819> do<00:05:05.060> a<00:05:05.090> substitute<00:05:06.550> yeah

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
substitute you can do a substitute yeah

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.399 
substitute you can do a substitute yeah
I<00:05:07.580> think<00:05:07.729> that's<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.090> pretty<00:05:08.360> powerful<00:05:08.719> card

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
I think that's a pretty powerful card

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.709 
I think that's a pretty powerful card
you<00:05:09.979> know<00:05:10.099> you<00:05:10.819> should<00:05:11.000> have<00:05:11.090> made<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.270> kind<00:05:11.659> of

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
you know you should have made it kind of

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.920 
you know you should have made it kind of
like<00:05:11.930> in<00:05:12.409> Dragoon<00:05:12.919> where<00:05:13.219> you<00:05:13.909> know<00:05:14.000> Oh

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
like in Dragoon where you know Oh

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.510 
like in Dragoon where you know Oh
not<00:05:15.319> even<00:05:15.529> the<00:05:15.620> in<00:05:15.710> Dragoon<00:05:16.069> because<00:05:16.250> you<00:05:16.370> can

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
not even the in Dragoon because you can

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.070 
not even the in Dragoon because you can
really<00:05:16.639> substitute<00:05:17.240> with<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:17.479> dragon<00:05:17.629> can't

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
really substitute with that dragon can't

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.320 
really substitute with that dragon can't
 I<00:05:18.469> don't<00:05:18.710> think<00:05:18.949> so<00:05:19.099> I<00:05:19.370> think<00:05:19.879> you<00:05:20.180> can

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
 I don't think so I think you can

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.240 
 I don't think so I think you can
substitute<00:05:20.539> friend<00:05:21.050> dragon<00:05:21.379> like<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:22.129> know

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
substitute friend dragon like you know

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.670 
substitute friend dragon like you know
use<00:05:22.909> a<00:05:22.939> substitute<00:05:23.750> fusion<00:05:24.050> cards<00:05:24.379> I<00:05:24.439> think<00:05:24.590> it

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
use a substitute fusion cards I think it

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.290 
use a substitute fusion cards I think it
has<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:24.860> be<00:05:25.009> those<00:05:25.189> cards<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:25.639> you<00:05:26.120> probably

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
has to be those cards so you probably

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.850 
has to be those cards so you probably
should<00:05:26.569> have<00:05:26.599> done<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.199> for<00:05:27.409> this<00:05:27.560> where<00:05:27.800> it

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
should have done that for this where it

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.529 
should have done that for this where it
