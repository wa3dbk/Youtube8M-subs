00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that's going to look like the reason why

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.680 
that's going to look like the reason why
I<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.479> doesn't

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
I like this is as you can see it doesn't

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.949 
I like this is as you can see it doesn't
add<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> whole<00:02:10.349> heck<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.770> lot<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.190> bulk<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.000> in

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
add a whole heck of a lot of bulk and in

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.340 
add a whole heck of a lot of bulk and in
my

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
my

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.780 
my
official<00:02:13.740> weigh-in<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.280> did<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
official weigh-in that I did on the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.660 
official weigh-in that I did on the
first<00:02:14.970> video<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:16.050> doesn't<00:02:16.590> even<00:02:16.770> register<00:02:17.070> on

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
first video it doesn't even register on

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.850 
first video it doesn't even register on
the<00:02:18.210> scale<00:02:18.540> that's<00:02:18.870> how<00:02:19.140> lightweight<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.710> is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
the scale that's how lightweight it is

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.200 
the scale that's how lightweight it is
so<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.610> again<00:02:21.090> at<00:02:22.100> $14.99<00:02:23.100> it's<00:02:23.610> really<00:02:24.060> not

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
so and again at $14.99 it's really not

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.050 
so and again at $14.99 it's really not
that<00:02:24.390> bad<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.900> deal<00:02:25.110> here<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.950> white<00:02:26.160> you

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
that bad of a deal here is the white you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.250 
that bad of a deal here is the white you
can<00:02:27.240> see<00:02:27.270> what<00:02:27.540> that's<00:02:27.660> going<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.020> look<00:02:28.200> like

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
can see what that's going to look like

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.760 
can see what that's going to look like
and<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:29.610> doesn't<00:02:30.090> obstruct<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:31.140> digital

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
and it doesn't obstruct the digital

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.820 
and it doesn't obstruct the digital
crown<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.750> you're<00:02:33.750> not<00:02:33.900> going<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.110> have<00:02:34.380> any

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
crown so you're not going to have any

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.250 
crown so you're not going to have any
lack<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.910> being<00:02:36.120> able<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.480> press<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.750> buttons

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
lack of being able to press the buttons

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.320 
lack of being able to press the buttons
or<00:02:37.560> anything<00:02:37.770> like<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.100> your<00:02:38.820> microphone

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330
