00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.490 
this cool little thing here how the way
I<00:02:12.330> got<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.930> was<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.870> website<00:02:16.319> here

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I got this was with this website here

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.130 
I got this was with this website here
now<00:02:16.980> if<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.610> hover<00:02:17.760> over<00:02:17.940> windows<00:02:18.420> 8<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.930> you

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
now if you hover over windows 8 and you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
now if you hover over windows 8 and you
head<00:02:19.319> over<00:02:19.349> windows<00:02:19.829> 8<00:02:20.130> transformation<00:02:20.880> pack

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
head over windows 8 transformation pack

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.009 
head over windows 8 transformation pack
this<00:02:23.160> works<00:02:23.549> with<00:02:23.760> both<00:02:23.910> 32-bit<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.870> 64-bit

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
this works with both 32-bit and 64-bit

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.990 
this works with both 32-bit and 64-bit
just<00:02:25.860> by<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.069> way<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.549> this<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.849> what

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
just by the way and this is what

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.170 
just by the way and this is what
transformed<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:28.079> about<00:02:28.260> everything<00:02:28.620> else

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
transformed just about everything else

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.039 
transformed just about everything else
it<00:02:30.180> isn't<00:02:30.900> too<00:02:31.410> buggy<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:33.299> most<00:02:33.540> buggy<00:02:33.810> is

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
it isn't too buggy the the most buggy is

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.080 
it isn't too buggy the the most buggy is
the<00:02:34.680> buggiest<00:02:35.040> thing<00:02:35.400> out<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.579> all<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.849> these

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the buggiest thing out of all of these

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.819 
the buggiest thing out of all of these
might<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.569> rainmeter<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.410> still<00:02:37.680> works

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
might be rainmeter and it still works

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.059 
might be rainmeter and it still works
pretty<00:02:38.099> well<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:39.269> after<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.349> do<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.680> you're

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
pretty well so after you do this you're

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.880 
pretty well so after you do this you're
going<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.220> need<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.430> restart<00:02:41.879> your<00:02:42.000> computer

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
going to need to restart your computer

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.229 
going to need to restart your computer
after<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.370> head<00:02:44.579> back<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:45.030> this

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
after that you can head back to this

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.140 
after that you can head back to this
video<00:02:45.599> once<00:02:46.530> you've<00:02:46.680> done<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.730> might<00:02:47.970> be

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
video once you've done that you might be

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.670 
video once you've done that you might be
