00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
good question actually the first thing

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
good question actually the first thing
that<00:00:39.210> tended<00:00:39.539> to<00:00:39.629> come<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.110> origins<00:00:40.980> that

we realized is that ours was a really

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350 
we realized is that ours was a really
poor<00:00:43.289> way<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:44.309> try<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> communicate<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.180> how

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
poor way to try to communicate just how

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.200 
poor way to try to communicate just how
much<00:00:45.480> stuff<00:00:45.840> was<00:00:46.050> actually<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.500> these<00:00:46.649> games

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
much stuff was actually in these games

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
I think what would be fair to say is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.170 
I think what would be fair to say is
that<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.800> with<00:01:07.980> origins<00:01:08.370> nobody's

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that just like with origins nobody's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.550 
that just like with origins nobody's
going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.450> disappointed<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:10.110> exactly

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
