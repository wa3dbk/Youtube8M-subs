00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
mount right here you got this piece and

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.110 
mount right here you got this piece and
then<00:02:05.380> this<00:02:05.560> piece<00:02:05.830> right<00:02:05.980> here<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.670> there's<00:02:07.060> a

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.020 

so<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.100> can<00:02:22.250> see<00:02:22.400> here<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> good<00:02:24.850> this<00:02:25.850> of

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
so you can see here is a good this of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.520 
so you can see here is a good this of
course<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.450> what<00:02:26.510> goes<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.080> bottom<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
course is what goes to the bottom of the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.590 
course is what goes to the bottom of the
GoPro<00:02:27.860> camera<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.340> got<00:02:31.520> that<00:02:31.730> mount<00:02:32.030> and

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
GoPro camera so you got that mount and

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:41.800 
GoPro camera so you got that mount and
then<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.020> could<00:02:33.230> go<00:02:38.590> let's<00:02:39.590> see<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:41.630> a

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
then this could go let's see just a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.770 
then this could go let's see just a
variety<00:02:42.320> of<00:02:42.350> mounting<00:02:42.740> options<00:02:43.570> which<00:02:44.570> is

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
variety of mounting options which is

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.440 
variety of mounting options which is
really<00:02:44.990> neat<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.890> look<00:02:46.760> forward<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:47.240> putting

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
really neat so I look forward to putting

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.300 
really neat so I look forward to putting
this<00:02:47.720> now<00:02:48.200> see<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:48.590> would<00:02:48.800> probably<00:02:48.980> go

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
this now see this would probably go

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.510 
this now see this would probably go
under<00:02:49.700> my<00:02:50.920> actually<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.070> right<00:02:52.280> here<00:02:52.490> I

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
under my actually this right here I

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.190 
under my actually this right here I
could<00:02:52.760> do<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.090> my<00:02:53.180> handlebars<00:02:53.450> like<00:02:53.900> that

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
could do it on my handlebars like that

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.740 
could do it on my handlebars like that
and<00:02:56.110> then<00:02:57.110> put<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.410> camera<00:02:57.770> on<00:02:57.860> top<00:02:58.570> but<00:02:59.570> I'll

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
and then put the camera on top but I'll

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.920 
and then put the camera on top but I'll
I'll<00:03:00.080> film<00:03:00.470> all<00:03:00.710> of<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:01.010> when<00:03:01.250> i<00:03:01.280> do<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.930> when

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
I'll film all of this when i do the when

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.890 
I'll film all of this when i do the when
I<00:03:02.960> do<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.290> bicycle<00:03:03.830> mounts<00:03:04.540> I'll<00:03:05.540> show<00:03:05.780> you

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
I do the bicycle mounts I'll show you

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.560 
I do the bicycle mounts I'll show you
how<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.440> had<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.800> mounted<00:03:06.950> but<00:03:07.340> as<00:03:07.580> with<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
how I had it mounted but as with the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.270 
how I had it mounted but as with the
GoPro<00:03:08.810> components<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.800> come<00:03:09.980> with<00:03:10.190> the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
GoPro components that come with the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.400 
GoPro components that come with the
camera<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.390> my<00:03:11.510> case<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:11.930> probably<00:03:12.080> seen
