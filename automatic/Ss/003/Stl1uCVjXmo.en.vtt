00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.660
 in alternative we already said 2 both 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.240
 that's not always four take 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.890
 a circuit with serial trial of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.730
 resistors and reactors 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.380
 coils and capacitors we have a source 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.710
 alternative that will debit us a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.239
 current of a frequency of say 50 m 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.100
 if she will the gentleman volta 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.620
 responsible for measuring effective voltages 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.620
 between any two corners of the circuit 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:54.809
 on auzon he finds take volts of 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:58.079
 the hall at and 20 volts from there to there is 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.030
 well from there to there he will not find 50 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.940
 volts that I guarantee you this is not it 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.110
 no sir gold 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.299
 so that's where you have to come 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.159
 sir fresnel inventor and let him 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.080
 benefactor of students studying 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.659
 electric explain us all that with 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.869
 rotating holidays our circuit being 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.759
 a series circuit the intensity exactly 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.420
 the same in value and in phase in all 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.810
 circuit points 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.640
 the kz2 the intensity arrow goes so we 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.130
 to serve as a benchmark is the origin of 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.380
 women as they say at the terminals of the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.009
 resistance we know that the tension is in 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 phase with the intensity at the bands of the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.580
 coil we saw it too the voltage is 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.370
 out of phase by 90 degrees 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.190
 now thirty volts in phase and a 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.670
 volt phase shifted 90 degrees what gives 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.440
 as a result, well, sir freinet 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.500
 tell us just do it simply 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.700
 this is to measure the length of the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:08.330
 new arrow which would make 36 good 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:09.950
 this part is sir fresnel us 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.290
 pointed out that we would arrive at the same 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.230
 result being arrows or taboos 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.360
 like this and this resultant tension 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.390
 at the terminals of the resistance set 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.420
 coils and shifted in advance always 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.670
 but of a new angle designated under the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.890
 pretty name so did it our 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.959
 mathematicians service terremark and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.299
 that it calculates very easily but 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.799
 this is not the moment 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.840
 just know that this angle too 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.420
 play a very important role for 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.790
 power problems but let's continue 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.489
 our celebrations at the ban of a 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.260
 resistance and a capacitor the manip 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.630
 and the same except that of course the attention 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.450
 to the capacitor strips would be 90 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.310
 degrees behind the intensity and the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.989
 resulting tension to the bands of 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.560
 the whole would be late a certain 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.569
 girl angle and the bounds of the set 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.299
 robin capacitors he will find 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.440
 how much sir volta and well he finds 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:09.650
 he finds 0 volts 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.530
 put yourself sir volta 20 volts 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.290
 phase shifted forward of 90 degrees and 20 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.329
 phase-shifted volts back 90 degrees 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.139
 the two arrows put end to end 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.489
 do well 0 see to tell you all we 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.090
 played a trick to our good sir 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.190
 volt 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.560
 we took the particular case where the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.530
 voltages at the terminals of the coil and 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.870
 capacitor was exactly equal but 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.440
 this is not usually the case 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.810
 so the resulting attention is the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.000
 phase shift at the terminals of the set ce 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.530
 calculation thanks to this strong diagram st 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.510
 notice we could have saved 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.730
 sir volta all this hassle of measurement 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.650
 of tension by simply using the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.440
 values ​​of resistance and 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.850
 reactors because let's take our triangle 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.890
 early tensions 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.440
 if I divide the tensions by 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.300
 the effective intensity that is the same 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.090
 in both we do not forget we 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.280
 gets a new triangle similar to 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.340
 first in which in particular 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.890
 long girl herself 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.920
 but we know our formulas the tensions 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.200
 / the intensity is the resistance 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.200
 inductive reactivity is the stop at 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.730
 capacitive tence 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.580
 so we can operate in the same way 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.350
 with the arrows resistance and re waits 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.950
 what sir freinet there too in 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.800
 her bag 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.250
 knowing the values ​​of each 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.050
 element 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.500
 we can predict what will happen in 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.500
 the circuit 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.120
 even if unplugging them which allows 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.520
 our source to go to rest then 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.550
 take out your granite shelves is 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.400
 serious and well this in our circuit 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.620
 alternative series the resistors do 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.670
 do not defend they are added purely 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.520
 and simply 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.550
 and 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.849
 the inductive air of the phases of 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.870
 90 degrees forward the react 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:13.770
 capacitive 90 degrees back so 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:17.310
 she withdraws just measure 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.289
 how many men does the resultant there 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.479
 I stop you sir fresnel it's 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.460
 whatever you measure there it's not 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.129
 only a resistance has not 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.849
 only one answer is a 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:28.849
 impedance 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.599
 I know that's a lot of things in years 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.340
 but in alternative you need what you need 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.900
 and our service mathematicians actually 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.580
 notice that it calculates very 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.509
 easily as in triangles 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.960
 square rectangles of the hypotenuse equals 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:49.030
 a little dense of all so 22.4 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.199
 home and happened in there a current 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.680
 from 1 ampere we would have 22.4 volts at 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.599
 bounds 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.330
 yes sir sir volta can come 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.729
 check but sir volt said he 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.680
 trust us 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:06.330
 besides he does not pass any current 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.330
 since our source went to bed
