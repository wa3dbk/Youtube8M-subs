 from the labyrinth this book I liked a lot 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.800
 very much but in that time like that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.380
 my imagination was a bit stagnant 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.330
 and every time I read it I did not know how 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.250
 were the penitents I did not know how the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.720
 labyrinth they did not know what the area was like 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.369
 where they are that I do not remember the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.770
 same name is a very nice story 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.270
 I enjoyed it very much and they expected me to be 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.030
 someone bringing the next movie 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.310
 to read or the other book I do not know I'm a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.950
 cheat and why not to die is in 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.720
 my position number 9 in the position number 8 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.940

 written by rick riordan I have all the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.069
 Saga has not finished it because I had 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.500
 many things to do this year is the 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.299
 first of the saga and I loved percy 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.519
 jackson has become one of my 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.870
 favorite characters and in this time 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.459
 that I have is going to keep reading all the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.470
 books because seriously it seems very 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.239
 cool really cool because 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.920
 number 6 percy jackson and the thief the 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.049
 lightning 'I still have them in English and I 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.370
 makes it harder to see them why 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.139
 I'm also delaying a little bit 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.849
 with this saga 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.630
 we already enter the first five places 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.450
 and in fifth place 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.940
 Mr. David's daily book 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.700
 levitate 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.280
 as this author pronounces or reads 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.590
 early 2014 is a book that I 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.020
 loved that I loved him I fell in love with that 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.480
 book is already published in Spanish with 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.520
 it is sung but it is not in 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.410
 Latin America that I know I've seen 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.990
 in many channels but from Spain and 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.880
 I hope someday they bring it to 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.460
 colombia because it is a very beautiful book 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.620
 in being very beautiful in the post but 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.450
 when in an estero language because of its interior 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.190
 which is called the advantages of being 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.630
 invisible or in some countries it is 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.520
 known as the advantages of being a 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.680
 marginalized of the Lord of steven your 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.050
 boschism as it preannounces neither 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.450
 without pronouncing his last name this book is 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.700
 magnitude seriously I think that all the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.410
 world they have read it or intends to read or to 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.810
 except that the movie is a very book 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.280
 pretty highly recommended for all 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.440
 ages especially for people 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.269
 Teenage an opportunity if not 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.070
 they've read it because it's really a book 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.200
 it's worth it I've put him number 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.150
 four the advantages of being invisible and 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.760
 we go to hate 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.090
 in position number 3 I have the invention 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.790
 by hugo cabret written by brian 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.490
 It is a book that I loved her book 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.530
 graphic has many many many 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.060
 images as you can see this is a 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.370
 very special book because it is written 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.410
 in text and images begin with 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.210
 images then the text continues the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.770
 story then the images continue 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.750
 and it is a book that although it is 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.699
 you read it in a very short time and do not 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.470
 law like in two hours seriously I know that 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.270
 When this book is great, it will be worth 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.310

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.010
