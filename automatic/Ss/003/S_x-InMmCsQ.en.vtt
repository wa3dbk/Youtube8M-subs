00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello I am in this video let's see the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.780
 Moon stay motorbike 11 with android 4.4 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.780
 point 4 for our galaxy s 4 min 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.439
 this video I'm going to do a little 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.070
 different I will give my opinion about 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.070
 this item in particular 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.740
 and first let's see the version of 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.740
 android 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.990
 here is the version 4 points 4.4 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.980
 and good 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.760
 in summary this room has almost the same 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.500
 that the previous version of android has 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.700
 internal storage of 4 points of 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.700
 2.2 gigas 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.579
 here is this is the image that you take 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.520
 before installing all my applications 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.830
 with this is what comes with 2.2 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.810
 comes from free space there is no 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.270
 problem with the cameras 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.219
 and in the part d 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.539
 in the part of the presentation what is 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:22.700
 or launcher view first 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.200
 printing does not have any change with 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.040
 compared to the previous version of 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.550
 android 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.980
 What I am against some points 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.050
 negative rather than positive 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.760
 for example the battery life 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.930
 this time the battery lasted me 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.950
 almost but good that is but a day with 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.259
 7 hours 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.259
 here is another image of it 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.689
 compared to the previous version that 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:02.100
 I lasted a good day almost two days a 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.659
 day with 12 hours if I remember correctly but 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.420
 good 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.899
 in this aspect do not give any improvement 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.840
 but the opposite otherwise 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.379
 another negative point against you 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.329
 I found was the use of applications 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.980
 note a slight delay in opening the 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.099
 applications is not that everything at the moment 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.459
 to load them as if they did not have internet 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.510
 or it will take a long time to load something that does not 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.510
 it was given in the previous version 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.330
 good otherwise 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.500
 as I said no I had no problem 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.380
 the rest 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.100
 get angry visually no no has 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.220
 changed remained 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.430
 it remained the same can not be moved 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.120
 here this screen that was something new 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.549
 in the previous version but 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.549
 in this case it was kept the same 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.140
 we hope that the developers 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.170
 improve those little flaws that there were in 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.450
 this in this version or good I do not know such 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.250
 time 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.379
 they are taking a little more time 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.000
 they are focusing more on what is android 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.920
 l 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.560
 good is something that we are all also 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.170
 waiting anxiously so the only thing 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.630
 What we have left is to wait so long 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.660
 improve this version like expecting 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.200
 post what is android tele lollipop 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.510

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.450
