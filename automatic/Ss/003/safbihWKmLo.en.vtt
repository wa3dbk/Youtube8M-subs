00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
Today I'm going to show you Maybelline's
new liquid liners which are called hyper glossy

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.620
and I'm going to show you how you can
use these liquid liners in the day on

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.200
dark-skinned girls and turn up the heat
just a little bit for the night

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.600
Hi I'm Pallavi Symons your makeup expert at Glamrs.com.. Pop colors are in for the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.220
spring/summer season and so our liners
Maybelline has cleverly put the two

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.690
together and launched hyper glossy
liquid liners in khaki green, turquoise

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.550
blue and tangerine orange most people
shy away from putting color on

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.510
dark-skinned girls I believe that
there's something very sexy about pop

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.610
colors on darker skin and i'm going to
use tangerine which is a wild orange i'm

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.879
going to show you how you can use these
liquid liners in the day and turn up the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.960
heat just a little bit for the night for
the day look we use a really neon pop

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.219
orange on high I went along with the
shape of the models eye and just picked it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.420
up into a sharp tick on the corners the
result was absolutely fascinating

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.799
because color came alive you could see
it and to pick it up for the night what

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.090
I did was I used a black most people
especially in our country do shy away

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.300
from having that kind of volume of color
so I used a black to pair with the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.620
orange picked up her eyes and she was
ready to go so now I'm going to show you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.280
how you can achieve these looks from day
to night and pick the colors that would

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.220
look great on your skin

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.360
I'm going to demonstrate Maybelline's
hyper glossy liquid liner on Nikita so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.340
I'm going to keep this look very simple
again it's for the day and as you can

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.909
see her colors rich so you don't want to
play around too much and we already

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.110
adding a shot of color so you want to
play down everything else I'm just going

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.040
to do a very simple liner but I am going
to pick up the liner on the sides just a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.979
little bit just dip into the product now
with her I want to decide where to stop

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.080
with the lineup because I don't want her
eyes too winged out so I'm just going

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.750
to do it gentle tick right here and
pick up her eyes because that'll be the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.970
most complimentary shape versus going
out and long and now I'm just going to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.200
simply fill you can already see the
contrast of this color with her skin

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.760
looks stunning

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.880
I'm going to repeat that on the other
eye as well

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.460
I'm going to just now that I have the
shape I'm going to take in it just a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.810
little bit starting from the inside

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.540
I'm just doing the thinnest line over
this

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.610
just gonna tick on the other side as
well a beautiful tangerine gorgeous

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.180
gorgeous orange

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.410
so just try and even them out and that
color looks really really nice on her

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.210
I'm not going to put too much mascara
again because it's a day look

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.590
now the liner is done I've actually
worked with the shape of Nikita's eyes I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.550
think that is perfectly complementary
right now or in terms of color and shape

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.860
so I'm going to just do a little bit of
mascara to shaped eyes a little further

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.920
I'm using Maybelline's colossal volume
Express mascara go as close as you can

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.040
to the root and color in

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.900
so there that's the hyper glossy a
liquid liner from maybelline in

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.579
tangerine and as you can see the colors
really set to a very strong pop of color

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.079
which is why it's wiser to keep the rest
of your face quite bare and clean she's

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.140
ready with the day look but now I'm
going to show you how you can take the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.079
same thing and make it a funkier and go
from day to night Nikita's still wearing

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.310
the look that we had on for the day so
now I'm just going to turn that up into

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.380
a night look a huge runway trend right
now is dual liner so pairing colored

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.199
liner with black or doing two liners all
at once is a huge rage and I'm just

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.190
going to simplify that for you and do it
alongside the liner that I have

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.630
previously drawn for that I'm using
hyper glossy by maybelline in black it's

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.919
a liquid liner I'm going to keep it if
you see really close to the lashes and

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:55.970
luckily the brush of this is very thin
so you can go almost in to the lashes so

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.860
it's creating a dual color

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.509
don't make it too thick it just only needs
to compliment the orange not take away

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.900
from it

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.560
particularly on the thinner part of the
liner you don't want to take away from

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.530
the color so go almost into the lashes
and paint on the skin between the lash

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.190
and the lash line I'm just finishing off
in the corner this is the tricky part so

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.470
make sure you have enough product to
lift

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.530
you

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.440
so that's it now I'm just going to amp
up the mascara give it one more coat and

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.940
not really clamp it too much because I
want the duality of the black and the

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.800
tangerine to come through so again I'm
going back in with the same mascara

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.620
product that I used before the colossal
volume Express from Maybelline

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.740
so there Nikita's done and she's wearing a
look that's really hot off the runways

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.800
and as you can see pairing of color with
black is very demure very edgy very

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.870
fashionable test contrasting meanings
and still has a very soft appeal to it

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.380
that's a trend that would work very well
on Indian women because first of all

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.310
we love our liners secondly if you a
little insecure without a black so

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.170
here's a pairing of a pop color with
black and it's fabulous that Maybelline

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.310
has a great range of just three colors
which is easy to choose from so take

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.460
your pick better the black and you know
that you're the hottest thing walking

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.790
around

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.490
the hyper glossy liquid liner range from
maybelline is a great manage of trend

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.449
and color it's a versatile product and
you can pick the ones that you like for

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.229
your own skin tone
