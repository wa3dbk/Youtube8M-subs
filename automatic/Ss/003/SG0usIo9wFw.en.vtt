but last time now I want to and it's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.620 
but last time now I want to and it's
probably<00:00:20.760> one<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.939> my<00:00:21.029> favorite<00:00:21.330> headsets

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
probably one of my favorite headsets

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.509 
probably one of my favorite headsets
that<00:00:21.720> I've<00:00:21.869> ever<00:00:22.109> had<00:00:22.350> or<00:00:22.830> maybe<00:00:23.130> my<00:00:23.369> favorite

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
that I've ever had or maybe my favorite

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.670 
that I've ever had or maybe my favorite
I'm<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:23.939> quite<00:00:24.119> sure<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:25.050> lot<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.410> people

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
I'm not quite sure but a lot of people

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.580 
I'm not quite sure but a lot of people
don't<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.550> 5.1<00:00:27.480> surround<00:00:27.900> they're<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.470> oh

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
don't like 5.1 surround they're like oh

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.679 
don't like 5.1 surround they're like oh
why's<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.949> at<00:00:29.039> 7.1<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.060> kind<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> find<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
why's it at 7.1 and I kind of find it to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.179 
why's it at 7.1 and I kind of find it to
be<00:00:30.720> pretty<00:00:31.080> arbitrary<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.949> number

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
be pretty arbitrary of a number

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.860 
be pretty arbitrary of a number
especially<00:00:32.489> because<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> lot<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> programs<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
especially because a lot of programs and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.180 
especially because a lot of programs and
a<00:00:33.899> lot<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.050> things<00:00:34.170> don't<00:00:34.380> actually<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
a lot of things don't actually use the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.130 
a lot of things don't actually use the
7.1<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.910> when<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.899> don't<00:00:36.989> know

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
7.1 and when they do if you don't know

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.720 
7.1 and when they do if you don't know
how<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.290> set<00:00:37.500> up<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> headset<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.460> as

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
how to set up the headset it's not as

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.180 
how to set up the headset it's not as
good<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.140> should<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.160> of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
good as it should be so it's kind of

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.709 
good as it should be so it's kind of
complicated<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> same<00:00:42.239> time<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
complicated and at the same time the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.750 
complicated and at the same time the
difference<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.140> I've<00:00:43.410> heard<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.399> isn't

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
difference that I've heard it isn't

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.369 
difference that I've heard it isn't
really<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.270> great<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.289> big

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
really that great so it's not that big

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.869 
really that great so it's not that big
of<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.530> deal<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.680> me<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.250> want<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.670> show<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
drawback to it in my opinion and this is

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.500 
drawback to it in my opinion and this is
gonna<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.129> my<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.399> review<00:00:53.789> before<00:00:54.120> i<00:00:54.149> unbox

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
gonna be my little review before i unbox

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
gonna be my little review before i unbox
it<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> i'll<00:00:54.870> let<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> hear<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.289> mic<00:00:55.559> but

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
it and i'll let you hear the mic but

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.010

anyway<00:00:56.460> um<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.360> only<00:00:57.510> reason<00:00:57.660> i<00:00:57.780> don't<00:00:57.840> like

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
anyway um the only reason i don't like

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.479 
anyway um the only reason i don't like
this<00:00:58.170> because<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> little<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:58.949> bulky

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this because it's a little bit bulky

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
this because it's a little bit bulky
it's<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.239> bulky<00:01:00.539> side<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.199> has<00:01:01.320> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it's on the bulky side and it has this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.080 
it's on the bulky side and it has this
this<00:01:01.829> big<00:01:02.039> ass<00:01:02.190> thing<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.579> where<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
this big ass thing right here where that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.939

thing sitting on the desk is it's in the
way<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.340> don't<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:11.760> necessarily

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
way and I don't it's not necessarily

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.810 
way and I don't it's not necessarily
useful<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.710> me<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.490> need<00:01:14.700> it

useful to me so I don't really need it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.550 
useful to me so I don't really need it
that<00:01:14.939> much<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.270> um<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:16.020> has<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> lot<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.350> cool

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
when you push up the mic and you get up

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.209 
when you push up the mic and you get up
to<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.079> certain<00:02:16.260> point<00:02:16.379> it<00:02:16.590> clicks<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.099> then

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.689 
the sound I feel like it isn't amazing
when<00:05:44.080> I<00:05:44.110> scream<00:05:44.500> or<00:05:44.740> when<00:05:44.860> I<00:05:44.889> yell<00:05:45.130> in<00:05:45.430> gameplay

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
when I scream or when I yell in gameplay

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.820 
when I scream or when I yell in gameplay
as<00:05:46.389> much<00:05:46.630> as<00:05:46.779> maybe<00:05:46.930> other<00:05:47.139> ones<00:05:47.349> but<00:05:47.469> I<00:05:47.620> think

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
as much as maybe other ones but I think

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.620 
as much as maybe other ones but I think
it's<00:05:47.949> pretty<00:05:48.250> quality<00:05:48.729> of<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.180> headset<00:05:49.449> mic

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
it's pretty quality of a headset mic

it's pretty quality of a headset mic
other<00:05:50.080> than<00:05:50.199> that<00:05:50.289> like<00:05:50.500> I<00:05:50.620> said<00:05:50.830> it<00:05:50.979> looks

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
other than that like I said it looks

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.430
