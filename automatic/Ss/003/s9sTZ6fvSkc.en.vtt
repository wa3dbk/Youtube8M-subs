00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.130 

as<00:01:10.329> roadies<00:01:11.329> you<00:01:11.479> need<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.719> look<00:01:11.810> out<00:01:11.960> for

people that are below you so in this

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.289 
people that are below you so in this

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
situation I would suggest not forcing

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.789 
situation I would suggest not forcing
your<00:01:17.420> way<00:01:17.509> through<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.020> many<00:01:18.049> cyclists<00:01:18.679> do

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
your way through it so many cyclists do

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.020 
your way through it so many cyclists do
through<00:01:19.069> these<00:01:19.219> crossing<00:01:19.520> pedestrians

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030

there's<00:01:20.240> no<00:01:20.569> pedestrian<00:01:21.109> light<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:21.469> they<00:01:21.590> can

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
there's no pedestrian light so they can

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.219 
there's no pedestrian light so they can
cross<00:01:21.950> whenever<00:01:22.280> it's<00:01:22.490> free<00:01:22.789> as<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.899> see<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:24.079> do

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
I just wait for the space to come up and

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.929 
I just wait for the space to come up and
then<00:01:26.479> take<00:01:26.689> it
