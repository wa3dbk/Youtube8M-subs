00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.100
 actually it's a cargo 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.440
 Spanish as bulk carrier that is obvious 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.010
 since the risks of pollution are 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.260
 fuel- related propulsions 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.270
 that is to say, 130 thousand 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.039
 liters of diesel that could be 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.199
 dump on on the beach this varies which 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.109
 are not worth electric has led to that the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.679
 boat can no longer be governable and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.730
 given the conditions 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.170
 weather it was extremely 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.450
 difficult to maneuver 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.280
 so precisely you say with 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.219
 such weather conditions and is it normal 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 that this ship are at sea yes the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.000
 ships are at sea ​​of ​​course 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.700
 whatever the weather 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.539
 you just have to look at what 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.510
 conditions close to duport d'anglet 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.440
 could have been operated but what I 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.620
 want to report 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.109
 made to the utmost speed and quality 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.920
 intervention of the cross etel who 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.420
 supervise the rescue measures 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.150
 team hoist al all 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.750
 nobody is also setting up 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.070
 extremely fast measures of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.229
 prevention and especially the polmar plan 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.939
 so that's precisely the question that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.860
 on which we wanted to linger 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.390
 plan polmar earth was triggered 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.970
 precautionary measure or already signs 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.080
 of pollution precautionary measure I 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.570
 go on the spot at the request of the first 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.020
 minister to make sure 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.200
 the palm organization particularly hailed 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.759
 mobilized teams and make sure 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.070
 conditions of protection against 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.400
 possible risks of pollution is 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.680
 also measure how much is that 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.270
 the state could intervene to help in 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:53.909
 moving this boat and at the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:56.969
 depollution of the primaries and so we 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.229
 are with the mobilization of everything from 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.790
 all the administrations he 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.409
 it is the administration of the sea 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.100
 what is the one we pay for 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.630
 gendarmerie by trips the state and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.369
 all the operations under 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.560
 command of eta for now 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.569
 are a priori rather optimistic about 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.010
 risks of large-scale pollution 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.860
 would be 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.599
 i t it's not about an oil tanker 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.970
 of a bulk carrier so who was targeted by 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.340
 elsewhere and so the only pollution that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.590
 can intervene and pollution related to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.200
 fuel contained in the tanks of 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.590
 propulsion fuel of the ship so 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.590
 limited even if it is located is 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.890
 a cargo of fuel supply 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.700
 which was valued at nearly 130 thousand 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.120
 liters 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.260
 so the opus must look at what 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.170
 are the effects in the hours that 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.140
 come from the fuel spill on 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.720
 on the beach and at sea do you 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.349
 have news of the crew of his 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.010
 health 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.859
 yes the crew has been deployed I have not 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.340
 no health problems there was a 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.090
 minor accident tells me on and on 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.920
 reactivity 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.230
 the gestures would have been gestures of 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.849
 of efficiency there is no nya no 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.010
 drama to lament it could have been 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.760
 especially given the strength of the lot 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.370
 and waves 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.090
 that's not the case and the rescue is 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.090
 done in the best conditions
