00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
but installing it is the same procedure

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.669 
but installing it is the same procedure
except<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:09.179> OEM<00:00:09.570> shift<00:00:09.900> knob<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.500> have

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
except the OEM shift knob you just have

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.620 
except the OEM shift knob you just have
to<00:00:11.360> pull<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.570> off<00:00:12.780> instead<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:14.389> unscrewing<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
to pull it off instead of unscrewing the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.070 
to pull it off instead of unscrewing the
little<00:00:15.900> set<00:00:16.529> screw<00:00:16.560> that's<00:00:17.630> right<00:00:18.630> behind

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
little set screw that's right behind

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
screw right there with actually the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.480 
screw right there with actually the
provided<00:02:28.470> allen<00:02:29.340> key<00:02:29.790> from<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.780> see

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
provided allen key from you you see

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.190 
provided allen key from you you see
instead<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:33.209> thing<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.720> don't<00:02:33.780> even<00:02:34.020> know

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
instead of this thing I don't even know

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.370 
instead of this thing I don't even know
what<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:35.780> can't<00:02:36.780> really<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.230> with

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
what it is I can't really do this with

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.500 
what it is I can't really do this with
one<00:02:37.560> hand<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.010> I'm<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.459> going<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.610> continue

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.180 

well<00:02:42.510> maybe<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.110> try<00:02:43.350> if<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.800> used<00:02:44.040> this

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
well maybe I can try if I get used this

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.620 
well maybe I can try if I get used this
one<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:44.459> more<00:02:44.850> leverage<00:02:45.410> yeah<00:02:46.410> there<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.770> go

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
one for more leverage yeah there you go

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.360 
one for more leverage yeah there you go
you<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.810> just<00:02:48.840> unscrew<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.590> set<00:02:50.130> screw

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
you can just unscrew that set screw

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.720 
you can just unscrew that set screw
hopefully<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.360> can<00:02:51.480> get<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.900> out<00:02:52.730> without

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
hopefully I can get it out without

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.870 
hopefully I can get it out without
pulling<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.660> out<00:02:54.780> too<00:02:54.959> far<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.350> losing<00:02:55.739> that

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
it back together thankfully I'm pretty

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.660

sure<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.769> put<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:22.980> back<00:03:23.130> together<00:03:23.310> without

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
sure I can put it back together without

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.970 
sure I can put it back together without
the<00:03:23.940> shift<00:03:24.239> knob<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.530> can<00:03:25.680> put<00:03:25.829> that<00:03:25.920> on

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
the shift knob so I can put that on

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.160 
the shift knob so I can put that on
later<00:03:26.340> but<00:03:26.610> all<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:27.060> goes<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.660> crevice

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
later but all this goes in this crevice

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.520 
later but all this goes in this crevice
over<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:32.160> mainly<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.209> need<00:03:33.329> to

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
over here so mainly I just need to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.610 
over here so mainly I just need to
reconnect<00:03:34.530> one<00:03:34.799> harness<00:03:35.190> wire<00:03:36.440> all<00:03:37.440> right

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
reconnect one harness wire all right

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.940 
reconnect one harness wire all right
here<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.130> all<00:03:38.280> snapped<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:39.530> it's<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.739> doozy

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
here it is all snapped in it's a doozy

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.390 
here it is all snapped in it's a doozy
there<00:03:41.430> pretty<00:03:41.700> tight<00:03:43.400> but<00:03:44.400> definitely<00:03:44.910> easy<00:03:45.180> I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
there pretty tight but definitely easy I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.539 
there pretty tight but definitely easy I
found<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.489> after<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:48.739> got<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.860> lined<00:03:50.130> up<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.519> a

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
found that after I got it lined up and a

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.180 
found that after I got it lined up and a
little<00:03:50.700> bit<00:03:50.820> in<00:03:50.970> here<00:03:51.350> both<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.560> these<00:03:52.709> ends

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
little bit in here both of these ends

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.840 
little bit in here both of these ends
the<00:03:53.640> passenger<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.630> driver<00:03:55.310> ends<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.519> or

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
the passenger and driver ends of it or

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.699 
the passenger and driver ends of it or
not<00:03:57.510> snapped<00:03:57.930> in<00:03:58.140> all<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.350> way<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.650> just

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
not snapped in all the way so I just

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.229 
not snapped in all the way so I just
pushed<00:03:59.130> hard<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.730> it<00:04:00.390> snapped<00:04:00.630> right<00:04:00.840> back<00:04:01.079> in

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
pushed hard and it snapped right back in

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.670 
pushed hard and it snapped right back in
okay<00:04:03.239> I'm<00:04:03.420> going<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.660> put<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.870> boot<00:04:04.140> back<00:04:04.410> on

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
okay I'm going to put the boot back on

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.130 
okay I'm going to put the boot back on
there's<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.090> obviously<00:04:06.420> see<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.930> way<00:04:07.079> it

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
there's you can obviously see the way it

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.199 
there's you can obviously see the way it
goes<00:04:07.610> there<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> wide<00:04:09.269> end<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:11.030> just<00:04:12.030> put

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
goes there is a wide end and just put

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.710 
goes there is a wide end and just put
the<00:04:12.329> boot<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.750> right<00:04:13.079> there<00:04:14.269> widen<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.390> snap

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
the boot on right there widen and snap

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.770 
the boot on right there widen and snap
it<00:04:15.930> in<00:04:16.880> hopefully<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:18.150> can<00:04:18.239> do<00:04:18.419> this<00:04:18.539> with<00:04:18.750> one
