then<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> bushings<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.720> front

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
then you have the bushings for the front

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.359 
then you have the bushings for the front
and<00:01:52.890> they're<00:01:53.820> thinner<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.079> identified<00:01:56.040> by

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and they're thinner and identified by

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.719 
and they're thinner and identified by
one<00:01:56.700> dot<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.930> side<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.759> have<00:01:59.759> two<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> those

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
one dot on the side I have two of those

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.010 
one dot on the side I have two of those
and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> rear<00:02:03.360> ones<00:02:03.600> too<00:02:04.350> again<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:06.020> bit

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and then the rear ones too again the bit

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.229 
and then the rear ones too again the bit
different<00:02:07.409> shape<00:02:07.550> for<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.729> thicker<00:02:08.970> barrel

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
different shape for the thicker barrel

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.950 
different shape for the thicker barrel
and<00:02:09.599> they're<00:02:09.869> identified<00:02:10.410> by<00:02:10.649> two<00:02:10.709> dots

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
and they're identified by two dots

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.430 
and they're identified by two dots
they<00:02:13.740> fit<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.970> rearward<00:02:15.300> rear<00:02:15.990> part<00:02:16.350> of

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
they fit on the rearward rear part of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.150 
they fit on the rearward rear part of
the<00:02:17.030> barrel

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
the barrel

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.890 
the barrel
okay<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.300> consider<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.420> little<00:02:21.630> bit<00:02:21.750> how

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
okay so consider you a little bit how

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.700 
okay so consider you a little bit how
this<00:02:22.430> goes<00:02:23.430> together<00:02:25.520> gonna<00:02:26.520> have<00:02:27.710> front

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
this goes together gonna have front

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.820 
this goes together gonna have front
bushing<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:30.330> way<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.660> here<00:02:31.730> like<00:02:32.730> so

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.640 

so<00:02:37.830> it's<00:02:38.400> got<00:02:38.670> these<00:02:39.600> ridges<00:02:40.020> on<00:02:40.200> top<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:42.650> fits

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
so it's got these ridges on top so fits

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.930 
so it's got these ridges on top so fits
right<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:44.630> just<00:02:45.630> like<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:47.370> then

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
right in there just like that and then

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.100 
right in there just like that and then
the<00:02:48.750> other<00:02:48.960> piece<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:50.480> go<00:02:51.480> right<00:02:52.080> on

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
the other piece is going to go right on

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:03.680 
the other piece is going to go right on
top<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:57.560> like<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.390> and<00:03:00.390> then<00:03:00.810> your<00:03:02.690> top

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
top of that like so and then your top

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.120 
top of that like so and then your top
clamp<00:03:04.460> so<00:03:05.460> do<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.730> top<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.800> and<00:03:07.800> so

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
clamp so do the top of that and so

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.550 
clamp so do the top of that and so
what's<00:03:08.670> gonna<00:03:09.470> happen<00:03:10.470> as<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.190> assembled

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
what's gonna happen as this is assembled

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.990 
what's gonna happen as this is assembled
this<00:03:16.910> replacement<00:03:17.910> gas<00:03:18.390> tube<00:03:20.000> will

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
this replacement gas tube will

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.920 
this replacement gas tube will
eventually<00:03:21.930> set<00:03:24.920> in<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.280> slot<00:03:26.550> like<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:27.090> as

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
eventually set in that slot like that as

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.730 
eventually set in that slot like that as
you<00:03:28.770> put<00:03:29.490> this<00:03:29.700> system<00:03:29.940> together<00:03:30.560> that's<00:03:31.560> what

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
you put this system together that's what

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.500 
you put this system together that's what
holds<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.250> in<00:03:32.460> place<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.060> it's<00:03:33.210> gonna<00:03:33.330> be

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
holds it in place and it's gonna be

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.630 
holds it in place and it's gonna be
about<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.780> half-inch<00:03:35.540> space<00:03:36.950> in<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.280> front<00:03:38.460> of
