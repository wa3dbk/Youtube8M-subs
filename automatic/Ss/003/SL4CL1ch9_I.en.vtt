00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
get some of the marinade into the pocket

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.859 
get some of the marinade into the pocket
as<00:01:03.629> well<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.299> there's<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.510> one

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
as well like that and there's a one

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.990 
as well like that and there's a one
further<00:01:07.170> step<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> piece

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
further step I'm going to take a piece

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.179 
further step I'm going to take a piece
of<00:01:09.180> cling<00:01:09.420> film<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> would<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
of cling film that's what I would do and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.609 
of cling film that's what I would do and
cover<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:11.909> tightly<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:13.260> leave<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
cover it very tightly and then leave it

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.160 
cover it very tightly and then leave it
to<00:01:13.950> marinate<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.939> 24<00:01:15.600> hours<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to marinate for 24 hours in the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.810 
to marinate for 24 hours in the
refrigerator<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:17.040> very<00:01:17.310> important

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
refrigerator that's very important

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.969 
refrigerator that's very important
because<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.270> way<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.020> marinade<00:01:19.500> goes<00:01:19.740> all

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
because this way the marinade goes all

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.429 
because this way the marinade goes all
the<00:01:20.040> way<00:01:20.310> inside<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.240> lamb<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> affects<00:01:22.200> all

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the way inside the lamb and affects all

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.510 
the way inside the lamb and affects all
the<00:01:22.740> taste<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> lamb<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.650> leg

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the taste of the lamb I have here a leg

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.109 
the taste of the lamb I have here a leg
