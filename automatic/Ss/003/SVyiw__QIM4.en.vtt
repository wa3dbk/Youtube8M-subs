about<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.890> don't<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:08.130> two<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.850> half<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
about I don't know two and a half to

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.930 
about I don't know two and a half to
three<00:02:10.110> inches<00:02:12.110> squared<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.490> can<00:02:14.670> find

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
three inches squared so you can find

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.949 
three inches squared so you can find
whatever<00:02:15.230> little<00:02:16.230> pen<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.720> have<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
thickness that you want and then I'm

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.460 
thickness that you want and then I'm
going<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.160> go<00:02:23.280> ahead<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.920> view<00:02:25.920> my<00:02:26.370> mixture

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
going to go ahead and view my mixture

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.070 
going to go ahead and view my mixture
right<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.430> little<00:02:32.550> bit<00:02:32.790> sticky<00:02:33.180> but

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
right in it's a little bit sticky but

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.479 
right in it's a little bit sticky but
after<00:02:34.440> we<00:02:34.530> chill<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.069> it's<00:02:35.550> going<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.330> firm<00:02:36.900> up

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
after we chill it it's going to firm up

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.930 
after we chill it it's going to firm up
nicely<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.650> important<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.370> kind<00:02:41.820> of

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
nicely so it is important to kind of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.250 
nicely so it is important to kind of
keep<00:02:42.209> mixing<00:02:43.080> until<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:45.420> mixture<00:02:45.780> becomes

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
keep mixing until the mixture becomes

keep mixing until the mixture becomes
quite<00:02:47.120> firm<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.390> little<00:02:48.600> bit<00:02:48.720> stiff<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:50.220> once

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
quite firm a little bit stiff and once

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.860 
quite firm a little bit stiff and once
your<00:02:52.350> mixture<00:02:52.590> has<00:02:53.010> been<00:02:53.190> pressed<00:02:53.630> slip<00:02:54.630> this

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
your mixture has been pressed slip this

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.229 
your mixture has been pressed slip this
into<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.620> freezer<00:02:55.980> or<00:02:56.430> into<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.940> fridge

into the freezer or into the fridge

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.930 
into the freezer or into the fridge
until<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:58.230> firm<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.860> if<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.040> want<00:02:59.370> the
