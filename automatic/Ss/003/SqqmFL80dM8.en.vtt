00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.559 
if fishes used to divide the natural
community<00:02:17.489> it's<00:02:17.819> like<00:02:18.120> no<00:02:18.660> point<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.880> also

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
community it's like no point and I also

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.750 
community it's like no point and I also
think<00:02:21.780> they<00:02:21.959> shouldn't<00:02:22.319> be<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:22.860> -<00:02:23.580> it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
think they shouldn't be like - it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.780 
think they shouldn't be like - it
shouldn't<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> war<00:02:24.510> between<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.980> relaxed

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
shouldn't be a war between the relaxed

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.030 
shouldn't be a war between the relaxed
and<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.000> naturals<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.260> should<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.770> be

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and the naturals like it should just be

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.670 
and the naturals like it should just be
about<00:02:29.360> healthy<00:02:30.360> hair<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.930> want<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.650> a
