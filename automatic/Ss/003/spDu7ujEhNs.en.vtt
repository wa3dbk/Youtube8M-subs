00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.389 

I've<00:00:01.110> been<00:00:01.319> playing<00:00:01.740> around<00:00:01.829> with<00:00:02.100> making

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
I've been playing around with making

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.090 
I've been playing around with making
just<00:00:02.970> for<00:00:03.120> fun<00:00:03.360> really<00:00:03.540> I'm<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:04.290> copper<00:00:04.740> wire

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
just for fun really I'm a copper wire

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.299 
just for fun really I'm a copper wire
fairly<00:00:05.609> stiff<00:00:05.930> copper<00:00:06.930> wire<00:00:07.170> based<00:00:07.470> LED<00:00:08.069> tree

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
fairly stiff copper wire based LED tree

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.610 
fairly stiff copper wire based LED tree
and<00:00:09.320> the<00:00:10.320> copper<00:00:10.800> wire<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.309> stripped<00:00:11.700> out<00:00:11.910> of

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
and the copper wire is stripped out of

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.709 
and the copper wire is stripped out of
household<00:00:13.620> wiring<00:00:14.219> kay<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.969> notice<00:00:15.210> standard

household wiring kay you notice standard
house<00:00:16.350> wiring<00:00:16.650> cable<00:00:17.630> and<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.350> end<00:00:19.439> result

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
house wiring cable and the end result

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.140 
house wiring cable and the end result
it's<00:00:21.420> using<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.460> copper<00:00:23.460> structure<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
it's using the copper structure of the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.929 
it's using the copper structure of the
tree<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:25.230> negative<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.920> then<00:00:26.039> each<00:00:26.310> LED

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
tree as the negative and then each LED

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.029 
tree as the negative and then each LED
has<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.210> individual<00:00:27.960> wire<00:00:28.170> coming<00:00:28.590> from<00:00:28.890> it

has a individual wire coming from it

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.189 
has a individual wire coming from it
down<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> base<00:00:29.609> where<00:00:29.849> those<00:00:30.060> are<00:00:30.210> 220<00:00:31.109> ohm

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
down to the base where those are 220 ohm

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.110 
down to the base where those are 220 ohm
resistor<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.460> running<00:00:32.700> off<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.910> five

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120

volt supply and if I turn this off

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.100 
volt supply and if I turn this off
you'll<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:36.540> quite<00:00:36.960> nice

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
you'll see that it's actually quite nice

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.369 
you'll see that it's actually quite nice
it's<00:00:37.440> very<00:00:37.620> three-dimensional

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
it's very three-dimensional

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.959 
it's very three-dimensional
that's<00:00:40.379> quite<00:00:40.680> pleasing<00:00:41.010> actually<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:42.770> and

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
that's quite pleasing actually and and

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.119 
that's quite pleasing actually and and
asmath<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.180> lot<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.600> these<00:00:45.660> things<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.230> actually

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
asmath a lot of these things I actually

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.400 
asmath a lot of these things I actually
have<00:00:47.520> made<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.030> LEDs<00:00:48.539> pluggable<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.230> can

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
have made that LEDs pluggable so you can

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
have made that LEDs pluggable so you can
plug<00:00:49.739> them<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.789> put<00:00:51.120> different

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
plug them in and out and put different

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
plug them in and out and put different
colors<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.809> if<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> wish<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.800> fact

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
colors in if you wish and the fact

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.439 
colors in if you wish and the fact
there's<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.219> different<00:00:53.489> resistor<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.090> each

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
there's a different resistor for each

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.240 
there's a different resistor for each
LED<00:00:55.050> means<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:56.039> as<00:00:56.129> many

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
LED means that you can have as many

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.119 
LED means that you can have as many
colors<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.710> almost

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
colors as you want in here the almost

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.150 
colors as you want in here the almost
downside<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.989> mate<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> if

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
downside to this is I think a mate of if

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.590 
downside to this is I think a mate of if
I<00:01:02.340> made<00:01:02.730> another<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.390> might

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
I made another one of these I might

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
I made another one of these I might
twist<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> wire<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> wee<00:01:04.619> bit<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:04.799> around<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
twist the wire a wee bit more around the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.210 
twist the wire a wee bit more around the
body<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> tree<00:01:07.110> because<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> wee<00:01:08.189> bit

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
body of the tree because it's a wee bit

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.649 
body of the tree because it's a wee bit
sort<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> loose<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.939> fluffy<00:01:09.270> looking<00:01:09.479> but

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
sort of loose and fluffy looking but

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.090 
sort of loose and fluffy looking but
said<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.530> too<00:01:10.710> bad<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:12.030> the

connections in the end I've actually

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.200 
connections in the end I've actually
lately<00:01:16.350> crimped<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.549> using<00:01:17.880> much

just<00:01:19.560> gently<00:01:19.860> pinched<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.409> molex<00:01:22.409> tel

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
just gently pinched the molex tel

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.410 
just gently pinched the molex tel
terminals<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.640> soldered<00:01:24.119> them<00:01:24.240> I

terminals on and then soldered them I
didn't<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.380> can't<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.830> crimp<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.460> wire

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
didn't you can't really crimp a wire

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.310 
didn't you can't really crimp a wire
this<00:01:26.880> size<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:27.509> these<00:01:27.630> terminals<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.200> the

this size into these terminals but the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560 
this size into these terminals but the
standard<00:01:28.740> crimping<00:01:29.100> tool<00:01:29.280> because<00:01:29.640> there's<00:01:30.329> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
standard crimping tool because there's a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.749 
standard crimping tool because there's a
risk<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.990> may<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.610> damage<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
risk that you may actually damage the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
risk that you may actually damage the
tool<00:01:32.939> having<00:01:33.420> said<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.990> he<00:01:34.079> was<00:01:34.229> quite

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
tool having said that it's he was quite

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.580 
tool having said that it's he was quite
robust<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.610> seems<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.780> displace<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
robust and it seems so just displace the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
robust and it seems so just displace the
copper<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.070> I'm<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.700> recommend<00:01:39.060> doing

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
copper but I'm not gonna recommend doing

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:39.940 
copper but I'm not gonna recommend doing
that

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.760 
that
it's<00:01:40.950> hence<00:01:41.189> why<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.970> gently<00:01:42.720> crimp<00:01:43.619> them

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
it's hence why I just gently crimp them

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
it's hence why I just gently crimp them
on<00:01:43.860> lately<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:44.460> sort<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.909> them<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.689> make

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
on lately and then sort of them to make

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.200 
on lately and then sort of them to make
the<00:01:46.020> good<00:01:46.619> solid<00:01:46.979> connection<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.939> I've<00:01:48.119> been

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the good solid connection and I've been

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.639 
the good solid connection and I've been
experimenting<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:48.899> different<00:01:48.990> ways<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
experimenting with different ways to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.660 
experimenting with different ways to
make<00:01:50.250> these<00:01:50.520> em<00:01:51.439> initially<00:01:52.439> I've<00:01:52.740> got<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.340> long

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670

bit<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.000> wire<00:01:54.180> well<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> long<00:01:54.899> barrel<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
bit of wire well not a long barrel a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.830 
bit of wire well not a long barrel a
modest<00:01:55.890> length<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> wire<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:57.240> set

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
modest length of wire and then set

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.289 
modest length of wire and then set
another<00:01:57.960> bit<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.649> an<00:01:59.399> angle<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.880> solder<00:02:00.180> them

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
another bit of an angle and solder them

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.600 
another bit of an angle and solder them
together<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.990> latterly<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> thought<00:02:02.399> well<00:02:02.579> I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
together and latterly I thought well I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.480 
together and latterly I thought well I
can<00:02:02.820> get<00:02:02.969> more<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.899> light<00:02:04.770> points<00:02:05.250> from<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
can get more and light points from the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.789 
can get more and light points from the
same<00:02:05.520> branch<00:02:06.000> by<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.570> putting<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.530> wire

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
same branch by just putting this wire

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.499 
same branch by just putting this wire
across<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.489> sort<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.940> cross<00:02:09.209> shape

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
across in a sort of like a cross shape

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.630 
across in a sort of like a cross shape
and<00:02:09.720> soldier<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.770> middle<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.310> saves

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and soldier in the middle and that saves

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.330 
and soldier in the middle and that saves
the<00:02:12.030> number<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.330> solder<00:02:12.569> connections<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
the number of solder connections and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.040 
the number of solder connections and
now<00:02:13.610> I'm<00:02:13.730> thinking<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:14.209> could<00:02:14.270> make<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.840> even

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
now I'm thinking I could make it even

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.150 
now I'm thinking I could make it even
easier<00:02:15.220> if<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.430> was<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.580> take<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:18.020> one<00:02:18.260> no<00:02:18.530> this

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
easier if I was to take this one no this

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.790 
easier if I was to take this one no this
middle<00:02:20.120> core<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.599> actually<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:21.050> thicker<00:02:21.349> cable

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
middle core is actually a thicker cable

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.089 
middle core is actually a thicker cable
it's<00:02:22.780> 2.5<00:02:23.780> ml<00:02:24.020> cross<00:02:24.230> sectional<00:02:24.680> area<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.890> think

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
it's 2.5 ml cross sectional area I think

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.510 
it's 2.5 ml cross sectional area I think
and<00:02:25.310> these<00:02:25.880> are<00:02:26.150> probably<00:02:26.420> 1.5<00:02:27.349> mil<00:02:27.680> 1<00:02:28.010> or<00:02:28.340> 1.5

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
and these are probably 1.5 mil 1 or 1.5

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.580 
and these are probably 1.5 mil 1 or 1.5
minus<00:02:29.450> 1.5<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.730> am<00:02:31.880> user<00:02:32.260> typically<00:02:33.260> how<00:02:33.470> I've

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
minus 1.5 so am user typically how I've

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.160 
minus 1.5 so am user typically how I've
been<00:02:33.739> sorting<00:02:34.160> them<00:02:34.280> together<00:02:34.959> I've<00:02:35.959> been

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
been sorting them together I've been

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.240 
been sorting them together I've been
telling<00:02:36.650> them<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.769> middle<00:02:40.010> where<00:02:40.160> I'm

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
telling them in the middle where I'm

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.630 
telling them in the middle where I'm
gonna<00:02:40.370> touch<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.849> sort<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:43.430> I've<00:02:43.489> just

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
gonna touch this sort of so I've just

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.550 
gonna touch this sort of so I've just
been<00:02:43.790> putting<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.420> blob<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.080> salt<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
been putting a blob of salt in the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.990 
been putting a blob of salt in the
middle<00:02:45.739> he's<00:02:45.890> just<00:02:46.310> doing<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.610> straight<00:02:46.940> in

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
middle he's just doing it straight in

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.660 
middle he's just doing it straight in
the<00:02:47.060> workbench<00:02:47.360> here<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.049> know<00:02:48.340> I'm<00:02:49.340> sure

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
the workbench here is you know I'm sure

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.890 
the workbench here is you know I'm sure
it's<00:02:49.819> gonna<00:02:49.940> see<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.209> lot<00:02:50.360> more<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.600> this<00:02:50.720> in<00:02:50.870> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
it's gonna see a lot more of this in the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.020 
it's gonna see a lot more of this in the
future<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.769> if<00:02:52.549> I<00:02:52.989> do<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.110> one<00:02:54.350> yeah<00:02:55.030> flow

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
future and if I do this one yeah flow

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.080 
future and if I do this one yeah flow
some<00:02:56.239> Sauron<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.900> at<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.010> opposite<00:02:58.280> end<00:03:01.090> plus

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
some Sauron and at the opposite end plus

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:15.610 
some Sauron and at the opposite end plus
also<00:03:02.480> in<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.959> middle<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.709> then<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:15.470> is

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
also in the middle and then this is

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.900 
also in the middle and then this is
where<00:03:15.830> these<00:03:15.980> wires<00:03:16.160> get<00:03:16.430> very<00:03:16.700> hot<00:03:16.880> very

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
where these wires get very hot very

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.020 
where these wires get very hot very
quickly<00:03:17.390> then<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.690> reflow<00:03:18.730> both<00:03:19.730> of<00:03:19.940> them

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
quickly then I reflow both of them

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.780 
quickly then I reflow both of them
together<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.600> form<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.989> sort<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.260> them<00:03:21.790> across

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
together to form a sort of them across

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.530 
together to form a sort of them across
oh<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.519> letter<00:03:25.790> actually<00:03:26.030> cool<00:03:26.510> down

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
oh and I letter actually cool down

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.530 
oh and I letter actually cool down
before<00:03:27.019> actually<00:03:27.739> pumping<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:34.390> noting<00:03:35.390> that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
before actually pumping it noting that

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.270 
before actually pumping it noting that
these<00:03:35.720> wires<00:03:35.959> get<00:03:36.200> very<00:03:36.380> hot<00:03:36.590> wire<00:03:36.799> solder

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
these wires get very hot wire solder

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.500 
these wires get very hot wire solder
them<00:03:37.400> because<00:03:37.609> copper<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.150> very<00:03:38.359> good

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
them because copper is a very good

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.720 
them because copper is a very good
conductor<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:38.989> heat<00:03:42.100> now<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.160> idea<00:03:43.489> was<00:03:43.700> that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
conductor of heat now the idea was that

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.170 
conductor of heat now the idea was that
I<00:03:44.030> could<00:03:44.269> then<00:03:44.859> just<00:03:45.859> add<00:03:46.160> another<00:03:46.489> bit<00:03:46.970> on

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
I could then just add another bit on

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:56.340 
I could then just add another bit on
here

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:04.180 

see<00:03:57.350> how<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:57.890> is<00:03:58.040> gonna<00:03:58.220> be<00:03:59.140> and<00:04:00.140> then<00:04:03.190> that

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
see how this is gonna be and then that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.110 
see how this is gonna be and then that
idea<00:04:05.030> is<00:04:05.270> that<00:04:05.360> once<00:04:05.540> these<00:04:05.720> them<00:04:05.990> have<00:04:06.740> a<00:04:07.120> code

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
idea is that once these them have a code

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.360 
idea is that once these them have a code
then<00:04:08.480> there<00:04:08.660> could<00:04:08.750> be<00:04:08.810> bent<00:04:09.350> round<00:04:09.590> angles

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
then there could be bent round angles

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.120 
then there could be bent round angles
and<00:04:10.640> they<00:04:10.970> form<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.540> branches<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.560> more<00:04:13.010> of

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
and they form the branches and a more of

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.680 
and they form the branches and a more of
a<00:04:13.220> three-dimensional<00:04:14.030> shape<00:04:14.060> than<00:04:14.480> just

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
a three-dimensional shape than just

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.130 
a three-dimensional shape than just
being<00:04:14.870> us<00:04:14.960> a<00:04:15.110> rigid<00:04:15.700> two-dimensional<00:04:16.700> shape

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
being us a rigid two-dimensional shape

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.820 
being us a rigid two-dimensional shape
actually<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.170> could<00:04:18.260> have<00:04:18.350> been<00:04:18.440> those<00:04:18.650> ones

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
actually I could have been those ones

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.110 
actually I could have been those ones
down<00:04:19.040> there<00:04:19.190> not<00:04:19.430> just<00:04:19.489> for<00:04:19.700> even<00:04:20.030> more

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
down there not just for even more

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.570 
down there not just for even more
variety<00:04:20.540> no<00:04:21.350> let's<00:04:21.709> see<00:04:21.890> if<00:04:21.980> I<00:04:22.040> can<00:04:22.190> hold<00:04:22.430> this

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
variety no let's see if I can hold this

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.310 
variety no let's see if I can hold this
before<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.360> heat<00:04:23.540> gets<00:04:23.720> across

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
before the heat gets across

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:37.560 
before the heat gets across
I<00:04:24.520> shall<00:04:25.520> sort<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.420> that<00:04:26.540> under<00:04:26.870> there

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.600 

that<00:04:38.290> cool<00:04:38.530> completely<00:04:38.830> if<00:04:39.070> I<00:04:39.160> move<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.430> too

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
that cool completely if I move it too

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.760 
that cool completely if I move it too
soon<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.120> put<00:04:40.780> pressure<00:04:41.050> on<00:04:41.230> it<00:04:41.260> like<00:04:41.500> like

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
soon and put pressure on it like like

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.880 
soon and put pressure on it like like
that<00:04:41.800> just<00:04:42.700> as<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:42.910> was<00:04:43.320> saying<00:04:44.320> if<00:04:44.500> I<00:04:44.590> move<00:04:44.800> it

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
that just as I was saying if I move it

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.070 
that just as I was saying if I move it
too<00:04:45.070> soon<00:04:45.280> it's<00:04:45.460> just<00:04:45.520> going<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.660> solder

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
too soon it's just going to the solder

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.610 
too soon it's just going to the solder
isn't<00:04:47.650> fully<00:04:48.250> set<00:04:48.700> yet<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.840> hasn't<00:04:50.440> fully

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
isn't fully set yet it hasn't fully

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.620 
isn't fully set yet it hasn't fully
cooled<00:04:50.950> down<00:04:51.190> so<00:04:51.490> yeah<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.210> have<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.420> have<00:04:52.570> a

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
cooled down so yeah you have to have a

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.600 
cooled down so yeah you have to have a
bit<00:04:52.750> of<00:04:52.840> patience<00:04:53.170> with<00:04:53.380> how<00:04:53.560> thermal<00:04:54.100> mass

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
bit of patience with how thermal mass

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.180 
bit of patience with how thermal mass
joints<00:04:55.540> like<00:04:55.660> this<00:04:58.950> generally<00:04:59.950> seeing

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
joints like this generally seeing

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.160 
joints like this generally seeing
generous<00:05:00.880> say<00:05:01.150> saying<00:05:01.630> if<00:05:01.720> you<00:05:01.810> look<00:05:01.930> at<00:05:02.050> them

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
generous say saying if you look at them

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.010 
generous say saying if you look at them
and<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:03.220> can<00:05:03.370> see<00:05:03.580> that<00:05:04.060> it's<00:05:04.210> changed

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
and you can see that it's changed

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.920 
and you can see that it's changed
texture<00:05:05.530> slightly<00:05:05.890> when<00:05:06.010> they<00:05:06.100> cool<00:05:06.250> down<00:05:06.930> and

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
texture slightly when they cool down and

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.780 
texture slightly when they cool down and
you'll<00:05:08.110> notice<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.770> slight<00:05:09.010> frost<00:05:09.400> go<00:05:09.670> over

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
you'll notice a slight frost go over

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.610 
you'll notice a slight frost go over
them<00:05:09.940> even<00:05:10.120> with<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.480> proper<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.470> good

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
them even with the proper of good

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.140 
them even with the proper of good
quality<00:05:12.010> lead-based<00:05:12.220> solder<00:05:12.640> you'll<00:05:12.910> see<00:05:13.120> a

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
quality lead-based solder you'll see a

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.360 
quality lead-based solder you'll see a
slight<00:05:13.360> change<00:05:13.690> of<00:05:13.930> state<00:05:14.230> a<00:05:14.260> slight<00:05:15.010> haze

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
slight change of state a slight haze

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.400 
slight change of state a slight haze
goes<00:05:16.150> over<00:05:16.390> it<00:05:16.450> as<00:05:16.600> it<00:05:16.750> cools<00:05:16.990> down<00:05:17.110> I<00:05:17.260> think

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
goes over it as it cools down I think

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.140 
goes over it as it cools down I think
that's<00:05:17.710> at<00:05:17.920> this<00:05:18.010> time<00:05:20.130> and<00:05:21.130> then<00:05:21.850> you<00:05:22.000> can

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
that's at this time and then you can

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.720 
that's at this time and then you can
just<00:05:22.710> shape<00:05:23.710> these<00:05:23.830> branches<00:05:24.430> in<00:05:24.550> whatever

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
just shape these branches in whatever

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.570 
just shape these branches in whatever
way<00:05:25.030> you<00:05:25.060> want<00:05:27.510> yeah<00:05:28.890> no<00:05:29.890> sure<00:05:30.190> though<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:30.370> I

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
way you want yeah no sure though that I

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.220 
way you want yeah no sure though that I
think<00:05:30.880> maybe<00:05:31.060> I<00:05:31.180> prefer<00:05:31.270> these<00:05:31.720> ones<00:05:31.990> they're

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
think maybe I prefer these ones they're

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.680 
think maybe I prefer these ones they're
more<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.830> an<00:05:33.010> organic<00:05:33.640> this<00:05:34.000> looks<00:05:34.240> is

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
more of an organic this looks is

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.240 
more of an organic this looks is
starting<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.200> look<00:05:35.290> a<00:05:35.380> bit<00:05:35.410> so<00:05:35.800> cheap<00:05:36.070> and

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
starting to look a bit so cheap and

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.820 
starting to look a bit so cheap and
tacky<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:37.090> other<00:05:37.180> ones<00:05:37.390> I<00:05:37.840> bent<00:05:38.200> a<00:05:38.500> sleigh

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
tacky the other ones I bent a sleigh

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.820 
tacky the other ones I bent a sleigh
l-shape<00:05:39.400> so<00:05:39.760> it<00:05:40.270> wasn't<00:05:40.630> just<00:05:40.660> a<00:05:40.900> small<00:05:41.500> sort

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
l-shape so it wasn't just a small sort

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.410 
l-shape so it wasn't just a small sort
of<00:05:41.920> point<00:05:42.160> it<00:05:42.310> was<00:05:42.400> actually<00:05:42.820> coming<00:05:43.150> across

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
of point it was actually coming across

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.780 
of point it was actually coming across
the<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.770> tube<00:05:44.950> it's<00:05:45.130> copper<00:05:45.370> running<00:05:45.700> in

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
the the tube it's copper running in

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.580 
the the tube it's copper running in
parallel<00:05:46.000> and<00:05:46.570> the<00:05:46.810> soda<00:05:47.050> would<00:05:47.170> flow<00:05:47.440> between

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
parallel and the soda would flow between

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.460 
parallel and the soda would flow between
them<00:05:47.890> but<00:05:48.610> yes<00:05:48.850> interesting<00:05:49.270> it's<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:50.140> quite

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
them but yes interesting it's a quite

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.780 
them but yes interesting it's a quite
tedious<00:05:50.740> thing<00:05:51.190> actually<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:51.550> wouldn't

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
tedious thing actually I wouldn't

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.810 
tedious thing actually I wouldn't
recommend<00:05:52.390> trying<00:05:52.780> this<00:05:53.380> with<00:05:54.190> any<00:05:54.370> more<00:05:54.640> than

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
recommend trying this with any more than

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.300 
recommend trying this with any more than
say<00:05:55.090> twelve<00:05:55.420> and<00:05:55.870> lights<00:05:56.230> initially<00:05:56.770> I<00:05:56.860> only

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
say twelve and lights initially I only

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.850 
say twelve and lights initially I only
used<00:05:57.550> about<00:05:57.820> name<00:05:58.390> on<00:05:58.660> this<00:05:58.870> one<00:05:59.050> is<00:05:59.410> it<00:05:59.680> one

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
used about name on this one is it one

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.650 
used about name on this one is it one
two<00:05:59.980> three<00:06:00.100> four<00:06:00.280> five<00:06:00.460> six<00:06:00.580> seven<00:06:00.940> eight<00:06:01.150> just

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
two three four five six seven eight just

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.830 
two three four five six seven eight just
did<00:06:02.460> one<00:06:03.460> two<00:06:03.610> three<00:06:03.820> four<00:06:04.000> five<00:06:04.210> six<00:06:04.360> oh<00:06:04.570> no<00:06:04.810> I

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
did one two three four five six oh no I

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.040 
did one two three four five six oh no I
did<00:06:05.050> it<00:06:05.080> I<00:06:05.230> use<00:06:05.410> name<00:06:05.650> and<00:06:05.950> yeah<00:06:06.640> was<00:06:07.510> a<00:06:07.630> wee<00:06:07.900> bit

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
did it I use name and yeah was a wee bit

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.850 
did it I use name and yeah was a wee bit
self<00:06:08.550> Fitri<00:06:09.550> and<00:06:09.700> time-consuming<00:06:10.030> but<00:06:10.630> em<00:06:10.860> but

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
self Fitri and time-consuming but em but

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.440 
self Fitri and time-consuming but em but
it<00:06:11.950> does<00:06:12.070> look<00:06:12.280> nice<00:06:12.430> you<00:06:12.820> know<00:06:12.910> it<00:06:13.180> whoops

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
it does look nice you know it whoops

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.930 
it does look nice you know it whoops
wash<00:06:13.840> popped<00:06:14.170> off<00:06:14.380> it<00:06:14.770> does<00:06:15.040> look<00:06:15.190> at<00:06:15.400> nice<00:06:15.700> and

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
wash popped off it does look at nice and

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.370 
wash popped off it does look at nice and
it<00:06:16.030> is<00:06:16.060> kind<00:06:16.360> of<00:06:16.420> self-supporting<00:06:17.170> it<00:06:17.290> is

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
it is kind of self-supporting it is

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.590 
it is kind of self-supporting it is
rigid<00:06:17.680> so<00:06:18.340> yeah<00:06:19.080> interesting<00:06:20.080> project
