00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
okay so the other night in blog number

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.919 
okay so the other night in blog number
49<00:00:08.250> i<00:00:08.280> think<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.849> was<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.330> showed<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.750> some

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
49 i think it was we showed you some

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.900 
49 i think it was we showed you some
very<00:00:10.080> cool<00:00:10.380> headlights<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.610> got<00:00:11.759> from

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
very cool headlights so we got from

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.839 
very cool headlights so we got from
muscle<00:00:12.269> rods<00:00:12.480> calm<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.460> they're<00:00:14.460> pretty<00:00:14.639> neat

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
muscle rods calm and they're pretty neat

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.240 
muscle rods calm and they're pretty neat
because<00:00:15.000> they<00:00:15.179> use<00:00:15.480> these<00:00:15.949> 9007<00:00:16.949> headlight

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
because they use these 9007 headlight

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.790 
because they use these 9007 headlight
balls<00:00:17.490> well<00:00:18.359> part<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.840> kit<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
balls well part of that kit is a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.980 
balls well part of that kit is a
headlight<00:00:20.250> relay<00:00:20.520> system<00:00:21.210> from<00:00:21.539> american

headlight relay system from american

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.150 
headlight relay system from american
autowire<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:23.699> relay<00:00:24.029> kit<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:25.160> sitting

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
autowire and the relay kit is sitting

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.380 
autowire and the relay kit is sitting
right<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.640> comes<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.939> two<00:00:27.060> relays<00:00:27.359> for

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
right here it comes to two relays for

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.089 
right here it comes to two relays for
the<00:00:27.630> high<00:00:27.720> beams<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> low<00:00:28.320> beams<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.830> whole

the high beams and the low beams a whole

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.320 
the high beams and the low beams a whole
bunch<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.429> wire<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.640> all<00:00:29.970> bunch<00:00:30.210> of

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
bunch of wire and all bunch of

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.510 
bunch of wire and all bunch of
connecters<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> first<00:00:31.740> thing<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.340> going

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
connecters but the first thing you going

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.209 
connecters but the first thing you going
to<00:00:32.579> ask<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:33.059> why<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.230> want<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.680> run<00:00:34.829> relays

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
to ask is why do you want to run relays

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.340 
to ask is why do you want to run relays
on<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> headlights<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.570> reason<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
on the headlights and the reason for it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.920 
on the headlights and the reason for it
is<00:00:38.030> headlights<00:00:39.030> especially<00:00:39.750> when<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
is headlights especially when you

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
is headlights especially when you
upgrade<00:00:40.110> them<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.559> these<00:00:40.680> higher<00:00:41.160> wattage

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
upgrade them to these higher wattage

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.330 
upgrade them to these higher wattage
pieces<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.660> take<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> lot<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> power<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.739> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
pieces they take a lot of power and this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.650 
pieces they take a lot of power and this
particular<00:00:44.489> system<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.390> run<00:00:45.510> all

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
particular system is going to run all

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.209 
particular system is going to run all
four<00:00:45.870> low<00:00:46.050> beams<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.559> four<00:00:46.800> high<00:00:46.950> beams

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
four low beams and all four high beams

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.119 
four low beams and all four high beams
at<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> same<00:00:47.640> time<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.690> rather<00:00:49.200> than<00:00:49.469> try<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
at the same time so rather than try and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.590 
at the same time so rather than try and
run<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> extra<00:00:51.000> energy<00:00:51.090> through<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
run all that extra energy through the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.470 
run all that extra energy through the
stock<00:00:51.930> wiring<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.280> use<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.579> original

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
stock wiring you now use your original

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750 
stock wiring you now use your original
headlight<00:00:54.809> wires<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> trigger<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
headlight wires just as a trigger to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.569 
headlight wires just as a trigger to
turn<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> relay<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.829> see<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.190> big<00:00:59.399> heavy

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
turn the relay on you see this big heavy

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.410 
turn the relay on you see this big heavy
wire<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.960> relay<00:01:01.789> does<00:01:02.789> exactly<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
wire here the relay does exactly what it

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.280 
wire here the relay does exactly what it
says<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.799> relay<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.610> takes<00:01:06.290> this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
says it it's a relay it takes this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.200 
says it it's a relay it takes this
incoming<00:01:07.979> 12<00:01:08.430> volts<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> turn<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
incoming 12 volts when you turn the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.649 
incoming 12 volts when you turn the
headlights<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.830> into<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.010> wire<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
headlights on into one wire and then it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.090 
headlights on into one wire and then it
switches<00:01:13.400> inside<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.909> take<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.560> higher<00:01:16.560> current

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
switches inside to take a higher current

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100 
switches inside to take a higher current
right<00:01:17.310> from<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> battery<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.900> eliminates

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
right from the battery so it eliminates

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.780 
right from the battery so it eliminates
high<00:01:19.590> current<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.100> through<00:01:20.220> small<00:01:20.549> wires

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
high current going through small wires

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.700 
high current going through small wires
basically<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.509> how<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.720> works<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> put

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
basically that's how it works so to put

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.289 
basically that's how it works so to put
this<00:01:22.770> thing<00:01:22.979> together<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.119> you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
this thing together what you do is you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.969 
this thing together what you do is you
mount<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> relays<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> firewall<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
mount the relays on the firewall and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.399 
mount the relays on the firewall and
then<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.580> run<00:01:26.820> new<00:01:27.479> wires<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
then you run new wires to all the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
then you run new wires to all the
headlights<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.040> there's<00:01:29.610> some<00:01:29.820> kind<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
headlights and there's some kind of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.319 
headlights and there's some kind of
interesting<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.250> set<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
interesting here this is the set of

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.630 
interesting here this is the set of
connectors<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:34.049> give<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> over

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
connectors that they give you and over

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
connectors that they give you and over
here<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.079> kind<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> breakdown<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
here is the kind of the breakdown the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.980 
here is the kind of the breakdown the
schematic<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.360> these<00:01:39.360> kind<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.720> all<00:01:39.810> look

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
schematic here these kind of all look

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.260 
schematic here these kind of all look
similar<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.650> there<00:01:41.340> are<00:01:41.460> situations<00:01:41.670> where

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
similar but there are situations where

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.330 
similar but there are situations where
you<00:01:42.299> run<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:43.259> wire<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> connector<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.930> then

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
you run one wire to a connector and then

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.770 
you run one wire to a connector and then
run<00:01:47.340> two<00:01:47.549> wires<00:01:47.759> from<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> connector<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
run two wires from the connector to the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.630 
run two wires from the connector to the
next<00:01:49.110> headlight<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.619> tie<00:01:50.399> them<00:01:50.460> together

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
next headlight and tie them together

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
next headlight and tie them together
these<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:51.659> very<00:01:52.049> different<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.710> see

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
these are all very different you can see

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.230 
these are all very different you can see
this<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.520> kind<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.790> double<00:01:54.090> wide

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
this one here it's kind of a double wide

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.330 
this one here it's kind of a double wide
that<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:55.079> putting<00:01:55.409> two<00:01:55.590> wires<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that that's for putting two wires in and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.850 
that that's for putting two wires in and
this<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.000> over<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.750> narrow<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:58.619> for

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
this one over here is a narrow one for

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.499 
this one over here is a narrow one for
putting<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.130> single<00:01:59.490> wire<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.030> american

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
putting a single wire the american

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.950 
putting a single wire the american
autowire<00:02:01.340> really<00:02:02.340> kit<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.909> pretty<00:02:03.149> good<00:02:03.360> about

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
autowire really kit is pretty good about

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260 
autowire really kit is pretty good about
describing<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.159> different<00:02:05.189> connectors<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
describing the different connectors and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.950 
describing the different connectors and
then

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
then

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.080 
then
the<00:02:07.080> schematic<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> relays<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.880> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the schematic for the relays and the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.270 
the schematic for the relays and the
instruction<00:02:09.600> then<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> other<00:02:10.560> side<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:11.130> got

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
instruction then the other side it's got

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.890 
instruction then the other side it's got
a<00:02:11.310> picture<00:02:11.819> with<00:02:11.940> colors<00:02:12.420> which<00:02:12.690> makes

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
a picture with colors which makes

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.840 
a picture with colors which makes
everything<00:02:13.140> easier<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.670> guys<00:02:14.819> are

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
everything easier and the guys are

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.699 
everything easier and the guys are
muscle<00:02:15.270> rods<00:02:15.450> kind<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.780> added<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.170> few<00:02:16.350> notes

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
muscle rods kind of added a few notes

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.190 
muscle rods kind of added a few notes
here<00:02:16.860> for<00:02:17.220> us<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.700> could<00:02:17.880> even<00:02:18.480> even<00:02:19.050> we

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
here for us that we could even even we

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.740 
here for us that we could even even we
can<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:19.650> them<00:02:19.740> together<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:21.030> our<00:02:21.390> next<00:02:21.630> step

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
can get them together so our next step

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.260 
can get them together so our next step
is<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> mount<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.560> relays<00:02:22.890> run<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> wires<00:02:23.910> and

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
is to mount the relays run the wires and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.479 
is to mount the relays run the wires and
then<00:02:24.420> what<00:02:24.569> we'll<00:02:24.720> have<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:25.190> headlights<00:02:26.190> that

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
then what we'll have is headlights that

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.300 
then what we'll have is headlights that
don't<00:02:27.000> dim<00:02:27.360> when<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.959> engine<00:02:28.230> rpm<00:02:28.620> decreases

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
don't dim when the engine rpm decreases

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.460 
don't dim when the engine rpm decreases
they'll<00:02:29.550> always<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.819> full<00:02:30.150> power<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.690> we

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
they'll always have full power and we

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.740 
they'll always have full power and we
won't<00:02:31.650> be<00:02:31.800> taxing<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.910> regular<00:02:33.390> headlight

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
won't be taxing the regular headlight

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.470 
won't be taxing the regular headlight
wires<00:02:34.489> okay<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.550> if<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.090> look<00:02:36.270> down<00:02:36.420> here

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
wires okay so if you look down here

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.660 
wires okay so if you look down here
inside<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.590> fender<00:02:37.800> this<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.400> where<00:02:38.580> we

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
inside the fender this is where we

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.720 
inside the fender this is where we
mounted<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.060> relays<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:40.400> there's<00:02:41.400> kind<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.610> a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
mounted the relays and there's kind of a

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.640 
mounted the relays and there's kind of a
spaghetti<00:02:42.120> mess<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.510> wires<00:02:42.690> here<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:43.380> i'll

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
spaghetti mess of wires here but i'll

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.229 
spaghetti mess of wires here but i'll
explain<00:02:44.010> i'll<00:02:44.160> add<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.519> is<00:02:44.670> factory<00:02:45.120> this

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
explain i'll add this is factory this

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.690 
explain i'll add this is factory this
the<00:02:45.420> horn<00:02:45.630> relay<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.620> over<00:02:46.890> here<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.310> the

the rest of this match this green tape

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.460 
the rest of this match this green tape
is<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:27.769> used<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:29.360> measure<00:03:30.360> out<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.780> rest<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.380> the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
is I used to measure out the rest of the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.810 
is I used to measure out the rest of the
wires<00:03:31.680> because<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.190> has<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.459> go<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
wires because this has to go to the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.630 
wires because this has to go to the
Buffalo<00:03:33.630> Beavan<00:03:33.959> high<00:03:34.140> beam<00:03:34.350> here<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.280> then

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
Buffalo Beavan high beam here and then

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.699 
Buffalo Beavan high beam here and then
it's<00:03:35.760> going<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.940> come<00:03:36.060> across<00:03:36.500> follow<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
it's going to come across follow the

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.479 
it's going to come across follow the
factory<00:03:38.220> harness<00:03:38.430> then<00:03:39.180> you<00:03:39.329> want<00:03:39.480> actually

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
factory harness then you want actually

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.009 
factory harness then you want actually
and<00:03:41.489> end<00:03:41.850> up<00:03:42.000> over<00:03:42.209> here<00:03:42.239> at<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.570> other<00:03:42.780> light

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
and end up over here at this other light

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.840 
and end up over here at this other light
and<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.530> red<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.549> go<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
and the red is going to go to the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.930 
and the red is going to go to the
battery<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.980> one<00:03:46.980> thing<00:03:47.190> about<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.670> this

battery and one thing about this this
whole<00:03:48.090> harness<00:03:48.510> tucks<00:03:48.810> up<00:03:49.019> under<00:03:49.290> here<00:03:49.500> and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
whole harness tucks up under here and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
part of the harness we're going to bury

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.690 
part of the harness we're going to bury
it<00:03:59.250> inside<00:03:59.489> this<00:04:00.320> which<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.560> called<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:02.190> tech

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
it inside this which is called the tech

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.130 
it inside this which is called the tech
flex<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:04.370> flexible<00:04:05.370> nylon

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
flex this is a flexible nylon

high-temperature<00:04:07.140> wire<00:04:07.500> loom<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:08.010> think<00:04:08.760> it's

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
high-temperature wire loom I think it's

it's<00:04:17.010> like<00:04:17.100> when<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.370> when<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:17.880> snake<00:04:18.239> eats<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.660> pig

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
it's like when a when a snake eats a pig

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.300 
it's like when a when a snake eats a pig
you<00:04:19.370> push<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.269> together<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.680> expands

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
you push it together and it expands

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.670 
you push it together and it expands
right<00:04:22.640> and<00:04:22.880> then<00:04:23.330> that's<00:04:23.480> how<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:23.720> slide<00:04:24.080> this

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
right and then that's how you slide this

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.170 
right and then that's how you slide this
over<00:04:24.890> your<00:04:25.100> wires<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.580> then<00:04:25.670> you<00:04:25.760> can<00:04:25.880> pull<00:04:26.060> it

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
over your wires and then you can pull it

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.510 
over your wires and then you can pull it
tight<00:04:26.510> it's<00:04:26.780> like<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.380> know<00:04:27.440> like<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:28.220> finger

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
tight it's like a you know like a finger

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.320 
tight it's like a you know like a finger
trap<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.620> we'll<00:04:30.620> put<00:04:30.890> this<00:04:31.070> over<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:32.060> whole

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
trap and we'll put this over this whole

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.270 
trap and we'll put this over this whole
part<00:04:32.600> of<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.750> harness<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.740> it'll<00:04:33.980> all<00:04:34.070> look

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
part of the harness so it'll all look

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.490 
part of the harness so it'll all look
nice<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.730> clean<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.780> won't<00:04:35.930> see<00:04:36.200> any<00:04:36.350> of

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
nice and clean and you won't see any of

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.110 
nice and clean and you won't see any of
it<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.770> then<00:04:37.160> you<00:04:37.250> can<00:04:37.400> just<00:04:37.550> cut<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.880> little

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
it and then you can just cut the little

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.330 
it and then you can just cut the little
holes<00:04:38.330> wherever<00:04:39.260> there's<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.500> tab<00:04:39.800> like<00:04:40.130> this

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
holes wherever there's a tab like this

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.730 
holes wherever there's a tab like this
one<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.790> that<00:04:40.850> tab<00:04:41.750> will<00:04:41.960> stick<00:04:42.200> back<00:04:42.440> into

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
one and that tab will stick back into

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.970 
one and that tab will stick back into
the<00:04:43.540> core<00:04:44.540> support<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.650> you'll<00:04:45.830> be<00:04:45.950> a

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
the core support and you'll be a

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.460 
the core support and you'll be a
business<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.610> then<00:04:47.510> you'll<00:04:48.260> have

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
business and then you'll have

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.870 
business and then you'll have
high-powered<00:04:49.340> headlights<00:04:49.820> all<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.720> time
