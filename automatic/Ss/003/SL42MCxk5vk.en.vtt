00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.759

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:31.220
 ring green lantern oh my god how is it 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.930
 a little outside the box is logical but 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.629
 very cool and take from you such 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.059
 box such some such box 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.149
 there is something in it and all that is 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.590
 customized licensed to Odessa 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.109
 that is, anyway, all that is here 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.559
 happens this is true and approved 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.539
 Odessa 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:53.989
 but here is such a green 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.440
 background about the meaning of ring zhzhenov 0 well, that's mega 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.280
 I already showed minikit from this series 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.070
 you from the same cancel it it was 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.750
 many months ago bad bad signal was 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.329
 if he look cool 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.970
 but now I got to the ring 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.700
 the green lantern is great i can 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.180
 say so here it opens and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.770
 so here it looks well , of course she 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.720
 a little bit outside the box this is not what 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.540
 we are used to both in comics and in 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.610
 multah but basically i'm since i'm here 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.140
 said odessa 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.360
 a license for it issued it means they are 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.090
 somehow approve so far for me 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.399
 like here means little book which 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.399
 there is any information of all sorts of different 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.380
 green lanterns and i'm even with you 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.439
 I read sometime but I can 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.660
 right now you show her here she is 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:49.750
 ravine enemies of the green lantern 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:54.030
 blue lantern and here i see hal here 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.140
 jordan in all its glory with a lantern 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.900
 it means honorable 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.900
 with the guard here are the cover 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.080
 really were at the green lantern 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.410
 so hard to be honest now it 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.560
 looks completely different and star 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.930
 sapphire it just means kills there 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.230
 but there now it looks like this 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.150
 more adult more serious green 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.400
 lantern one of the most serious rulers on 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
 my opinion is generally out now 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.540
 and went out 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.550
 here they have an origin and that is deep in 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.930
 space abin sur green lantern sector 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.700
 2814 arrived and gave the mosque dying their 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.430
 lantern your ring meaning hal 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.750
 Jordan here are such a cover in 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.220
 general here we have history history then 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.019
 I myself will give the holder a little about him and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.660
 mean just the way rounds wars up 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.959
 points about lanterns themselves what comes across 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.690
 plus natural enemies are not all here 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.030
 hit my mine here but basically i think 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.010
 that something interesting can be found here 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.010
 oh well let's at least ring something 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.720
 look here is very snowy everything is clear 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.760
 little book is cool to them now i will try 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.519
 get to the ring from that little bit 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.519
 difficult because the box on which 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.600
 pry more than anything here all 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.530
 tight enough so here is a soldered ring 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.410
 as it is known just because arc is given if 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:38.440
 I'll break my nail now I'll wash 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:41.970
 or the king cant swear on the camera we 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.970
 almost started already almost 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:58.270
 it didn’t look amazing 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:02.380
 really like wow wow great 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.290
 for the ring oh well plastic now you 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.370
 you will write but actually also on it 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:13.330
 the thousandth license and that's great they 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:17.080
 really means approved so have 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.049
 us with a glow then there must be a glow 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.670
 through but i need for this batteries 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:30.480
 need to insert I did not think about 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:32.740
 this so we don’t have batteries 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.540
 replaceable ie you want to say that 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.430
 i won't want i am shorter 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.730
 unworthy of the essence let him end green 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.440
 on 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.850
 or just we do not see now how 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.340
 it glows because there is enough 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:49.000
 light if i be different you are not 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:51.490
 see nothing at all so what is it 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.620
 looks a bit spravno but of God and 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.770
 also stages a but you just don't 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.440
 imagine the opportunity to wear 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.330
 at least something that has a logo on itself 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.720
 green lantern it's so incredible 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.669
 cool here it is a little bit 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.910
 dimensionless that is, if you want you can 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:13.810
 on any kind of leafed through 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:17.770
 Here is such a sudden set 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.960
 I do not know pony, I understand that you are cool 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.880
 admirers of the classic green lantern 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.280
 it may not like her for something simpler 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.050
 bars just i don't know if with 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.640
 figure out how it works can be everything 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.200
 something here can be done with his 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.710
 by cross-section that they are not even 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.370
 Generally should admire the husband loaf to 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.229
 light up 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.419
 that's just shorter but should glow 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.000
 I still can not understand how it glows but 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:47.110
 the thing as they say is not the point is 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.940
 that green lantern tea was worth it 89 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.770
 cron it means you need 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.610
 78 as always, others remember how much 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.680
 will need shorter scissors by 7 and 2 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.419
 approximate and then divided by 2 to 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.560
 find out how much this set table from us 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:06.660
 in Russia, that's all here and here to me 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.330
 I hope you like it, despite 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.460
 the fact that it is a little childish 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.630
 canonical and do not be boring at all 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.000
 put the likes 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.060
 love green lantern subscribe to 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.350
