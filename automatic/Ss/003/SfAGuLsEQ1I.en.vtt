wedding<00:02:45.829> which<00:02:46.160> was<00:02:46.780> privacy<00:02:48.190> but<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.250> am<00:02:49.400> just

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
wedding which was privacy but I am just

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.110 
wedding which was privacy but I am just
a<00:02:49.879> quantitative<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.260> ceremony<00:02:51.799> itself<00:02:52.250> so

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
a quantitative on the ceremony itself so

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.599 
a quantitative on the ceremony itself so
I<00:02:53.150> think<00:02:53.360> it's<00:02:53.720> time<00:02:53.989> for<00:02:54.260> equal<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:55.430> more

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
I think it's time for equal to more

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.750 
I think it's time for equal to more
people<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.180> be<00:02:56.329> able<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.600> share<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.049> moment<00:02:57.440> so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
people to be able to share the moment so

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.910 
people to be able to share the moment so
probably<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:59.180> little<00:02:59.359> bit<00:02:59.630> nearer<00:02:59.930> than<00:03:00.889> that

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
probably a little bit nearer than that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.080 
probably a little bit nearer than that
so<00:03:01.850> so<00:03:02.389> the<00:03:02.450> party<00:03:02.840> protocol<00:03:03.319> in<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.310> last<00:03:04.819> few

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
so so the party protocol in the last few

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.759 
so so the party protocol in the last few
months<00:03:05.389> that<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.660> guys<00:03:05.810> have<00:03:05.959> been<00:03:06.079> married<00:03:06.290> I
