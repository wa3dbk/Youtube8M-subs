00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
and expect great quality that's why we

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
and expect great quality that's why we
use<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.760> mics<00:00:57.120> rather<00:00:57.750> than<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.989> webcam<00:00:58.440> mic

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
but there are a lot of settings to go

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.399 
but there are a lot of settings to go
through<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.939> it<00:01:47.939> will<00:01:48.119> take<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.570> very<00:01:48.840> long

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
through and it will take you a very long

time<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> find<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.060> better<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.689> leave

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
time to find it so it's better to leave

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.020
