00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 Hi guys, in today's video, we're going 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.690
 show a hands-on smartphone 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.719
 f480 is positive that there company personnel 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.540
 national and before anything else that 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.910
 What are you thinking there? 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 see video straight it reserves 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.350
 cool surprises for us is that this 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.779
 smartphone is fine and this is it 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.840
 well you must be asking too 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.810
 chain 'boxing're not given to make a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.210
 boxing because unfortunately in the box there is no 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.840
 came the headset did not come the cable 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.489
 usb 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.090
 But it's possible to make the surrender beauty to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.090
 the guys let's go 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.370
 as I said in the personal presentation 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.589
 s 480 it offers some surprise 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.409
 sakineh was an interesting surprise 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.670
 for example his very cool ergonomics 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.299
 finishing 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.100
 already the edges are metal 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:10.240
 This is cool, very interesting. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.090
 the back cover also has a 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.929
 texture is you realize that it is a 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.920
 better finished plastic, ie 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:22.720
 has evolved in this area and in 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.929
 physical characteristics 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.630
 This was very interesting to see in a 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.630
 phone and domestic manufacturing 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.000
 it's pretty cool to see that the whim 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.240
 glass here covering the screen 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.770
 it is not gorilla glass however're 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.289
 He's very tough, okay, so let's go. 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.439
 turn on the device in the meantime 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.170
 You will talking about his setup 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.829
 this appliance r 480 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:58.810
 at this moment he is the top of this date 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:01.299
 nÃ© it is the top of the line of positive and 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.119
 Until then what you are seeing 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:09.030
 logo has already changed to the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.030
 positive you see that it is more minimalist 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.060
 it's an interesting idea that you 're personal 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:23.170
 it is quite fluid it has the screens 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.050
 which slide quite easily 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.990
 it uses a quad-core processor 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.600
 I still do not know what it is but he uses a 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.520
 1.3 ghz quad-core processor 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.290
 and comes with 1 gigabyte of RAM and 8 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.140
 gigabytes of storage with 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.660
 possibility of expansion, we will 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.080
 open here also to see the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.460
 battery and we'll see where the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.190
 expansion 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:56.670
 It's okay, his screen has a resolution of 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:03.040
 854 for 480 ac letters are possible 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.740
 you see with comfort announce no 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.240
 get yourself talking you're not the screen is not 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.600
 hd but you can not see anything cool 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.360
 I can not see perfectly well beyond 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:22.090
 perfectly no problem at all 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:25.110
 visualization is one thing I 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.440
 just now the repair personnel 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:33.040
 android menu buttons have one thing 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.990
 cool is a bad thing for them to erase 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.540
 When you do not need to use the 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.850
 but when you need to use them 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.920
 example you do not know where they are 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.540
 positioned there you know more or less 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.450
 huh 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.910
 So when they erase you when 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.720
 you click it already runs it at least 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.850
 Could you call first after you? 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.730
 execute the command you want and 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.800
 even so I was going to get two touches right 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.760
 his android's personal is interesting 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.310
 to quote that the positive has already 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.440
 android that tiket such a person already 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.560
 placing r 4.4 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.350
 at the moment the most current android to another 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.269
 camera thing 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:22.400
 it has an 8 megapixel camera 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:25.220
 shoot in hd or 1280 by 720 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.370
 interesting of this personal camera we 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.509
 Let's test in the review, is that the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.250
 reported that it uses a sensor 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:38.330
 from sony is this a personal one 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.580
 sensor is a sensor that captures more 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.470
 light there so the photos come out more 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.960
 clear we'll check this out on 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.909
 Review is there and now we will open 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:55.789
 to view the battery of one of the 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:59.659
 chips pretty easy to open staff in easy 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:02.810
 The hood is her plastic like me. 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.340
 I said it is well finished without a burr nothing 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.780
 though thin 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.180
 we can not say that this is a point 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.849
 because, after all, the phones that 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.340
 samsung people do not also do 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.949
 nothing more than that here they ask 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.909
 when she's here she gets very firm 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:25.159
 the phone is an interesting thing is 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:28.610
 personal dual off chip uses a card 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:33.139
 using a micro- microphone is no excuse and the 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:36.020
 sim card of normal size 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.380
 and here we are seeing here the slot 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:44.300
 for storage expansion and here the 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.069
 1800m amperes battery here proving the 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.580
 I can say from experience of 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:52.669
 testing is that it is a battery is a 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.169
 little below the capacity to 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.349
 this phone right size 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.150
 is a 46-inch screen is usually 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:04.729
 these phones come with a battery of 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:06.259
 2001 average but is also another 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.130
 item that we will check in the review 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.729
 Ok folks 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.940
 well that was the surrender of s 480 um 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.520
 top-of-the-line 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.639
 less on that date and any staff 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.340
 Doubt leaves us in the comments here in 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:25.759
 It's okay, it's good that we will respond. 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.729
 in the legal review video the staff is 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.650
 That's right folks short on social networks 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.060
 Hence the joinha in the video speaks 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.550
 This helps us to do this. 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.770
 videos that are better for you 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.770
 beauty speaks up to the next
