00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.819 
for this so I don't mind as you see here
it<00:01:27.689> comes<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:29.000> trebuchet<00:01:30.000> shot<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.840> there

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so it's been villainous now for a little

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.590 
so it's been villainous now for a little
while<00:01:37.469> but<00:01:37.859> pretty<00:01:38.729> much<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.090> happens<00:01:39.420> for

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
while but pretty much what happens for

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.480 
while but pretty much what happens for
me<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.810> every<00:01:40.079> three<00:01:40.320> minutes<00:01:40.679> I<00:01:40.829> actually<00:01:41.039> get

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.359 
me is every three minutes I actually get
a<00:01:41.520> thousand<00:01:42.450> experience<00:01:42.960> which<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.590> gives<00:01:44.219> me

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
a thousand experience which it gives me

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.209 
a thousand experience which it gives me
the<00:01:44.490> bronze<00:01:44.789> for<00:01:45.619> repelling<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> attackers

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
so personally I don't mind but uh it's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.319 
so personally I don't mind but uh it's
just<00:01:52.950> kind<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.219> annoying<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.759> they

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
just kind of annoying because they

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.999 
just kind of annoying because they
attacked<00:01:54.659> us<00:01:54.840> once<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.500> wall<00:01:55.709> is<00:01:55.890> down

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
attacked us once and this wall is down

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.990 
attacked us once and this wall is down
the<00:01:56.219> whole<00:01:56.369> time<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:58.130> they<00:01:59.130> didn't<00:01:59.399> didn't

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the whole time and they didn't didn't

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.490 
the whole time and they didn't didn't
even<00:02:00.090> notice<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.569> there's<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> shot<00:02:01.380> right

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
even notice it so there's a shot right

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080 
even notice it so there's a shot right
there<00:02:01.740> we'll<00:02:02.310> go<00:02:02.399> ahead<00:02:02.459> and<00:02:02.640> repair<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.969> here

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
there we'll go ahead and repair it here

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.080 
there we'll go ahead and repair it here
quick<00:02:03.619> put<00:02:04.619> away<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.549> getting<00:02:08.700> screens

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
quick put away so I'm getting screens

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.150 
quick put away so I'm getting screens
from<00:02:09.239> repairing<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.840> not<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.799> much<00:02:10.950> though

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
from repairing and not that much though

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.380 
from repairing and not that much though
and<00:02:11.400> we'll<00:02:11.579> go<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.760> top<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> wall<00:02:12.239> you're

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and we'll go on top of the wall you're

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.930 
and we'll go on top of the wall you're
quick<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.410> as<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.430> see<00:02:14.519> here<00:02:14.670> comes<00:02:14.819> a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
quick and as you can see here comes a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.020 
quick and as you can see here comes a
shot<00:02:15.120> boom<00:02:15.799> collapses<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:19.819> pretty<00:02:20.819> much<00:02:20.910> how

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
shot boom collapses and pretty much how

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.770 
shot boom collapses and pretty much how
it's<00:02:21.209> been<00:02:21.360> going

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
it's been going

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.370 
it's been going
I<00:02:22.430> mean<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.459> thought<00:02:23.970> its<00:02:24.239> kind<00:02:24.299> of<00:02:24.480> neat<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.780> see

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
I mean I thought its kind of neat to see

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.280 
I mean I thought its kind of neat to see
something<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.180> guess<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.930> take<00:02:28.110> it

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
something like that so I guess I take it

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.039 
something like that so I guess I take it
that<00:02:28.440> works<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.829> any<00:02:29.010> Borderlands<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.450> cat

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
that works in any Borderlands the cat

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.660 
that works in any Borderlands the cat
the<00:02:31.290> trebuchet<00:02:31.769> on<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> map<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.340> right<00:02:32.579> up

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the trebuchet on the map is right up

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.580 
the trebuchet on the map is right up
here<00:02:32.849> so<00:02:33.090> if<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.269> can<00:02:33.360> see<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.569> map<00:02:33.750> turn<00:02:34.410> on

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
here so if you can see the map turn on

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.340 
here so if you can see the map turn on
720p<00:02:35.250> by<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.670> way<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:35.970> looks<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.959> looks<00:02:37.290> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
720p by the way it looks this it looks a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.590 
720p by the way it looks this it looks a
lot<00:02:37.470> better<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.799> 720p<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> guys<00:02:39.269> up<00:02:39.450> here

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
lot better in 720p so the guys up here

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.180 
lot better in 720p so the guys up here
in<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> trebuchet<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.470> he's<00:02:40.769> shooting<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
in the trebuchet and he's shooting it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.129 
in the trebuchet and he's shooting it
right<00:02:41.430> down<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.480> lining<00:02:42.780> about

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
right down here and it's lining about

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.140 
right down here and it's lining about
there<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.709> doing<00:02:43.920> damage<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.940> wall

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
there and it's doing damage to the wall

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.360 
there and it's doing damage to the wall
actually<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.650> can<00:02:46.769> see<00:02:46.859> how<00:02:46.950> many<00:02:47.130> trips

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
actually so you can see how many trips

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.300 
actually so you can see how many trips
I've<00:02:47.579> made<00:02:47.609> back<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.150> forth<00:02:48.359> from<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.810> UH

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
I've made back and forth from the UH

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.580 
I've made back and forth from the UH
from<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> supply<00:02:50.790> depot<00:02:50.850> there<00:02:51.329> but<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:51.989> mean

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
from the supply depot there but I mean

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.110 
from the supply depot there but I mean
I'm<00:02:52.739> sure<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:53.069> can<00:02:53.220> do<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.340> on<00:02:53.639> any<00:02:53.850> map

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
I'm sure you can do that on any map

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.910 
I'm sure you can do that on any map
because<00:02:54.569> they're<00:02:55.109> all<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.350> same<00:02:55.380> pretty<00:02:55.799> much

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
because they're all the same pretty much

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.309 
because they're all the same pretty much
so<00:02:56.160> if<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.549> set<00:02:56.760> up<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.940> trebuchet<00:02:57.359> here<00:02:57.630> you'd

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
so if you set up a trebuchet here you'd

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.330 
so if you set up a trebuchet here you'd
be<00:02:58.440> able<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.650> oh<00:02:58.829> look<00:02:59.069> at<00:02:59.160> that

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
be able to oh look at that

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.289 
be able to oh look at that
the<00:02:59.579> wall<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.880> taken<00:03:00.180> out<00:03:00.299> there<00:03:02.180> that's<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
the wall is taken out there that's a

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.949 
the wall is taken out there that's a
wall<00:03:03.450> stain<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.870> each<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:04.349> anyways

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
wall stain on each one but anyways

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.449 
wall stain on each one but anyways
that's<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.109> nice<00:03:07.260> little<00:03:07.530> tip<00:03:07.739> there<00:03:08.010> for<00:03:08.340> when

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
that's a nice little tip there for when

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.569 
that's a nice little tip there for when
you're<00:03:08.609> seeing<00:03:09.239> if<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:10.560> enemy<00:03:10.920> team<00:03:10.950> takes

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
you're seeing if the enemy team takes

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.680 
you're seeing if the enemy team takes
over<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:12.530> dreadful<00:03:13.530> Bay<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:14.040> think<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.450> best

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
over a dreadful Bay I think the best

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.030 
over a dreadful Bay I think the best
thing<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.930> do<00:03:16.169> is<00:03:16.319> sit<00:03:16.500> up<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.769> garrison

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
thing to do is sit up in the garrison

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.030 
thing to do is sit up in the garrison
was<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> trebuchet<00:03:17.849> right<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.419> on<00:03:18.599> this<00:03:19.530> wall

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
was a trebuchet right here on this wall

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.530 
was a trebuchet right here on this wall
right<00:03:20.130> here<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.609> shoot<00:03:20.819> at<00:03:20.940> their<00:03:21.120> wall<00:03:21.269> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
right here and a shoot at their wall and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.170 
right here and a shoot at their wall and
then<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.620> should<00:03:22.829> be<00:03:22.980> set<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.760> when<00:03:23.940> you

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
then you should be set for when you

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.409 
then you should be set for when you
invade<00:03:24.780> but<00:03:25.590> they<00:03:26.400> actually<00:03:26.760> tried<00:03:27.000> invading

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
and he was firing at it for a little

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.550 
and he was firing at it for a little
while<00:04:57.850> but<00:04:58.270> right<00:04:58.780> now<00:04:58.960> he's<00:04:59.140> trying<00:04:59.260> to<00:04:59.380> help

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560

while but right now he's trying to help
out<00:04:59.710> his<00:04:59.770> teammates<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:01.080> kill<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.200> people<00:05:02.320> on

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
out his teammates and kill the people on

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.590 
out his teammates and kill the people on
the<00:05:02.560> ground<00:05:02.740> there<00:05:02.860> but<00:05:03.040> when<00:05:03.910> he<00:05:04.000> fires<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.330> it

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
the ground there but when he fires it it

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.410 
the ground there but when he fires it it
was<00:05:04.690> down<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.140> about<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.970> was<00:05:07.090> down<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:07.390> about

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
was down to about it was down to about

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.000 
was down to about it was down to about
there<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.110> takes<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.440> while<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:08.680> actually

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
there so it takes a while to actually

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.570 
there so it takes a while to actually
destroy<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.670> fortify<00:05:10.210> wall<00:05:10.420> but<00:05:11.290> um<00:05:11.580> it's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
destroy the fortify wall but um it's

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.190 
destroy the fortify wall but um it's
very<00:05:12.700> effective<00:05:13.180> once<00:05:13.540> you<00:05:13.690> do<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:14.050> that's

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
very effective once you do so that's

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.570 
very effective once you do so that's
what<00:05:14.320> I'm<00:05:14.470> doing<00:05:14.710> right<00:05:14.830> now<00:05:15.010> it's<00:05:15.220> gonna<00:05:15.460> take

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
what I'm doing right now it's gonna take

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.330 
what I'm doing right now it's gonna take
me<00:05:15.880> a<00:05:15.910> little<00:05:16.030> while<00:05:16.210> but<00:05:16.720> uh<00:05:16.830> it's<00:05:17.830> definitely

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
me a little while but uh it's definitely

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.500 
me a little while but uh it's definitely
worth<00:05:18.490> it<00:05:18.670> because<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.090> part<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:19.420> I'm

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
worth it because the part that I'm

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.270 
worth it because the part that I'm
destroying<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:19.990> where<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.290> trebuchet<00:05:20.800> is<00:05:20.830> so

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
destroying is where the trebuchet is so

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.940 
destroying is where the trebuchet is so
um<00:05:22.090> as<00:05:22.360> you<00:05:22.690> can<00:05:22.750> see<00:05:22.960> it's<00:05:23.350> this<00:05:23.560> wall<00:05:23.800> right

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
um as you can see it's this wall right

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.240 
um as you can see it's this wall right
here<00:05:24.360> but<00:05:25.360> it's<00:05:26.020> it's<00:05:26.290> doing<00:05:26.680> as<00:05:26.920> you<00:05:27.040> can<00:05:27.130> see

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
here but it's it's doing as you can see

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.920 
here but it's it's doing as you can see
quite<00:05:27.430> a<00:05:27.490> map<00:05:27.700> quite<00:05:28.120> a<00:05:28.180> bit<00:05:28.360> amount<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.630> damage

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
quite a map quite a bit amount of damage

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.360 
quite a map quite a bit amount of damage
but<00:05:29.110> it's<00:05:29.230> still<00:05:29.560> gonna<00:05:29.740> take<00:05:29.920> a<00:05:29.950> little<00:05:30.130> while

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
but it's still gonna take a little while

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.700 
but it's still gonna take a little while
and<00:05:30.750> pretty<00:05:31.750> much<00:05:31.870> what<00:05:32.020> you<00:05:32.140> want<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.410> do<00:05:32.530> is

and pretty much what you want to do is

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.430 
and pretty much what you want to do is
just<00:05:33.060> draw<00:05:34.060> it<00:05:34.120> direct<00:05:34.600> it<00:05:34.750> either<00:05:34.930> turning

right<00:05:35.620> or<00:05:35.770> left<00:05:36.010> and<00:05:36.220> then<00:05:36.490> you<00:05:37.390> have<00:05:37.480> to<00:05:37.600> power

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
right or left and then you have to power

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.290 
right or left and then you have to power
up<00:05:37.990> all<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.320> way<00:05:38.380> to<00:05:38.440> full<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:39.010> then<00:05:39.670> just<00:05:40.060> use
