00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
define where we want to region to be as

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:44.740 
define where we want to region to be as
you<00:00:44.090> can<00:00:44.210> see<00:00:44.300> i'm<00:00:44.360> going<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.540> do<00:00:44.629> this

you're going to create it by doing
videos<00:01:06.040> 38<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.340> then<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:07.940> is<00:01:08.060> where<00:01:08.180> your

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
videos 38 and then this is where your

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.130 
videos 38 and then this is where your
region<00:01:08.600> name<00:01:08.780> comes<00:01:09.049> in<00:01:09.229> it's<00:01:09.799> going<00:01:09.979> to<00:01:10.010> be

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
region name comes in it's going to be

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
expands from bedrock to the sky so let's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.470 
expands from bedrock to the sky so let's
reduce<00:01:25.820> expand<00:01:26.780> max<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:28.010> then<00:01:28.460> our<00:01:28.700> region

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
reduce expand max and then our region

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.230 
reduce expand max and then our region
name<00:01:29.630> which<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.840> tutorial<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:32.650> lot<00:01:33.970> then<00:01:34.970> now<00:01:35.180> to
