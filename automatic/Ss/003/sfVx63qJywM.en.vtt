00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.300
 I've seen this somewhere. 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.890
 Who is he? 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.670
 He is a Saiyan. 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.970
 People call him Goku or Kakaroto. 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.090
 But were not all exterminated together with the planet Vegeta? 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.200
 Almost all have disappeared, but some have survived. 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.980
 In particular Prince Vegeta. 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.860
 The hair of the Saiyajines is not black? 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.770
 however, they did well to eliminate freezer. 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.170
 It seems that Saiyan can be transformed into Super Saiyan 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.440
 What? 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.780
 Super Saiyajin? .... 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.430
 Super Saiyajin? .... 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.790
 Super Saiyajin? !!! 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.420
 I see... 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.150
 It was him. 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.480
 What do you say? 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.470
 Well ... Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan. 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.360
 God! 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.720
 I saw it in my dream. 

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:31.456
 I dreamed I was fighting with the Super Saiyan God, who looks like him! 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.388
 Please, Start. 

00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:36.952
 Do not underestimate me.
