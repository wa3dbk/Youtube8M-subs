about that design but one of the things
that<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.750> didn't<00:00:52.079> quite<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.289> about<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.800> is

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
that is awesome and part of that's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.590 
that is awesome and part of that's
probably<00:01:27.960> from<00:01:28.320> moving<00:01:28.590> from<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.600> Sabre

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
probably from moving from the Sabre

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.319 
probably from moving from the Sabre
ground<00:01:30.869> blade<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> full<00:01:31.860> flap<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.549> also

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
ground blade to the full flap and also

ground blade to the full flap and also
moving<00:01:33.600> from<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> full<00:01:37.439> stainless<00:01:38.070> liners<00:01:38.750> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
moving from the full stainless liners to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.330 
moving from the full stainless liners to
skeletonized<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:44.640> great

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
skeletonized do that in there just great

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.440 
skeletonized do that in there just great
one<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.490> other<00:01:47.610> differences<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
one of the other differences is the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
one of the other differences is the
standard<00:01:49.320> medics<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:51.360> g10<00:01:51.899> has<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> nice

standard medics to the g10 has a nice

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
standard medics to the g10 has a nice
texture<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.240> fairly<00:01:54.479> smooth<00:01:54.899> not

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
texture to it but it's fairly smooth not

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.490 
texture to it but it's fairly smooth not
all<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.649> grippy<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:58.610> sprint<00:01:59.610> run<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.500> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
all that grippy the sprint run it's a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.209 
all that grippy the sprint run it's a
rougher<00:02:02.130> texturing<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:04.829> it's<00:02:05.070> not

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
rougher texturing you know it's it's not

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.370 
rougher texturing you know it's it's not
the<00:02:05.520> little<00:02:05.880> sort<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.329> grains<00:02:06.780> or<00:02:07.049> bumps

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the little sort of grains or bumps

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
the little sort of grains or bumps
aren't<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.710> fine<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.280> almost<00:02:08.520> has<00:02:08.700> almost<00:02:09.000> a
