going to do is make it so that the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.510 
going to do is make it so that the
region<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> top<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
region is all the way up to the top and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.609 
region is all the way up to the top and
all<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> way<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> bedrock<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.470> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
all the way up to the bedrock if you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.960 
all the way up to the bedrock if you
don't<00:01:25.770> want<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.460> don't<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.350 
don't want to do this you don't have to
you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.869> expand<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.939> think<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.090> like

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you can just do expand I think it's like

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.310 
you can just do expand I think it's like
five<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:32.509> that'll<00:01:33.509> make<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.689> that'll<00:01:34.290> make

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
five up that'll make it that'll make

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.469 
five up that'll make it that'll make
every<00:01:34.740> single<00:01:34.890> block<00:01:35.250> five<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.909> saw<00:01:39.240> stay

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
every single block five up and saw stay

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.200 
every single block five up and saw stay
but<00:01:40.290> I'm<00:01:40.409> gonna<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.759> such<00:01:42.030> as

but I'm gonna do it so that it's such as

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.679 
but I'm gonna do it so that it's such as
expand<00:01:42.750> vert<00:01:43.470> which<00:01:44.220> expands<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> top<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
expand vert which expands it top to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.109 
expand vert which expands it top to
bottom<00:01:46.640> now<00:01:47.840> now<00:01:48.840> um<00:01:49.549> with<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.759> region

I'm<00:02:08.420> just<00:02:08.539> gonna<00:02:08.660> get<00:02:08.899> string<00:02:09.259> out<00:02:12.459> you're

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
I'm just gonna get string out you're

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.059 
I'm just gonna get string out you're
going<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.670> want<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:16.870> figure<00:02:17.870> out<00:02:18.140> what<00:02:18.470> region

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
going to want to figure out what region

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.100 
going to want to figure out what region
this<00:02:19.550> region<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:20.209> in<00:02:20.450> your<00:02:20.660> going<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.840> want<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
this region is in your going to want it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.880 
this region is in your going to want it
in<00:02:21.800> another<00:02:22.430> region<00:02:22.870> unless<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.440> want<00:02:24.740> them

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
in another region unless you want them

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.949 
in another region unless you want them
to<00:02:25.070> be<00:02:25.160> able<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.370> break<00:02:25.550> blocks<00:02:26.209> around<00:02:26.540> it

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
to be able to break blocks around it

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.390 
to be able to break blocks around it
because<00:02:27.380> if<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:27.590> not<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.950> region<00:02:28.250> then

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
because if it's not in the region then

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.710 
because if it's not in the region then
they<00:02:28.520> can<00:02:28.640> just<00:02:28.790> break<00:02:28.910> everything<00:02:29.209> around<00:02:29.510> it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
they can just break everything around it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.420 
they can just break everything around it
and<00:02:30.730> not<00:02:31.730> inside<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:32.540> just<00:02:32.660> around<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.140> but

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and not inside it but just around it but

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.770 
and not inside it but just around it but
mine's<00:02:34.430> already<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.940> region<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.630> want

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
mine's already in a region so you want

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.180 
mine's already in a region so you want
to<00:02:35.870> check<00:02:35.959> if<00:02:36.110> it's<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.320> a<00:02:36.350> region<00:02:36.739> mines<00:02:36.980> in

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
to check if it's in a region mines in

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.880 
to check if it's in a region mines in
spawn<00:02:37.550> time<00:02:37.930> your<00:02:38.930> have<00:02:39.140> named<00:02:39.410> your<00:02:39.560> spawn

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.440 
spawn time your have named your spawn
county<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.910> want<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.060> make<00:02:41.150> sure<00:02:41.209> that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
county but you want to make sure that

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.590 
county but you want to make sure that
this<00:02:41.900> region<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.620> can't<00:02:42.950> build<00:02:43.340> in<00:02:43.730> see<00:02:44.450> it

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
this region you can't build in see it

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.790 
this region you can't build in see it
says<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.110> build<00:02:45.320> my<00:02:45.470> own<00:02:45.590> which<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:45.890> /<00:02:46.280> RG

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
says can you build my own which is / RG

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.280 
says can you build my own which is / RG
flag<00:02:49.330> region<00:02:50.330> name<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.840> then<00:02:51.080> build<00:02:51.950> deny<00:02:53.290> so

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
flag region name and then build deny so

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.530 
flag region name and then build deny so
that's<00:02:55.220> how<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.430> do<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.730> you're<00:02:56.360> going<00:02:56.450> to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
that's how you do that you're going to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.420 
that's how you do that you're going to
want<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.780> do<00:02:56.959> /<00:02:57.650> RG<00:02:58.310> set<00:02:58.880> parent<00:03:00.250> whatever<00:03:01.250> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
want to do / RG set parent whatever the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.840 
want to do / RG set parent whatever the
that<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.690> plots<00:03:02.959> name<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.709> regional<00:03:04.459> name<00:03:04.580> and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
that the plots name is regional name and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.199 
that the plots name is regional name and
then<00:03:05.510> whatever<00:03:05.780> region<00:03:06.170> its<00:03:06.590> ends<00:03:06.920> name<00:03:07.280> and

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
then whatever region its ends name and

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.810 
then whatever region its ends name and
that<00:03:08.989> sets<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.380> parent<00:03:09.920> which<00:03:10.190> basically<00:03:10.640> just

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
that sets a parent which basically just

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.210 
that sets a parent which basically just
says<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.600> is<00:03:11.630> smaller<00:03:12.260> than<00:03:12.560> spawn<00:03:12.950> town

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
says that it is smaller than spawn town

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.360 
says that it is smaller than spawn town
it's<00:03:14.060> inside<00:03:14.780> spawn<00:03:15.380> town<00:03:15.620> because<00:03:16.100> if<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
it's inside spawn town because if the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.560 
it's inside spawn town because if the
parent<00:03:16.970> was<00:03:17.829> if<00:03:18.829> plot<00:03:19.790> one<00:03:20.000> was<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.269> parent<00:03:20.540> of

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
parent was if plot one was the parent of

parent was if plot one was the parent of
spawn<00:03:20.870> town<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.350> i'm<00:03:21.530> pretty<00:03:21.799> sure<00:03:22.010> get

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
spawn town and i'm pretty sure get

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.060 
spawn town and i'm pretty sure get
messed<00:03:22.610> up<00:03:22.790> because<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:24.170> obviously<00:03:24.620> not<00:03:24.709> in

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
messed up because it's obviously not in

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.430 
messed up because it's obviously not in
that<00:03:25.880> plot<00:03:26.209> its<00:03:26.510> well<00:03:27.200> yeah<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.239> now<00:03:29.870> i'm<00:03:30.410> going

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
that plot its well yeah so now i'm going

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.750 
that plot its well yeah so now i'm going
to<00:03:30.590> do<00:03:30.650> one<00:03:30.769> more<00:03:30.920> thing<00:03:30.980> before<00:03:31.250> we<00:03:31.459> get<00:03:31.640> the

to do one more thing before we get the
sign<00:03:32.000> up<00:03:32.239> you<00:03:32.840> want<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.049> do<00:03:33.140> /<00:03:33.320> RG<00:03:33.890> set<00:03:35.380> priority

you don't do that and they buy the plot
