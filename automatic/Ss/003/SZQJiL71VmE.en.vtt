00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.480

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.410
 it is readable so I confirm it is 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.270

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.140
 so he asks to type these three 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.210
 digits 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.210

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.959
 interest if I want to increase the amount 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.790
 installment for up to six installments without 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.320
