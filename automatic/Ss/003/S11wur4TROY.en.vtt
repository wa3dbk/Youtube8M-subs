that<00:02:04.020> i<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.670> hard<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
that i have hard to just think of one a

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.180 
that i have hard to just think of one a
damaged<00:02:09.149> gate<00:02:09.360> how<00:02:09.599> about<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.110> know<00:02:11.069> that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
damaged gate how about that I know that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.670 
damaged gate how about that I know that
one's<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.670> there<00:02:11.819> yep<00:02:12.510> there<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.870> is

move cards you can duplicate cards

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.099 
move cards you can duplicate cards
different<00:02:45.180> things<00:02:45.209> like<00:02:45.359> that<00:02:45.720> way<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.900> can

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109
