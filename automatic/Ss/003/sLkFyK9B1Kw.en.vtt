00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.690
 this tutorial we will learn to elaborate a 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.690
 crocodile like this 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.650
 well let's see how the 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.140
 materials that we will use will be a 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.380
 square of paper and we will fold it by the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.380
 diagonal 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:28.060
 in this way we unfold and take 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.060
 this side and this side to the center 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.030
 ok and now we will take this side and this 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030
 side to center 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.940
 and we will have this figure what follows is 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.370
 reverse those two folds of the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.670
 next we unfold and we will put 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.140
 first on this side and this fold 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.140
 we will out 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.739
 and we press 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.860
 well we do the other we unpack we put 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.550
 this side and this double we will do it towards 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.350
 outside 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.300
 and we will press the top well 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.250
 flip we have our figure and what 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.820
 we will do is take this side where it 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.780
 find these bends by folding it 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.540
 one side to unfold this fold that 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.140
 it's found 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.700
 thus 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.330
 well and we'll mark the other side 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.790
 pressing it 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.060
 we unfold and we will do the same of the other 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.060
 side 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.610
 now to unfold this side and 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.600
 we will mark 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.770
 thus 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.430
 and so we will get a mark of x in the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.650
 center well now we will take this side and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.950
 we will double it for the brand that we have 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.950
 fact 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.660
 thus 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.619
 we unfold and now we will take this other 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.619
 side by the other brand 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.260
 and so we have marked again another 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.360
 X 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.130
 on the other side 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.950
 what we will do next will be 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.340
 bring the tip in and invest 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.340
 the fold 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.190
 thus 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.660
 all right 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.990
 we press and do the same of the other 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.990
 side 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.560
 we will put these folds and invert 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.160
 the other and we will have this form 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.340
 we unfold and we will put these two points 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.290
 approximately one centimeter 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.980
 on this side 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.230
 and the other good and we will mark again 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.230
 again our folds 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.250
 thus 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.340
 bolt we will make you our figure 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.960
 and where are these 2 these 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.970
 two tabs we will make it back 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.970
 as far as the fold indicates 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:01.290
 in this way and we will take those two sides 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.200
 bending it parallel to this fold 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.709
 leaving about half a centimeter 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.040
 in this way we do the same thing 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.040
 other side 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.810
 and we will stay like this 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.930
 Now what we will do is press the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:27.080
 part of inside so that the 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.080
 tips are made in this way 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.440
 and finally we only take the 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.440
 tip and bend it a little 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.520
 unfold and open these folds 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.520
 introducing the tip 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.920
 and we closed the folds again 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.910
 we will do the same thing on the other side 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:57.070
 we bend the tip we unfold 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.650
 and we will put the tip inside 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.290
 all right 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.639
 and finally we have finished our 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.639
 origami crocodile 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.080
