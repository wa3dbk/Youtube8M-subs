00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.230
 good personal day and welcome to the channel 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.810
 jet 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 today I will making the statement of 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.710
 flash procedure 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.440
 I'm using here one is tying the vx 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.859
 cruzer is this procedure works for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.609
 any ties since the old 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.779
 side is the superjet to the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.170
 newest, so fsph rh office is 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.599
 Finally, it works with any 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.480
 The procedure is very simple. 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.829
 Do you know who has a four- wheeler? 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.910
 projects that you already know more or less 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.910
 I'll do it here 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.410
 here i have an adapter he uses this one 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.170
 adapter at the input of the flash 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 the entry is this here remembering the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.710
 staff whenever you finish the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.960
 remove the adapter 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.449
 if you do not remove the water adapter 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.239
 will be returning when you place 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.789
 the boat in the sea again 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.680
 and that return will fill everything with water 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.780
 can even sink and your jet ski 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.100
 causing a very good loss 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:13.860
 is first put the adapter focus here 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.250
 push turns and hangs ready who is 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.979
 caught here on the other side I put 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.000
 this quick coupling together with the same 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.490
 large garden 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.500
 this spending here has a system that closes 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 the water when you release this hose that 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.650
 It's already turned on but it will only get water 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.380
 when I flea 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.579
 so what I 'm going to do I'm going first 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 start the engine and then 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:42.540
 To leave the water on, love is almost 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.130
 the jec must're plan is in the ground and 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.960
 That's it 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.979
 I'm just holding my hand here so it goes 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.979
 get a little shaky 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.610
 now the respect for 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.740
 part of this water will be discarded in the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.650
 Good turbine, you see that water there. 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.630
 and the other to cool the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.660
 motor 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.730
 you should do this procedure is for 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.209
 at least two minutes 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.709
 if by chance during this procedure it is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.690
 that 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.540
 and if that siren that played here as 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.470
 It works the jet is playing with you 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.989
 means here is the water pressure of the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.030
 low and the engine is 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.580
 is when the employee as he gave the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.160
 alert this alert was fuel low 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.870
 It is quite common to happen when you 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.349
 turn on this alert just push a button 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.750
 the panel is going to go off if I 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.629
 leave here you have it on the side 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.959
 this way out here on the side 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.720
 she does not get steady water with the jet ski 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.190
 doing today it is only water when 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.190
 you give little accelerated 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.110
 and yet the amount of water well 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.390
 only came here to water a 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.130
 little ground but that's not the way it is 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.340
 worries and is working 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.250
 there are 100 people who say that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.180
 flag that models and ties have 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.580
 it's cooling but it's not just 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:48.990
 a patented effect then is the brand 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.990
 prada a different touch on your models 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.040
 always check the dashboard if by chance 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.190
 is not lighting the light of the order 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.320
 In this case, here she is blinking 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.870
 because the fuel is low 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.630
 if it gives any defect in relation to the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.210
 temperature for example it will stay 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.620
 here in the digital panel the symbol SindÃ´ 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.030
 of heating 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.489
 you then interrupted the operation 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.810
 of the engine soon afterwards does not let 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.430
 to work with 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.430
 with that anomaly 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.169
 another interesting thing also personal 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.099
 after walking is putting the bank in this 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.460
 position 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:41.580
 so that all the water that has accumulated in the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.000
 seat foam use will slowly 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.199
 getting off on the right foot can get heavy 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.199
 as often happens 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.840
 today you already do this procedure you 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.569
 yes you can give little alan but without 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.699
 let the engine face the 25 thousand rpm 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.120
 is out of the water did not miss the 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.120
 5,000 rpm 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.110
 to finalize the personal process you 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.419
 you have to stop water first 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.310
 which interrupts the operation of the engine 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.340
 I'll skip that hose it will already 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.259
 ready water water 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.360
 I'm going to tap the accelerator to 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.360
 eliminate s up to us to vote 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.820
 And now I can call the staff. 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.700
 procedure is very simple who has 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.960
 engine 1 4 t-jet engines knows that it has 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.100
 that to do this process mainly 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.780
 after walking naked in the sea and salt water and 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.280
 this procedure is very important for 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.020
 keep the durability and then like me 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.940
 I showed in the first video here of the 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.430
 channel that happens when you stop 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.820
 do this procedure or do it in a 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.920
 wrong, I do not know why people are wrong. 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.500
 mystifying, however, because in my 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.870
 opinion is a simple procedure it is 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.350
 manual comes teaching how to do this 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.720
 It has no any great mystery 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.460
 It's not in the future that I'm going to do this. 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.230
 same procedure in the other brands 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.260
 To the people there who have these 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.660
 Do you doubt that you can do this? 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.730
 legal maintenance this procedure 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.220
 remembering again it has to be done 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.410
 every time you walk in salt water 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.050
 remember that is another detail 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.350
 particularly important in the models and 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.990
 is to never let gasoline over 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:40.260
 one month stored in the tank 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:44.100
 then you can do a lot of damage to the 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.440
 ideal engine to always put gasoline 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.950
 you will use that day will walk 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.710
 puts gasoline on until it's over 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.060
 he starts alerting the reservation is that 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.880
 annoying whistle 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.590
 just tap the button that alerts you 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.020
 it's going to stop 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.410
 that's when he's giving this alert 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.570
 still has 15 liters in average gasoline 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.140
 inside the tank so do not worry 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:13.169
 in just ran over there marina back 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.910
 because at 1,100 for example with 15 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:18.450
 you quietly rotate one 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.850
 time and that's it folks I hope to have 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.979
 pleased to you older like this 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.169
 here you can get here on the channel and jets 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:27.450
 I'll advance by getting places. 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:30.090
 to leave Iraq in the video gives a 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.540
 commented and will help a lot 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.540
 thanks
