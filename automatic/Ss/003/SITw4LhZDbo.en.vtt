pick up my naked 2 palette more I love
the<00:04:41.090> naked<00:04:41.389> one<00:04:41.540> though<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.290> think<00:04:42.350> then

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
the naked one though and I think then

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.170 
the naked one though and I think then
they<00:04:42.740> could<00:04:42.889> choose<00:04:43.040> probably<00:04:43.490> more<00:04:43.669> travel

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
they could choose probably more travel

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.010 
they could choose probably more travel
friendly<00:04:44.980> but<00:04:45.980> overall<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.760> think<00:04:46.820> if<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.810> have

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
friendly but overall I think if you have

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.290 
friendly but overall I think if you have
the<00:04:48.169> money<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.500> spend<00:04:48.590> both<00:04:49.100> palettes<00:04:49.610> are<00:04:49.850> a

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
the money to spend both palettes are a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.180 
the money to spend both palettes are a
really<00:04:50.630> good<00:04:50.720> option<00:04:50.900> for<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.350> but<00:04:51.980> if<00:04:52.070> you

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
really good option for you but if you

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.800 
really good option for you but if you
don't<00:04:52.400> then<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:52.940> would<00:04:53.120> just<00:04:53.240> get<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.419> Naked<00:04:53.780> 2

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
don't then I would just get the Naked 2

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.500 
don't then I would just get the Naked 2
I<00:04:53.960> think<00:04:54.200> it<00:04:54.500> comes<00:04:54.680> with<00:04:54.889> a<00:04:55.130> better<00:04:55.730> brush<00:04:56.120> and

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
I think it comes with a better brush and

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.090 
I think it comes with a better brush and
it<00:04:56.780> also<00:04:56.900> comes<00:04:57.200> with<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.380> lip<00:04:57.590> product<00:04:57.830> which

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
it also comes with a lip product which

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.760 
it also comes with a lip product which
is<00:04:58.220> nice<00:04:58.490> because<00:04:58.760> you<00:04:59.150> get<00:04:59.840> more<00:05:00.200> you<00:05:00.620> know

of a little if you're new to makeup it's

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.390 
of a little if you're new to makeup it's
better<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.600> have<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> lip<00:05:06.140> product<00:05:06.350> and<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:07.040> stuff
