00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 our passion for kiteboarding is still 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.299
 wind sport and so even if you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.309
 proved to be in ideal conditions where 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.620
 warm water and the sea but if there is no wind 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.330
 you still can't ride some 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.650
 time ago a new hobby appeared 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.619
 paddle surfing 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.600
 and many are interested in this 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.279
 number and k and barter and because skating 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.970
 on the board with a paddle allows not to depend 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.519
 from the wind 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.039
 large board allows you to stand confidently 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.830
 use to move bismuth 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.720
 riding on the pick does not resemble to but also 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.940
 so much raider is in position 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.090
 standing 5 boards well suited not only 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 surfing on the waves but also possible 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 use for normal riding 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.600
 water calm walks as well 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.020
 speed competition while driving 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.570
 distances but everything would be fine if 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.670
 not their size these boards are too big 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.559
 to be mobile interest in them was 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.170
 big and so the solution came 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.090
 fast enough to make these boards 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.670
 inflatable 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.789
 so meet the inflatable fell board and 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.100
 from the English company rap battle these boards 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.350
 have the usual shape and size for 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.880
 classic 2 proudly single 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.850
 A feature is that they have 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.159
 inflatable valve and made of pvc themselves 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.270
 inside there are nicks that allow 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.820
 give this board 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 flat shape after inflating the board 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.630
 acquires the necessary rigidity for 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.060
 so that you can ride confidently 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.970
 it stands on our tests was three 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.040
 board size the largest is 10 and 8 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.049
 it has a very large width and quite 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.939
 suitable for very heavy weight robert 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.710
 which exceeds 100 kilograms on this 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.460
 the board can be skated twice the world can 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.079
 even be a threesome 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.270
 while she has enough 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.990
 sustainability to any beginner 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.390
 rider 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.170
 did not experience balance problems more 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.020
 universal board size 10 and 6 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.090
 this board is long but already 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.180
 it is already noticeable therefore the speed of this board 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.130
 will be significantly higher than the maximum 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.899
 big blackboard and 10 and 8 she will 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.399
 universal for boat trips 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.270
 so surfing lucky 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.829
 another board that was 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.929
 we have this board size 9 4 it has 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.729
 already pronounced rocker 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:14.349
 narrow nose is the same as standard 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.989
 siphons boards and rug art under 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.670
 heel which helps to control 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.269
 board on the wave this board is already 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.560
 designed for real surfing 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.180
 the size of this board is well suited for 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.230
 light riders for kids or for 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.430
 girls for stronger riders 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.650
 riding on this board will require 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.630
 a little workout you will need 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.910
 first master fluency 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.130
 paddle because the board is small 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.959
 size and requires that you already know how 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.030
 keep balance all the boards and 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.799
 equipped handle that are in 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.480
 center and also three fins fins 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.459
 glued back surface therefore 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.380
 don't get lost even if you often 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.299
 assemble and disassemble the board in order 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.340
 to ride attacked boron you 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.299
 need paddle paddle not included 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.819
 set of this board 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.730
 our boards were completed collapsible 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.299
 breaking the features of this paddle is that 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.319
 she breaks down into three parts 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.840
 one part that allows 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.870
 adjust paddle length 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.579
 different growths and strictly speaking itself 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.650
 paddle after you arrive to 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.470
 the place of riding you can get your 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.540
 spring which is quite free to fit 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.049
 in a backpack for the board and collect it 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.049
 adjusting to your height 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.860
 the paddle is very light strong and has 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.080
 sufficient stiffness on these large 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.390
 doses as you can ride and kite but 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.130
 there are some features of the board very 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.130
 large size therefore manage them 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.680
 it wo n't be easy to start on such a board 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.780
 easier in the sitting position you pick up the course 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.080
 the board will be more stable in order 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.450
 to get on it starting right away like on 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.270
 regular cheeseboard get up attacked 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.920
 the board can be quite difficult for you 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.200
 you have to make a big nose 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.150
 so take your time try first 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.790
 ride sitting and then learn 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.420
 get up better fit kite with a little 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.610
 lengthening 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.130
 riding the hem burg will have 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.740
 features the board is very large and has 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.290
 noticeable resistance therefore 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.390
 to accelerate on it will be very difficult and 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.500
 it is important that your kite is good even 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.420
 at low speed 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.710
 to change direction on 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.140
 will you have to pick 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.330
 navigate the board if you want 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.490
 turn around directing the nose of the board down 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.320
 wind you have to go to the nose to 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.870
 turn the board into the wind 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.590
 it will be easier to move yourself closer to 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.050
 poop but basically turns on the hem 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.030
 the board is simple enough the only thing 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.030
 Remember that you should not hurry and take 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.800
 board by weight after skiing 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.340

 back pack a board for that to you 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.949
 need to unscrew the valve and open 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.949
 letting it out 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.060
 and you can start folding your 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:23.259

 into place you can easily pump up the board 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.070
 inflatable boards squad scared this great 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.930
