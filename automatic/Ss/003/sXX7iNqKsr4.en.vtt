00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.120
 today we are going to solve the famous 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:34.850
 200 error of a canon printer 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:37.190
 pixma mt 640 without needing to put 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.020
 no computer program or give it 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.790
 hit with a hammer or throw it away 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.030
 window etc etc 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.170
 as you can see 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.170
 in this printer 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.450
 We have the famous of the 200 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.840
 Well, what we have to do, we put out 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.840
 First 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.189
 and let's go out 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.900
 and what we are going to do first is 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.900
 move the car in the printer 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.260
 A) Yes 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.050
 we look 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.630
 there is a button 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.230
 a spring 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.250
 t 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.510
 the second is to be careful because that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.900
 you are going to do with the hand with stained 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.160
 of ink 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:52.250
 well from now on this spring 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:57.340
 we will call it button of the head 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.340
 well then for what it is 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.270
 you see 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.540
 we will have to maintain that spring 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.900
 pulsed 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.409
 both 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.409
 what 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.780
 the cancel button and today's button 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.250
 very well 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.790
 the way to do it will be keep 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.040
 pressed the button on the head 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.850
 followed the cancel button and by 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.240
 last today 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.330
 when the head carriage returns to its 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.970
 site we withdraw the hand 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.770
 but we keep pressing button 1 and the 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.330
 cancel button 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:56.490
 then we release the button 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.490
 and finally we have to have keep 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.110
 pressing the cancel button for 5 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.740
 seconds and that we reset to 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.190
 what is the printer we are going to 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.190
 check it 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.090
 we want to enter the displaced 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.390
 we press the coffee button 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.520
 to the bottom 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.590
 we keep pressing the cancel button 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.590
 and finally the lion 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.230
 it gets us going 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.230
 but it will go back to its place 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.519
 a few seconds 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.980
 we count and I have not expelled 5 seconds 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.980
 on the cancel button 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:25.490
 now he should have retired alone 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.490
 yes 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.140
 and as you see 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.900
 We have reset what is 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.660
 what is the face 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.830
 and with this 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.260
 we talk to each other, I hope that 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.560
 you liked the video that we serve 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.390
 much 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.720
 we have to dance also for others 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.260
 good canon printer models 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.260
 and until next time
