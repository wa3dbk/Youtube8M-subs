00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
very hard you know I think the Croatia

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.080 
very hard you know I think the Croatia
game<00:01:40.100> is<00:01:40.219> master<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.640> us<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.820> know<00:01:40.850> it's<00:01:41.030> the

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.959 
first game and if we can get a good
result<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:42.680> know<00:01:42.799> about<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.189> it<00:01:43.399> sets<00:01:43.700> us<00:01:43.850> up

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
result to know about it it sets us up

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.569

and<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:45.140> know<00:01:45.229> spanner<00:01:45.530> obviously<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.369> team

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
and you know spanner obviously the team

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:47.920 
and you know spanner obviously the team
there<00:01:46.759> for<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.119> reason<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:47.450> know<00:01:47.509> their<00:01:47.750> number

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
there for a reason you know their number

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.749 
there for a reason you know their number
one<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.200> world<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:48.649> there's<00:01:49.399> gonna<00:01:49.490> be<00:01:49.640> no

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
one the world and there's gonna be no

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.550 
one the world and there's gonna be no
easy<00:01:49.789> feat<00:01:50.090> earlier<00:01:50.420> but<00:01:50.719> I'm<00:01:50.869> I<00:01:51.109> think<00:01:51.439> if<00:01:51.500> we

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
easy feat earlier but I'm I think if we

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.529 
easy feat earlier but I'm I think if we
get<00:01:51.679> a<00:01:51.710> good<00:01:51.740> result<00:01:51.979> against<00:01:52.310> Croatian<00:01:52.789> do<00:01:53.390> we

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
get a good result against Croatian do we

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.060 
get a good result against Croatian do we
can't<00:01:53.689> against<00:01:53.899> pain<00:01:54.079> it'll<00:01:54.439> all<00:01:54.530> be<00:01:54.799> set<00:01:54.979> up

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
can't against pain it'll all be set up

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.130 
can't against pain it'll all be set up
for<00:01:55.100> 40<00:01:56.000> when<00:01:56.119> he<00:01:56.179> gets<00:01:56.329> it<00:01:56.450> later<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.929> get<00:01:57.020> us

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
for 40 when he gets it later to get us

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.240
