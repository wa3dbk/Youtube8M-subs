00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
deployed I have it on auto jet pack

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.080 
deployed I have it on auto jet pack
right<00:01:08.830> now<00:01:08.890> if<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:09.280> didn't<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.760> could<00:01:09.910> just

it fast paced just like you'd expect in
a<00:01:22.750> mobile<00:01:23.050> game<00:01:23.080> because<00:01:23.530> it's<00:01:23.680> more<00:01:23.860> it's

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
a mobile game because it's more it's

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.490 
a mobile game because it's more it's
more<00:01:24.220> like<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.640> console<00:01:25.300> based<00:01:25.479> game<00:01:25.720> right<00:01:26.200> but

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
more like a console based game right but

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.749 
more like a console based game right but
we<00:01:26.619> wanted<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:26.950> make<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.190> so<00:01:27.369> that<00:01:27.399> you're<00:01:27.700> not

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.180 
we wanted to make it so that you're not
in<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.509> air<00:01:28.630> longer<00:01:28.990> than<00:01:29.259> you<00:01:29.800> could<00:01:29.950> be<00:01:30.070> in

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
in the air longer than you could be in

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.620 
in the air longer than you could be in
there<00:01:30.340> longer<00:01:30.640> but<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.030> could<00:01:31.210> you<00:01:31.330> could<00:01:31.509> be

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
there longer but you could you could be

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.260 
there longer but you could you could be
in<00:01:31.720> for<00:01:31.750> only<00:01:31.930> 30<00:01:32.229> seconds<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:32.860> land<00:01:33.550> and<00:01:33.820> then

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
in for only 30 seconds and land and then

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.820 
in for only 30 seconds and land and then
it's<00:01:34.450> saved<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.050> you're<00:01:35.200> saved<00:01:35.440> you<00:01:35.590> can<00:01:35.710> turn
