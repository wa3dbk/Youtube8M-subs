00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 do you think Professor Andrei 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:12.840
 well you know i am a little bit displeased over 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:22.920
 how we made sorry progress 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:33.960
 pen forgive so signal on your 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:47.489
 lectures experienced me of course we set 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:52.230
 scores as if in advance of the team we set 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.570
 oh well they were not objective at all 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.520
 objective and of course you need to change them 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.609
 To change these measures Russian many in 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.920
 downward downward 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.250
 degrees below it directly 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.040
 Directly Ivan on site times 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.369
 the top five for strategy strategies were 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.380
 disgusting well somehow doesn't fit 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.820
 No, I will follow less for strategies in 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.310
 explicitly set four because 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.650
 in general, they did not want to invent anything 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.180
 I went out and how much do you put 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.990
 your professor you do not dare, I put 5 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.110
 Well , this does not stick out and you may know 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.810
 you know nobody 5 many teams got 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.560
 such an assessment is already a higher command 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:43.530
 the level of the team that ranked last 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.950
 place in the group and it is very bad it is not 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.600
 5 points yes strategy is three points on 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.310
 strategies because not only go and 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:59.329
 fighting endless fights good 4 page 1 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.329
 until 3 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:11.230
 404 is good and I'll set it up by 4 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.720
 fight we have how much for fight too 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.110
 a little four five bye we have u 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:24.180
 We still have five, in principle, as it were, on 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.180
 four i think everything is very bad andrew 3 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:32.019
 guys I know you 100 I will say that all 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.360
 I didnâ€™t need it 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.769
 put everything right yes but for fights 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.519
 all the same, you can put more because 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.620
 what guys at the time they are wrong 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.370
 fighting the wrong places but in 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.250
 pretty much right 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.250
 the very battle itself they have magic 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.930
 pretty well sent you enemies 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.670
 for fighting would still put 5 strategies 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.150
 again i would put three it would be 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.530
 that is correct 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.730
 station we did not reach the target to 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.459
 pounced he flies and flies I will not 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.110
 answer provocative questions 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:16.000
 depending on what the whispies teddy found 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:18.760
 it's unprofessional up to 44 good 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.239
 we put 4 professor what that pulled for 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.239
 linen
