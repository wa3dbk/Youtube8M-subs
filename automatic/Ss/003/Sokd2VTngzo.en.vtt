00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.500
 cover for macbook air of 2011 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.590
 four hooks to be able to anchor 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.590
 our macbook air 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.890
 well you've already taught the top 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.890
 and now let's see the bottom 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.580
 the lower cover comes with some 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.729
 holes so that the macbook and go can 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.770
 refrigerate better and also has 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.990
 the hooks like the part of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.490
 up to anchor it to our 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.490
 ship and that is fixed 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.320
 the two front hooks are the same 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.110
 than those on the top cover but the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.270
 two back hooks are different already 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.530
 which are corner two to be able to grab 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.530
 better the macbook 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.730
 below we have the four legs 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.730
 padded that are white sponge 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.570
 he nailed her nails so you can see what 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.700
 soft that are to remain marked 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.240
 but after a while that brand 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.240
 disappears 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.090
 Now I will show you how they are placed 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.490
 this is my 13 inch macbook 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.370
 first we will put the bottom part that 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.550
 the four are hooked under pressure 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.550
 corners 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.760
 when it is well fitted we will listen 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.760
 a clack 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.920
 the two back corners have already been 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.920
 well placed 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.159
 now the two ahead are missing 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.560
 we just do a little bit of strength and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.360
 when the clack is that it is already good 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.360
 put on the other side the same 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.470
 once we have finished putting it 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.930
 we go over to see if the four are 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.280
 hooks well placed and if it happens to you like 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.959
 to me that I have left one that is not 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.300
 Well put it back to tighten 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.870
 towards the flag again and it looks good 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.870
 fastened 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.290
 Now let's put the top cover 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.920
 you have to hook it with the four 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.920
 hooks that brings 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.840
 on we put we look that it is well 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.140
 hooked back first what do 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.140
 stop 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.489
 We open the lid like the part of 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.790
 down we just push until we get 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.790
 flag 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.069
 in the other corner the same 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.580
 and check that they are well hooked 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.580
 the four corners alright to the macbook air 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.790
 the opening angle of the macbook air 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.550
 it does not change at all it opens 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.060
 exactly as without the case 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.060
 put 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.740
 As you can see, it just makes the size bigger 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.570
 of our macbook air and in this way 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.169
 we have it protected without it being 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.960
 excessively thick neither nor fat and with 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.199
 the lower legs because it remains 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.870
 protected and will not be scratched by supporting it on 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.610
 some surface that has something with it 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.610
 that we can damage the bottom of 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.430
 our man booker the shots are like 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.410
 you can see all of them uncovered no note 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.680
 for none so much on one side as on the 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.680
 other 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.570
 so if you liked this cover in 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.550
 Amazon you can find them for about 16 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.150
 euros a greeting and see you in the 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.150
