00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320 
to play Super Mario Kart for the Super
Nintendo<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.789> very<00:00:20.970> different<00:00:21.150> from

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
Nintendo and it's very different from

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540 
Nintendo and it's very different from
Super<00:00:21.630> Mario<00:00:21.689> World<00:00:21.990> obviously<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:23.400> it

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
Super Mario World obviously but it

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.609 
Super Mario World obviously but it
starts<00:00:23.820> off<00:00:23.970> very<00:00:24.210> similarly<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.380> doesn't

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
starts off very similarly it doesn't

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.630 
starts off very similarly it doesn't
know<00:00:25.680> anything<00:00:25.710> about<00:00:26.070> how<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.279> play<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> game

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
know anything about how to play the game

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640 
know anything about how to play the game
including<00:00:27.269> which<00:00:27.660> buttons<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
including which buttons do what it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.750 
including which buttons do what it
doesn't<00:00:28.800> know<00:00:28.920> what<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> accelerate<00:00:29.519> button

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
doesn't know what the accelerate button

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.490 
doesn't know what the accelerate button
is<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.599> eventually<00:00:30.929> through<00:00:31.140> trial<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
is but eventually through trial and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.620 
is but eventually through trial and
error<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.830> does<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.610> fact<00:00:32.850> very

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
error it does get it and in fact very

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.180 
error it does get it and in fact very
early<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.230> learned<00:00:34.410> how<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> turn<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> left

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
early on it learned how to turn a left

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.650 
early on it learned how to turn a left
and<00:00:35.460> actually<00:00:35.760> make<00:00:35.910> pretty<00:00:36.360> good<00:00:36.480> progress

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
and actually make pretty good progress

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.950 
and actually make pretty good progress
through<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> course<00:00:37.399> but<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.300> know<00:00:39.420> most

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
through the course but but you know most

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.510 
through the course but but you know most
of<00:00:40.140> them<00:00:40.290> still<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:41.010> didn't<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.399> know

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
of them still just didn't really know

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.619 
of them still just didn't really know
what<00:00:41.640> they<00:00:41.730> were<00:00:41.820> doing<00:00:42.059> didn't<00:00:42.329> press<00:00:42.450> any

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
what they were doing didn't press any

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.750 
what they were doing didn't press any
buttons<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> didn't<00:00:43.739> make<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.860> any<00:00:44.100> distance

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
buttons and didn't make it any distance

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.049 
buttons and didn't make it any distance
but<00:00:45.570> over<00:00:45.870> time<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.289> got<00:00:46.410> better<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.969> here<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
but over time it got better and here it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.510 
but over time it got better and here it
is<00:00:48.180> completing<00:00:49.079> its<00:00:49.230> first<00:00:49.500> lap<00:00:49.890> around<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
is completing its first lap around the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060 
is completing its first lap around the
track<00:00:51.230> obviously<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:52.469> taking<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> very

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
track obviously it's not taking the very

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
track obviously it's not taking the very
best<00:00:53.460> route<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.820> could<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.899> don't<00:00:55.050> really

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
best route it could you don't really

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.119 
best route it could you don't really
want<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.739> you're<00:00:55.829> playing<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
want to do this if you're playing the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
want to do this if you're playing the
game<00:00:56.180> smash<00:00:57.180> against<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> wall<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.020> did

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
game smash against the wall but it did

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.360 
game smash against the wall but it did
make<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.320> around<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> track<00:00:58.800> eventually<00:00:59.250> got

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
make it around the track eventually got

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.060 
make it around the track eventually got
stuck<00:00:59.640> here<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.620> generation

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
stuck here we are with the in generation

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.889 
stuck here we are with the in generation
7<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.699> very<00:01:02.969> first<00:01:03.149> pcs<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.539> made<00:01:03.780> all

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
7 with the very first pcs that made all

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
7 with the very first pcs that made all
the<00:01:03.989> way<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.229> around<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> track<00:01:04.799> five<00:01:05.760> times

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the way that around the track five times

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.120 
the way that around the track five times
to<00:01:06.390> complete<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> course<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:07.950> Time

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
to complete the course this is in Time

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.090 
to complete the course this is in Time
Trial<00:01:08.369> mode<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.700> there's<00:01:08.850> no<00:01:08.970> enemies<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
Trial mode so there's no enemies a

Trial mode so there's no enemies a
generation<00:01:11.100> 7<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.400> actually<00:01:11.610> very<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:12.150> quick

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
generation 7 is actually very very quick

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.719 
generation 7 is actually very very quick
it<00:01:12.659> took<00:01:12.900> 34<00:01:13.560> generations<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.340> beat<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> game

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
it took 34 generations to beat the game

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
it took 34 generations to beat the game
or<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.390> beat<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> level<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.080> Super<00:01:16.740> Mario

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
or to beat the level in Super Mario

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.249 
or to beat the level in Super Mario
World<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.970> could<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.900> kind<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
World you could see there to get kind of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.690 
World you could see there to get kind of
going<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> little<00:01:20.159> bit<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> loop<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.640> it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
going a little bit of a loop and it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
going a little bit of a loop and it
actually<00:01:21.000> did<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.240> multiple<00:01:21.600> times<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> it's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
actually did that multiple times so it's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.740 
actually did that multiple times so it's
it's<00:01:23.549> definitely<00:01:23.909> not<00:01:24.000> using<00:01:24.270> any<00:01:24.390> sort<00:01:24.659> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it's definitely not using any sort of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
it's definitely not using any sort of
efficient<00:01:25.259> path<00:01:25.830> through<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> level<00:01:26.520> but

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
efficient path through the level but

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910 
efficient path through the level but
it's<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> good<00:01:27.570> starting<00:01:27.900> point<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.409> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
it's a good starting point and you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.080 
it's a good starting point and you
really<00:01:29.100> need<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.280> good<00:01:29.400> starting<00:01:29.700> point<00:01:29.880> in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
really need a good starting point in

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.480 
really need a good starting point in
order<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.329> make<00:01:30.600> progress<00:01:30.840> even<00:01:31.350> though<00:01:32.250> it's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
order to make progress even though it's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.100 
order to make progress even though it's
getting<00:01:32.670> turned<00:01:32.970> around<00:01:33.060> some<00:01:33.900> slight

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
getting turned around some slight

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.390 
getting turned around some slight
modifications<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:35.009> prevent<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.369> from

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
modifications will prevent it from

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.950 
modifications will prevent it from
getting<00:01:35.549> turn<00:01:35.790> around<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.240> completing<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
getting turn around and completing the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.050 
getting turn around and completing the
course<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.290> bit<00:01:37.409> faster<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:38.790> this

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
course a little bit faster and now this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420 
course a little bit faster and now this
very<00:01:39.750> first<00:01:40.020> time<00:01:40.320> around<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> entire<00:01:41.040> course

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
very first time around the entire course

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.480 
very first time around the entire course
and<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.540> gets<00:01:42.659> turned<00:01:42.960> around<00:01:43.049> again

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
and there it gets turned around again

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.219 
and there it gets turned around again
the<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:44.909> first<00:01:45.090> time<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.509> got<00:01:45.659> 2<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.079> half

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the very first time it got 2 and a half

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.740 
the very first time it got 2 and a half
minutes<00:01:46.590> which<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:48.000> bad<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.600> world

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
minutes which is very bad the world

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.830 
minutes which is very bad the world

interesting behavior son just did a

interesting behavior son just did a
donut<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:54.869> stopped<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.159> gets

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430

starts crashing against the wall it can
see<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.860> road<00:01:59.189> ahead<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.790> look<00:01:59.880> at

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
see the road ahead of it if you look at

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.880 
see the road ahead of it if you look at
the<00:02:00.090> bottom<00:02:00.420> half<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> screen<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.829> can

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the bottom half of the screen you can

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.020 
the bottom half of the screen you can
see<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.219> road<00:02:02.340> ahead<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> just

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
see the road ahead of it but it just

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.679 
see the road ahead of it but it just
can't<00:02:03.509> quite<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.110> there<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:05.340> species<00:02:05.820> well

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
can't quite get there this species well

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.260 
can't quite get there this species well
really<00:02:07.530> liked<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.250> pipe<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.789> fact<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.149> can

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
really liked this pipe in fact you can

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.570 
really liked this pipe in fact you can
even<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.629> its<00:02:09.899> course-correcting<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.280> keep

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
even see its course-correcting to keep

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.140 
even see its course-correcting to keep
driving<00:02:12.000> into<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> pipe

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
driving into the pipe

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.360 
driving into the pipe
it<00:02:13.750> really<00:02:14.349> liked<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.950> pipe<00:02:15.840> Mario<00:02:17.370> anyway

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
it really liked the pipe Mario anyway

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.420 
it really liked the pipe Mario anyway
eventually<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.680> actually<00:02:20.680> started<00:02:21.129> doing<00:02:21.220> a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
eventually it's actually started doing a

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.880 
eventually it's actually started doing a
lot<00:02:21.579> better<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:22.720> one<00:02:22.989> species<00:02:23.319> here

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
lot better this one species here

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.179 
lot better this one species here
actually<00:02:24.129> beat<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.120> best<00:02:25.450> time<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.920> previous

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
actually beat the best time the previous

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.830 
actually beat the best time the previous
best<00:02:27.489> time<00:02:27.700> was<00:02:27.849> over<00:02:28.150> two<00:02:28.269> minutes<00:02:28.569> when<00:02:28.720> this

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
best time was over two minutes when this

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.809 
best time was over two minutes when this
one<00:02:28.989> came<00:02:29.170> along<00:02:29.349> this<00:02:29.739> one<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.609> little

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
one came along this one is just a little

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.699 
one came along this one is just a little
over<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.299> minute<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.689> a<00:02:31.750> half<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.349> this<00:02:32.530> was

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
over a minute and a half so this was

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.020 
over a minute and a half so this was
actually<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:33.040> very<00:02:33.189> first<00:02:33.579> one<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:33.939> would

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
actually the very first one that I would

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.720 
actually the very first one that I would
consider<00:02:34.299> pretty<00:02:35.109> good<00:02:35.379> it<00:02:35.980> still<00:02:36.250> drove<00:02:36.579> on

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
consider pretty good it still drove on

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.000 
consider pretty good it still drove on
the<00:02:36.819> dirt<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.060> lot<00:02:37.239> now<00:02:38.230> eventually<00:02:38.680> we<00:02:38.769> put

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the dirt a lot now eventually we put

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.309 
the dirt a lot now eventually we put
this<00:02:39.129> in<00:02:39.400> Grand<00:02:39.700> Prix<00:02:39.939> mode<00:02:40.150> fighting<00:02:40.959> against

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
this in Grand Prix mode fighting against

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.089 
this in Grand Prix mode fighting against
other<00:02:41.730> enemies<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.209> 50cc<00:02:43.659> and<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.980> would

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
other enemies and 50cc and it would

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.069 
other enemies and 50cc and it would
actually<00:02:45.340> did<00:02:45.430> pretty<00:02:45.639> well<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:46.450> sometimes

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
actually did pretty well but sometimes

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.099 
actually did pretty well but sometimes
things<00:02:47.409> like<00:02:47.560> this<00:02:47.620> were<00:02:48.220> happening<00:02:48.750> which<00:02:49.750> is

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
things like this were happening which is

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.479 
things like this were happening which is
pretty<00:02:50.409> classic<00:02:50.709> Mario<00:02:51.250> Kart<00:02:51.989> but<00:02:52.989> uh<00:02:53.019> yeah<00:02:54.010> it

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
pretty classic Mario Kart but uh yeah it

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.580 
pretty classic Mario Kart but uh yeah it
you<00:02:54.849> know<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.720> did<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.109> did<00:02:56.230> do<00:02:56.319> pretty<00:02:56.440> well

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
you know it did it did do pretty well

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.170 
you know it did it did do pretty well
given<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.040> their<00:02:57.159> enemies<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:57.670> actually<00:02:58.090> he

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
given that their enemies and actually he

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.339 
given that their enemies and actually he
probably<00:02:58.209> helped<00:02:58.629> it<00:02:58.720> evolve<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.200> there

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
probably helped it evolve that there

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.809 
probably helped it evolve that there
were<00:02:59.409> a<00:02:59.470> lot<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.650> enemies<00:02:59.920> here's<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.639> very

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
were a lot of enemies here's the very

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.379 
were a lot of enemies here's the very
best<00:03:01.180> simulation<00:03:02.109> in<00:03:02.500> 50cc<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:04.150> can<00:03:04.299> actually

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
best simulation in 50cc you can actually

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.849 
best simulation in 50cc you can actually
see<00:03:04.689> it<00:03:04.810> staying<00:03:05.079> on<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.290> road<00:03:05.439> most<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.799> the

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
see it staying on the road most of the

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.020 
see it staying on the road most of the
time<00:03:06.040> it's<00:03:06.220> navigating<00:03:06.700> pretty<00:03:06.879> well

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
time it's navigating pretty well

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.099 
time it's navigating pretty well
sometimes<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.540> goes<00:03:07.599> off<00:03:07.780> in<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:07.989> dirt

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
sometimes it goes off in the dirt

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.869 
sometimes it goes off in the dirt
actually<00:03:08.769> sometimes<00:03:09.159> that<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.459> hits<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.730> dirt

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
actually sometimes that it hits the dirt

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.589 
actually sometimes that it hits the dirt
it's<00:03:10.569> taking<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.230> more<00:03:11.439> efficient<00:03:11.859> path<00:03:12.069> and

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
it's taking a more efficient path and
