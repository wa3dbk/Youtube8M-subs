00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.859
 good very good morning first of all 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:09.120
 I take to greet the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.150
 efficient cycling in colombia that we 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.370
 follow and good surely that that we 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.590
 accompany along those three weeks and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.869
 it's nice to see that they support us and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 let's hope we offer you a nice 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.689
 show and be able to carry what 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.550
 we are looking for that is to win the tour of 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.939
 france and it has meant to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.140
 winner your first tour of france good 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.849
 the truth is that everyone has always 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.170
 fact that the tour is the tour if it is a 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.000
 race career most important to 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.670
 world by stages- I try to be 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.650
 quiet and see how a career like 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 because that branch to see some not 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.879
 committing pressures me to many things 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 finally we always run the same 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.360
 equipment in 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.010
 in all races do not take out those that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.800
 eight world tour races are rebellious 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.239
 it's nine here but it's really good 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.649
 a career that fills you up a lot with finding 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.290
 view of the public was impressive what 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.000
 long of the time trial surely 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.620
 when we reach the mountain stages 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.850
 it will be people's risks that is what 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.790
 says that everyone who is a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.119
 show I think that as a career it is 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.740
 a career that where is unique that what 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.899
 that attracts is a lot of public moves many 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.850
 more like that and good is the first time that what 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.799
 I'm going to live and well, what a pleasure to be able to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.929
 to be here is the realization of a dream 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.509
 because I believe that a cyclist in 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.670
 Colombia dreams of running the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.600
 spin and the tour but but initially the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.700
 tour attracts like dream since 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 I started from very small whose intensity 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 I wanted to run france tour as 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.700
 the dream the longing I am now here and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.890
 well let's say now if this dream 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.100
 I hope I can get to Paris in one 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.649
 piece will be a nice show and good 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.330
 especially good to be able to offer that 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.860
 show 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.990
 and give a hand to anyone what is the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.390
 main goal and good to give the best 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.730
 just how it was prepared before 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.380
 come to the tour how it feels physically 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.080
 He already told us about his mood, which is 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.720
 the best and how he lived that pre that last 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.310
 preparation stage with good air the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.050
 truth is that I have prepared 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.520
 made throughout the year 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.690
 finally to get a big one from the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.670
 accumulation of kilometers and the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.230
 accomplishment of many things throughout 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.640
 of the year the careers that I've done 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.470
 stage races that in fact 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.000
 and if a good series of competition 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.560
 competition came against the six- day 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.690
 of the race before the tour I think they are 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.920
 good days of career I was twenty 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.740
 days after the bayern rubbing in 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.990
 Colombia 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.690
 live to face switzerland trains when 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.180
 very well in colombia in switzerland I think that 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.490
 I used to tune a little that that that 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.070
 race pace and well now we are 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.510
 here and good boys is something very 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.340
 special for all the truth is that the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.980
 dreams, it's up to fight for them to be 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.300
 fulfill but it's worth dreaming I hope 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.490
 that many of those who dream someday 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.020
 be in a big wintour fight for that 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.090
 dream of grief can be very nice 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.940
 it can cost sacrifice dedication and 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.980
 delivery but it is the reward of many 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.480
 many times sacrifices and then nothing 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.310
 done to save all the people in 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.900
 Colombia especially my family my 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.820
 woman being in BoyacÃ¡ and you can see a 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.820
 strong hug for everyone in colombia
