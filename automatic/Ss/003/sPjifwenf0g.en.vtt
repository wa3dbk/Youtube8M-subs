 front was not coming 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:20.959
 and therefore vain as he

 towing it an off-track position does it really is where it is verified 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.309
 that has no damage on the track and will grant result opens the 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:10.099

 fortunately here are two things that are important and we have already seen 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.709
 last week the technology and the preparation of the proposals is 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.509
 essential is fully prepared to study objects a simulacrum 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.479
 that was also previously 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.099

 despite the green zone of sight of the simple view of course it has 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.529
 some small damages but sure to do it will be already ela 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:14.229
 the one of the mechanics city of the hotel expertise the one that percent exactly 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:18.390
 if it suffers some other structural damage arlanzón or not at the moment in which 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.630
 what we got to see did not have any significant damage to a normalized program 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.330
 normal activities and how many this with the benefit of 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.190
 We did not have injuries
