00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.650
 create tropical jungle in siberian 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.990
 conditions is it possible of course with 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.180
 confidence say flower growers who 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.579
 not one century grown in indoor 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.810
 greenhouses and window sills 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.360
 home palms 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.570
 these plants look very impressive 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.129
 especially in rooms with high ceilings 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.739
 live quite a long time and does not require 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.809
 Special and overly complex care 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.670
 the purchase of the pool should immediately be settled on 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.110
 that they will not be small 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.480
 tiny plant which you are now 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.149
 they buy you to grow from 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.110
 one and a half meters and above and need to buy 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.610
 from the point that there was a place for her 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.770
 but here we have three types 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.510
 palm it 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.670
 washington cicas or winstone but cicas 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.910
 he certainly tall will not grow he 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.520
 only a maximum of 80 centimeters grows well 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.880
 very, very rarely reaches a meter 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.440
 care height no matter how much 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.929
 demanding about how they all have 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.000
 palm air humidity is because 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:24.150
 what they sold grow tropical 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.659
 forests where high humidity but when 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.900
 skeleton spraying often in winter 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.250
 cool and content is desirable for 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.189
 all field 10-15 degrees well max 12 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.320
 well for them is winter and that was if not 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.409
 able to keep them cool 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.420
 indoors before that somehow shield a little 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.680
 put away from the battery so as not to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.200
 so dried up leaves and tips of the stake but 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.630
 protect from drafts but in the winter 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.729
 airing time 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.969
 0 this is the content of their temperature 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.880
 18 to 23 degrees as it is quite 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.100
 normal but desirable to make 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.420
 fresh air for and that's exactly summer they 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.170
 prefer fresh air but 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.630
 sprinkles like them more often as usual 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.299
 preferably but still very palm trees 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.370
 once a week you need to do a shower in the bathroom 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.700
 because they very strongly collects on 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.750
 yourself dust and cabs leaves it to not 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.630
 Klitschko wound up 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.520
 to prevent shower and grow 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.890
 palm tree can only be made from seed but 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.630
 will take more than one year as a plant 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.330
 growing very slowly 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.160
 the only way to get it is 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.710
 purchase it in a specialized 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.840
 the store repot caught everything very 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.300
 rarely a dollar in 23 years 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.090
 when we already reached the plant 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.220
 sizes but big yes and there is no possibility 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.470
 it is necessary to transplant it at least once a year 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.390
 change the top layer of the earth but at the same time 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.180
 must be very careful not to damage 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.850
 roots roots when the roots are damaged 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.150
 the plants are sick for a very long time and 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.250
 all their palm may die 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.390
 necessarily very mandatory drainage 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.480
 because not a bottom 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.060
 does not tolerate stagnant water in the roots and 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.080
 so better drainage and not to feel sorry for him 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.140
 pots for transplanting better not deep a 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.080
 wider let it be lower but wider as 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.300
 would their roots grow 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.790
 superficial as a palm tree is not well tolerated 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.680
 root damage if transplanted 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.340
 root system was damaged 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.620
 it is useful to create a lower heating up 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.049
 25-30 degrees to improve rooting 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.040
 the first time after transplanting leaves 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.590
 palm trees 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.110
 for the plant to consume less water 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.540
 on evaporation for young plants better 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.269
 take a light primer well conductive 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.580
 air when transplanting adults finger in 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.739
 the soil should contain clay for 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.200
 good growth is needed regularly and 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.489
 organic fertilizer is also desirable 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.079
 which, incidentally, the muse is replaced and 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.510
 mineral supplements 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.000
 feed the plants to as usual 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.220
 all from spring to autumn long ago you are 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.640
 better in reduced concentration than 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.579
 for example now as a different fertilizer 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.400
 many can alternate for example root 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.299
 top dressing with leaf crawling on the leaves 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.489
 top dressing 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.739
 do not wash the wax on the leaves 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.090
 or remove the negligent pubescence 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.460
 touching leaves 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.919
 do not tolerate and can walk in the tip 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.139
 abundant washing place 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.000
 spray palm leaves so that 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.850
 warm water flowed over the leaves 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.740
 that's enough and as mentioned 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.870
 for the prevention of all kinds 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.360
 diseases we understand everything very rarely 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.610
 amazed but mostly in it either 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.380
 spider mite or thrips 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.260
 Well, paradise prevention would be 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.729
 enough to not get infected 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.060
 This plant is well and so now all these 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:00.000
 herbs is just who would have a lot more 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.580
 of course do the usual soap solution 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.370
 Now economic to breed 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.919
 for processing but it's enough one 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.190
 soul because the soap for palm she 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.740
 as if a little bit it makes itself felt 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.990
 by the way when they renew the leaves of the earth 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.479
 can cover the film as abundant 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.940
 watering a palm tree can be harmful 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.490
 get carried away with watering especially winter 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.650
 time when if 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.810
 the plants are still cool 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.120
 indoors it was better not to get carried away 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.190
 water must be necessarily dark 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.759
 warm at room temperature and 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.590
 necessarily suited because if 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.750
 pour cold water and cold 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.830
 indoors, spotting can begin 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.190
 leaves but it is in many palm it on 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.319
 what is winston Judas here is washington u 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.389
 it is natural and yellowing 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:50.900
 leaves well, do not push dying lower 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.330
 leaves 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.580
 but here if he just started to turn yellow you 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.919
 not immediately you can not cut a sheet 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.349
 wait until he completely withers away 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.630
 and then only trim if he only 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:05.210
 started and cut off so he all at once 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.060
 turn yellow next how would it be better to wait 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.180
 when we were very full of children 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.710
 the date-palm and coconut in terms 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.680
 view of energy specialists 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.870
 plants are the best home palms 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.840
 they have a strong enough character 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.020
 in order to clear the space from 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.490
 energy pessimism and cute bullet so 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.800
 what if you have the worst 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.289
 pessimistic mood or so 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.630
 completely got whiners that only 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.940
 do what complains of fate get 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.880
 I never understand 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.979
 but experts say not worth it 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.469
 place it in the bedroom even if 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.630
 space allows it is considered that 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:47.150
 feathery palm is best placed in 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.979
 living room or holly palm tree created for 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.409
 order to create mood 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:54.349
 so if you put it in the bedroom 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:56.719
 then your sleep will disturb 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:59.540
 feathery palm helps people 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:02.150
 who suffer from lung diseases and 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.850
 he have these plants do not give started 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.980
 diseases spread and develop into 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.930
 chronic form 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.180
 true or not argue do not undertake 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:14.060
 check anyway you will not regret 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.630
 because in any case, the palm tree in the house 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.630
 beautiful
