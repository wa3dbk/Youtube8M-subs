 template with pre entry this wants 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.910
 say the players get along better or 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.120
 worse what is represented in the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.410
 performance when playing according to a 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.969
 series of attributes as is your 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.860
 nationality the league in which they play 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.410
 your team and even training 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.090
 favorite in such a case if it is surrounded by 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.530
 players of their same nationality is a 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.210
 same team from their same league these 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.320
 players are going to perform better so 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.450
 so much if you look now when 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.090
 let's change to buscats call run today 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.289
 just like after that that serves and you 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.510
 will sit a little in this template 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.489
 Italian this will contribute in the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.610
 better compensation than as you can see above 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.920
 just passed to 90 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.750
 as I tell you this at the end is reflected in 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.520
 the field in which the players 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.900
 unmarked better are more accurate in their 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.910
 passes 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.350
 In short, your team 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.360
 will play better if we are focused 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.340
 so keep in mind that the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.370
 compensation is a very very very very factor 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.890
 important in FIFA Ultimate Team fijaros 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.450
 that also when we change to the forest 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.610
 by spalletti an Italian coach and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.530
 in addition to the same training that has 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.490
 team goes up to 100% and the team is 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.110
 perfect 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.930
 In addition to a template you can create 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.640
 several that also on the idea of ​​fifa 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.409
 ultimate not only created a team but 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.670
 that you have several with different 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.250
 characteristics to play different 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.290
 competitions 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.930
 apart from the fixed attributes such as 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.850
 shooting speed the attributes of 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.100
 the players there are a number of variants 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.620
 that also influence each chromium and are 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.729
 morality the way we say would be 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.470
 resistance and contracts the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.820
 contracts represent a few matches that 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.290
 can play in this case royce has 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.670
 three contracts which means that 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.080
 can play three more matches once 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.080
 that you run out you can not continue playing 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.060
 and for this we have a series of cards 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.280
 of consumables that are not players and 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.620
 that help us keep our 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.450
 players to the dream of morality and 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.370
 giving you some points of 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.730
 certain attributes for a match or 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.879
 in this case as you are going to see 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.200
 renewing the opposite of new framework 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.849
 King comes back to have a lot of match 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.860
 for nothing but how we earn money and 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.049
 how do we get players apart from 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.700
 buying envelopes then the most fun and 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.040
 the most interesting thing about the latter and 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.299
 also negotiate with the codes first 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.150
 We can sell our own 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.940
 players we can create auctions in the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.280
 that we put a base price so that 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.090
 people bid or we can even put a 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.550
 purchase price now 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.020
 the one that directly pays the price with 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.580
 more obvious will take 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.460
 with a time limit and the players 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.890
 They enter decades 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.170
 In the same way we can do the action 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.780
 reverse that through a series of 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.220
 filters that the fifa gives us 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.530
 do our search for players to 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.780
 find the auction that we most 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.850
 interest in here let's make a filter 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.190
 of auction for a left side 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.220
 Spanish of the club so we found a 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.390
 bunch of jordi alba besides putting in 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.640
 auction will make a direct purchase 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.320
 we can include several cards and the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.240
 amount of money to know if at 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.620
 seller is interested but how we play 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.570
 that in the end what interests us 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.310
 us and we have two big 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.320
 modalities are the cups or 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.300
 tournaments are direct eliminatory with 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.670
 different requirements when playing 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.170
 with a certain electronic template 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.930
 fact includes some new tournaments 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.570
 every weekend and the other great way 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.010
 is the practically classic mode of 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.900
 fifa seasons in which along 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.000
 of five divisions 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.010
 we play seasons divided into 10 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.290
 matches in which according to our 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.019
 result at the end of these 10 games 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.269
 we can climb down or stay and 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.760
 even winning the league what entails a 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.349
 biggest prize so nothing friends this 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.180
 only the tip of the iceberg of what 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.879
 fifa ultimate team we will follow 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.890
 explaining more moment we want you 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.379
 you get the basic contracts 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.319
 compenetration game modes but 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.730
 there's a lot more here than scratching 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.480
 we will continue explaining in new videos 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.480
 until next time
