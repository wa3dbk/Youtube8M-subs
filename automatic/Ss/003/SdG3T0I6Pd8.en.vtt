dripping<00:02:31.980> jug<00:02:32.220> lines<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.550> get

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
dripping jug lines and so you can get

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.430 
dripping jug lines and so you can get
out<00:02:35.760> there<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.030> catch<00:02:36.180> some<00:02:36.420> catfish<00:02:36.840> so

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
out there and catch some catfish so

closed L polyethylene foam and I've just
drilled<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.389> hole<00:04:39.419> here<00:04:39.979> let's<00:04:40.979> just<00:04:41.069> stick

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
drilled a hole here let's just stick

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.580 
drilled a hole here let's just stick
this<00:04:41.789> through<00:04:41.970> here<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.449> can<00:04:42.630> see<00:04:42.870> through

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
this through here so you can see through

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.570 
this through here so you can see through
the<00:04:43.710> bottom<00:04:44.069> with<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.490> 1/2<00:04:44.759> inch<00:04:44.970> drill<00:04:45.750> bit<00:04:45.810> and

then<00:04:51.090> I've<00:04:51.210> got<00:04:51.389> a<00:04:51.419> piece<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.690> PVC<00:04:51.990> here<00:04:52.650> cut<00:04:53.039> to

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
then I've got a piece of PVC here cut to

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
then I've got a piece of PVC here cut to
the<00:04:54.090> width<00:04:54.300> of<00:04:55.789> this<00:04:56.789> foam<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.419> I'm<00:04:57.750> just

the width of this foam and I'm just

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.379 
the width of this foam and I'm just
going<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.199> jam<00:04:58.530> this<00:04:58.710> piece<00:04:58.979> of<00:04:59.130> PVC<00:04:59.340> inside<00:05:00.210> of

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
going to jam this piece of PVC inside of

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.420 
going to jam this piece of PVC inside of
here<00:05:00.599> you<00:05:01.080> don't<00:05:01.229> have<00:05:01.349> to<00:05:01.500> glue<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:02.039> or<00:05:02.250> do

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
here you don't have to glue it or do

I<00:05:06.900> have<00:05:07.620> used<00:05:08.599> heavy<00:05:09.599> plastic<00:05:10.370> drinking

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
I have used heavy plastic drinking

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.659 
I have used heavy plastic drinking
straws<00:05:11.870> to<00:05:12.870> do<00:05:13.050> this<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:13.650> it<00:05:13.979> has<00:05:14.159> worked<00:05:14.370> well

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
straws to do this and it has worked well

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.570 
straws to do this and it has worked well
is<00:05:15.000> also<00:05:15.659> it<00:05:15.900> doesn't<00:05:16.259> last<00:05:16.530> as<00:05:16.830> long<00:05:17.009> but<00:05:17.430> it

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
is also it doesn't last as long but it

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.830 
is also it doesn't last as long but it

option is just to take them piece of

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.450 
option is just to take them piece of
foam<00:05:37.020> like<00:05:37.320> this<00:05:37.590> without<00:05:37.860> drilling<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.430> hole

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
foam like this without drilling a hole

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.480 
foam like this without drilling a hole
in<00:05:38.849> it<00:05:40.280> take<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.340> piece<00:05:41.610> of<00:05:41.639> duct<00:05:41.969> tape<00:05:43.490> I'll

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
in it take a piece of duct tape I'll

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.629 
in it take a piece of duct tape I'll
just<00:05:44.669> wrap<00:05:44.969> this<00:05:45.240> real<00:05:45.930> good<00:05:46.259> right<00:05:47.219> here<00:05:47.370> in

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
just wrap this real good right here in

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.120 
just wrap this real good right here in
the<00:05:47.940> middle<00:05:49.490> with<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.520> piece<00:05:50.789> of<00:05:50.909> duct<00:05:51.120> tape<00:05:52.130> get

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
the middle with a piece of duct tape get

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.760 
the middle with a piece of duct tape get
it<00:05:53.250> on<00:05:53.370> there<00:05:53.580> good<00:05:53.610> and<00:05:53.909> tight<00:05:54.229> the<00:05:55.229> reason

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
it on there good and tight the reason

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.760 
it on there good and tight the reason
behind<00:05:55.919> putting<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.669> duct<00:05:56.909> tape<00:05:57.650> onto<00:05:58.650> the

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
behind putting the duct tape onto the

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.480 
behind putting the duct tape onto the
foam<00:05:59.039> is<00:05:59.310> because<00:06:00.030> if<00:06:00.240> you<00:06:00.509> don't<00:06:01.069> then<00:06:02.069> when

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
foam is because if you don't then when

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.270 
foam is because if you don't then when
the<00:06:02.639> line<00:06:02.909> cuts<00:06:03.840> into<00:06:04.229> this<00:06:04.380> foam<00:06:04.740> it<00:06:05.069> will

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
the line cuts into this foam it will

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.659 
the line cuts into this foam it will
eventually<00:06:05.969> cut<00:06:06.300> through<00:06:06.659> the<00:06:06.810> foam<00:06:07.050> and

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
eventually cut through the foam and

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.820 
eventually cut through the foam and
it'll<00:06:08.669> ruin<00:06:08.819> your<00:06:09.090> jug<00:06:09.300> line<00:06:09.479> so<00:06:10.199> you<00:06:10.590> just

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
it'll ruin your jug line so you just

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.529 
it'll ruin your jug line so you just
have<00:06:10.979> something<00:06:11.280> on<00:06:11.490> there<00:06:11.789> to<00:06:12.090> keep<00:06:12.270> that

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
have something on there to keep that

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.050 
have something on there to keep that
line<00:06:12.780> from<00:06:13.110> cutting<00:06:13.530> through<00:06:13.770> that<00:06:13.949> foam<00:06:14.280> then

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
line from cutting through that foam then

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.309 
line from cutting through that foam then
it<00:06:15.240> fit<00:06:15.479> is<00:06:15.690> gets<00:06:16.590> you<00:06:16.710> in<00:06:16.800> really<00:06:17.009> good<00:06:17.250> shape

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
it fit is gets you in really good shape
