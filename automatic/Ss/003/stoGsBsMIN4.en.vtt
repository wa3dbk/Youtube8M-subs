hello<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.199> Natasha<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:02.010> from<00:00:02.310> PTY<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:03.090> we're

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hello I'm Natasha I'm from PTY and we're

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.660 
hello I'm Natasha I'm from PTY and we're
here<00:00:03.810> today<00:00:03.959> showing<00:00:04.380> off<00:00:04.620> our<00:00:04.830> nano<00:00:05.160> coating

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
here today showing off our nano coating

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.720 
here today showing off our nano coating
technology<00:00:06.270> now<00:00:06.990> I've<00:00:07.140> got<00:00:07.379> two<00:00:07.620> tissues<00:00:07.859> once

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
technology now I've got two tissues once

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.430 
technology now I've got two tissues once
treated<00:00:09.000> with<00:00:09.330> our<00:00:09.480> technology<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.200> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
treated with our technology and the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.070 
treated with our technology and the
other<00:00:10.590> one<00:00:10.800> isn't<00:00:11.040> our<00:00:11.969> coding<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> thousand

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
other one isn't our coding is a thousand

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.810 
other one isn't our coding is a thousand
times<00:00:13.230> thinner<00:00:13.530> than<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.799> human<00:00:13.860> hair<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.759> you

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
times thinner than a human hair so you

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.700 
times thinner than a human hair so you
can't<00:00:15.120> see<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> difference<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.410> can't

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
can't see a difference and you can't

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.380 
can't see a difference and you can't
feel<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> difference<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:17.970> I'm<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.210> pop

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
feel the difference but I'm going to pop

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.939 
feel the difference but I'm going to pop
these<00:00:18.539> into<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.900> water<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.380> you'll<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.830> able

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
these into the water and you'll be able

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.910 
these into the water and you'll be able
to<00:00:20.130> notice<00:00:20.430> something<00:00:20.670> very<00:00:20.820> special<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> if<00:00:22.769> i

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
to notice something very special so if i

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.540 
to notice something very special so if i
put<00:00:23.160> both<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.400> these<00:00:23.699> into<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> water

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
put both of these into the water

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.669 
put both of these into the water
you<00:00:27.119> begin<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.960> one<00:00:28.230> has<00:00:28.470> got<00:00:28.650> very

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
you begin to see that one has got very

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.540 
you begin to see that one has got very
very<00:00:29.310> wet<00:00:29.460> while<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> other<00:00:30.539> one

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
very wet while the other one

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.480 
very wet while the other one
I<00:00:32.610> stayed<00:00:33.180> nice<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.480> dry

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
I stayed nice and dry

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.170 
I stayed nice and dry
and<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.910> fact<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.570> put<00:00:37.260> more<00:00:37.470> water<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.980> there<00:00:38.220> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and in fact I put more water on there it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.090 
and in fact I put more water on there it
will<00:00:39.300> simply<00:00:39.690> beat<00:00:39.870> up<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.230> roll<00:00:40.380> off

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
will simply beat up and roll off

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.819 
will simply beat up and roll off
now<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.699> reason<00:00:42.910> it<00:00:43.149> does<00:00:43.329> this<00:00:43.690> because<00:00:44.289> our

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
now the reason it does this because our

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.160 
now the reason it does this because our
hydrophobic<00:00:45.789> layer<00:00:45.910> that<00:00:46.449> we've<00:00:46.629> applied<00:00:46.930> to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
hydrophobic layer that we've applied to

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.040 
hydrophobic layer that we've applied to
the<00:00:47.289> surface<00:00:47.530> has<00:00:48.339> neutralized<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.750> tissue

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
the surface has neutralized that tissue

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.040 
the surface has neutralized that tissue
so<00:00:50.860> water<00:00:51.129> molecules<00:00:51.760> are<00:00:52.059> more<00:00:52.480> attracted<00:00:53.019> to

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
so water molecules are more attracted to

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.069 
so water molecules are more attracted to
themselves<00:00:53.589> than<00:00:54.039> they<00:00:54.070> are<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.640> tissue

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
themselves than they are to the tissue

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.729 
themselves than they are to the tissue
now<00:00:56.079> if<00:00:56.320> we<00:00:56.469> do<00:00:56.649> this<00:00:56.829> on<00:00:56.980> electronic<00:00:57.579> devices

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
now if we do this on electronic devices

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.529 
now if we do this on electronic devices
if<00:00:59.739> I<00:00:59.860> take<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.129> normal<00:01:00.610> circuit<00:01:01.059> board<00:01:01.269> and<00:01:01.449> I

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
if I take a normal circuit board and I

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.840 
if I take a normal circuit board and I
put<00:01:01.780> water<00:01:02.049> on<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.409> their<00:01:02.589> we<00:01:03.190> see<00:01:03.399> that<00:01:03.610> it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
put water on to their we see that it

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.420 
put water on to their we see that it
spreads<00:01:04.330> out<00:01:04.570> on<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.960> surface<00:01:05.440> now<00:01:06.250> this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
spreads out on the surface now this

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.800 
spreads out on the surface now this
means<00:01:06.729> that<00:01:06.850> you're<00:01:07.030> likely<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.360> get<00:01:07.509> a<00:01:07.570> lot<00:01:07.780> of

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
means that you're likely to get a lot of

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.249 
means that you're likely to get a lot of
corrosion<00:01:08.200> building<00:01:08.830> up<00:01:08.950> on<00:01:09.130> there<00:01:10.259> however

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
corrosion building up on there however

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.100 
corrosion building up on there however
if<00:01:11.979> I<00:01:12.159> do<00:01:12.220> that<00:01:12.580> with<00:01:13.270> one<00:01:13.509> which<00:01:13.720> has<00:01:13.930> our

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
if I do that with one which has our

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.040 
if I do that with one which has our
splash<00:01:14.619> proof<00:01:14.950> nano<00:01:15.280> coating<00:01:15.819> on<00:01:15.970> you<00:01:16.690> can<00:01:16.869> see

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
splash proof nano coating on you can see

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.969 
splash proof nano coating on you can see
that<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.319> droplets<00:01:17.860> form<00:01:18.520> beans<00:01:18.850> instead<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
that the droplets form beans instead and

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.880 
that the droplets form beans instead and
in<00:01:21.340> fact<00:01:21.580> if<00:01:21.759> I<00:01:21.880> give<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.179> a<00:01:22.240> little<00:01:22.360> twist

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
in fact if I give it a little twist

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.210 
in fact if I give it a little twist
they'll<00:01:23.890> simply<00:01:24.250> roll<00:01:24.520> up

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.580

so for device manufacturers like
Motorola<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:31.610> TCL<00:01:32.320> what<00:01:33.320> they<00:01:33.470> find<00:01:33.770> is<00:01:33.980> on

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
Motorola and TCL what they find is on

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.860 
Motorola and TCL what they find is on
their<00:01:34.280> products<00:01:34.760> instead<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.270> a<00:01:35.390> buildup<00:01:35.720> of

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
their products instead of a buildup of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.810 
their products instead of a buildup of
corrosion<00:01:36.230> developing<00:01:36.980> because<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.490> waters

corrosion developing because the waters

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.210 
corrosion developing because the waters
sitting<00:01:38.150> on<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:38.450> surface<00:01:38.660> of<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.140> device<00:01:39.440> the

remains corrosion free
and<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:45.290> was<00:01:45.439> really<00:01:45.770> for<00:01:45.979> protection<00:01:46.490> from

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.980 
slightly thicker and that way the water
is<00:02:04.159> not<00:02:04.430> interacting<00:02:05.119> with<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.360> electronics

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
is not interacting with the electronics

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.620 
is not interacting with the electronics
and<00:02:06.259> all<00:02:06.549> so<00:02:07.549> we've<00:02:07.729> had<00:02:07.759> that<00:02:08.090> phone<00:02:08.360> there

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
and all so we've had that phone there

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.840 
and all so we've had that phone there
under<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.110> water<00:02:09.319> for<00:02:09.679> an<00:02:09.770> hour<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.310> 34

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
under the water for an hour and 34

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.750 
under the water for an hour and 34
minutes<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.540> far<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.890> it's<00:02:13.220> doing<00:02:13.459> absolutely

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
minutes so far and it's doing absolutely

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.890 
minutes so far and it's doing absolutely
fine

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.959
