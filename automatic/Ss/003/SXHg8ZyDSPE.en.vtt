but the reason why I thought that would
be<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.540> good<00:01:55.690> idea<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:56.080> do<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:56.230> video<00:01:56.530> is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
be a good idea to do this video is

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.190 
be a good idea to do this video is
because<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.970> know<00:01:58.090> video<00:01:58.720> mixing<00:01:59.110> is

because you know video mixing is

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.740 
because you know video mixing is
