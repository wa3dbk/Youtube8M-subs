00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.040
 expensive and valuable and 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.170
 hello to all dear viewers subscribers 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.900
 just channel guests in this release 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.609
 diablo 3 we play a nun and today 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.739
 I am going to talk about us 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.390
 waiting when playing these characters and also about 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:24.199
 tom what clothes skills and of course 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.179
 weapons are most beneficial for her to play 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.890
 nun pretty simple and if desired and 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.720
 Crites can be raised almost to 3 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.609
 billion but of course for this us 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.160
 need appropriate clothes 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.899
 and these clothes from our girls just 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.670
 which, when used by 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.929
 their intended purpose give us a very and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.210
 very good bonuses 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.250
 and for example set in and allows us to wear 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.109
 immediately four mantra that very 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.600
 affects our stamina and attack 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.160
 on site sound splits the crowd into the island 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.230
 environment for our health 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.940
 I'm not talking about the bucket not thousands of storms 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.589
 which allows us to make of 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.710
 crazy nuns don't go knocks 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.870
 destroying everything in our path our 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.489
 nun use the element of light but it 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.109
 absolutely no effect on our 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.790
 skills because each of them has 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.210
 special runes that allow 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.710
 to put 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.710
 absolutely any elemental damage 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.530
 passivki our nuns are very peculiar 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.360
 and most of them give us a very 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.340
 good bonuses here we can understand 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.200
 the speed of our run maximum reserve 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.210
 spirit and its regeneration rate 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.460
 boost attack speed when used 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.070
 some skills will reduce the rollback time 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.640
 These skills to understand very well your 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.720
 stamina 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.070
 It has done more damage and more damage and more damage and 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.070
 so much more 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.990
 honestly i dont have the slightest 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.910
 concepts why our nuns made such 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.770
 defensive skill and because bonuses 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.360
 which they give are dim compared to 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.640
 those rocks that we have besides 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.400
 them it concerns skills blinding 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.190
 a flash of breath is not a weight peace and holy 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.080
 saints in the tab of concentration and 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.030
 both paid special attention to this skill 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.310
 like seven parties estimates mysterious 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.080
 ally and sobriety mean seven 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.030
 sides of the world allows to apply to all 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.950
 hits with not such indicators of damage 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.230
 mysterious ally when used 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.060
 one of the runes allows us to call on 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.790
 help allies who raises 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.860
 not bad our indicators but about sobriety 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.750
 allows us very quickly our spirit to harm 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.800
 thread or raise our protection on some kind 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.800
 short period of time 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.569
 As for the skill which region from 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.060
 us the spirit is the best choice here 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.280
 will certainly fists of thunder and the case in 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.170
 that what exactly string acceleration of all 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.480
 Four skills they riga not most 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.189
 of the spirit 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.500
 Well, something like this and in conclusion I want 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.239
 say a few words about a character case 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.250
 the fact that the nun I play is already very 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.799
 I like it a long time because the damage 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.209
 which I put really huge right 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.889
 gladly recommended a nun 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.870
 novice because the character is very 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.870
 easy to manage our without having 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.819
 some good things 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.680
 legendary kits and so on on 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.700
 that's all for everyone thanks for watching everyone 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.700
 good luck and all bye
