keeping<00:01:49.649> these<00:01:49.799> devices<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.610> sync<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.240> driving

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
keeping these devices in sync is driving

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.469 
keeping these devices in sync is driving
us<00:01:52.259> crazy

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.969 

so<00:01:59.179> we've<00:02:00.179> got<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.689> great<00:02:01.020> solution<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.740> this

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
so we've got a great solution for this

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.910 
so we've got a great solution for this
problem<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.869> we<00:02:03.869> think<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.229> solution<00:02:04.619> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
problem and we think this solution is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.550 
problem and we think this solution is
our<00:02:05.100> next<00:02:05.490> big<00:02:05.700> insight<00:02:06.179> which<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.319> we're

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
our next big insight which is we're

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.699 
our next big insight which is we're
going<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.799> demote<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:09.149> pc<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> mac<00:02:09.959> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
going to demote the pc in the mac to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.570 
going to demote the pc in the mac to
just<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.519> device<00:02:12.379> just<00:02:13.379> like<00:02:13.560> an<00:02:13.739> iphone<00:02:13.860> and

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
just be a device just like an iphone and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.289 
just be a device just like an iphone and
ipad<00:02:15.330> or<00:02:15.360> ipod<00:02:15.989> touch<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.970> we're<00:02:17.970> going<00:02:18.269> to

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
ipad or ipod touch and we're going to

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.720 
ipad or ipod touch and we're going to
move<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.170> digital<00:02:19.650> hub<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.129> center<00:02:20.549> of<00:02:20.580> your

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
move the digital hub the center of your

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.979 
move the digital hub the center of your
digital<00:02:21.030> life<00:02:21.709> into<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.799> cloud<00:02:23.780> because<00:02:24.780> all

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
digital life into the cloud because all

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.259 
digital life into the cloud because all
these<00:02:25.379> new<00:02:25.620> devices<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.400> communications

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
these new devices have communications

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.420 
these new devices have communications
built<00:02:27.510> into<00:02:27.810> them<00:02:27.959> they<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:28.769> all<00:02:28.890> talk<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
built into them they can all talk to the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.390 
built into them they can all talk to the
cloud<00:02:29.700> whenever<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:30.690> want<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.940> now<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:34.560> I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
cloud whenever they want and so now if I

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.970 
cloud whenever they want and so now if I
get<00:02:35.610> something<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:36.090> my<00:02:36.329> iPhone<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.170> sent<00:02:37.769> up<00:02:37.920> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
get something on my iPhone it sent up to

get something on my iPhone it sent up to
the<00:02:38.099> cloud<00:02:38.430> immediately<00:02:38.760> let's<00:02:39.390> say<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> take

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
the cloud immediately let's say I take

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.199 
the cloud immediately let's say I take
some<00:02:40.049> pictures<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.860> those<00:02:41.730> pictures<00:02:42.000> are

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
some pictures with it those pictures are

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.080 
some pictures with it those pictures are
in<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> cloud<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.140> they<00:02:43.920> are<00:02:44.069> now<00:02:44.280> pushed

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
in the cloud and they are now pushed

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.720

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.740 
think the cloud is just a hard disk in
the<00:03:06.239> sky<00:03:07.010> right<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.269> take<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.299> bunch<00:03:09.569> of

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
the sky right and you take a bunch of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.069 
the sky right and you take a bunch of
stuff<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:11.190> put<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.489> in<00:03:11.700> your<00:03:11.880> dropbox<00:03:12.720> or

stuff and you put it in your dropbox or

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.590 
stuff and you put it in your dropbox or
your<00:03:13.260> idisk<00:03:13.769> or<00:03:14.100> whatever<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:15.060> transfers

it<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.109> cloud<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.530> stores<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.069> then

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
it up to the cloud and stores and then

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.280 
it up to the cloud and stores and then
you<00:03:17.280> drag<00:03:17.850> whatever<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.329> want<00:03:18.540> back<00:03:18.750> out<00:03:19.019> on

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
you drag whatever you want back out on

you drag whatever you want back out on
your<00:03:19.410> other<00:03:19.560> devices<00:03:20.000> we<00:03:21.000> think<00:03:21.299> it's<00:03:21.480> way

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
your other devices we think it's way

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.509 
your other devices we think it's way
more<00:03:21.959> than<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:23.480> we<00:03:24.480> call<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.810> iCloud<00:03:25.530> now

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
more than that and we call it iCloud now

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.620 
more than that and we call it iCloud now
iCloud<00:03:27.239> stores<00:03:27.959> your<00:03:28.349> content<00:03:29.040> in<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:30.329> cloud

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
iCloud stores your content in the cloud

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.979 
iCloud stores your content in the cloud
and<00:03:31.970> wirelessly<00:03:32.970> pushes<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.810> all<00:03:33.959> your

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
and wirelessly pushes it to all your

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.250 
and wirelessly pushes it to all your
devices<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.819> automatically<00:03:36.450> uploads<00:03:37.049> it

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
devices so it automatically uploads it

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.220 
devices so it automatically uploads it
stores<00:03:38.099> it<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.519> automatically<00:03:39.299> pushes<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:40.049> to

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
stores it and automatically pushes it to

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.490 
stores it and automatically pushes it to
all<00:03:40.349> your<00:03:40.590> other<00:03:40.620> devices<00:03:41.239> but<00:03:42.239> also<00:03:42.500> it's

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
all your other devices but also it's

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.539 
all your other devices but also it's
completely<00:03:44.430> integrated<00:03:44.730> with<00:03:45.299> your<00:03:45.510> apps<00:03:45.720> and

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
completely integrated with your apps and

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.640 
completely integrated with your apps and
so<00:03:47.549> everything<00:03:47.970> happens<00:03:48.630> automatically<00:03:49.319> and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
so everything happens automatically and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.930 
so everything happens automatically and
there's<00:03:50.370> nothing<00:03:50.700> new<00:03:51.389> to<00:03:51.810> learn<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.870> just<00:03:55.200> all

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
there's nothing new to learn it just all

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.280 
there's nothing new to learn it just all
works

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
works

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:08.660 
works
it<00:03:58.650> just<00:03:59.040> works<00:04:04.310> now<00:04:06.049> you<00:04:07.049> might<00:04:07.230> ask<00:04:07.670> why

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
it just works now you might ask why

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.130 
it just works now you might ask why
