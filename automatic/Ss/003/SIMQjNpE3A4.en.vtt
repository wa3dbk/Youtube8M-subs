00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.810
 once you have demonstrated something of 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:31.349
 collaborate our winds to pay 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.349
 the 500 requirements we are going to fry

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.070
 said coach 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:22.330
 we only have a couple of minutes back by 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.330
 each side 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.280
 once we have already had two or 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.500
 three minutes for each face we're going to 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.379
 make a little bit of water not much a 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.730
 little bit of water people there are people who 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.730
 normally he is 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.850
 the same liquid that brings the boat the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.560
 keep us we will not do it 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.260
 precisely because we have not spent it 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.560
 a trick of the pot and second because the 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.710
 canned liquid usually brings 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.140
 stabilizers preservatives and things like that 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.170
 that we add a little water and the 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.220
 We left 12 minutes in the water 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.600
 confectionery 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.540
 well, we already have our 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.079
 movements of the piquillo confitado and 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.539
 here instead of the blender 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.509
 we're going to be assassinating factor yo 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.789
 greeting a boat of cream small plants 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:30.780
 when it has 300 milliliters 200 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:34.889
 milliliters let's make the cream pot 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.569
 to cook and then our 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.169
 piquillo peppers 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:44.279
 and we're going to crush all this with the 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.279
 sweetheart helicopter 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.780
 the virus database has been 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:56.540
 updated we abandon our sauce 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.820
 so that it starts starting to 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.910
 taste 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.300
 We are letting it thicken to taste 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:09.280
 while we make the tuna loins 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.620
 we fry and we are rectifying it of salt and 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.880
 pepper while it's starting it's going 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.060
 trying and we will rectify salt 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.710
 pepper meanwhile another bit of 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.960
 frying oil and what is the 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.650
 peppers I say peppers peppers 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.190
 like brass thread this we already have the 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.190
 Tuna loins lamas have already seasoned by 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.740
 both sides mass paprika and 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.400
 that regiment received them orders 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.340
 strict goyo's simply 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.680
 pass them through beaten eggs that had 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.260
 the manias and little bit of salt says 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.890
 you simply go for beaten egg 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:52.000
 it will be visual a chef from his town who 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.000
 be what it is called 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.270
 armed robbery bony and his mother 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.849
 that you have to pass it simply by 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.860
 egg and fry 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.889
 very good we already have our steaks 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.830
 fried these there are two options or the 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:14.930
 we serve as I am going to do 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.870
 just put it on the plate 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.979
 and have the sauce next 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:26.300

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.480
 that makes 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.500
 his mother 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:42.490
 she told me she is in the steaks 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:45.070
