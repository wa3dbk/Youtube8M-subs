00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
instead we just run and then he is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.499 
instead we just run and then he is
scripted<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.369> run<00:01:47.520> through<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> door<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.390> he

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
scripted to run through the door so he

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.760 
scripted to run through the door so he
won't<00:01:48.659> bother<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.049> anymore<00:01:49.229> once<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.649> go

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
those guys go down you can decide if you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.300 
those guys go down you can decide if you
want<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> use<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> beam<00:01:55.829> rifle

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I like having tons of ammo left over in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.990 
I like having tons of ammo left over in
the<00:01:58.259> human<00:01:58.560> sniper<00:01:58.799> rifle<00:01:59.219> find<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.820> it's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the human sniper rifle find that it's

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.969 
the human sniper rifle find that it's
slightly<00:02:00.299> easier<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> use<00:02:01.020> plus<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.710> shoot

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
slightly easier to use plus I can shoot

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.609 
slightly easier to use plus I can shoot
two<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.549> three<00:02:02.759> shots<00:02:03.030> off<00:02:03.240> quickly<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
two to three shots off quickly and it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.760 
two to three shots off quickly and it
won't<00:02:04.890> overheat<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:07.140> here<00:02:07.439> there<00:02:07.590> are<00:02:07.619> two

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
won't overheat and so here there are two

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.499 
won't overheat and so here there are two
brutes<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.369> definitely<00:02:08.879> want<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> take<00:02:09.300> out

target<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.660> hull<00:03:00.900> then<00:03:01.410> sure<00:03:01.800> tons<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.490> tons

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
target the hull then sure tons and tons

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.550 
target the hull then sure tons and tons
and<00:03:02.790> tons<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.150> shots<00:03:03.420> will<00:03:03.600> kill<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.959> but<00:03:04.440> if

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
and tons of shots will kill it but if

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.680 
and tons of shots will kill it but if
you<00:03:04.709> get<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.160> think<00:03:05.490> four<00:03:05.880> perfect<00:03:06.630> shots

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
you get I think four perfect shots

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.330 
you get I think four perfect shots
usually<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.470> want<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.620> shoot<00:03:07.740> at<00:03:07.830> least<00:03:07.860> six

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
usually you want to shoot at least six

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.280 
usually you want to shoot at least six
shots<00:03:08.640> at<00:03:08.820> each<00:03:09.240> of<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> at<00:03:09.750> one<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
shots at each of the at one of the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.380 
shots at each of the at one of the
engines<00:03:10.650> then<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.640> should<00:03:11.880> take<00:03:12.030> out<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
engines then that should take out the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.570 
engines then that should take out the
Phantom<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.959> then<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.770> meantime<00:03:14.010> in

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
Phantom and then in the meantime in

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.250 
Phantom and then in the meantime in
between<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:15.570> try<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.810> do<00:03:15.990> your<00:03:16.020> best

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
between just try and do your best

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.199 
between just try and do your best
lasering<00:03:16.890> thought<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.400> one<00:03:17.550> was<00:03:17.760> gonna<00:03:17.910> hit

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
lasering thought that one was gonna hit

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.020 
lasering thought that one was gonna hit
but<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.810> didn't<00:03:19.170> am<00:03:19.260> i<00:03:19.560> discouraged<00:03:20.100> no<00:03:20.640> am<00:03:20.880> I

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
but it didn't am i discouraged no am I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.390 
but it didn't am i discouraged no am I
gonna<00:03:21.209> keep<00:03:21.450> laser<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.989> fools<00:03:22.260> yes<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.280> there

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
gonna keep laser in fools yes and there

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.220 
gonna keep laser in fools yes and there
are<00:03:23.489> tons<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.790> missile<00:03:24.090> pods<00:03:24.239> around<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.989> map

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
are tons of missile pods around the map

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.410 
are tons of missile pods around the map
so<00:03:25.590> we're<00:03:25.680> gonna<00:03:25.769> look<00:03:25.950> around<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.670> there<00:03:27.300> are

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
so we're gonna look around and there are

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.930 
so we're gonna look around and there are
several<00:03:27.780> waves<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.650> phantoms<00:03:29.220> three<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.700> four

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
several waves of phantoms three to four

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.850 
several waves of phantoms three to four
depending<00:03:30.300> on<00:03:30.390> how<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.600> count<00:03:30.870> them<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.290> so

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
depending on how you count them and so

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.710 
depending on how you count them and so
here<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.550> wave<00:03:32.970> where<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.420> want<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.630> be

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
here is a wave where you want to be

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.650 
here is a wave where you want to be
positioned<00:03:34.290> on<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.500> left<00:03:34.920> side<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.640> this<00:03:36.330> ship

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
positioned on the left side of this ship

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.420 
positioned on the left side of this ship
so<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:36.900> when<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.200> rotates<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.950> can<00:03:38.100> actually

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
so that when it rotates you can actually

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.490 
so that when it rotates you can actually
get<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.700> front<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.269> engine<00:03:39.480> notice<00:03:40.380> how

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
get the front of the engine notice how

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.720 
get the front of the engine notice how
that<00:03:40.560> goes<00:03:40.830> down<00:03:40.980> immediately

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
that goes down immediately

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.699 
that goes down immediately
that<00:03:42.239> kills<00:03:42.570> all<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.170> enemies<00:03:43.500> who<00:03:43.650> are

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
that kills all of the enemies who are

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.380 
that kills all of the enemies who are
gonna<00:03:43.830> drop<00:03:44.160> except<00:03:44.580> for<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.820> ones<00:03:45.000> who<00:03:45.300> were

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
gonna drop except for the ones who were

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.900 
gonna drop except for the ones who were
already<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.200> dropping<00:03:46.680> animation<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.820> we

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
already in the dropping animation so we

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.610 
already in the dropping animation so we
use<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> quick<00:03:48.390> rocket<00:03:48.840> running<00:03:49.170> up<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.380> stairs

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
use a quick rocket running up the stairs

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.009 
use a quick rocket running up the stairs
to<00:03:49.739> take<00:03:49.980> them<00:03:50.160> out<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.670> then<00:03:51.540> look<00:03:51.720> around

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
to take them out and then look around

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.509 
to take them out and then look around
and<00:03:52.140> see<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.320> there's<00:03:52.470> any<00:03:52.709> other<00:03:52.980> enemies

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
and see if there's any other enemies

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.390 
and see if there's any other enemies
left<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.200> at<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.470> point<00:03:55.709> in<00:03:55.860> time<00:03:56.040> there's

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
left and at this point in time there's

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.460 
left and at this point in time there's
two<00:03:56.910> lasers<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.450> are<00:03:57.900> really<00:03:58.200> easy<00:03:58.350> to

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
two lasers that are really easy to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.830 
two lasers that are really easy to
access<00:03:58.980> one<00:03:59.519> was<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.910> corner<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.450> then

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
access one was in the corner and then

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.330 
access one was in the corner and then
one<00:04:00.989> was<00:04:01.140> actually<00:04:01.410> right<00:04:01.590> there<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.950> my<00:04:02.100> right

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
one was actually right there to my right

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.190 
one was actually right there to my right
that<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.550> could<00:04:02.760> have<00:04:02.850> grabbed<00:04:03.180> but<00:04:03.600> I<00:04:03.660> noticed

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
that I could have grabbed but I noticed

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.960 
that I could have grabbed but I noticed
that<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.470> next<00:04:04.830> phantom<00:04:05.220> was<00:04:05.310> coming<00:04:05.640> in<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:05.880> I

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
that the next phantom was coming in so I

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.520 
that the next phantom was coming in so I
wanted<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.300> prioritize<00:04:06.870> shooting<00:04:07.260> at<00:04:07.350> him

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
wanted to prioritize shooting at him

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.190 
wanted to prioritize shooting at him
notice<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.519> for<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.150> phantom<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.900> just

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
notice that for this phantom I just

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.810 
notice that for this phantom I just
shoot<00:04:10.470> at<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.890> anywhere<00:04:11.370> because<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.730> have

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
shoot at it anywhere because I have

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.699 
shoot at it anywhere because I have
infinite<00:04:12.209> missile<00:04:12.660> pod<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.080> don't<00:04:13.380> have<00:04:13.560> to

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
infinite missile pod I don't have to

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.920 
infinite missile pod I don't have to
worry<00:04:13.920> about<00:04:14.220> shooting<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.090> perfect<00:04:15.600> bullets

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
worry about shooting the perfect bullets

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.740 
worry about shooting the perfect bullets
at<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.169> perfect<00:04:16.560> place<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.570> part<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
at the perfect place and part of the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.449 
at the perfect place and part of the
risk<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.200> targeting<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.799> phantom<00:04:20.160> first

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
risk with targeting the phantom first

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.159 
risk with targeting the phantom first
there<00:04:20.700> is<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.060> Banshees<00:04:21.510> will<00:04:21.660> actually

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
there is that the Banshees will actually

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.900 
there is that the Banshees will actually
take<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.440> out<00:04:22.800> with<00:04:23.070> their<00:04:23.220> blue<00:04:23.400> gun<00:04:23.640> or<00:04:23.820> with

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
take you out with their blue gun or with

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.460 
take you out with their blue gun or with
their<00:04:24.060> green<00:04:24.270> bombs<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.140> want<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.380> be

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
their green bombs so you want to be

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.660 
their green bombs so you want to be
careful<00:04:25.740> usual

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
careful usual

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.280 
careful usual
shooting<00:04:27.090> one<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.450> two<00:04:27.600> missile<00:04:27.900> pods<00:04:28.050> at<00:04:28.230> a

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.170 
shooting one to two missile pods at a
banshee<00:04:28.500> will<00:04:28.740> make<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:29.040> fly<00:04:29.220> away<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:29.760> if<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
banshee will make it fly away and if the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.970 
banshee will make it fly away and if the
two<00:04:30.390> missile<00:04:31.020> pods<00:04:31.170> connect<00:04:31.620> then<00:04:31.770> it'll

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
two missile pods connect then it'll

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.320 
two missile pods connect then it'll
actually<00:04:32.160> take<00:04:32.490> out<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.790> Banshee<00:04:33.120> which<00:04:33.240> is

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
actually take out the Banshee which is

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.210 
actually take out the Banshee which is
pretty<00:04:33.540> nice

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
pretty nice

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.710 
pretty nice
so<00:04:35.220> also<00:04:35.670> notice<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.150> there's<00:04:36.330> different

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
so also notice that there's different

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.390 
so also notice that there's different
positions<00:04:37.260> like<00:04:37.410> you<00:04:37.560> start<00:04:37.860> out<00:04:37.980> shooting

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
positions like you start out shooting

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400 
positions like you start out shooting
towards<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.910> front<00:04:39.180> right<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.720> then<00:04:40.200> there's

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
towards the front right and then there's

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.520 
towards the front right and then there's
a<00:04:40.470> huge<00:04:40.830> income<00:04:41.660> incoming<00:04:42.660> enemy<00:04:42.990> wave<00:04:43.200> on<00:04:43.440> the

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
a huge income incoming enemy wave on the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.160 
a huge income incoming enemy wave on the
left<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.100> then<00:04:44.760> there's<00:04:45.420> just<00:04:45.600> gonna<00:04:45.720> be<00:04:45.810> all

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
left and then there's just gonna be all

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.810 
left and then there's just gonna be all
these<00:04:46.320> banshees<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.950> phantoms<00:04:47.340> this<00:04:47.610> one

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
these banshees and phantoms this one

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.970 
these banshees and phantoms this one
comes<00:04:48.150> up<00:04:48.270> through<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.570> middle<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.530> here

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
comes up through the middle and so here

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.620 
comes up through the middle and so here
I<00:04:50.130> probably<00:04:50.520> could<00:04:50.970> have<00:04:51.060> used<00:04:51.300> one<00:04:51.480> of<00:04:51.510> the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
I probably could have used one of the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.560 
I probably could have used one of the
missile<00:04:51.960> pods<00:04:52.110> on<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.830> ground<00:04:53.160> but<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.180> decided

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
missile pods on the ground but I decided

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.300 
missile pods on the ground but I decided
that<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:54.960> wanted<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.560> make<00:04:55.710> sure<00:04:55.740> that<00:04:55.890> I<00:04:56.130> hit

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
that I wanted to make sure that I hit

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.550 
that I wanted to make sure that I hit
this<00:04:56.490> guy<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:56.970> nail<00:04:57.090> them<00:04:57.240> perfectly<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:57.990> you

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
this guy and nail them perfectly and you

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.620 
this guy and nail them perfectly and you
want<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.800> aim<00:04:59.010> by<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.400> way<00:04:59.610> for<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.150> engines

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
want to aim by the way for the engines

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.710 
want to aim by the way for the engines
slightly<00:05:01.410> above<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.890> engine<00:05:02.490> it's<00:05:03.390> pretty

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
slightly above the engine it's pretty

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.690 
slightly above the engine it's pretty
difficult<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.590> little<00:05:04.830> finicky<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.340> make

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
difficult and a little finicky to make

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.610 
difficult and a little finicky to make
sure<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.420> it's<00:05:06.570> on<00:05:06.690> it<00:05:06.840> perfectly<00:05:07.260> you<00:05:07.440> see

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
sure that it's on it perfectly you see

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.740 
sure that it's on it perfectly you see
that<00:05:07.770> sometimes<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.310> locks<00:05:08.520> on<00:05:08.730> to<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.210> front

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
that sometimes it locks on to the front

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.050 
that sometimes it locks on to the front
turret<00:05:09.990> or<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.680> side<00:05:10.890> turret<00:05:11.310> so<00:05:11.760> you<00:05:11.850> want

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
turret or to the side turret so you want

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.900 
turret or to the side turret so you want
to<00:05:12.120> aim<00:05:12.210> slightly<00:05:12.750> above<00:05:13.620> not<00:05:13.980> directly<00:05:14.640> at

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
to aim slightly above not directly at

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.520 
to aim slightly above not directly at
otherwise<00:05:15.450> it<00:05:15.660> might<00:05:15.780> target<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.350> other

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
otherwise it might target the other

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.830 
otherwise it might target the other
pieces<00:05:16.830> so<00:05:17.220> here<00:05:17.700> we<00:05:17.850> picked<00:05:18.060> up<00:05:18.180> our<00:05:18.360> second

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
pieces so here we picked up our second

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.170 
pieces so here we picked up our second
laser<00:05:18.960> which<00:05:19.650> we<00:05:19.830> can<00:05:19.980> use<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.160> take<00:05:20.460> out<00:05:20.670> these

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
laser which we can use to take out these

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.300 
laser which we can use to take out these
guys<00:05:21.480> there<00:05:22.020> I<00:05:22.050> clip<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.470> wing<00:05:22.650> but<00:05:22.950> it<00:05:23.040> didn't

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
guys there I clip the wing but it didn't

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.410 
guys there I clip the wing but it didn't
take<00:05:23.400> out<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.700> baby<00:05:23.850> fully<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:26.180> so<00:05:27.180> you<00:05:27.270> got

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
take out the baby fully and so you got

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.270 
take out the baby fully and so you got
some<00:05:27.630> policemen<00:05:28.200> in<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.470> background<00:05:28.980> hope

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
some policemen in the background hope

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.630 
some policemen in the background hope
that<00:05:29.520> everybody<00:05:30.060> in<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.330> world<00:05:30.540> is<00:05:30.780> okay<00:05:31.640> now

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
that everybody in the world is okay now

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.160 
that everybody in the world is okay now
I'm<00:05:32.790> looking<00:05:33.090> around<00:05:33.180> for<00:05:33.390> a<00:05:33.540> missile<00:05:33.960> pod

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
I'm looking around for a missile pod

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.170 
I'm looking around for a missile pod
because<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.620> run<00:05:34.800> out<00:05:34.920> of<00:05:34.950> laser<00:05:35.280> pretty<00:05:35.730> darn

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
because you run out of laser pretty darn

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.300 
because you run out of laser pretty darn
quick<00:05:36.600> but<00:05:37.110> there<00:05:37.260> tend<00:05:37.440> to<00:05:37.470> be<00:05:37.560> tons<00:05:38.070> of

quick but there tend to be tons of

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.030 
quick but there tend to be tons of
missile<00:05:38.640> pods<00:05:38.820> on<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.450> ground<00:05:39.720> and<00:05:40.050> we<00:05:40.860> want

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
missile pods on the ground and we want

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.940
