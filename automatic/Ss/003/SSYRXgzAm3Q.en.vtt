DivX Presents:
Two Minutes With the Samsung Galaxy Note

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
Hi! This is Jim with DivX.

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:16.000
One of cool things about working here is we get to
try out all the new gadgets and devices that play 
DivX video

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:22.500
It's often Blu-ray players and thin TVs, and new 
tablets and phones, but this one really caught 
our eye. 

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:27.525
It’s the Samsung Galaxy Note and it's a new phone 
thats right in the sweet spot between a tablet and
a phone.

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:32.025
I’ve been calling it a phablet … or a tab-lone, 
but that's not really catching on. 

00:00:32.026 --> 00:00:36.025
The much smarter people at Samsung are promoting it
as “a new kind of smartphone”. 

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:36.900
Let's check it out!

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:45.000
So when you look at the Note next to a Galaxy S II
phone with the 4.2 inch screen, the Galaxy Tab at 
7.7 inch screen

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.900
and then the larger Tab at 10.1 inches, you can see
that the 5.3 inch screen of the Note is really an 
interesting size.

00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:53.200
It's kind of right in between a phone and a tablet.

00:00:54.201 --> 00:01:00.000
And speaking of size -- if you’re wondering, which
most of my friends were, it still fits comfortably 
in a pants pocket.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:05.200
Now with this in your not going to want to go 
jogging or do your calisthenics – but you probably 
don’t excercise in jeans anyway. 

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:10.200
The point is, you don’t need a man-purse to 
carry this around, It still fits comfortably 
in your pocket. 

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:16.200
And if that’s not incentive enough, the Note plays 
DivX HD video and video is what really makes this 
device so cool. 

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:20.200
As you can see, it plays DivX video beautifully. 
It’s a great size for movies on the go,

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:23.900
especially when you don’t want the guy next to you
on the airplane leaning over to catch a peek.

00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:31.200
This phone has 16GB of memory so I could easily 
store around 10 standard definition or 5 high 
definition DivX movies. 

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.200
And one last thing, some people were curious to know 
how it felt to use the Note as a phone. 

00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:39.200
And honestly it doesn’t feel much different. You be 
the judge and see how it looks. 

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:42.500
It’s certainly easier than this...

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:46.500
Hello...hey Mom...no...it's not a good time...
I'm in the middle of something...
