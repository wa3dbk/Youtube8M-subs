00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
other thing that happens is it's the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.230

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
think this is really more than the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.010 
think this is really more than the
calorie<00:01:59.909> number<00:02:00.210> being<00:02:00.390> right<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:00.869> the

a day I mean that's just the truth but

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.540 
a day I mean that's just the truth but
what<00:02:22.410> you've<00:02:22.560> probably<00:02:22.890> been<00:02:23.070> eating<00:02:23.400> and

when I start to dig down with most of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.570 
when I start to dig down with most of
the<00:02:25.230> people<00:02:25.380> who<00:02:25.590> ask<00:02:25.770> these<00:02:25.950> questions<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.550> I

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
the people who ask these questions and I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.740 
the people who ask these questions and I
start<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> figure<00:02:27.060> out<00:02:27.150> ok<00:02:27.300> we'll<00:02:27.450> talk<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.720> me

most<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.150> people<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:39.990> talked<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.500> you

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
most of the people that I talked to you

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.050 
most of the people that I talked to you
or<00:02:40.710> telling<00:02:40.980> me<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.280> these<00:02:41.460> are<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.910> is

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
or telling me that these are this is

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.050 
or telling me that these are this is
just<00:02:42.240> too<00:02:42.390> much<00:02:42.510> food<00:02:42.950> we're<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.400> very<00:02:44.730> high

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
just too much food we're on a very high

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.650 
just too much food we're on a very high
carbohydrate<00:02:46.100> fairly<00:02:47.100> low<00:02:47.400> protein<00:02:47.820> fairly

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
carbohydrate fairly low protein fairly

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.510 
carbohydrate fairly low protein fairly
low<00:02:48.840> fat<00:02:49.170> diet<00:02:49.590> most<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.130> their<00:02:50.220> food<00:02:50.400> was

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
low fat diet most of their food was

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.960 
low fat diet most of their food was
coming<00:02:50.700> from<00:02:50.910> carbs<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:52.770> that's<00:02:53.640> where<00:02:53.880> this

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
coming from carbs so that's where this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.820 
coming from carbs so that's where this
all<00:02:54.120> makes<00:02:54.360> perfect<00:02:54.420> sense<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.260> there's<00:02:55.800> a

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
all makes perfect sense so there's a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.770 
all makes perfect sense so there's a
little<00:02:55.980> bit<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.160> science<00:02:56.400> behind<00:02:56.850> why<00:02:57.360> that's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
little bit of science behind why that's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.620 
little bit of science behind why that's
the<00:02:57.930> case<00:02:57.960> but<00:02:59.150> essentially<00:03:00.150> without<00:03:00.300> getting

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
the case but essentially without getting

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.450 
the case but essentially without getting
into<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.080> hormonal<00:03:01.620> breakdown<00:03:02.430> of

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
into all the hormonal breakdown of

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.150 
into all the hormonal breakdown of
everything<00:03:02.880> your<00:03:03.840> body<00:03:04.020> has<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.740> switch<00:03:05.130> that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
everything your body has a switch that

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.000 
everything your body has a switch that
goes<00:03:05.520> off<00:03:05.850> ok<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.870> switch<00:03:07.050> says<00:03:07.320> stop

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
goes off ok and the switch says stop

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.130 
goes off ok and the switch says stop
eating<00:03:08.280> now<00:03:08.400> because<00:03:08.820> you're<00:03:09.000> full<00:03:09.270> you<00:03:09.900> don't

interesting<00:04:10.950> science<00:04:11.220> behind<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.520> as<00:04:11.730> well

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
interesting science behind that as well

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.480 
interesting science behind that as well
but<00:04:12.630> what<00:04:13.290> happens<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.830> people<00:04:14.070> when<00:04:14.400> they

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
but what happens to people when they

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.789 
but what happens to people when they
start<00:04:14.760> doing<00:04:14.910> phase<00:04:15.240> one<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.959> they<00:04:16.500> start

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
start doing phase one is they start

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.440 
start doing phase one is they start
eating<00:04:16.950> foods<00:04:17.370> that<00:04:17.640> trigger<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.090> their<00:04:18.209> body
