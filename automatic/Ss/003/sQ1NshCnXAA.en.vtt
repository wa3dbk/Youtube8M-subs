highlights in there now I thought I was
smart<00:00:21.720> by<00:00:22.080> first<00:00:22.650> bleaching<00:00:23.039> all<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.189> darker

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
smart by first bleaching all the darker

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.310 
smart by first bleaching all the darker
parts<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.939> then<00:00:24.060> bleached<00:00:24.359> gee<00:00:24.600> blown<00:00:24.990> apart

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
parts and then bleached gee blown apart

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.710

and<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.039> did<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.400> two<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:26.730> three<00:00:27.029> times<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:27.630> I

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and I did it two or three times like I

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.150 
and I did it two or three times like I
bleached<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.170> two<00:00:28.349> or<00:00:28.500> three<00:00:28.680> times<00:00:28.920> and
