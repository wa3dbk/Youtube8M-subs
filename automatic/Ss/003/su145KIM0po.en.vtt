00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.310 

Oh

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.410 

hey

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.060 

so<00:01:14.420> that's<00:01:14.540> all<00:01:14.659> there<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.530> verses<00:01:15.950> in

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
so that's all there is to the verses in

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.000 
so that's all there is to the verses in
the<00:01:16.100> course<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:17.540> I'm<00:01:17.990> ready<00:01:18.290> now<00:01:18.350> business

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
the course the I'm ready now business

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:28.420 
the course the I'm ready now business
the<00:01:19.850> cords<00:01:20.180> are<00:01:20.390> aligner<00:01:26.650> 3d<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:27.920> usually<00:01:28.369> just

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
the cords are aligner 3d I usually just

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.219 
the cords are aligner 3d I usually just
straight<00:01:28.820> power<00:01:29.060> cord<00:01:29.360> those<00:01:29.570> because<00:01:29.869> it's<00:01:30.080> a

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
straight power cord those because it's a

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.249 
straight power cord those because it's a
pretty<00:01:30.470> built-up<00:01:30.890> part<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.600> only<00:01:33.140> thing

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
pretty built-up part so the only thing

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.950 
pretty built-up part so the only thing
left<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.920> solo<00:01:34.390> so<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:35.540> is<00:01:35.659> how<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.899> goes

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
left is the solo so this is how it goes

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.580 
left is the solo so this is how it goes
so<00:01:36.770> when<00:01:36.890> they're<00:01:37.549> playing<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.909> E<00:01:37.940> minor<00:01:38.590> it

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
so when they're playing the E minor it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.109 
so when they're playing the E minor it
changes<00:01:40.070> slightly<00:01:40.340> between<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.970> two

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
changes slightly between the two

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.090 
changes slightly between the two
different<00:01:41.450> times<00:01:41.600> for<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:41.990> soul<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:42.979> the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
different times for the soul so the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:57.880 
different times for the soul so the
first<00:01:43.280> time<00:01:43.610> is<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.850> little<00:01:43.970> simpler<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:44.750> goes

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.670 

hey<00:01:58.890> how'd<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.790> fifth<00:02:00.300> fret<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.350> slide

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
hey how'd your fifth fret so you slide

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.080 
hey how'd your fifth fret so you slide
on<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> web<00:02:05.070> through<00:02:05.220> 12th<00:02:05.640> through<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.850> same

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
on the web through 12th through the same

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:19.750 
on the web through 12th through the same
two<00:02:06.330> fingers<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.800> hold<00:02:08.010> that<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.430> then

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.280 

and<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.210> second<00:02:21.570> time<00:02:21.720> through<00:02:21.990> there's<00:02:22.230> a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
and the second time through there's a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:30.430 
and the second time through there's a
couple<00:02:22.500> more<00:02:22.770> notes

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.490 

so<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.739> add<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.040> batsmen<00:02:36.110> sad<00:02:37.110> parts

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
so you just add on batsmen sad parts

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.460 
so you just add on batsmen sad parts
part<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> most<00:02:38.239> stretching<00:02:39.239> or<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.349> could

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
part of the most stretching or you could

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.260 
part of the most stretching or you could
play<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:42.260> sorry

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.590 

that's<00:02:47.270> probably<00:02:47.480> easier

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.980
