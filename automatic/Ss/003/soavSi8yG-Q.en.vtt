come in and people are like always on

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.750 
come in and people are like always on
the<00:00:31.199> stage<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.619> must<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> super<00:00:32.309> Christian

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
the stage you must be a super Christian

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
the stage you must be a super Christian
and<00:00:33.290> that's<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.250> case<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:36.120> any<00:00:36.360> stretch

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and that's not the case by any stretch

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.840 
and that's not the case by any stretch
to<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> means<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.739> think<00:00:38.430> that's<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
to the means but I think that's kind of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.729 
to the means but I think that's kind of
pressure<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.570> put<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.500> kind

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
pressure to put on you and so you kind

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.369 
pressure to put on you and so you kind
of<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.059> Christian<00:00:42.660> dance<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
of do this little Christian dance and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.740 
of do this little Christian dance and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
you say the right things but really

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.940 
you say the right things but really
there's<00:00:45.899> no<00:00:46.050> growth<00:00:46.649> there's<00:00:47.100> no<00:00:48.829> you<00:00:49.829> know

know that that I've got it all together
I'm<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> truth<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.020> don't<00:01:31.380> want

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
I'm in the truth is is that I don't want

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.640 
I'm in the truth is is that I don't want
people<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.250> believe<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.479> not

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
people to believe that but it's not

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.710 
people to believe that but it's not
that's<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> truth<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:36.000> simply<00:01:36.600> an

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that's not the truth is it's simply an

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.469 
that's not the truth is it's simply an
illusion<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.299> what's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
illusion and so I think that's what's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.980 
illusion and so I think that's what's
been<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.840> kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.979> cool<00:01:41.420> with<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> magic

been so kind of so cool with the magic

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350 
been so kind of so cool with the magic
and<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> artistic<00:01:43.530> expression<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.310> etic<00:01:44.640> for

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and that artistic expression is etic for

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.149 
and that artistic expression is etic for
me<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.439> kind<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:46.860> outlet

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
real life for us and not not a game I

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.020 
real life for us and not not a game I

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
pretend and so I think we've only like

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.699 
pretend and so I think we've only like
when<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.390> share<00:02:57.660> your<00:02:57.810> faith<00:02:58.049> if<00:02:58.319> you're<00:02:58.470> just

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
when you share your faith if you're just

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.259 
when you share your faith if you're just
pretending<00:02:59.280> people<00:02:59.519> know<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.700> they<00:02:59.910> go<00:03:00.120> and

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
pretending people know that they go and

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.580 
pretending people know that they go and
start<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.600> real<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.049> dude<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.530> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
start a real for this dude and so so I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.650 
start a real for this dude and so so I
think<00:03:04.769> that's<00:03:04.980> what's<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.730> dangerous<00:03:06.239> about

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
think that's what's so dangerous about

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.890 
think that's what's so dangerous about
apathy<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.709> can<00:03:08.489> just<00:03:08.639> trigger<00:03:09.180> strips<00:03:09.690> my

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
apathy is it can just trigger strips my

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.080 
apathy is it can just trigger strips my
passion<00:03:10.470> for<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.730> Lord<00:03:11.970> with
