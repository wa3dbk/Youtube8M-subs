00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.129
 barry treadmill or interest as 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.920
 examine the storm that has three 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.140
 Previous or middle portions 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.680
 a previous portion has fibers 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.440
 vegetables that suffers water 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.600
 it is automatically a palpation 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.600
 bilateral done in this way 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.350
 the middle position has oblique fibers 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.310
 that are made in the temporal bone of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.310
 this form 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.440
 and the posterior palpation has fibers 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.559
 verticals that are made 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.559
 in this way horizontal ask 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.800
 had some discomfort when he was 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.780
 he palpated 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.770
 ok let's see what the muscle 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.760
 pot that is palpated down the 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.700
 posterior zygomatic arch and back 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.380
 coinciding with the boyal angle and it 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.380
 performs bilaterally in this way 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.640
 had some discomfort 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.250
 ok let's see then the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.650
 sternocleidomastoid muscle 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.240
 the patient is asked to turn the 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.790
 opposite where they will perform 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.299
 palpation we look at the office 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.070
 master idea and this muscle is inserted 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.170
 from the master position idea until the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.380
 clavicle more or less than the next 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.380
 way 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.850
 Now let's see what the trapeze 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.210
 the patient is asked to sit down 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.210
 briefly 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.420
 and it is the muscle that is inserted into the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.420
 back the neck and the other 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.000
 straight to please 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.080
 there was some discomfort when it was 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.240
 performed the palpation 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.450
 and finally we are going to make the 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.000
 palpation of the gastric leaf the belly 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.470
 later specifically will be ready 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.470
 bilaterally in this way 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.739
 He had no discomfort 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.709
 and perfect then we have made 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.550
 satisfactorily palpating the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.550
 muscles of Peru as
