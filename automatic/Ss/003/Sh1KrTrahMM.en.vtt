00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello you are welcome to the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.529
 my day friday got the top five of my 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.240
 absolute favorite teas 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.530
 because of coffee, of course, I drink 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.960
 also like tea very much 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.960
 So let's get started and see the same 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.640
 First comes a herbal tea leni 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.439
 for years super like it drink his 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.960
 wanted and it is really very 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.880
 Nice and that appointment I like it 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.330
 gladly because that also lemon balm in it 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.980
 some rosehip and an optimal 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.480
 herbal mixture and who always leaves 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.460
 drink in the morning at noon in the evening 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.190
 in between times at night when it is 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.809
 must be and I really like him 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.180
 I can not live without him anymore 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.520
 herbal garden pommerland and here stands 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.100
 yet they swear by light and power 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.440
 and that's always good and a great one 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.420
 t of course in organic quality and the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.280
 I like it very much sweetie 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.559
 I usually did not mean that because I told them so 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.110
 just like best and here is the 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.530
 lemon of the rosehip lemongrass 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.360
 hibiscus ginger sunflower british and 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.039
 I think you can taste the sunflowers 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.140
 blew through a bit and that 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.080
 one usually counters it in normal 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.940
 not and that's why I love this tea 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.560
 and whenever I take a loot in the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.390
 I am also pleased that the keyboard 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.880
 bags are just as nice 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.130
 those are the little things that it is 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.200
 somehow make out but this tee 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.390
 tastes great and I can 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.640
 you really recommend one more 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.500
 lemon balm in summer with me 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.530
 is really drunk up and down 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.460
 especially cold with ice cubes I suppose 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.290
 quite often as the basis for iced tea 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.880
 lemon ice tea or grapefruit iced tea 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.460
 or whatever you want to do 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.130
 I think herbal tea is great 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.740
 basis for it does not matter what you order 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.570
 makes and no matter what is fruit 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.970
 is what's in there and that's 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.470
 really delicious lemons is awesome 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.720
 refreshingly it probably recognizes 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.090
 all and just go in the summer 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.970
 also in combination with brake assistance me 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.560
 that very very interesting and top league 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.180
 I think many of you know how 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.700
 Lemons is tasty that's why I have to 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.739
 not talk about it for a long time and me 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.810
 think the tips of life tree very much 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.239
 very good ones have a great quality 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.250
 because many say yes prey t is the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.959
 lower quality the experience I have 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.980
 Not at all in recent years 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.379
 made and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.000
 I have the feeling that the prey and 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.620
 I have the feeling that it bags 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.330
 just got much better 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.730
 earlier have since I believe the remains 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.220
 in and you said so people it 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.409
 not great loose tea are better though 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.180
 meanwhile I'm very happy with 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.370
 the bag tees because it is easy 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.709
 is super convenient and fast 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.590
 that 's why i' m a big favorite of the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.870
 small bags and yes lemons it is on 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.450
 Rhein has to be in the summer so he was in 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.329
 shopping basket as and I find really great 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.060
 then i am an absolute fan of yogi 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.170
 tea i have him now the sender 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.239
 I drank it at some point 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.370
 just had over and I'm standing 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.440
 anyway very much fails but on 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.920
 unity I have something with the time 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.660
 over drunk over wore with it goes too 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.670
 Do you know that when you have a tgv 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.769
 you've been drinking that someday 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.510
 do not like nature anymore 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.239
 woke him up but eventually discovered him 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.099
 again and is free what I great 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.140
 I think drink and we bought up 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.000
 Give them free coffee because I hope for him 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.160
 just can not stand so well 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.430
 and he was judge says for example 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.709
 if I take my coffee to go 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.750
 wanted coffee again without fun yes exactly 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.060
 I want coffee without fun that's mg 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.880
 caffeine free corp who does that totally 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.109
 fun and i really like him and 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.599
 That's why I like that too 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.519
 Tea is caffeine free and yes is a good one 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.419
 man is the need ten to 15 minutes 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.340
 Cook 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.799
 from the fund is always such a thing 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.150
 really only if you so second 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.220
 breakfast or a little bit of time 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.109
 but has the love I have to go 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.180
 try you know it guarantees in 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.069
 red yogi tea this is a classic 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.870
 but this good morning time too 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.880
 really great yes if you want 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.400
 try it out and if I have a go 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.650
 has less time thinks e 10 to 15 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.260
 minutes to boil then I climb 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.680
 For a part of his life, he buys omas 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.870
 of life tree sweet tea and he is one 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.539
 very delicious I think that's really good 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.160
 it's a great time with hanni bush 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.579
 is also caffeine free and that too 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.560
 fennel in the sweet wood family and others 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.710
 two classic spices I drink it 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.949
 with a milk or with soya 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.860
 and with a shot at garden mostly 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.900
 or maple syrup and I like it 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.970
 super good I think is tasty 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.810
 which is also great but you can not 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.849
 compare with the cooked for 15 minutes 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.960
 Yoga has to last 27 to ten minutes 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:48.419
 raise and I also find in social 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.770
 is on the problem that the taste 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.530
 I did not get along so well 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.900
 at least the feeling at least that 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.810
 do not loose 15 compared to the one really 15 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.940
 minutes strongly simmered but like 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.430
 I am really good and unfortunately it has to 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.800
 often with me always go fast because 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.080
 usually finally to do with the children 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.699
 or have it somehow little time 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.710
 to pause 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.630
 I admit that I'm the rarest 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.180
 Mostly five or five minutes 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.710
 six minutes that's enough for me and then 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.810
 is as strong enough and then 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.940
 nice milk and the tea 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.770
 I really enjoy it 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.919
 Of course in the winter of course increased 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.169
 But also in the summer often as edges 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.000
 I think two of them have to draw cool too 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.740
 you do not always kick in hot 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.320
 You can still enjoy the cold in summer 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.419
 milk and something surrendered says tastes 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.940
 just great and I'm an absolute 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.729
 fan and my absolute favorite movie 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.680
 summer is the time to faithful lovely 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.289
 and fruity that really makes 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.500
 great in every iced tea and apple is in it 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.180
 Pear strawberry and fruits dreamlike 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.750
 rose petals and you can taste it 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.250
 really and I find so rewarding 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.650
 excellent or strawberry but 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.050
 also lemons are other variants 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.849
 conceivable and also iced with basil 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.430
 Just taste with this theme 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.080
 excellent he also beats super hot 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.389
 but I admit that I am in the summer 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.360
 Increases cold drink deeply with beautiful 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.310
 a lot of ice and a lot of fruit in it and 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.780
 loss has made it one 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.990
 I have already made cocktail 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.849
 cocktail with cold tea also tastes good 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.469
 really excellent if you have the 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.610
 not right things and until now 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:26.130
 I have to say I do not have one 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.409
 better fruit tea drunk and me 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.020
 I'm very happy with it and me 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:33.090
 think it's very nice, too 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.260
 important if you have a theme that you 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.320
 that's what it's like 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.880
 you like to pack matures and something 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.100
 looks stupid then it is already 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.650
 bad somehow because of the ts 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.240
 just wants to be great 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.400
 and also delicious and now I have total 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.590
 Fancy a steak that's when you go 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.390
 So a video is making tea is drinking 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.340
 simply great and above all cozy 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.440
 and with the right t veld the whole 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.930
 then much easier and is ahead 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.090
 all much much tastier what is in yours 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.160
 They should be so favorite in you 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.240
 the cashier comes down write me down 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.730
 the comments 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.800
 and now here is weekend on this 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.200
 as they return to the hotel on monday 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.480
 old freshness to a new video 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.890
 I wish you great days and up 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.890
 Monday was called
