and get a great source of omega-3s for

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.050 
and get a great source of omega-3s for
animal-based<00:01:21.360> omega-3s<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:23.159> krill<00:01:23.549> oil<00:01:23.580> i

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
animal-based omega-3s I like krill oil i

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.810 
animal-based omega-3s I like krill oil i
used<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.960> use<00:01:24.990> cod<00:01:25.380> liver<00:01:25.560> oil<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.549> after

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
used to use cod liver oil but after

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.730 
used to use cod liver oil but after
doing<00:01:26.970> some<00:01:27.150> research<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.869> found<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.380> krill

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
doing some research I found that krill

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.969 
doing some research I found that krill
oil<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.250> superior<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.380> agreed<00:01:31.860> with

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
oil is superior and it just agreed with

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.149 
oil is superior and it just agreed with
me<00:01:32.130> better<00:01:32.750> krill<00:01:33.750> oil<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.200> also<00:01:34.229> has<00:01:34.920> much

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
me better krill oil is also has much

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.770 
me better krill oil is also has much
better<00:01:35.340> absorption<00:01:35.729> than<00:01:36.090> fish<00:01:36.299> oil<00:01:36.540> is

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
better absorption than fish oil is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.590 
better absorption than fish oil is
pollution<00:01:37.439> free<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.939> kind<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.329> use

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
pollution free and the kind that I use

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.170 
pollution free and the kind that I use
is<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:39.990> perishable<00:01:40.650> krill<00:01:41.460> oil<00:01:41.670> also

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
is not perishable krill oil also
