 and now so I do not see however the club has told me it is clear we 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.850
 not yet added but of course it starts with this weather greatly reduced 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.630
 temperature on average in the Netherlands around 15 degrees 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 fairly clear and dry weather and tomorrow it seems to be a nice summer day 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.979
 get some sun with the first latch but gradually from the south 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.670
 those with and those heavy showers 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.970
 with the chance of hail storms and strong gusts of wind the most sun in the east 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.750
 and northeast of the country there also the highest temperatures 24 or 25 degrees 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.760
 elsewhere in some temperature of 22 or 23 degrees in the evening and night yes they do that 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.100
 the beer with the banana in that again a big one 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.900
 nacional 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.799
 we are coming 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.260
 alphen on the Rhine 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.790
 and then he is gone again 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.210
 a 7 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.590
 if you still have a lot of beautiful things too well 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.880
 the pacemakers still do not expect showers with a chance of hail storms and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.230
 gusts of wind also occasionally sun and still that summer temperature between them 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.680
 22 and the 24 degrees 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.899
 and where can it come from he could water a kilo 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.049
 what is there so you want to hear it say 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.410
 and of course we go fast no 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.670
 the prospects to eat monday tuesday and wednesday I still have those showers 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.740
 Wednesday some more sun temperatures on average almost normal for the time 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.560
 of the year 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.680
 so around 21 or 22 degrees the summer weather for martin and you are the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.060
 afterwards I believe I shot well but what if there is a point too 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.179
 or if so 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.579
 Well for tomorrow night I have a nice position and it comes naturally 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.239
 those heavy showers in between the showers it is still great to base 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.959
 the water sport gets a 4 from me and that is because of the heavy showers with a chance 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.930
 be careful with wind gusts 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.290
 here it is sultry here it is hot here there is a fire hazard and thunderstorm 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.230
 otherwise our one from this campsite from horst yes our limburg haile therefore 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.919
 expected 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.609
 and look at them the netherlands have been demanded two years on Friday 6 in addition there are 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.799
 more to the normal time half past ten 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.149
 he hoped not to see that he goes further
