around<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> two<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:43.440> three<00:00:43.590> laps<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
around the two or three laps you have to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.160 
around the two or three laps you have to
agree<00:00:44.280> how<00:00:44.489> would<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> they<00:00:45.780> had

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
loose wheel well I think probably what

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.090 
loose wheel well I think probably what

flying by Johnson watch the pointers and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
flying by Johnson watch the pointers and
the<00:00:56.550> speeds<00:00:57.050> relative<00:00:58.730> before<00:00:59.730> 248<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.480> mean<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the speeds relative before 248 I mean it

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.100
