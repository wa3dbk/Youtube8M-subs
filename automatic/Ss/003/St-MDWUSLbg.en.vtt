00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 so hello everyone just from the post office 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.049
 not just with mail us mail recently 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.559
 but in general, it does not matter we start to shoot 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.389
 new package came a new parcel here 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.410
 so here it looks and let's see what 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.930
 there inside i am most interesting i am something 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:30.710
 I do not understand it is written one on this account 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:35.360
 This package is so clear and here we have 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.680
 These are women's watches 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.489
 let's look at them the same 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.789
 little just strange written here 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.980
 case I think a case should no one 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.950
 met 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.340
 Well, the clock should be so proper 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.039
 She is now a bit later as 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.079
 looks and looks like this 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.430
 such a dial as a better show here 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.430
 probably so 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.770
 here so they go as you see well 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.380
 far 3 they naturally do not work 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.180
 Givi written but there is some kind of back 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.110
 no identifying marks absolutely 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.630
 no silicone strap without holes 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.030
 daughters but they are there thin some this 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:27.540
 just push it and how about children 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.900
 Well, that's size 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.670
 here is g-shock they are shorter here and so 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.140
 Well on hand to dress them and we do not know 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.290
 just put here on women here 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.190
 so I will look such watch 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.869
 let us have a closer look will show you more 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.300
 details of the checks in principle so done 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.710
 not bad 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:58.200
 pretty and neat 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.810
 we have a nice watch naturally 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:08.869
 it will cost more is definitely 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.160
 Here they show they cost two so 3 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.310

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.570
 I do n't know what they are doing 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.110
