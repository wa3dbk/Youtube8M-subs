so<00:02:39.020> what<00:02:39.170> we<00:02:39.320> did<00:02:39.790> because<00:02:40.790> with<00:02:41.510> some<00:02:41.750> eyelets

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
so what we did because with some eyelets

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.990

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
on the shoes and the boots it's kind of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.330 
on the shoes and the boots it's kind of
hard<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.330> get<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.200> melted<00:02:45.560> ends<00:02:45.860> through<00:02:46.190> them

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
hard to get the melted ends through them

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.760
