I<00:01:06.580> judge<00:01:07.119> all<00:01:07.330> tremolo<00:01:07.780> pedals<00:01:08.110> based<00:01:08.800> on<00:01:08.979> old

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
I judge all tremolo pedals based on old

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.550 
I judge all tremolo pedals based on old
amps<00:01:09.970> life<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.660> lot<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.899> people<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.410> old

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
amps life a lot of people the old

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.820 
amps life a lot of people the old
tremolo<00:01:12.009> style<00:01:12.520> amps<00:01:12.910> from<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.180> 60s<00:01:13.570> our<00:01:14.410> amps

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
tremolo style amps from the 60s our amps

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.620 
tremolo style amps from the 60s our amps
that<00:01:15.009> people<00:01:15.340> covet<00:01:15.580> because<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.149> their

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
that people covet because of their

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.320 
that people covet because of their
tremolo<00:01:17.080> channel<00:01:17.410> I<00:01:17.890> believe<00:01:18.759> this<00:01:18.880> too<00:01:19.149> this

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
tremolo channel I believe this too this

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.029 
tremolo channel I believe this too this
pedal<00:01:19.660> is<00:01:19.929> the<00:01:20.080> closest<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.500> can<00:01:20.530> come<00:01:20.649> in

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
pedal is the closest you can come in

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.169 
pedal is the closest you can come in
pedal<00:01:21.280> form<00:01:21.959> it<00:01:22.959> has<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.170> rate<00:01:23.500> depth<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.759> wave

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179

knob what's right depth in wave what

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.580 
knob what's right depth in wave what

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
does it do the rate is knob that

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.070 
does it do the rate is knob that
controls<00:01:29.920> how<00:01:30.099> fast<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:31.270> tremolo<00:01:31.509> pulsates

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
controls how fast the tremolo pulsates

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.279 
controls how fast the tremolo pulsates
mhm<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.950> depth<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.789> how<00:01:34.090> prevalent<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.929> is<00:01:35.020> in

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
mhm the depth is how prevalent it is in

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.169 
mhm the depth is how prevalent it is in
the<00:01:35.440> signal<00:01:35.800> and<00:01:35.979> then<00:01:36.459> the<00:01:36.610> wave<00:01:36.819> is

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
the signal and then the wave is

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.199 
the signal and then the wave is
something<00:01:37.720> all<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.500> way<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.250> left<00:01:39.490> the

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
something all the way to the left the

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:42.680 
something all the way to the left the
wave<00:01:40.780> is<00:01:41.080> what<00:01:41.110> they<00:01:41.440> call<00:01:41.619> a<00:01:41.649> triangle<00:01:42.190> wave

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
wave is what they call a triangle wave

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.809 
wave is what they call a triangle wave
where<00:01:43.690> it<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.229> never<00:01:44.920> shuts<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.399> signal<00:01:45.700> off

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
where it is never shuts the signal off

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.419 
where it is never shuts the signal off
completely<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:47.530> when<00:01:47.739> you<00:01:47.830> roll<00:01:48.069> it<00:01:48.250> all<00:01:48.399> the

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
completely then when you roll it all the

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.190 
completely then when you roll it all the
way<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.000> right<00:01:49.209> is<00:01:49.750> what<00:01:49.929> they<00:01:50.020> call<00:01:50.170> a

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
way to the right is what they call a

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.410 
way to the right is what they call a
square<00:01:50.440> wave<00:01:50.709> where<00:01:51.099> it's<00:01:51.310> actually<00:01:51.819> off<00:01:52.030> and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
square wave where it's actually off and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.080 
square wave where it's actually off and
then<00:01:52.599> on<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.080> then<00:01:53.200> off<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.679> then<00:01:53.800> on<00:01:54.090> first

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
then on and then off and then on first

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.469 
then on and then off and then on first
off<00:01:55.300> I'll<00:01:55.569> show<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:56.190> my<00:01:57.190> signal<00:01:57.670> with<00:01:58.179> just

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
off I'll show you my signal with just

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.180 
off I'll show you my signal with just
your<00:01:58.599> basic<00:01:58.810> trim<00:01:59.200> oil<00:01:59.410> it's<00:01:59.770> kind<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.099> a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
your basic trim oil it's kind of a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:17.210 
your basic trim oil it's kind of a
medium<00:02:00.580> rate<00:02:00.789> with<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.959> triangle<00:02:02.830> wave

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.800 

very<00:02:18.220> cool<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:18.849> like<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.239> said<00:02:19.420> when<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:19.690> get

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
very cool and like you said when you get

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.630 
very cool and like you said when you get
the<00:02:19.930> square<00:02:20.200> wave<00:02:20.410> action<00:02:20.890> going<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.370> almost

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
the square wave action going it almost

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.120 
the square wave action going it almost
has<00:02:21.880> sort<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.390> pulse<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.260> which<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:23.890> kind

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
has sort of a pulse to it which I kind

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:36.240 
has sort of a pulse to it which I kind
of<00:02:24.250> use<00:02:24.489> like<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:34.080> or<00:02:35.080> crank<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.800> up<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:36.099> a

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
of use like this or crank it up just a
