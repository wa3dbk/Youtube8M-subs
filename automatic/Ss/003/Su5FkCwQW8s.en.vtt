00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:11.790
 so the guys I'm here in line 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.170
 glasses the effect is the paÃ§o booth 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.260
 anyway it is a virtual reality glasses is 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.789
 usual has no announcement that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.050
 It's happening here, we got it. 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.180
 chance 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.609
 iac is the hell to stop when the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.380
 channel the good companions and saved 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.510
 sao paulo they do not do this because the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 pfizer and the driver too but anyway 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.280
 this little daughter 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.879
 just that long a time consuming because 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.800
 people stay there for a few minutes 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.180
 Anytime I say there I will 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.649
 stay for a few minutes but for those who are 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.200
 Waiting for the shit right? 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.320
 The team is not going to show you guys here. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.320
 O 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.879
 #mimimi 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.760
 It's for fun, it's much better than me. 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.140
 I thought so 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.240
 in fact his resolution is still a 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.210
 little primitive, right? 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.090
 but the answer of fiddling with his head 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.680
 so I thought it was phenomenal too and it would take 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.150
 Do you even forget that you have glasses? 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.370
 so cool and so good that so you 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.830
 You do not even realize that you're 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.690
 changing looks like it's one thing and 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.000
 you too in the head and the ones that are 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.860
 stirring and coming back very good and I found 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.860
 so crazy is that when people 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.360
 watch out and then video on youtube the people 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.290
 already watched the personal video playing minecraft 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.880
 I'm always new thing and when 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.240
 I was watching the television program 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.920
 make the guy throw us away is not 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.130
 it seems I twist because because the guy 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.040
 He came 180graus he does so turns to there 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.120
 and on the screen 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.890
 some 70 degrees appeared that was in the facim 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.330
 I had fled from the oppression of the doctor. 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.250
 It not is not a pure not for yesterday 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.080
 and when we 're playing in the area and 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.390
 threw it came it 's not a roller coaster 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.890
 in which we do not mess with people 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.170
 playing if not move move is is to 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.700
 one and how you spoke to the limitation that 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.340
 people see that early graphics are 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.720
 Fraquinhos and weak firing the plug 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.400
 Another question is whether it is 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.920
 same resolution because on tv it looked good 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.560
 and blue only solve import light graphic 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.250
 clear and exhausted on television is greater 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.380
 only in the reef if a glasses at last if it is 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.660
 very small know the same squares 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.970
 and its great on the screen 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.870
 This is the only thing that still takes you away. 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.720
 of reality 5 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.269
 when when they do something that for 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.310
 which is completely unlikely 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.299
 so with au 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.379
 but the retina is not there, man I think 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.959
 it will be difficult and I think it will be a 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.090
 resolution to about not only gay but 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.040
 like expensive film because we see the 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.890
 cinema is still limited a screen for more 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.329
 it will be 3d you can not see outside 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.650
 of that is a mountain in the background not 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.480
 manages to turn side of another mountain 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.909
 there I think it was just a 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.530
 very great revolution who still 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.079
 it seems that the public has not yet understood 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.660
 It's going to be very strong and I think it 's 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.519
 the doubt I had was whether it's legal 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.889
 even legal and as proof of concept 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.160
 For me it happened like this. 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.570
 How is it going to work in games? 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.500
 commercials get out of this thing 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.389
 basic 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.669
 in this only thing if you have that fast 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.770
 with minecraft example already has to 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.289
 To stop to see is occupied by facebook is 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:44.830
 this exactly but you can expect and farm 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:48.610
 bill in blocks at the end facebook enjoy 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:52.900
 our impressions there because you have faith in 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.510
 facebook but also short video there 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.710
 I counted 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.710
 there is something
