00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.040
 hello friends of the planet sonic here who 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.500
 My name is Victor Muller and this is ours. 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.089
 unique in today's form 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.880
 today we talk a little about the situation 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.210
 the company of our mascot since 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.060
 as a whole she walks very optimistic 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.269
 according to data released by the blind bits 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.789
 already a few months a year from 2014 to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.309
 company of our beloved mascot profited 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.290
 expressively in its three branches of 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.899
 the market. 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.559
 consumer who basically sells 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.050
 games 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.690
 the air hot and machinery chico 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.780
 those on the other side of the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.270
 world starting with the consumer market 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.300
 the big surprise was the game persona 4 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.879
 from other ultra suplex macs where 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.149
 developed by ATLUS and which currently 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.600
 blinded sales came in the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.239
 House of 4 million and 100 thousand units to 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.369
 around the world by far 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.590
 expectations of selling 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.810
 only 30 thousand copies 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.229
 another success of the company was alien 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.450
 which sold 600,000 copies in the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.610
 first months and according to data 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 released last January 21 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.670
 already exceeded the mark of 1 million 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.820
 copies sold on the cmmi rpg 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.860
 phantasy star online 2 had a million 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.049
 downloads for laptop only 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.869
 playstation vita and three million 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.780
 downloads counting the other platforms 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.909
 jattin exceeded the mark of the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.439
 4 million downloads 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.560
 and it looks like the show is wanting 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.869
 to further enhance the brand by producing 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.670
 an anime and manga for the series 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.579
 however the bad news for the market 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.500
 consumer comes from our beloved mascot 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.079
 both versions of sonic boom have had 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.990
 your reduced sales expectations 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.420
 by half according to updated data from 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.270
 video games chats in January this year to 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.280
 racy fleury version that pay and what went 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.649
 developed by the American team of 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.430
 big head bottan sold 184 1971 copies 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.920
 Already chatroulette cristo 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.280
 for 3ds developed by samsung 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.390
 sold 176 thousand five hundred and ninety 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.549
 children 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.189
 The quantity sold on the Wii is 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.230
 considered reasonable for the standards of 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.810
 exclusive of nintendo console 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.139
 still far below the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.209
 initial expectations of 600 thousand copies 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.400
 the current projection is that the number of 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.709
 sales of sonic boom more to brake than 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.359
 reaches 300 thousand copies 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.790
 another game that did not meet the 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.919
 expectations was the fantasy being new 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.750
 for playstation vita and released 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.700
 exclusively in japan 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.639
 in this case it was delayed by the launch 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.139
 since the developers 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.209
 they needed more time to refine 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.549
 the game in addition to the sales of the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.099
 ps vita were lower than expected by 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.700
 dreams directly affecting sales of the 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.969
 game 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.719
 even so the game sold 107 thousand copies 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:09.609
 in just one week only in japan 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:11.889
 considered a relative success 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:17.229
 total net revenues in the market 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:20.109
 consumer was 48.2 billion yen 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:22.599
 that the Japanese side currency with profit 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.669
 operating income of 6 billion 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.729
 far surpassing expectations 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.709
 Initial 1 billion profit from the market 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.560
 consumer as to the division of 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.810
 archers the drought managed to generate 18 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.959
 billion yen and net income 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.979
 increasing operating profit by 200 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.049
 millions of years 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:43.419
 contrary to the expectations of 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.120
 investors expecting a decrease 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.069
 of 1 billion yen since there was no 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.379
 titles this year 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.780
 already the pachinko machines that are of 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.329
 responsibility of the Sami who merged 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.049
 with the series in 2004 managed to generate 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.729
 a net revenue of 25 billion 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.849
 surpassing by a great margin the 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:06.659
 expectations of generating 16 billion of them 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.699
 already operating profit was in the 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.889
 7.3 billion for those who do not know the 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:14.560
 plastics are the famous games of chance 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:17.229
 which are legalized in Japan where the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.539
 player bet money on machines and if 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.750
 lucky you can receive a high return 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:25.420
 financially or simply lose everything 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.370
 however with all success 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.690
 division of the company that 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.210
 is the Japanese series 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.950
 things do not seem very good 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.260
 for the second American harvest one 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.140
 report released on January 29 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.200
 there was a tragic fall in profits 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.370
 compared to last year between 2013 and 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.910
 2014 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.200
 the net profit of the American blind was 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.540
 126 billion 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.210
 already between 2014 and 2015 fell to only 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.430
 16 billion the same American division did not 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.770
 closing the fiscal year at the loss 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.260
 the decrease of profit will cause 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.390
 a major internal restructuring 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.820
 the traditional office located in 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.460
 San Francisco is removed to the southeast 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.100
 California and the company in its 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.410
 dismissal of employees 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.690
 in addition a part of the American series 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.890
 shall be made available for new 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.080
 shareholders 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.580
 the good news for sonic fans is that 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.710
 the American sega have strengthened 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.290
 merchandising up the blues and 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.570
 probably new games should 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.940
 arise because the strongest brand in the 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.370
 company here in the west 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.230
 finally the great focus this time will be the 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.730
 computer and device market 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.880
 furniture 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.620
 I'm victor miller and this was ours. 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.360
