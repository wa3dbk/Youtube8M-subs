00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
one of the most beautiful products we've

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.490 
one of the most beautiful products we've
ever<00:02:47.540> designed<00:02:49.480> one<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.690> key<00:02:50.990> design

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
ever designed one of the key design

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.890 
ever designed one of the key design
decisions<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.700> we<00:02:52.850> made<00:02:53.060> early<00:02:53.390> on<00:02:53.420> with<00:02:53.810> the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
decisions that we made early on with the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.590 
decisions that we made early on with the
new<00:02:54.050> macbook<00:02:54.470> air<00:02:54.710> it<00:02:55.160> was<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.550> use<00:02:55.790> flash<00:02:56.240> for

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
new macbook air it was to use flash for

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.230 
new macbook air it was to use flash for
storage<00:02:57.020> we<00:02:57.740> do<00:02:57.890> flash<00:02:58.160> storage<00:02:58.520> differently

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
storage we do flash storage differently

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.170 
storage we do flash storage differently
than<00:02:59.420> other<00:02:59.600> computer<00:03:00.110> manufacturers<00:03:01.180> rather

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
than other computer manufacturers rather

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.270 
than other computer manufacturers rather
than<00:03:02.390> package<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.930> inside<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.440> housing<00:03:03.890> we

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
than package it inside the housing we

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.220 
than package it inside the housing we
place<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.790> chips<00:03:05.030> directly<00:03:05.570> on<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.840> logic

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
place the chips directly on the logic

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.380 
place the chips directly on the logic
board<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:06.980> we<00:03:07.010> can<00:03:07.310> be<00:03:07.460> much<00:03:07.640> more<00:03:07.880> efficient

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
board so we can be much more efficient

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.840 
board so we can be much more efficient
about<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.900> way<00:03:09.020> we<00:03:09.050> use<00:03:09.380> space<00:03:09.680> this<00:03:10.460> gives<00:03:10.700> us

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
about the way we use space this gives us

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.960 
about the way we use space this gives us
a<00:03:11.000> lot<00:03:11.240> more<00:03:11.300> room<00:03:11.750> for<00:03:12.050> batteries<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.730> what

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
a lot more room for batteries so what

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.180 
a lot more room for batteries so what
you<00:03:14.120> get<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.810> up<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.140> five<00:03:15.350> hours<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.740> battery
