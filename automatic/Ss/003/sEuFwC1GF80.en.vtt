00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.690
 I believe 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.610
 and well hi the friends his ultimate and 83 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.080
 I hope you all have the form on 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.790
 finds himself at the place by the same sutto 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 instructions to flavors for free without 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.450
 exploder still with the software weighs 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.630
 trial brenner but this time the 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.680
 software just went into version 2.0 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.910
 the first video that I could quote the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.170
 version 1.3 there was a lot 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.059
 of errors gives damaged for 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.340
 some people so here I 'm going 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.920
 redo the tutorial with the new 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.000
 version 2.0 and German to those with 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 who did not work it should work 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.570
 that this one because a lot of those 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.500
 which were created so I first 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.690
 you need much used 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 to drop your resume to you so me for 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.270
 the video example I'm going to take a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.640
 zombies word on black ops 1 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.710
 so I like enough towards me to leave here from 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.450
 black ops there in this folder there 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.290
 however remembered I put the word of 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.610
 zombies is not home thing very 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.840
 important to leave directly 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.920
 finally the usb key you leave them 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.630
 insert into your pc you go 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.220
 understand why so once you 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.050
 have both backups it's good you 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.050
 think the software so we do not start 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.970
 So that's all wild 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.650
 who are on mac usb is the key to good 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.869
 to directly record the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.330
 only morning directly on it so that 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.070
 for now it does not interest me too much 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.420
 what we are going to do is record our 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.770
 profile to us for not having to moan 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.820
 weight paths to sell you 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.320
 go good profile cold lot by m but 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.119
 it's wrong 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.799
 leave it by m stuck for lack of your 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.799
 backup to you so I click on it 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.189
 there never the name that I want to return 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.330
 to call me back then me I them 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.590
 manceaux must see cf profile then you 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.479
 go first to consolidate would 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.460
 forget about their advises you put 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.810
 that of easy red up kinÃ© place 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.009
 so it's very important 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.320
 here are click on these profiles then 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.490
 admitted profile so there the profile is 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.200
 returned there will be no need to go back to 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.530
 every time for this new stadium it's 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.760
 good so then to choose to assault 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.650
 towards the sign so either you go in 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.370
 open and you choose it so 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.380
 directly 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.459
 I'm like that you open the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.080
 folder where there is the backup you the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.700
 drag on the software from you 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.630
 release 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.800
 iliad appears here right here so 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.950
 the week is very simple you go 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.810
 in the other rom or choice and his profiles 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.860
 existing 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.110
 alas the profile you click on your 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.250
 profile to you they must be blue 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.400
 like that you click on the arrow 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.530
 red for you shut up there if I had a 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.569
 American wild that his odds blus or 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.519
 what you click paris on the other 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.480
 man and you choose the parameter - 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.820
 this fault of your center of achievement 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.810
 next and the hurts there it's not 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.440
 important what the backup and 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.120
 French already 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.590
 then all that has to be done 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.590
 you click on rixheim 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.030
 this is the only one with decines is so 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.290
 important here I told you and if the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.989
 usb key because then you click 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.030
 directly on save to save 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.590
 directly sefa soulac usb there I 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.599
 do it that's good that I can do it 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.269
 but alas without putting the devoted 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.890
 class that backup is here here is 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.329
 so the poorly smelled train had to be defined 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.909
 I would just have to play by hand on the 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.040
 key background on the ps3 and the one working 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.180
 directly but when I did 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.370
 several tests this morning but I have 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.540
 always order them damaged so 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.500
 I also found a trick it is 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.780
 because I did several tests this 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.890
 morning to 6 months 9 the 15th and that's that I 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.720
 tests but I admit to being a solution 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.730
 to work around the error of damaging it 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.920
 in what you do went on your 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.079
 services you click on it you go 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.590
 in the honor category you do there 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.409
 on the arrow 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.329
 you still go on the other man 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.129
 exists a paris profile you choose 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.890
 your profile they must be blue 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.890
 you close that and coots and on blake 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.560
 really there should not have been any need 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.290
 to do that but good anyway in 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.579
 doing like that his jury function cgg 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.470
 more heavily damaged so in any 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.109
 case it works so we can close 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.660
 software the keys save it 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.900
 directly on the usb key just extracted 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.459
 matt leblanc extract the age to put the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.209
 piece down on the ps3 and we will test 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.209
 if it works 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.230
 fortunately 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.530
 so here we are on the ps3 the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.230
 joystick we go in a chain was to 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.790
 data is not ps3 on the key 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:38.420
 usb she backup is here koke uncle 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.320
 Enrique is already so I'm here 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.430
 and you see confident in this 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.870
 technique that I found this morning 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.760
 Well, there is no mistake to damage it 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.470
 while this morning doing the method 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.060
 normally I always have 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.740
 damage it so in any case I 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.090
 managed to find that for all 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.550
 people who have a problem with the 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.840
 version 1.0 3d I hope with this 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.530
 method there that I found this morning but 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.600
 It functioned 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.820
 So here we are, we're just right and it's 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.210
 there the savate if it worked well 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.210
 no it's the game 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.910
 you 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.569
 we 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.169
 so here I already have the score she 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.250
 young I think it's good so I 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.860
 So will let down the weapons is not good 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.900
 it works I do not know the 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.759
 commander i'm going to face the mirror 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.830
 so that's good good here you see that 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.509
 the falla served as the function both 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.680
 that ben I hope with this little 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.389
 method that I found to work around 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.280
 gives them damaged I hope it's okay 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.509
 work for everyone because 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.770
 it's true that for version 1.3 these 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.020
 symptoms it made me a little shit 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.159
 because I software are pushed to 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.449
 work very well there was a lot 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.000
 of wood holes that serves for it's not 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.020
 because we pay 19 euros for 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.629
 fraudsters are also software 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.500
 kraft who can do the same thing 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.610
 so that's normally with the track 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.500
 method that I found that should 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.430
 work for everyone then 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.020
 a little you I wanted to tell you if 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.159
 never software it will not start it 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.169
 there is error with software being that the 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.400
 Czech tomas start not you are in 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.469
 the readme file that is in the 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.909
 folder and you need to go down 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.990
 the marks and all the emotions that has 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.379
 need to operate the 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.110
 software 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.069
 so that was marked by the creator 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.900
 software 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.099
 I just add the links of 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.180
 download like that it's more 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.710
 fast for blues and just to do 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.680
 copy paste on the internet you 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.969
 download here so I hope beck 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.199
 you will understand everything if you have 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.789
 questions that one lives in to avoid not 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.830
 mark it to me my comment to 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.909
 private messages but normally in 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.110
 doing the fine technique that I have 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.430
 searched this morning it should 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.710
 operate should no longer have may 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.029
 damaged so here I hope it 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.469
 you will have liked galens already very 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:44.969
