as<00:00:08.019> I<00:00:08.920> was<00:00:09.130> working<00:00:09.790> on<00:00:09.910> this<00:00:10.120> outer<00:00:10.480> ring<00:00:10.870> I

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
as I was working on this outer ring I

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.070 
as I was working on this outer ring I
was<00:00:11.740> thinking<00:00:12.309> of<00:00:12.490> the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
was thinking of the

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.470 
was thinking of the
the<00:00:14.260> terminology<00:00:15.160> of<00:00:15.190> what<00:00:15.730> it<00:00:15.910> is<00:00:15.940> that<00:00:16.090> I'm

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
the terminology of what it is that I'm

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.020 
the terminology of what it is that I'm
trying<00:00:16.900> to<00:00:17.170> do<00:00:17.350> and<00:00:17.710> what<00:00:18.160> it<00:00:18.280> is<00:00:18.430> I've<00:00:18.670> got<00:00:18.850> the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030 
trying to do and what it is I've got the

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.850 
trying to do and what it is I've got the
big<00:00:19.210> file<00:00:19.540> there<00:00:19.990> if<00:00:20.080> y'all<00:00:20.290> can<00:00:20.470> see<00:00:20.650> that

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
big file there if y'all can see that

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.950 
big file there if y'all can see that
whole<00:00:21.070> thing<00:00:21.400> now<00:00:21.610> do<00:00:21.670> got<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.300> end<00:00:22.510> on<00:00:22.689> here

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
whole thing now do got the end on here

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.570 
whole thing now do got the end on here
and<00:00:23.050> I<00:00:23.140> suggested<00:00:23.770> for<00:00:23.920> everybody<00:00:24.189> but<00:00:24.369> now<00:00:24.520> do

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
and I suggested for everybody but now do

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.880 
and I suggested for everybody but now do
got<00:00:24.970> this<00:00:25.119> file<00:00:25.420> over<00:00:25.630> here<00:00:25.720> that<00:00:26.350> don't<00:00:26.650> have

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
got this file over here that don't have

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.640 
got this file over here that don't have
a<00:00:26.920> handle<00:00:27.250> on

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
a handle on

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.580 
a handle on
and<00:00:29.160> there<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.030> reason<00:00:30.450> for<00:00:30.690> that<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> was

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
and there is a reason for that I was

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.290 
and there is a reason for that I was
using<00:00:31.950> it<00:00:32.220> on<00:00:32.340> another<00:00:32.670> thing<00:00:32.940> where<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
using it on another thing where it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.390 
using it on another thing where it
needed<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.780> lay<00:00:33.960> flat<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.920> handle<00:00:35.280> would

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
needed to lay flat the handle would

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.700 
needed to lay flat the handle would
interfere<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.960> there<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> reason

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
interfere with that so there is a reason

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.490 
interfere with that so there is a reason
not<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> handle<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.300> file<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
not to have a handle on this file it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.950 
not to have a handle on this file it
will<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:41.360> installed<00:00:42.360> shortly<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.970> coarser

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
will be installed shortly the coarser

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.330 
will be installed shortly the coarser
grade<00:00:46.400> the<00:00:47.660> terminology<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.190> I'm

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
grade the terminology of this what I'm

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.810 
grade the terminology of this what I'm
going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.670> into<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.330> outer<00:00:51.630> ring<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.820> I'm

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
going to do into this outer ring is I'm

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
going to do into this outer ring is I'm
using<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.630> broadness<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.620> foul<00:00:57.170> covered

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
using the broadness of the foul covered

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.490 
using the broadness of the foul covered
as<00:00:58.290> much<00:00:58.320> area<00:00:58.950> as<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.880> while<00:01:00.480> rotating<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
of levelness that I mentioned in the

of levelness that I mentioned in the
last<00:01:25.790> video<00:01:26.840> what<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.140> means<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.850> D

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
last video what that means is this D

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.070 
last video what that means is this D
Center<00:01:31.020> ring<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.970> outer<00:01:33.300> ring<00:01:34.460> was<00:01:36.080> it

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
Center ring and this outer ring was it

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.550 
Center ring and this outer ring was it
had<00:01:37.470> been<00:01:37.710> beat<00:01:38.040> by<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.340> hammer<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.380> so

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
had been beat by a hammer and it was so

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.680 
had been beat by a hammer and it was so
puck<00:01:41.120> marked<00:01:42.410> all<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.890> around<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
puck marked all the way around that it

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.920 
puck marked all the way around that it
would<00:01:45.900> I<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.290> had<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> remove<00:01:47.130> too<00:01:47.640> much

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
would I would had to remove too much

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.860 
would I would had to remove too much
material<00:01:48.930> from<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.830> lip<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.820> outer<00:01:51.510> edge

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
material from the lip of this outer edge

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.470 
material from the lip of this outer edge
plus<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.860> inner<00:01:53.040> edge<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.640> would<00:01:53.940> have<00:01:54.240> to

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
plus the inner edge I would have to

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.670 
plus the inner edge I would have to
remove<00:01:55.380> an<00:01:55.590> excessive<00:01:56.280> amount<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.850> material

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
remove an excessive amount of material

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.950 
remove an excessive amount of material
so<00:01:58.680> what<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.920> did<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.970> took<00:02:00.150> it<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.810> an

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
so what I did is I I took it to an

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.250 
so what I did is I I took it to an
average<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:02.010> took<00:02:02.580> about<00:02:02.880> half<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.080> high

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
average I took about half of the high

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.589 
average I took about half of the high
places<00:02:04.680> away<00:02:05.690> with<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:07.350> coarse<00:02:08.099> pile<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:09.060> just

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
places away with the coarse pile I just

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.309 
places away with the coarse pile I just
just<00:02:09.989> worked<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.530> all<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.760> way<00:02:11.940> around<00:02:12.450> with<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
just worked it all the way around with a

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.580 
just worked it all the way around with a
coarse<00:02:13.769> foul<00:02:14.390> turning<00:02:15.390> visit<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.709> time

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
coarse foul turning visit all the time

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.880 
coarse foul turning visit all the time
all<00:02:20.090> around<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.480> width<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.930> course<00:02:22.170> with

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
the course grade pile right there then I

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.740 
the course grade pile right there then I
followed<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.670> up<00:02:26.790> with<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:28.459> it's<00:02:29.459> fine<00:02:29.790> tooth

around with the fine grit then I came

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.200 
around with the fine grit then I came
with<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.090> piece<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.720> Emery<00:02:42.620> cloth<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:43.490> 240

anytime you use it a piece of sandpaper
you<00:02:52.230> use<00:02:52.470> what's<00:02:52.800> called<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.430> threefold<00:02:53.930> that

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
you use what's called a threefold that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.280 
you use what's called a threefold that
way<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.710> way<00:02:55.950> okay<00:02:56.790> now<00:02:57.030> when<00:02:57.420> when<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.930> use

way that way okay now when when you use

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.890 
way that way okay now when when you use
that<00:02:58.590> piece<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:59.130> paper<00:02:59.310> it's<00:02:59.970> got<00:03:00.210> a<00:03:00.240> grip<00:03:00.630> on

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
that piece of paper it's got a grip on

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900 
that piece of paper it's got a grip on
the<00:03:01.050> back<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.440> one<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.130> won't<00:03:02.370> go<00:03:02.610> ask

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the back of that one so it won't go ask

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.620 
the back of that one so it won't go ask
you<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:04.220> if<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.460> fold<00:03:05.790> your<00:03:05.940> paper<00:03:06.390> in

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
you if you if you fold your paper in

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.440 
you if you if you fold your paper in
half<00:03:07.290> then<00:03:08.280> it'll<00:03:08.550> it'll<00:03:08.730> go<00:03:08.910> like<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.390> right

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
half then it'll it'll go like that right

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.910 
half then it'll it'll go like that right
there<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.050> can't<00:03:10.290> control<00:03:10.620> it

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
there you can't control it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.850 
there you can't control it
so<00:03:11.220> if<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.400> fold<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.000> thirds<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.860> have

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
so if you fold it in thirds you have

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.000 
so if you fold it in thirds you have
control<00:03:14.340> over<00:03:14.370> your<00:03:14.850> paper<00:03:15.120> Plus<00:03:15.630> after<00:03:16.560> you

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
off with our hose and then we'll see

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.580 
off with our hose and then we'll see
what<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:08.910> looks<00:04:09.060> like<00:04:10.040> actually<00:04:12.590> finishing

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
what it looks like actually finishing

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.820 
what it looks like actually finishing
this<00:04:13.830> flywheel<00:04:14.370> if<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.360> remember<00:04:16.140> back<00:04:16.410> to

this flywheel if you remember back to

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.850 
this flywheel if you remember back to
the<00:04:17.010> get-go<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.900> look<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:20.760> looks<00:04:21.000> really<00:04:21.420> bad

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
the get-go it look it looks really bad

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.480 
the get-go it look it looks really bad
and<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.160> it's<00:04:23.850> it's<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.390> turbo<00:04:24.750> flywheel<00:04:25.680> it

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
and it is it's it's a turbo flywheel it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.750 
and it is it's it's a turbo flywheel it
has<00:04:26.700> a<00:04:26.730> real<00:04:27.270> good<00:04:27.720> lot<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.230> magnetism<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.580> the

has a real good lot of magnetism in the
magnets<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:31.800> is<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.250> correct<00:04:32.520> flywheel<00:04:33.240> for

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
magnets it is the correct flywheel for

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.830 
magnets it is the correct flywheel for

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
the engine this is one of those

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.409 
the engine this is one of those
incidents<00:04:37.700> were<00:04:39.500> that<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:41.190> build<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.760> engine

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
incidents were that to build the engine

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.010 
incidents were that to build the engine
and<00:04:42.830> maintain<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.130> correct<00:04:44.540> serial<00:04:45.540> number

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
and maintain the correct serial number

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.250 
and maintain the correct serial number
to<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.500> engine<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.880> verify<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.570> it<00:04:49.080> was

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
to the engine to verify that it was

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.710 
to the engine to verify that it was
actually<00:04:50.570> it's<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.720> good<00:04:51.930> example<00:04:52.730> of<00:04:53.730> what

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
actually it's a good example of what

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.050 
actually it's a good example of what
this<00:04:54.930> engine<00:04:55.470> was<00:04:55.800> when<00:04:56.310> it<00:04:56.430> came<00:04:56.640> from<00:04:56.880> the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
this engine was when it came from the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.879 
this engine was when it came from the
factory<00:04:57.650> just

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
factory just

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.260

example<00:04:59.520> in<00:05:00.210> in<00:05:00.689> reality<00:05:01.580> if<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.639> were<00:05:02.999> going

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
example in in reality if you were going

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.939 
example in in reality if you were going
to<00:05:03.389> use<00:05:03.629> this<00:05:04.020> engine<00:05:05.090> most<00:05:06.090> likely<00:05:06.949> you

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
to use this engine most likely you

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.119 
to use this engine most likely you
remember<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.699> have<00:05:08.909> not<00:05:08.939> even<00:05:09.529> we<00:05:10.529> not<00:05:10.800> never

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
remember we have not even we not never

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.309 
remember we have not even we not never
we<00:05:11.400> never<00:05:11.430> crank<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:12.240> engine<00:05:12.719> we<00:05:12.870> have<00:05:13.080> no

proof<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:14.629> the<00:05:15.629> engine<00:05:16.020> will<00:05:16.229> run<00:05:16.560> we<00:05:17.550> have

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
proof that the engine will run we have

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.909 
proof that the engine will run we have
done<00:05:18.229> all<00:05:19.229> of<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:19.650> basics<00:05:20.719> so<00:05:21.719> it<00:05:22.620> should

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
done all of the basics so it should

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:33.580 
done all of the basics so it should
start<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.669> run<00:05:24.830> as<00:05:25.830> use<00:05:26.759> the<00:05:28.310> flywheel<00:05:30.379> has<00:05:31.379> to

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
start and run as use the flywheel has to

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.950 
start and run as use the flywheel has to
extreme<00:05:35.090> to<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.120> extreme<00:05:37.219> flat<00:05:38.449> places<00:05:39.449> on

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
extreme to the extreme flat places on

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.649 
extreme to the extreme flat places on
the<00:05:40.229> flywheel<00:05:40.729> now<00:05:41.729> you<00:05:41.789> see<00:05:42.000> how<00:05:42.150> quick<00:05:42.479> we

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
the flywheel now you see how quick we

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.149 
the flywheel now you see how quick we
went<00:05:42.870> around<00:05:43.050> that<00:05:43.199> there's<00:05:43.529> hardly<00:05:43.860> no

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
went around that there's hardly no

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.550 
went around that there's hardly no
scratches<00:05:45.029> whatsoever<00:05:45.659> in<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.050> rim<00:05:46.289> with

scratches whatsoever in the rim with
that<00:05:46.770> and<00:05:47.430> then<00:05:47.639> you<00:05:47.669> follow<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.240> up<00:05:48.389> here<00:05:48.689> with

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
that and then you follow it up here with

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.899 
that and then you follow it up here with
the<00:05:49.139> with<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.830> 320<00:05:50.900> weather<00:05:51.900> dry<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.669> can

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
the with the 320 weather dry and I can

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.059 
the with the 320 weather dry and I can
see<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.300> scratches<00:05:54.629> going<00:05:55.199> away<00:05:55.439> every<00:05:55.889> time

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
see the scratches going away every time

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.269 
see the scratches going away every time
I<00:05:56.129> go<00:05:56.400> around<00:05:56.960> cut<00:05:57.960> around<00:05:58.139> it<00:05:58.589> you<00:05:58.830> don't<00:05:59.039> want

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
I go around cut around it you don't want

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.760 
I go around cut around it you don't want
a<00:05:59.339> sharp<00:05:59.639> edge<00:06:00.469> left<00:06:01.469> on<00:06:01.710> anything<00:06:02.069> as<00:06:02.699> a<00:06:02.759> rule

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
a sharp edge left on anything as a rule

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.969 
a sharp edge left on anything as a rule
so<00:06:04.770> we<00:06:05.219> did<00:06:05.430> that<00:06:05.669> now<00:06:06.889> if<00:06:07.889> you<00:06:07.949> can<00:06:08.370> see<00:06:09.979> this

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
so we did that now if you can see this

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.629 
so we did that now if you can see this
is<00:06:11.250> I<00:06:11.939> have<00:06:12.689> not<00:06:12.870> I<00:06:13.169> have<00:06:13.319> not<00:06:13.529> used<00:06:13.949> this<00:06:14.279> grip

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
is I have not I have not used this grip

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.869 
is I have not I have not used this grip
on<00:06:14.909> the<00:06:15.210> flywheel<00:06:15.449> as<00:06:15.930> of<00:06:16.169> gift<00:06:16.500> and<00:06:16.949> and<00:06:17.699> it's

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:17.879 
on the flywheel as of gift and and it's

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.010 
on the flywheel as of gift and and it's
just<00:06:18.120> a<00:06:18.330> clean<00:06:18.659> up<00:06:18.870> this<00:06:19.169> this<00:06:19.680> scotch<00:06:20.099> pad

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
just a clean up this this scotch pad

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.619 
just a clean up this this scotch pad
actually<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.830> flywheel<00:06:23.639> if<00:06:23.909> you<00:06:24.089> want<00:06:24.330> to

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
actually the flywheel if you want to

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:29.149 
actually the flywheel if you want to
leave<00:06:24.960> it<00:06:25.199> in<00:06:25.500> its<00:06:26.159> thrall<00:06:27.089> condition<00:06:28.159> the

leave it in its thrall condition the
Scotch<00:06:29.550> pad<00:06:30.000> right<00:06:30.389> here<00:06:30.649> is<00:06:32.960> that's<00:06:33.960> a<00:06:34.080> pretty

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
Scotch pad right here is that's a pretty

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.499 
Scotch pad right here is that's a pretty
decent<00:06:34.710> finish<00:06:34.860> all<00:06:35.189> the<00:06:35.310> way<00:06:35.430> around<00:06:35.759> looks

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
decent finish all the way around looks

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.730 
decent finish all the way around looks
looks<00:06:37.020> good<00:06:37.259> and<00:06:37.439> clean<00:06:38.360> but<00:06:39.360> right<00:06:39.719> here<00:06:39.750> is<00:06:40.680> a

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
looks good and clean but right here is a

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.540 
looks good and clean but right here is a
flat<00:06:41.339> place<00:06:41.759> in<00:06:42.060> that<00:06:42.270> pulley<00:06:43.069> right<00:06:44.069> there

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
flat place in that pulley right there

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.189 
flat place in that pulley right there
it's<00:06:44.729> it's<00:06:45.029> probably<00:06:45.240> been<00:06:45.539> dropped<00:06:45.899> on<00:06:46.139> that

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
it's it's probably been dropped on that

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.600 
it's it's probably been dropped on that
on<00:06:47.159> this<00:06:47.370> side<00:06:47.699> also<00:06:48.449> a<00:06:49.169> completely<00:06:50.099> opposite

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
place a little more extreme there are

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.119 
place a little more extreme there are
three<00:06:57.360> of<00:06:57.539> them<00:06:57.689> there's<00:06:58.349> another<00:06:58.710> one<00:06:58.949> down

here<00:06:59.460> and<00:06:59.610> a<00:06:59.699> nick<00:06:59.939> it's<00:07:00.930> it's<00:07:01.379> the<00:07:01.919> the

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
here and a nick it's it's the the

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.790 
here and a nick it's it's the the
flywheel<00:07:02.849> will<00:07:03.180> beat<00:07:03.479> out<00:07:03.719> of<00:07:03.960> true<00:07:04.289> it<00:07:04.649> will

flywheel will beat out of true it will

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.889 
flywheel will beat out of true it will
be<00:07:04.979> out<00:07:05.189> of<00:07:05.370> a<00:07:05.460> balance<00:07:05.909> I'm<00:07:06.270> going<00:07:06.539> to<00:07:06.629> the

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:06.899 
be out of a balance I'm going to the

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:08.389 
be out of a balance I'm going to the
reason<00:07:07.259> I<00:07:07.349> cleaned<00:07:07.709> it<00:07:07.830> up<00:07:07.979> and<00:07:08.159> going

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:08.399 
reason I cleaned it up and going

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.980 
reason I cleaned it up and going
painting<00:07:08.819> everything<00:07:09.089> is<00:07:09.389> because<00:07:09.719> of<00:07:09.899> the

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
painting everything is because of the

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.170 
painting everything is because of the
serial<00:07:10.289> number<00:07:10.560> what<00:07:11.190> I'll<00:07:11.370> do<00:07:11.669> is

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 
serial number what I'll do is

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.510 
serial number what I'll do is
I'm<00:07:12.449> gonna<00:07:12.660> put<00:07:12.930> this<00:07:13.080> on<00:07:13.289> the<00:07:13.350> engine<00:07:13.889> we<00:07:14.280> will

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
I'm gonna put this on the engine we will

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.450 
I'm gonna put this on the engine we will
start<00:07:14.940> the<00:07:15.120> engine<00:07:15.150> with<00:07:15.810> this<00:07:16.110> flywheel<00:07:16.460> if

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
start the engine with this flywheel if

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.400 
start the engine with this flywheel if
the<00:07:17.759> engine<00:07:18.120> was<00:07:18.240> ever<00:07:18.509> going<00:07:18.810> to<00:07:18.930> go<00:07:19.050> into

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.410 
the engine was ever going to go into

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.719 
the engine was ever going to go into
service<00:07:19.710> and<00:07:20.009> then<00:07:20.160> you<00:07:20.280> would<00:07:20.430> want<00:07:20.639> to

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.729 
service and then you would want to

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:23.540 
service and then you would want to
change<00:07:20.940> this<00:07:21.270> flywheel<00:07:21.660> to<00:07:22.259> one<00:07:22.500> that<00:07:22.770> was<00:07:23.009> in

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
change this flywheel to one that was in

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.749 
change this flywheel to one that was in
perfect<00:07:24.150> roundness<00:07:24.740> because<00:07:25.740> of<00:07:25.979> vibration

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 
perfect roundness because of vibration

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:29.300 
perfect roundness because of vibration
here<00:07:27.330> we'll<00:07:27.660> telescope<00:07:28.440> itself<00:07:28.979> through<00:07:29.280> the

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
here we'll telescope itself through the

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.210 
here we'll telescope itself through the
crankshaft<00:07:29.669> to<00:07:30.419> the<00:07:30.870> bushings<00:07:31.470> and<00:07:31.740> it<00:07:31.979> will

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
crankshaft to the bushings and it will

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.200 
crankshaft to the bushings and it will
wear<00:07:32.520> the<00:07:32.729> bushings<00:07:33.240> out<00:07:33.449> post<00:07:34.050> haste<00:07:34.919> I<00:07:35.460> mean

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210 
wear the bushings out post haste I mean

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.330 
wear the bushings out post haste I mean
we<00:07:36.389> talking<00:07:36.900> about<00:07:37.139> some<00:07:37.380> bushings<00:07:37.830> get<00:07:38.070> wore

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
we talking about some bushings get wore

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.170 
we talking about some bushings get wore
out<00:07:38.660> because<00:07:39.660> of<00:07:40.139> a<00:07:40.520> flywheel<00:07:41.520> that's<00:07:41.880> out<00:07:42.150> of

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 
out because of a flywheel that's out of

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.320 
out because of a flywheel that's out of
balance<00:07:42.979> we<00:07:43.979> go<00:07:44.160> get<00:07:44.400> over<00:07:44.580> to<00:07:44.759> something<00:07:45.060> else

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:45.330 
balance we go get over to something else

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.310 
balance we go get over to something else
now

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:47.320 
now

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:54.870 
now
just<00:07:48.320> something<00:07:48.620> to<00:07:48.650> think<00:07:48.800> about<00:07:51.010> it's<00:07:52.010> a<00:07:52.420> 72

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:54.880 
just something to think about it's a 72

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.960 
just something to think about it's a 72
