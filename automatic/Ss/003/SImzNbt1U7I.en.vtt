a lot about what critique is look
another<00:01:37.110> continue<00:01:37.560> point<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.600> there's<00:01:39.600> all

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
another continue point and there's all

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.600 
another continue point and there's all
these<00:01:39.960> different<00:01:40.320> patterns<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.950> things<00:01:41.340> going

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
these different patterns of things going

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.960 
these different patterns of things going
and<00:01:41.759> I've<00:01:41.909> learned<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.329> best<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:44.430> slow

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
and I've learned it's best to be slow

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.690 
and I've learned it's best to be slow
and<00:01:45.000> beware<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:46.710> unsafe<00:01:47.280> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and beware see that was very unsafe I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.359 
and beware see that was very unsafe I
jumped<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> exact<00:01:48.960> wrong<00:01:49.170> moment<00:01:49.380> twice<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
jumped at the exact wrong moment twice I

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.469 
jumped at the exact wrong moment twice I
cannot<00:01:50.759> believe<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.119> lifted<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
cannot believe I lifted that

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.870 
cannot believe I lifted that
and<00:01:53.409> that's<00:01:53.860> what<00:01:54.039> I<00:01:54.070> get<00:01:54.280> for<00:01:54.430> living<00:01:54.670> through

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
and that's what I get for living through

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.240 
and that's what I get for living through
that<00:01:55.350> luckily<00:01:56.350> there's<00:01:56.649> lots<00:01:56.799> of<00:01:56.890> continued

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
that luckily there's lots of continued

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.940 
that luckily there's lots of continued
points<00:01:57.549> around<00:01:57.759> this<00:01:57.939> part<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:59.799> they

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
points around this part because they

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.169 
points around this part because they
know<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.130> you're<00:02:00.520> gonna<00:02:00.640> die<00:02:00.880> because

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
know that you're gonna die because

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.840 
know that you're gonna die because
there's<00:02:01.509> all<00:02:01.659> these<00:02:01.689> random<00:02:02.200> things<00:02:02.850> they

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
there's all these random things they

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.149 
there's all these random things they
actually<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.990> pattern<00:02:05.380> is<00:02:05.500> pretty<00:02:05.560> easy<00:02:05.950> to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
actually the pattern is pretty easy to

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.009 
actually the pattern is pretty easy to
pay<00:02:06.759> attention<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.240> as<00:02:07.450> long<00:02:07.630> as<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:07.869> actually

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
pay attention to as long as you actually

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.790 
pay attention to as long as you actually
pay<00:02:08.289> attention<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.569> then<00:02:10.869> there's<00:02:11.080> one<00:02:11.319> here

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
pay attention and then there's one here

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.880 
pay attention and then there's one here
where<00:02:12.580> there<00:02:12.790> are<00:02:12.940> two<00:02:13.300> going<00:02:13.630> around<00:02:13.900> plus

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
where there are two going around plus

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.949 
where there are two going around plus
one<00:02:15.250> above<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:18.330> extra<00:02:19.330> good<00:02:19.450> alright<00:02:19.690> there's

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
one above it extra good alright there's
