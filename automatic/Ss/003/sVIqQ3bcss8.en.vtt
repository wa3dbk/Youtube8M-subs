sticking<00:00:02.850> on<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.060> body<00:00:03.270> so<00:00:03.870> here<00:00:04.529> now<00:00:05.430> now<00:00:06.210> in

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
sticking on the body so here now now in

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.350 
sticking on the body so here now now in
relation<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:07.020> if<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:08.069> come<00:00:08.639> over<00:00:08.670> here<00:00:09.120> use

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
relation to if you come over here use

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.839 
relation to if you come over here use
one<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.660> your<00:00:09.809> pins<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.740> yeah<00:00:10.889> yeah<00:00:11.070> and

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
one of your pins this one yeah yeah and

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.330 
one of your pins this one yeah yeah and
the<00:00:12.059> point<00:00:12.809> here<00:00:13.170> as<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.740> point<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.219> reference

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the point here as a point of reference

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.390 
the point here as a point of reference
okay<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.900> when<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:16.980> see<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
okay so when I do this can you see it

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.189 
okay so when I do this can you see it
moves<00:00:18.920> but<00:00:19.920> now<00:00:20.160> if<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.240> push<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.720> foot<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
moves but now if I push that foot and

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.269 
moves but now if I push that foot and
this<00:00:22.380> does<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:22.619> move

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
this does not move

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.700 
this does not move
can<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:23.970> see<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.170> does<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.500> move

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
can you see because it does not move

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.050 
can you see because it does not move
that<00:00:26.160> push<00:00:26.460> went<00:00:26.849> into<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.390> foot<00:00:27.949> and<00:00:28.949> if<00:00:29.910> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
that push went into that foot and if I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.089 
that push went into that foot and if I
do<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.050> push<00:00:31.289> moves<00:00:31.710> this

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
do this can you see that push moves this

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.180 
do this can you see that push moves this
dot<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:33.630> very<00:00:33.780> important<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.980> does

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
dot so it's very important if this does

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.310 
dot so it's very important if this does
not<00:00:35.370> move<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.820> acts<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> pivoting<00:00:37.079> point

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
not move it acts as a pivoting point

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.830 
not move it acts as a pivoting point
then<00:00:37.800> power<00:00:38.100> goes<00:00:38.430> somewhere<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.540> case

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
then power goes somewhere in this case

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.959 
then power goes somewhere in this case
in<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.200> art<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:41.520> legs

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
in this art of my legs

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.150 
in this art of my legs
it<00:00:42.210> went<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> other<00:00:42.780> foot<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.890> push

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it went to the other foot so if I push

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.549 
it went to the other foot so if I push
that<00:00:44.340> foot<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.910> does<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.570> then<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.289> not

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that foot it does this and then I do not

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
that foot it does this and then I do not
allow<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.910> goes<00:00:48.149> here

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
allow that can you see it goes here

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.500 
allow that can you see it goes here
mm-hmm<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.860> goes<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.399> side<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.449> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
mm-hmm it goes to that side so this is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.760 
mm-hmm it goes to that side so this is
the<00:00:51.719> transfer<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.530> power<00:00:53.600> now<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> same

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the transfer of power now at the same

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.310 
the transfer of power now at the same
time<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.460> transfer<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.329> way<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.109> when

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
time this transfer is this way so when

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.869 
time this transfer is this way so when
you<00:00:58.469> look<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.340> as<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.550> demarcation

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you look at this one as a demarcation

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.630 
you look at this one as a demarcation
line<00:01:00.420> any<00:01:00.989> movement<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:01.949> long<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.430> this

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
line any movement here as long as this

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.520 
line any movement here as long as this
line<00:01:02.879> does<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.120> move<00:01:03.449> goes<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> bottom

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
line does not move goes to the bottom

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.490 
line does not move goes to the bottom
and<00:01:04.860> any<00:01:05.790> move<00:01:06.060> from<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> bottom<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.290> same

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and any move from the bottom at the same

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
and any move from the bottom at the same
time<00:01:07.740> goes<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> top<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.150> this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
time goes to the top if you have this

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
time goes to the top if you have this
lot<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.520> left<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.420> top

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
lot and now you have left right on top

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.350 
lot and now you have left right on top
left<00:01:13.320> right<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.460> bottom<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.330> top

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
left right at the bottom and the top

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.920 
left right at the bottom and the top
bottom<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:16.500> you've<00:01:16.680> got<00:01:16.710> four<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.720> this<00:01:18.720> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
bottom so now you've got four go this is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.460 
bottom so now you've got four go this is
1<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.799> 2<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:20.970> 3<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.920> 4<00:01:23.659> 1<00:01:24.659> 2<00:01:24.869> 3<00:01:25.110> 4

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
1 this is 2 this is 3 this is 4 1 2 3 4

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.620 
1 this is 2 this is 3 this is 4 1 2 3 4
now<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:26.820> got<00:01:27.000> four<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> them

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
now you got four of them

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.289 
now you got four of them
so<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> first<00:01:28.320> combination<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.579> first<00:01:30.090> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
so the first combination is the first is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.039 
so the first combination is the first is
1<00:01:30.570> 2<00:01:31.259> 3<00:01:32.159> 4<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.869> now<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.350> 4<00:01:34.680> counts<00:01:35.640> for

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
1 2 3 4 so now you got 4 counts for

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.450 
1 2 3 4 so now you got 4 counts for
occurrences<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.280> pieces

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
occurrences of pieces

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.800 
occurrences of pieces
the<00:01:38.880> second<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.509> 1<00:01:39.930> into<00:01:40.200> 2<00:01:40.500> becomes<00:01:41.810> then

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the second is 1 into 2 becomes then

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.020 
the second is 1 into 2 becomes then
let's<00:01:43.590> say<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:46.159> 1<00:01:47.159> plus<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> bottom

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
let's say here and 1 plus the bottom

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.149 
let's say here and 1 plus the bottom
this<00:01:48.270> time<00:01:48.329> okay<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:50.009> this

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
this time okay so we have this

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.319 
this time okay so we have this
inclination<00:01:50.759> we<00:01:51.479> always<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
inclination we always like to do this

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.560 
inclination we always like to do this
the<00:01:54.329> bottom<00:01:54.750> likes<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.200> go<00:01:55.320> down<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.420> look<00:01:57.420> at

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the bottom likes to go down and look at

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.420 
the bottom likes to go down and look at
this<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.530> always<00:01:58.740> look<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.460> to<00:02:00.000> go<00:02:00.360> up

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
this here we always look like to go up

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.240 
this here we always look like to go up
so<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.579> top<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.780> shoulder<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> very

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.460 

what<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.369> call<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.780> shoulder<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
what do you call it the shoulder is the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.830 
what do you call it the shoulder is the

that<00:02:12.840> because<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:13.560> here<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.189> has<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.610> shape

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
that because it's here it has this shape

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.819 
that because it's here it has this shape
you<00:02:15.269> see<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:15.689> all<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.019> time<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.379> when<00:02:16.560> this

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
you see it all the time but when this

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.890 
you see it all the time but when this
happens<00:02:17.370> when<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.849> shoulder<00:02:18.209> pops<00:02:18.510> your

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
happens when the shoulder pops your

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.690 
happens when the shoulder pops your
whole<00:02:19.110> body<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.439> popping<00:02:19.829> just<00:02:20.069> over<00:02:20.370> here<00:02:20.579> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
whole body is popping just over here you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.660 
whole body is popping just over here you
cannot<00:02:20.939> see<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.980> couldn't<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.489> your

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
cannot see and and you couldn't see your

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.100 
cannot see and and you couldn't see your
body<00:02:23.819> was<00:02:24.060> doing<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.420> before<00:02:24.599> that's<00:02:24.900> right

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
body was doing that before that's right

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.710 
body was doing that before that's right
now<00:02:25.260> I'm<00:02:25.379> saying<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.739> don't<00:02:25.890> move<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.720> I'm

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
now I'm saying and don't move and I'm

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.390 
now I'm saying and don't move and I'm
holding<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.200> because<00:02:28.620> otherwise<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:29.129> do<00:02:29.280> not

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
holding you because otherwise you do not

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.750 
holding you because otherwise you do not
know<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:30.090> was<00:02:30.209> doing<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.319> now<00:02:31.560> our

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
know that it was doing that so now our

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.460 
know that it was doing that so now our
thing<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.970> here<00:02:33.239> if<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.569> go<00:02:33.750> behind<00:02:33.930> me<00:02:34.260> give

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
thing is here if you go behind me give

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.080 
thing is here if you go behind me give
me<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:35.280> put<00:02:36.060> your<00:02:36.090> hand<00:02:36.390> here<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.870> here

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
me that and put your hand here and here

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.750 
me that and put your hand here and here
and<00:02:39.090> here<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.500> our<00:02:40.709> problem

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
and here so this is our problem

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.500 
and here so this is our problem
you<00:02:42.689> see<00:02:42.900> everybody<00:02:43.560> has<00:02:43.769> this<00:02:43.950> problem<00:02:44.510> can

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
you see everybody has this problem can

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.479 
you see everybody has this problem can
you<00:02:45.540> see<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:45.959> goes<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:46.379> this<00:02:46.560> goes<00:02:46.620> down<00:02:47.069> when

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
you see this goes up this goes down when

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.360 
you see this goes up this goes down when
that<00:02:47.609> happens<00:02:48.150> we're<00:02:48.599> all<00:02:48.810> doing<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:50.190> when

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
that happens we're all doing it so when

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.759 
that happens we're all doing it so when
we<00:02:50.519> push<00:02:50.760> hands<00:02:51.000> we<00:02:51.209> do<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.389> lot<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.659> this<00:02:51.930> now

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
we push hands we do a lot of this now

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.009 
we push hands we do a lot of this now
watch<00:02:53.340> what<00:02:53.609> happens<00:02:53.670> can<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.480> feel<00:02:54.750> what

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
watch what happens can you feel what

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.460 
watch what happens can you feel what
happened<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:57.299> top<00:02:57.569> goes<00:02:57.870> down<00:02:58.109> where<00:02:58.319> the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
happened the top goes down where the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.229 
happened the top goes down where the
bottom<00:02:58.769> goes<00:02:59.010> upward<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.519> they<00:02:59.909> will<00:03:00.030> try<00:03:00.209> to

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
bottom goes upward and they will try to

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.839 
bottom goes upward and they will try to
meet<00:03:00.569> in<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.900> middle<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.230> that's<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.250> primary

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
meet in the middle and that's a primary

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.960 
meet in the middle and that's a primary
action<00:03:03.329> of<00:03:03.840> our<00:03:04.109> yield<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:05.129> our<00:03:05.459> Tai<00:03:05.730> Chi

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
action of our yield of our Tai Chi

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.210 
action of our yield of our Tai Chi
action<00:03:06.359> so<00:03:06.599> when<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.200> circle<00:03:07.620> same

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
action so when you do the circle same

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.460 
action so when you do the circle same
from<00:03:08.459> here<00:03:08.700> you're<00:03:09.060> trying<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.540> accept<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:10.049> you

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
from here you're trying to accept it you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.410 
from here you're trying to accept it you
will<00:03:10.709> always<00:03:10.980> keep<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.609> minded<00:03:12.030> does<00:03:12.239> this

conform to making Punk and it does so

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.210 
conform to making Punk and it does so
you<00:03:18.299> think<00:03:18.629> about<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:19.079> five-pointed<00:03:19.769> rump<00:03:19.980> you

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
you think about a five-pointed rump you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.879 
you think about a five-pointed rump you
make<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> drum<00:03:20.879> with<00:03:21.329> five<00:03:21.690> dots<00:03:22.319> on<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
make a drum with five dots on the

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.250 
make a drum with five dots on the

outside nail the certain nail the hide

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.460 
outside nail the certain nail the hide
onto<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.190> frame<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.669> those<00:03:27.359> were<00:03:27.750> never<00:03:27.989> when

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
onto the frame and those were never when

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.140 
onto the frame and those were never when
you<00:03:28.560> nail<00:03:28.799> them<00:03:29.040> down<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.519> means<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.879> does<00:03:30.000> not

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
you nail them down it means it does not

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.539 
you nail them down it means it does not
go<00:03:30.419> inward<00:03:30.810> anymore<00:03:31.199> because<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.129> drum<00:03:32.370> is

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
go inward anymore because the drum is

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.759 
go inward anymore because the drum is
you<00:03:32.730> hit<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.120> when<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.629> hit<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.019> middle<00:03:34.349> the

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
you hit it when you hit the middle the

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.949 
you hit it when you hit the middle the
outside<00:03:35.250> nailing<00:03:35.730> nailed<00:03:36.120> down<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.750> the

outside nailing nailed down is the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.000 
outside nailing nailed down is the
equivalent<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.530> pushing<00:03:37.859> out<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:39.859> then<00:03:40.859> so

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
equivalent of pushing out and then so

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.860 
equivalent of pushing out and then so
that<00:03:41.040> tension<00:03:41.790> surface<00:03:41.970> attention<00:03:42.540> you
