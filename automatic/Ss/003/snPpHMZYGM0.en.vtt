00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:08.040
 edition of ios tips today i show 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.420
 you like rape in the newsstand 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.420
 can hide 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.349
 you see I have several apps in here 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.789
 I can stow away in my newspaper kiosk 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.919
 open it anytime and you 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.840
 work as normal normally 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.360
 and i'll show you how to get the apps in 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.160
 Your newsstand gets it first 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.190
 you have to go to the newsstand on the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.040
 second page your apps set page 1 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.600
 page 2 and to the newspaper kiosk airline 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.420
 then you have on page 3 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.360
 the apps that yes in the newspaper, churches 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.760
 eg do red line in the case 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.400
 what he does now is you do as 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.460
 first on the homebutton stop immediately 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.220
 after that the app that we in the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.890
 wanted to move newspaper kiosk and 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.659
 then after the iphone on the first one 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.830
 page has jumped he pulls all 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.530
 quickly back to the second page 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.229
 I'll show you this like this 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.540
 looks like a bit back button 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.869
 hold and over it when it wobbles 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.060
 pushes her on newspaper kiosk 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.400
 and then on the home button and then 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.080
 Do you have the app in there 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.140
 I'll show you the whole thing again 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.399
 hold the home button and finish that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.820
 cool that you can have as many apps as 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.179
 you want 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:43.380
 We store in the newsstand 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:44.579
 times more thing in and you see can I 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.659
 then here actually infinitely far 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.030
 scroll down 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.219
 you can also folder in that 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.869
 news stand Invite 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.109
 so to speak works with the same 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109
 technology 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.299
 as already mentioned you can actually 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.630
 endless apps in this 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.090
 loading newsstands 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.130
 you just can not get it out of that 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.959
 remove newsstand as you can see 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.640
 you can not get out there anymore 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.319
 just as you do not like them 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.480
 no more, we stay in there then 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:27.849
 except dam there restart your iphone 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.620
 new and it's pretty easy though 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.290
 would just have the folder he in 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.360
 newspaper handle had to try 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.180
 to open 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.530
 and as you can see that does not work 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.200
 it's just relative then 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.060
 quickly back on and you have to neither in 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.220
 otherwise enter something else 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.380
 the only thing then again not so 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.180
 It's great that all the apps were on the before 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.180
 Newsstands were now deleted 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.150
 It would be a funny thing 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.760
 function in ios sex and now again 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.470
 It is important that if you look after them 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.459
 the home button pressed to the side 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.569
 One comes that we quickly afterwards 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.579
 covers the second page 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.970
 otherwise the whole thing does not work 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.010
 that means everything has to be done relatively fast 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.630
 and well- timed do not work 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.450
 be frustrated if it is not the same 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.639
 at the first time works out at some point will 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.470
 in any case so much 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.720
 that you I hope you have this 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.329
 feature not yet known and have 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.489
 success in trying out as I said 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:39.900
 do not exist if it does not go away 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.900
 In any case, have fun with iOS tips
