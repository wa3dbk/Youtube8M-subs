00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
obviously in the two thousand but I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.070 
obviously in the two thousand but I
think<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> 1000<00:01:25.770> maybe<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.159> well<00:01:26.369> and

but by his own high standards he is only

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.890 
but by his own high standards he is only
ever<00:02:22.020> one<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.380> 1000<00:02:22.920> guineas<00:02:23.040> once<00:02:23.569> he<00:02:24.569> has<00:02:24.720> had

several several offices get beat by his
own<00:02:27.989> high<00:02:28.200> standards<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.069> poor<00:02:29.280> record

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
own high standards it's a poor record

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.600 
own high standards it's a poor record
and<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.380> reason<00:02:31.560> as<00:02:31.980> we've

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
and I think this is the reason as we've

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.250 
and I think this is the reason as we've
alluded<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.330> two<00:02:33.510> thousand<00:02:33.959> Guineas

it<00:02:39.120> seems<00:02:39.360> particularly<00:02:39.989> so<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.790> beginnings

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
it seems particularly so in beginnings

poor boy standards and discourse after i

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.660 
poor boy standards and discourse after i
think<00:02:58.349> that<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.920> good<00:02:59.069> ol<00:02:59.160> fan<00:02:59.310> offices<00:02:59.580> have

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
got a strong hand i think that lyric of

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.610 
got a strong hand i think that lyric of
line<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> very<00:03:02.760> good<00:03:02.819> or<00:03:03.000> two<00:03:03.349> but<00:03:04.349> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
line is a very good or two but the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.740 
line is a very good or two but the
reason<00:03:04.799> God<00:03:05.069> for<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.400> course<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:06.360> because

discourse<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.549> lyrical<00:03:50.819> I<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.000> think<00:03:51.299> it's

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
discourse in lyrical I I think it's

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.990 
discourse in lyrical I I think it's
about<00:03:51.630> eight<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.840> ten<00:03:52.139> to<00:03:52.290> one<00:03:52.670> but<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.910> that

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
about eight and ten to one but just that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.849 
about eight and ten to one but just that
simple<00:03:54.269> fact<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.780> good<00:03:55.200> often<00:03:55.500> were<00:03:55.620> willing

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
simple fact that good often were willing

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.949 
simple fact that good often were willing
to<00:03:55.889> give<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.160> give<00:03:56.700> discourse<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.269> prep<00:03:57.569> the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
to give it give discourse to prep the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.860 
to give it give discourse to prep the
prep<00:03:58.200> gallop<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.859> not<00:03:59.280> lyrical<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.090> suggest

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
prep gallop and not lyrical I suggest

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.390 
prep gallop and not lyrical I suggest
that<00:04:00.959> they<00:04:01.139> think<00:04:01.230> discourse<00:04:01.799> is<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.069> one<00:04:02.190> for

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
that they think discourse is the one for

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.650 
that they think discourse is the one for
the<00:04:02.430> guineas<00:04:02.700> that's<00:04:02.910> not<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.180> say<00:04:03.329> lyric<00:04:03.600> of
