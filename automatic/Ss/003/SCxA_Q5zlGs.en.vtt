00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.830
 62 of art a 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.430
 all 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.430
 agip 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.340
 in an advanced state of restoration yes 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.230
 actually to the tar that decomposition 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.320
 it was right on the edge of 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.239
 decomposition this era were 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.110
 the famous a whitened sepulcher below 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:44.110
 a layer of anti-noise stucco paint 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.019
 and various bales there was a reborn that 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.670
 guys the bodywork was fine 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.739
 to be thrown in the wreckage on the see 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.750
 what you can recover will come out 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.489
 however a very lived and very thing 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.890
 lived now we will see what there is 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.820
 you can do but in short you must not 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:08.830
 be new because otherwise it is not worth it 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 now let's take a ride in front of you and you are 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:17.970
 away that it's not too bad too hood 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.970
 does with italy 1 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.290
 coffee from English friends 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.000
 actually we finished putting 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.390
 fenders together and all because 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.250
 they didn't go very far in vellum either 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:50.229
 the zac hat and away from Franco 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.890
 gasoline battery and at 19 to one e 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:58.630
 then we succeeded yes we have 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:05.550
 reassembled the bridges comfortably without doing 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:10.950
 the slightest effort with ours 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:14.730
 bridge car ii and we went from enchantment 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 we treated a little bit 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.430
 a bit all the assembly of many 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.430
 sectors 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:36.030
 all we are ready for now 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.650
 to reverse the opposite is the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.320
 I'll put back on the easels to be able 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.310
 work in life to be able to assemble a 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.480
 a little all you need maybe once 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.590
 we put it on the wheels and stay with it 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.510
 low back now years 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.730
 they pass and you have to place yourself 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.390
 comfortable comfortable for it too much 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.190
 fatigue 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:09.710
 verona franco ecco then went to mendes 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.840
 it's perfect 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.700
 but it can make me arrive frankly protected 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.150
 contrary you don't have to give me the charge since 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.150
 bass 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.750
 yes yes yes yes but now we turn the whole 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.990
 otherwise at least we know better fantela 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.630
 as the thing gets better there is more 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.660
 the speech is not as logical as it is 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.030
 iniquitous pistol that the right was left 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.380
 to the left it goes to the right and the right goes 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.850
 we start the pause we seem 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.200
 montecitorio that is doing the 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.380
 elections 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.250
 the right and left force see you in 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:04:00.130
 a next phase 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:04:00.130
 ok then we have advanced state of 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:16.150
 of decomposition of composition there 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.150
 we put up the mute to the bike 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:30.290
 they have however france and luca had put in 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:33.410
 the motor's motion is yes that the candleholder 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.410
 carburato de france 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.410
 pupetta 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:55.430
 and all things there well pedals a wanted 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:55.430
 arm yourself with everything there is also driving 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:04.350
 that particular that dirty of the di 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:08.150
 as frank as someone wants us to be 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.150
 some details not so much for 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.230
 giuseppe antonio marco filippo 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:35.030
 morgillo organizer the mockery 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:38.860
 where every day became an uncertain e 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:43.040
 now I go now I'm going to civilize the 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:46.090
 the transmissions is that in the end we see 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.090
 better than channel 5
