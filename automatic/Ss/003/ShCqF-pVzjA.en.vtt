00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 we say that we made a point 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:10.019
 important for carlo because they are the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:12.250
 11:15 do more 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.379
 they played a hefty game with 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.920
 a right spirit 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.390
 sin for the exclusion but we are 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.310
 happy with the performance the result 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.890
 it's a game we played 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.980
 very well we went into trouble 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.460
 every five 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.740
 time in my opinion 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.219
 free immediately found the goal on a 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.930
 our mistake 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.989
 instead we kept a game well 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.519
 we also kept suffering a little for 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.900
 they had kept after when we were 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.340
 remained in ten and what 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.960
 where is the match joins me that 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.680
 definitely because in a day 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.470
 really 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.510
 the desire is instead passed satisfaction 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.380
 which, instead, as he wished he had 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.600
 an important point brought him home 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.890
 team playing was a moment too 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.450
 difficult that there was a team that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.300
 however it did not close behind ha 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.460
 tried to play from the first minute 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.530
 I was pretty sure we would do it 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 result today indeed I was convinced 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.940
 even that we would have succeeded also in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.410
 win this game and I think without it 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.010
 the expulsion of our goalkeeper 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.450
 surely the entry of the deputy would have 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.550
 it would surely hurt because up 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.009
 that band they were suffering from 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.590
 and unfortunately we find ourselves again 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.800
 in ten, however, a great goalkeeper is one 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.810
 an important parade of pelizzoli 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.350
 is an experienced player and a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.240
 player who will surely lend a hand 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 to this group in this direction 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.040
 question mowatt result when me 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.160
 however, they have proven to be more popular 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.240
 form instead another with this is the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.310
 secret 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.060
 the important result because the environment 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.710
 needs some enthusiasm 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 it is starting from here your experience 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.750
 said something about elections before 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.610
 rigor for nothing, nothing nothing 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.299
 because he said it's a sign like 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.299
 this starts 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.590
 rather
