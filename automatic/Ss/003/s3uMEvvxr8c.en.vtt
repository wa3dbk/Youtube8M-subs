00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
speaker for the heavyset or the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.090 
speaker for the heavyset or the
microphone<00:00:33.720> of<00:00:34.110> course<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.560> have<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> built-in

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
microphone of course we have a built-in

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.610 
microphone of course we have a built-in
microphone<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> design<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.410> for

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
microphone so this is a design the for

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.799 
microphone so this is a design the for
the<00:00:37.739> kid<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.460> android<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.239> desktop<00:00:39.780> computer

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the kid is android a desktop computer

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.410 
the kid is android a desktop computer
using<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> android<00:00:41.130> OS<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.610> customize<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
using the android OS we customize the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.260 
using the android OS we customize the
operating<00:00:42.870> system<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.550> made<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:45.000> our

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
operating system and then we made it our

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.400 
operating system and then we made it our
own<00:00:45.660> skin<00:00:46.290> on<00:00:46.620> top<00:00:46.650> of<00:00:47.070> android<00:00:47.520> OS<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.510> parents

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
own skin on top of android OS so parents

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.550 
own skin on top of android OS so parents
can<00:00:49.790> prepare<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.820> case<00:00:51.390> account<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.290> then

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
can prepare the case account and then

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.340 
can prepare the case account and then
they<00:00:52.770> set<00:00:53.040> up<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> remotely<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.750> for

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
they set up the remotely and then for

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.800 
they set up the remotely and then for
example<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.040> just<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.760> one<00:00:56.970> over<00:00:57.150> example

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
example this is just a one over example

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.110 
example this is just a one over example
my<00:00:58.590> son<00:00:58.890> used<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.950> i<00:01:02.760> can

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
my son used this one and so the i can

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.170 
my son used this one and so the i can
log<00:01:03.360> in<00:01:03.540> from<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> beginning

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.280 

so<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.420> have<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.960> coder<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:08.980> some<00:01:09.660> if<00:01:10.660> son<00:01:10.990> is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
so I have a coder and some if son is

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.760 
so I have a coder and some if son is
using<00:01:11.800> this<00:01:12.010> so<00:01:12.940> then<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.630> have<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:13.960> separate<00:01:14.440> set

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
using this so then I have a separate set

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.720 
using this so then I have a separate set
of<00:01:15.120> Android<00:01:16.120> application<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.680> if<00:01:18.070> kids<00:01:18.490> are

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
of Android application and if kids are

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.920 
of Android application and if kids are
you<00:01:19.150> know<00:01:19.320> play<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.530> game<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.640> then<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.780> then

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
you know play the game and then and then

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.600 
you know play the game and then and then
I<00:01:23.080> I<00:01:23.850> am<00:01:24.850> out<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.330> a<00:01:25.630> home<00:01:25.870> and<00:01:26.430> he's<00:01:27.430> supposed

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.719 
have a choice remotely through the cloud
in<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.280> stop<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:46.720> know<00:01:46.869> this<00:01:47.710> app<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.490> then

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
in a stop to you know this app so then

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.290 
in a stop to you know this app so then
then<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.990> going<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.740> be<00:01:50.860> 10<00:01:51.100> second<00:01:51.520> later<00:01:51.759> over

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
then is going to be 10 second later over

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.920 
then is going to be 10 second later over
the<00:01:52.450> cloud<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:53.530> will<00:01:53.770> be<00:01:53.920> finished<00:01:54.399> so<00:01:55.149> then

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
the cloud it will be finished so then

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.859 
the cloud it will be finished so then
the<00:01:56.229> kids<00:01:56.470> know<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.160> then<00:01:57.700> if<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.420> don't<00:01:58.660> like

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
then you can eliminate the disk roots

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.810 
then you can eliminate the disk roots
need<00:02:02.080> for<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.740> time<00:02:02.950> being<00:02:03.220> on<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.460> finish<00:02:03.670> the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
need for the time being on to finish the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.510
