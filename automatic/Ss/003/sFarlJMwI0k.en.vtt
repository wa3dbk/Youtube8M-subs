00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.639
 beautiful to all the boys well returned the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.080
 my channel welcome in a new one 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.220
 gta 5 episode 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.750
 today I will show you another god 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.490
 usual very short mysteries and I tell you 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.679
 only we should have played a good one 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.470
 slice of the history of the campaign 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.900
 in short, and we have to replay one 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.449
 mission then we will start game 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.110
 repeating main mission and we will go to 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.390
 replay the number number mission 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.600
 wait until I find it here it is 46 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.750
 in short, we must predator behind 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.400
 replaying it is practically I do not want 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.129
 spoiler hails the mission if not 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.280
 you did it then I cut you big 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.580
 part of the mission and meet again in 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.939
 point in which in short there is the mystery that 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.199
 I have to show you so we got it 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.110
 the helicopter 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:10.820
 now I will summarize the mission briefly 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.610
 but do n't spoil me or anything then this 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.430
 mission we should chase one 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.760
 car in short with four people 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.540
 inside and that a certain point yes 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.330
 these four people will crash 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.610
 they will scatter through the woods because 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.920
 they want to escape just us with 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.060
 michael and trevor precisely aboard a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.940
 helicopter 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.040
 we will go over the wood where there is maicol 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.920
 who was chasing where Franklin is 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.260
 which precisely followed the car us with 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.840
 michael thanks to a sniper rifle 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.409
 with thermal sight we will be able to peck 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.890
 the guys even if they are covered by 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.110
 leaves 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.460
 so we could check in from above 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.040
 harley 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.710
 but what is curious is that you see there is 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.020
 franklin that tells us where to go e 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.119
 that here is bigfoot 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.709
 or rather what appears to be a 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.379
 likud since the people precisely 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.640
 they run around the woods that is 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:17.120
 the only way to recognize them here 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.260
 we will be able to notice a firm figure that to a 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:26.299
 certain point disappears but still results 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.739
 be a mystery of the big foot vi 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.569
 I recommend doing it very quickly 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.760
 because after a while they disappear 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.829
 in fact it is more or less in this area not 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.040
 has returned nothing okay is nothing for 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.599
 this episode is everything I have noticed now 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.880
 that I don't have to say when I'll do the 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.280
 next episode because then with time 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.780
 so I can't do it rightly 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.310
 angry if I don't upload the video for 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.310
 when I say, however, just ok 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.790
 I succeed I do another I think it will be of 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.560
 assassin's creed 3 why should we also 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.019
 finishing it would be even now 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.180
 said this from gta 5 everything also to 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.599
 we will mention this little episode 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.599
 next
