case I'm just going to press the button
I'm<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> capture<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.530> top<00:00:37.800> part<00:00:38.129> of

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
I'm going to capture the top part of

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.310 
I'm going to capture the top part of
this<00:00:38.340> paper<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:40.100> so<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.140> do<00:00:43.140> its

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
this paper and so it's going to do its

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
this paper and so it's going to do its
thing<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.980> try<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.289> figure<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.410> exactly<00:00:47.070> what

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
thing and try to figure out exactly what

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.860 
thing and try to figure out exactly what
this<00:00:48.239> content<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:51.110> what<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.440> editable<00:00:53.870> so

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this content is and what is editable so

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.110 
this content is and what is editable so
it<00:00:54.930> takes<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.260> minute<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.280> taking<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> photo

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it takes a minute but taking the photo

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.119 
it takes a minute but taking the photo
doesn't<00:00:57.449> take<00:00:57.660> very<00:00:57.690> long<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.980> this

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
doesn't take very long now I have this

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.130 
doesn't take very long now I have this
in<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> need<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> convert

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
in here and what I need to do is convert

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.689 
in here and what I need to do is convert
to<00:01:01.350> edit<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.070> tap<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.370> convert

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
to edit so I'm going to tap on convert

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.469 
to edit so I'm going to tap on convert
to<00:01:02.850> edit<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:05.060> basically<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to edit and basically this is going to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.640 
to edit and basically this is going to
turn<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.290> actual<00:01:07.860> writing<00:01:08.280> into<00:01:08.790> lines<00:01:09.650> so

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
turn the actual writing into lines so

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:21.260 
turn the actual writing into lines so
we'll<00:01:10.830> give<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.070> closer<00:01:11.580> look<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:21.060> now

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
we'll give you a closer look here so now

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.520 
we'll give you a closer look here so now
these<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.950> editable<00:01:22.950> notes<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.619> can<00:01:26.299> add

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
these are editable notes so I can add

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.679 
these are editable notes so I can add
some<00:01:28.530> notes<00:01:28.710> or<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.549> want<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> erase<00:01:30.299> part<00:01:30.600> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
this I don't want this right here I can

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
this I don't want this right here I can
actually<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.090> remove<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.159> go

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you can actually solve it using the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.719 
you can actually solve it using the
s-pen<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.890> delete<00:01:56.130> parts<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.640> the

had handwritten this all out and it's

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.690 
had handwritten this all out and it's
really<00:02:03.420> cool<00:02:03.659> way<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> quickly<00:02:04.829> bring<00:02:05.399> stuff

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
really cool way to quickly bring stuff

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.990 
really cool way to quickly bring stuff
in<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> same<00:02:06.930> thing<00:02:07.140> with<00:02:07.320> a

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
in you can do the same thing with a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.720 
in you can do the same thing with a
handout<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.270> has<00:02:09.539> typed<00:02:10.530> text<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.459> you'll

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
handout that has typed text and you'll

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.680 
handout that has typed text and you'll
