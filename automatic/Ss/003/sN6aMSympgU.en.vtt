in<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:00.450> video<00:00:00.750> I'm<00:00:00.810> going<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.960> cover<00:00:01.050> a

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
in this video I'm going to cover a

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.480 
in this video I'm going to cover a
really<00:00:01.740> quick<00:00:02.040> and<00:00:02.100> simple<00:00:02.340> tip<00:00:03.060> for<00:00:03.410> doing

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.490 
really quick and simple tip for doing

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.890 
really quick and simple tip for doing
dumbbell<00:00:05.490> curls<00:00:06.120> now<00:00:06.390> it's<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.319> real<00:00:07.790> basic<00:00:08.900> tip

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
dumbbell curls now it's a real basic tip

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.629 
dumbbell curls now it's a real basic tip
but<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.950> tend<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> forget<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:12.290> as<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:13.650> gain

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
but we tend to forget this as we gain

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.849 
but we tend to forget this as we gain
more<00:00:14.670> knowledge<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.630> experience<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> gym

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
more knowledge and experience in the gym

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.140 
more knowledge and experience in the gym
we<00:00:17.100> kind<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.430> forget<00:00:17.699> some<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.000> these

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
we kind of forget some of these

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.710 
we kind of forget some of these
fundamentals<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.730> you'll<00:00:20.730> see<00:00:20.970> forms<00:00:21.420> start

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
fundamentals and you'll see forms start

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.230 
fundamentals and you'll see forms start
to<00:00:22.070> suffer<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:23.340> most<00:00:23.609> people<00:00:23.820> when<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.180> do

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
to suffer now most people when they do

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.700 
to suffer now most people when they do
the<00:00:24.539> curl<00:00:24.840> will<00:00:25.490> hold<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.359> dumbbells<00:00:27.840> at

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the curl will hold the dumbbells at

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.930 
the curl will hold the dumbbells at
their<00:00:28.949> sides<00:00:29.300> whether<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:31.070> palms<00:00:32.070> forward

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
their sides whether it's palms forward

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.650 
their sides whether it's palms forward
or<00:00:33.270> at<00:00:33.450> their<00:00:33.660> sides<00:00:35.000> neutral<00:00:36.000> grip<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> start

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
or at their sides neutral grip to start

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.030 
or at their sides neutral grip to start
but<00:00:37.380> typically<00:00:37.770> you'll<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> arms

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
but typically you'll see that the arms

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.459 
but typically you'll see that the arms
are<00:00:41.160> under<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:42.149> tremendous<00:00:42.719> weight<00:00:43.230> from<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
are under a tremendous weight from the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.750 
are under a tremendous weight from the
dumbbells<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.070> senators<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.610> write

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
dumbbells and these senators can write

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.430 
dumbbells and these senators can write
down<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.420> when<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.719> their<00:00:45.960> curl<00:00:46.260> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
down then when they do their curl it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.819 
down then when they do their curl it
just<00:00:46.620> sort<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.300> looks<00:00:49.460> something<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
just sort of looks something like this

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.930 
just sort of looks something like this
but<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.160> they're<00:00:53.309> not<00:00:53.399> doing<00:00:53.460> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
but now what they're not doing is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
but now what they're not doing is
supporting<00:00:54.149> their<00:00:54.930> shoulder<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
supporting their shoulder with a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.189 
supporting their shoulder with a
shoulder<00:00:56.370> girdle<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.120> whole<00:00:58.910> complex<00:01:00.199> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
shoulder girdle that whole complex and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
shoulder girdle that whole complex and
the<00:01:01.320> shoulder<00:01:01.800> which<00:01:03.170> includes<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.920> try

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the shoulder which includes your try

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.940 
the shoulder which includes your try
using<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.200> trapezius<00:01:07.200> muscle<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> middle

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
using your trapezius muscle the middle

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
using your trapezius muscle the middle
traps<00:01:08.369> pulling<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> together<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> round

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
traps pulling it together with the round

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.440 
traps pulling it together with the round
points<00:01:10.200> they're<00:01:11.159> using<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> rear<00:01:11.760> delts<00:01:12.270> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
points they're using the rear delts to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.210 
points they're using the rear delts to
really<00:01:12.720> stabilize<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> even<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> rotator

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
really stabilize and even the rotator

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.560 
really stabilize and even the rotator
cuff<00:01:14.460> muscles<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.170> actually

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
cuff muscles so you can actually

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.700 
cuff muscles so you can actually
contract<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.840> those<00:01:18.960> muscles<00:01:19.470> working

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
contract them all those muscles working

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
contract them all those muscles working
to<00:01:19.860> his<00:01:19.950> eye<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.400> sure<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.640> contract<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
to his eye so make sure they contract to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.320 
to his eye so make sure they contract to
support<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:23.159> shoulder<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.119> when<00:01:24.210> you're

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
support the shoulder so when you're

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
support the shoulder so when you're
holding<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.810> dumbbells<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.650> sides<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
holding the dumbbells at your sides you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.070 
holding the dumbbells at your sides you
really<00:01:26.880> want<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> think<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.509> shoulders

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
really want to think of your shoulders

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.620 
really want to think of your shoulders
like<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> scarecrow<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.030> had<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> wooden

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
like a scarecrow as if you had a wooden

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.609 
like a scarecrow as if you had a wooden
board<00:01:31.009> going<00:01:32.009> across<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:33.150> back<00:01:33.619> nailing

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
board going across your back nailing

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.179 
board going across your back nailing
your<00:01:35.240> shoulders<00:01:36.240> together<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.869> then<00:01:37.189> you're

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
your shoulders together and then you're

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.160 
your shoulders together and then you're
not<00:01:38.340> allowed<00:01:38.610> any<00:01:38.880> momentum<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.750> there<00:01:39.990> at

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
not allowed any momentum from there at

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:51.130 
not allowed any momentum from there at
the<00:01:40.290> shoulder<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.070> coming<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:42.320> DL

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.899 

I<00:01:51.200> should<00:01:52.190> be<00:01:52.280> able<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.430> see<00:01:52.580> difference

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
I should be able to see difference

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.050 
I should be able to see difference
between<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:54.200> form<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.360> this<00:01:57.729> from<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.850> back

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
between this form and this from the back

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.740 
between this form and this from the back
it's<00:01:59.570> just<00:02:00.790> so<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:01.880> can<00:02:02.030> get<00:02:02.240> an<00:02:02.360> idea<00:02:02.720> the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
it's just so you can get an idea the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.510 
it's just so you can get an idea the
muscles<00:02:03.260> that<00:02:03.350> you're<00:02:03.590> using<00:02:03.770> here<00:02:03.979> is<00:02:04.250> route

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
muscles that you're using here is route

muscles that you're using here is route
you're<00:02:04.700> pulling<00:02:05.180> you're<00:02:05.930> really<00:02:06.170> pulling

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
you're pulling you're really pulling

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.850 
you're pulling you're really pulling
back<00:02:07.090> with<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.600> rotator<00:02:09.110> cuff<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.649> rear
