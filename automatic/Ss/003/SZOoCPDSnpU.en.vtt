there sure there was no reason for him
to<00:00:34.590> go<00:00:34.800> back<00:00:34.950> top<00:00:35.190> lane<00:00:35.370> dyrus<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.940> freezing

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to go back top lane dyrus was freezing

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.790 
to go back top lane dyrus was freezing
it's<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.780> he<00:00:36.899> teleported<00:00:37.350> from<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.620> point

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it's not like he teleported from a point

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.319 
it's not like he teleported from a point
of<00:00:37.950> pressure<00:00:38.190> yeah<00:00:38.670> second<00:00:38.969> oh<00:00:39.030> look<00:00:39.180> at<00:00:39.270> this

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
of pressure yeah second oh look at this

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940 
of pressure yeah second oh look at this
one<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> jump<00:00:40.140> knee<00:00:40.290> i'm<00:00:40.379> dandy<00:00:40.649> they

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
one so to jump knee i'm dandy they

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.200 
one so to jump knee i'm dandy they
actually<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> lot<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> members<00:00:41.850> some<00:00:42.090> tea

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
actually have a lot of members some tea

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.549 
actually have a lot of members some tea
is<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:42.809> know<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
is it because they know they have to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.560 
is it because they know they have to
teleport<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.160> then<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:44.489> expecting<00:00:45.090> muko<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
teleport but then not expecting muko to

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540 
teleport but then not expecting muko to
join<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.200> point<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.800> sooner<00:00:47.190> he<00:00:47.340> comes

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
