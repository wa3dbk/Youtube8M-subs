half<00:00:19.789> of<00:00:19.939> it<00:00:20.089> and<00:00:20.269> it<00:00:20.359> just<00:00:20.390> sits<00:00:20.810> around<00:00:20.900> in<00:00:21.169> my

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
half of it and it just sits around in my

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.019 
half of it and it just sits around in my
house<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:21.859> it's<00:00:22.009> a<00:00:22.070> waste<00:00:22.279> of<00:00:22.460> money<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:22.789> the

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
house and it's a waste of money and the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.120 
house and it's a waste of money and the
next<00:00:23.329> semester<00:00:23.720> I<00:00:23.749> just<00:00:24.140> buy<00:00:24.289> more<00:00:24.560> stuff<00:00:24.859> and

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:27.409 
I never use the stuff so I decided this

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.169

semester<00:00:27.859> to<00:00:27.949> be<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.069> little<00:00:28.249> different<00:00:28.519> and<00:00:28.849> I

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
semester to be a little different and I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.120 
semester to be a little different and I
didn't<00:00:29.749> really<00:00:29.929> buy<00:00:30.109> that<00:00:30.140> much<00:00:30.380> stuff<00:00:30.710> I<00:00:30.890> just

like ninety-seven cents from walmart I

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.230 
like ninety-seven cents from walmart I
know<00:02:52.070> they<00:02:52.250> were<00:02:52.310> from<00:02:52.550> walmart<00:02:52.910> but<00:02:53.090> they

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
know they were from walmart but they

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.870 
know they were from walmart but they
were<00:02:53.990> really<00:02:54.200> really<00:02:54.410> cheap<00:02:54.710> buy<00:02:54.860> now<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.610> they

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.650 
cool kind of calendar thing there's a
magnet<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.820> back<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.300> i<00:03:08.330> guess<00:03:08.510> i<00:03:08.600> could

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
magnet on the back so i guess i could

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.120 
magnet on the back so i guess i could
put<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:08.990> like<00:03:09.110> my<00:03:09.260> fridge<00:03:09.620> or<00:03:09.800> something

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
put it on like my fridge or something

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.410 
put it on like my fridge or something
but<00:03:10.370> i'll<00:03:10.460> probably<00:03:10.640> just<00:03:10.760> put<00:03:10.970> on<00:03:11.060> my<00:03:11.180> desk

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
but i'll probably just put on my desk

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.150 
but i'll probably just put on my desk
and<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.870> can<00:03:12.020> pretty<00:03:12.110> much<00:03:12.260> write<00:03:12.530> anything<00:03:12.920> on

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
and I can pretty much write anything on

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.250 
and I can pretty much write anything on
this<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.640> there's<00:03:14.180> no<00:03:14.330> dates<00:03:14.660> filled<00:03:14.960> in<00:03:15.080> so

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
this and there's no dates filled in so

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.230 
this and there's no dates filled in so
you<00:03:15.350> can<00:03:15.470> write<00:03:15.620> in<00:03:15.800> your<00:03:15.830> own<00:03:16.070> dates<00:03:16.400> things<00:03:17.150> I

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
you can write in your own dates things I

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.240 
you can write in your own dates things I

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
I think it's a very practical product

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.430 
I think it's a very practical product
and<00:03:30.650> it's<00:03:30.800> gonna<00:03:30.920> keep<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.340> really<00:03:31.550> organized

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
and it's gonna keep you really organized

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.690 
and it's gonna keep you really organized
so<00:03:33.440> yeah<00:03:33.590> those<00:03:33.740> are<00:03:33.890> all<00:03:33.980> my<00:03:34.100> school<00:03:34.340> supplies

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
so yeah those are all my school supplies

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.810 
so yeah those are all my school supplies
like<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.660> said<00:03:35.990> I<00:03:36.290> didn't<00:03:37.220> need<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.459> go<00:03:37.550> crazy

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
like I said I didn't need to go crazy

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.610 
like I said I didn't need to go crazy
and<00:03:38.360> I<00:03:38.630> think<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:38.959> these<00:03:39.170> supplies<00:03:39.590> are

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
and I think that these supplies are

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.199 
and I think that these supplies are
going<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:39.950> keep<00:03:40.070> me<00:03:40.220> organized<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.910> it's<00:03:41.030> not

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
going to keep me organized and it's not

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.640 
going to keep me organized and it's not
too<00:03:41.540> much<00:03:41.750> cuz<00:03:42.050> i<00:03:42.080> think<00:03:42.230> if<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:42.350> have<00:03:42.440> too

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
too much cuz i think if you have too

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.140 
too much cuz i think if you have too
much<00:03:42.800> school<00:03:43.040> supplies<00:03:43.370> you're<00:03:43.820> just<00:03:44.030> gonna
