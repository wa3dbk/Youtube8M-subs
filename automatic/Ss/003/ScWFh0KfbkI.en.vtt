sony la ei for adapter this is designed

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.830 
sony la ei for adapter this is designed
for<00:00:07.740> emailed<00:00:08.220> cameras<00:00:08.670> both<00:00:08.880> handycam<00:00:09.540> and

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
for emailed cameras both handycam and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.499 
for emailed cameras both handycam and
alpha<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.440> means<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.950> VG<00:00:11.670> 30<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.240> well<00:00:12.420> as

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
alpha so that means the VG 30 as well as

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.620 
alpha so that means the VG 30 as well as
the<00:00:12.660> VG<00:00:13.019> 900<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.920> then<00:00:14.400> alpha<00:00:14.759> cameras<00:00:15.420> like

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the VG 900 and then alpha cameras like

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.730 
the VG 900 and then alpha cameras like
the<00:00:15.809> a6000<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.369> a7<00:00:17.940> a7r<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.260> does<00:00:19.470> use

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the a6000 the a7 a7r and it does use

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.519 
the a6000 the a7 a7r and it does use
sony's<00:00:20.160> translucent<00:00:20.939> mirror<00:00:21.510> technology<00:00:21.960> so

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
sony's translucent mirror technology so

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.349 
sony's translucent mirror technology so
that<00:00:22.560> when<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.949> use<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> mount<00:00:23.789> glass<00:00:24.090> on

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that when you use your a mount glass on

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.140 
that when you use your a mount glass on
your<00:00:24.420> email<00:00:25.080> body<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:26.010> will<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.580> complete

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
your email body you will have complete

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.689 
your email body you will have complete
autofocus<00:00:28.050> capability<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.859> that's<00:00:29.490> really

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
autofocus capability and that's really

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.749 
autofocus capability and that's really
the<00:00:30.029> biggest<00:00:30.449> arguing<00:00:31.230> arguing<00:00:31.980> point<00:00:32.550> or

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the biggest arguing arguing point or

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.569 
the biggest arguing arguing point or
selling<00:00:33.149> point<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.540> should<00:00:33.570> say<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> lae

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
selling point I should say for the lae

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.060 
selling point I should say for the lae
a4<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> generations<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
a4 and all of the generations that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.040 
a4 and all of the generations that
preceded<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.270> course<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.899> best

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
preceded it of course this is the best

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.549 
preceded it of course this is the best
because<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.219> does<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.550> its<00:00:42.000> own<00:00:42.559> autofocus

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
because this does have its own autofocus

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.650 
because this does have its own autofocus
system<00:00:43.739> onboard<00:00:44.160> which<00:00:44.879> really<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
system onboard which really is a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
system onboard which really is a
difference<00:00:46.289> maker<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:47.129> you're<00:00:47.250> trying<00:00:47.489> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
difference maker when you're trying to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.150 
difference maker when you're trying to
sell<00:00:47.910> someone<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.600> adapter<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.890> nature

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
sell someone an adapter of this nature

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
sell someone an adapter of this nature
that<00:00:50.309> promises<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.270> deliver<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> same

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that promises to deliver the same

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.150 
that promises to deliver the same
performance<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:54.420> lens<00:00:54.660> expects<00:00:55.320> from<00:00:55.829> its

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
performance as the lens expects from its

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.910 
performance as the lens expects from its
alpha<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.940> mount<00:00:57.809> counterparts<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
alpha a mount counterparts so you can

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.110 
alpha a mount counterparts so you can
see<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> comes<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.609> little<00:00:59.670> pouch

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
see it comes with this little pouch

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.229 
see it comes with this little pouch
which<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.260> its<00:01:01.410> price<00:01:01.710> point<00:01:01.760> frankly<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.030> guess

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
which at its price point frankly I guess

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.359 
which at its price point frankly I guess
I<00:01:03.510> won't<00:01:04.049> say<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.350> should<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.129> nice<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
I won't say it should but it's nice that

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.520 
I won't say it should but it's nice that
it<00:01:05.640> does<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
it does have it and there you have it a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
it does have it and there you have it a
very<00:01:08.040> small<00:01:08.369> form<00:01:08.640> factor<00:01:08.700> which<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.479> critical

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
very small form factor which is critical

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.780 
very small form factor which is critical
considering<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.460> about

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
considering that this is all about

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210 
considering that this is all about
maintaining<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:13.229> form<00:01:13.470> factor<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
maintaining the form factor that the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.520 
maintaining the form factor that the
email<00:01:14.549> brings<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> table<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.229> very

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
email brings to the table so not very

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.039 
email brings to the table so not very
thick<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.570> allow<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
thick and this is going to allow you to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.630 
thick and this is going to allow you to
use<00:01:19.170> again<00:01:19.680> any<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.159> mount<00:01:20.670> lens<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.960> full

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
use again any a mount lens with full

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.890 
use again any a mount lens with full
capability<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> comes<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.420> autofocus

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
capability when it comes to autofocus

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
capability when it comes to autofocus
because<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.590> does<00:01:25.830> bring<00:01:26.100> its<00:01:26.939> own

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
because this does bring its own

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.420 
because this does bring its own
translucent<00:01:28.200> mirror<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.650> same<00:01:28.920> system<00:01:29.400> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
translucent mirror the same system that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.940 
translucent mirror the same system that
Sony<00:01:29.850> relies<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.320> their<00:01:31.500> digital

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
Sony relies on for all of their digital

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.420 
Sony relies on for all of their digital
SLRs<00:01:32.640> at<00:01:33.540> least<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.740> point<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
SLRs at least up to this point and you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.670 
SLRs at least up to this point and you
can<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.360> right<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.439> mount

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
can see right here we have the mount

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.240 
can see right here we have the mount
some<00:01:38.670> instructions<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.390> usage<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.250> that's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
some instructions on usage and that's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.310 
some instructions on usage and that's
pretty<00:01:42.060> much<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.720> go<00:01:42.869> ahead<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
pretty much it you go ahead and you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.190 
pretty much it you go ahead and you
attach<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> your<00:01:44.880> camera<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.540> choice<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
attach this to your camera of choice and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.600 
attach this to your camera of choice and
you're<00:01:46.920> good<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> go

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you're good to go

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.940 
you're good to go
so<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.720> paperwork<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.320> didn't<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.770> go

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so the paperwork I didn't really go

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.280 
so the paperwork I didn't really go
through<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.430> here<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
through right here but it's what you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.440 
through right here but it's what you
would<00:01:52.380> expect<00:01:52.740> warranty

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
would expect warranty

ever made for that very reason you're

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.199 
ever made for that very reason you're
looking<00:03:05.040> at<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.250> only<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.730> that's<00:03:06.000> going<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.260 
truly allow you to step up the autofocus

autofocus wasn't as competent as it is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.650 
autofocus wasn't as competent as it is
now<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.970> cameras<00:03:15.570> like<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.560> a6000<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:18.570> know

now on cameras like the a6000 you know
even<00:03:18.959> though<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.200> NEX<00:03:19.530> six<00:03:19.830> was<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.160> first<00:03:20.340> to

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
nex-5r you could still even argue here

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.400 
nex-5r you could still even argue here
this<00:03:25.290> would<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.830> vast<00:03:26.280> upgrade<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.900> NEX

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
this would be a vast upgrade for the NEX

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.890 
this would be a vast upgrade for the NEX
six<00:03:28.739> when<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.070> comes<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.550> autofocus<00:03:30.120> speed<00:03:30.480> and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
six when it comes to autofocus speed and

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.800 
six when it comes to autofocus speed and
tracking<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.670> nice<00:03:33.090> addition

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
tracking so a nice addition

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.360 
tracking so a nice addition
