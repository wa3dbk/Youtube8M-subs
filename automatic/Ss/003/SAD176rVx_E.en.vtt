00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.890 
them up and set them to the side and
actually<00:03:15.670> freeze<00:03:16.030> them<00:03:16.269> because<00:03:16.540> crinkle

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
actually freeze them because crinkle

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.020

cookies<00:03:17.230> freeze<00:03:17.560> really<00:03:17.950> well<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.730> can

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
cookies freeze really well so you can

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.720 
cookies freeze really well so you can
bake<00:03:19.360> another<00:03:19.690> batch<00:03:20.019> which<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.470> am<00:03:20.709> or<00:03:21.010> you

bake another batch which I am or you

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.880 
bake another batch which I am or you
could<00:03:21.970> put<00:03:22.209> them<00:03:22.390> on<00:03:22.690> like<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.019> plate<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.680> a
