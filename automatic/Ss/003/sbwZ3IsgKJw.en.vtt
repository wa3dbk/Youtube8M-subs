butt of the rod and that can cause a lot
of<00:01:50.759> breakage<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.119> them<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> lot<00:01:51.570> of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
of breakage of them you see a lot of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.499 
of breakage of them you see a lot of
rods<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.990> broken<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.439> way<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.549> just

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
rods get broken that way so just

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
rods get broken that way so just
plopping<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.990> first<00:01:55.259> piece<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> fly<00:01:55.770> line<00:01:55.950> in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
plopping that first piece of fly line in

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.920 
plopping that first piece of fly line in
the<00:01:56.130> water<00:01:57.020> it's<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.259> there<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.420> then<00:02:00.420> within

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the water it's in there and then within

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.749 
the water it's in there and then within
the<00:02:01.079> rod<00:02:01.259> tip<00:02:01.530> side<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.979> side<00:02:02.189> using<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
the rod tip side to side using the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
the rod tip side to side using the
tension<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> water<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
tension of the water that's going to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.569 
tension of the water that's going to
pull<00:02:04.560> some<00:02:04.740> fly<00:02:04.920> line<00:02:05.130> through<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.369> Rings

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
pull some fly line through the Rings

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.449 
pull some fly line through the Rings
that<00:02:06.049> gives<00:02:07.049> us<00:02:07.200> enough<00:02:07.560> fly<00:02:07.860> line<00:02:08.099> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
that gives us enough fly line to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.460 
that gives us enough fly line to
actually<00:02:08.580> make<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> cast<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.629> potentially

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
actually make a cast and potentially

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.740 
actually make a cast and potentially
catch<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.739> fish<00:02:10.950> but

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
catch a fish but

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
the water gets the line out there but it

to<00:03:29.810> fish<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.320> lots<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.650> tight<00:03:30.920> spaces<00:03:31.489> where

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
to fish in lots of tight spaces where

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
to fish in lots of tight spaces where
let's<00:03:32.299> face<00:03:32.510> it

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
let's face it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.270 
let's face it
fish<00:03:33.200> find<00:03:33.440> themselves<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:33.920> tight<00:03:34.070> spaces

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
fish find themselves in tight spaces

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.979 
fish find themselves in tight spaces
because<00:03:34.790> they're<00:03:35.450> trying<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.720> hide<00:03:35.870> from

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
because they're trying to hide from

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.479 
because they're trying to hide from
predators<00:03:36.080> or<00:03:37.690> birds<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.950> name<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.310> there's<00:03:40.459> a

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
predators or birds you name it there's a

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.560 
predators or birds you name it there's a
lot<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.700> things<00:03:40.850> trying<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.120> get<00:03:41.269> all<00:03:41.390> of<00:03:41.480> them

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
lot of things trying to get all of them

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.789 
lot of things trying to get all of them
and<00:03:41.720> they're<00:03:41.989> always<00:03:42.140> they're<00:03:42.590> always<00:03:42.650> a

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
and they're always they're always a

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.370 
and they're always they're always a
little<00:03:43.010> spooky<00:03:43.280> from<00:03:43.430> us<00:03:43.579> who<00:03:43.700> can<00:03:43.850> blame<00:03:43.970> them

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
little spooky from us who can blame them

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.380 
little spooky from us who can blame them
so<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.920> Royal<00:03:46.130> cast<00:03:46.370> will<00:03:47.000> help<00:03:47.120> us<00:03:47.239> in<00:03:47.360> that

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
so the Royal cast will help us in that

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.539 
so the Royal cast will help us in that
situation<00:03:47.630> now<00:03:48.500> where<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.799> also<00:03:48.950> helps<00:03:49.400> is

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
situation now where it also helps is

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.449 
situation now where it also helps is
we're<00:03:50.269> I'm<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.630> boat<00:03:50.870> fishing<00:03:51.110> boat<00:03:52.040> fishermen

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
we're I'm a boat fishing boat fishermen

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.949 
we're I'm a boat fishing boat fishermen
would<00:03:52.549> use<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.790> longer<00:03:53.090> rod<00:03:53.360> I'm<00:03:53.570> using<00:03:53.780> a

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
would use a longer rod I'm using a

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.660 
would use a longer rod I'm using a
nine-foot<00:03:54.380> rod<00:03:54.739> it's<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:54.950> number<00:03:55.160> five<00:03:55.340> line

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
nine-foot rod it's a number five line

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.069 
nine-foot rod it's a number five line
but<00:03:56.150> a<00:03:56.180> bolt<00:03:56.390> fisherman<00:03:56.750> would<00:03:56.870> use<00:03:57.049> a

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
but a bolt fisherman would use a

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.380 
but a bolt fisherman would use a
ten-foot<00:03:57.739> rod<00:03:57.950> perhaps<00:03:58.640> even<00:03:58.820> longer<00:03:59.090> and

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
ten-foot rod perhaps even longer and

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.509 
ten-foot rod perhaps even longer and
often<00:03:59.900> six<00:04:00.230> seven<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.890> even<00:04:01.100> an<00:04:01.160> eight<00:04:01.280> line

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
often six seven and even an eight line

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.990 
often six seven and even an eight line
so<00:04:02.180> those<00:04:02.750> rods<00:04:03.019> we<00:04:03.860> can<00:04:04.040> use<00:04:04.160> long<00:04:04.519> Royal

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
so those rods we can use long Royal

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.509 
so those rods we can use long Royal
casts<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.410> handle<00:04:06.829> a<00:04:06.890> hell<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.310> lot<00:04:07.430> of

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
casts and and handle a hell of a lot of

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.069 
casts and and handle a hell of a lot of
line<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.700> real<00:04:08.120> long<00:04:08.390> length<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:08.690> line<00:04:08.870> with

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
line a real long length of line with

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.610 
line a real long length of line with
that<00:04:09.110> cast<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:10.030> they<00:04:11.030> actually<00:04:11.180> use<00:04:11.750> that

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
that cast and they actually use that

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.699 
that cast and they actually use that
roll<00:04:12.860> cast<00:04:13.160> as<00:04:13.549> a<00:04:14.209> retrieve<00:04:14.690> so<00:04:15.410> where<00:04:15.590> that

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
roll cast as a retrieve so where that

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.650 
roll cast as a retrieve so where that
fly<00:04:15.950> line<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:16.190> coming<00:04:16.430> back<00:04:16.549> towards<00:04:17.030> us<00:04:17.120> quite

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
fly line is coming back towards us quite

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.140 
fly line is coming back towards us quite
slowly<00:04:18.019> now<00:04:18.290> we<00:04:18.769> can<00:04:18.950> slow<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.160> down<00:04:19.280> we<00:04:20.000> can

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
slowly now we can slow it down we can

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.300 
slowly now we can slow it down we can
speed<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.390> up<00:04:20.539> and<00:04:21.229> slow<00:04:21.289> it<00:04:21.560> down<00:04:21.590> we<00:04:22.070> can<00:04:22.220> do

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
speed it up and slow it down we can do

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.560 
speed it up and slow it down we can do
all<00:04:22.460> kinds<00:04:22.729> we<00:04:22.820> can<00:04:22.970> jiggle<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.300> rod<00:04:23.450> around

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
all kinds we can jiggle the rod around

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.390 
all kinds we can jiggle the rod around
and

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
and

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.070 
and
still<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.850> retrieved<00:04:25.270> so<00:04:25.479> we're<00:04:25.600> still<00:04:25.840> fishing

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
still a retrieved so we're still fishing

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.189 
still a retrieved so we're still fishing
obviously<00:04:27.009> if<00:04:27.100> we<00:04:27.220> get<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.400> fish<00:04:27.610> cake<00:04:27.880> now<00:04:28.199> this

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
obviously if we get a fish cake now this

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.689 
obviously if we get a fish cake now this
situation<00:04:29.740> we're<00:04:29.830> not<00:04:29.860> gonna<00:04:30.040> settle<00:04:30.310> yeah

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
situation we're not gonna settle yeah

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.340 
situation we're not gonna settle yeah
I'm<00:04:30.759> gonna<00:04:30.940> yeah<00:04:31.330> I'm<00:04:31.389> gonna<00:04:31.509> tight<00:04:31.750> lines<00:04:31.990> and

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna tight lines and

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.650 
I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna tight lines and
immediately<00:04:32.889> but<00:04:33.699> a<00:04:33.729> good<00:04:33.970> hard<00:04:34.180> roll<00:04:34.389> cast

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
immediately but a good hard roll cast

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.659 
immediately but a good hard roll cast
will<00:04:35.289> set<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:35.710> hook<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.130> then<00:04:36.430> we<00:04:36.520> can

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
will set that hook and then we can

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.700 
will set that hook and then we can
tighten<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.120> line<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.539> play<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.960> fish<00:04:38.139> so

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
tighten the line and play the fish so

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.430 
tighten the line and play the fish so
it's<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:38.889> very<00:04:39.100> effective<00:04:39.729> method<00:04:40.120> on<00:04:40.479> boat<00:04:41.169> or

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
it's a very effective method on boat or

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.800 
it's a very effective method on boat or
Bank<00:04:41.860> it's<00:04:42.460> used<00:04:42.850> on<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.180> boats<00:04:43.360> but<00:04:43.690> it's

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
Bank it's used on the boats but it's

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.499 
Bank it's used on the boats but it's
tends<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.139> be<00:04:44.229> ignored<00:04:44.560> on<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.770> banks<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:45.699> boat

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
tends to be ignored on the banks so boat

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:47.939 
tends to be ignored on the banks so boat
fishermen<00:04:46.900> will<00:04:47.020> let<00:04:47.199> that<00:04:47.350> hang<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.889> they

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
fishermen will let that hang and they

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.379 
fishermen will let that hang and they
call<00:04:48.190> this<00:04:48.340> fishing<00:04:48.699> the<00:04:48.820> hang<00:04:48.970> with<00:04:49.120> you<00:04:49.180> let

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
call this fishing the hang with you let

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.150 
call this fishing the hang with you let
that<00:04:49.539> hang<00:04:49.750> there<00:04:49.780> for<00:04:50.110> ages<00:04:50.199> with<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.979> long

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
that hang there for ages with the long

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.670 
that hang there for ages with the long
rods<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.910> then<00:04:52.180> eventually<00:04:52.419> they'll<00:04:53.320> roll<00:04:53.560> it

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
rods and then eventually they'll roll it

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.249 
rods and then eventually they'll roll it
out<00:04:53.800> there<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.669> often<00:04:55.449> that's<00:04:55.690> enough<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.169> do

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
out there and often that's enough to do

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.600 
out there and often that's enough to do
the<00:04:56.410> fishing<00:04:56.620> there's<00:04:57.010> enough<00:04:57.190> fly<00:04:57.400> laying

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
the fishing there's enough fly laying

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.270 
the fishing there's enough fly laying
there<00:04:57.789> or<00:04:58.030> they'll<00:04:58.240> roll<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.539> out<00:04:58.660> pick<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:59.020> up

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
there or they'll roll it out pick it up

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.860 
there or they'll roll it out pick it up
and<00:05:00.280> they'll<00:05:00.789> get<00:05:00.880> some<00:05:01.060> distance<00:05:01.240> and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
and they'll get some distance and

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.240 
and they'll get some distance and
they're<00:05:02.020> fishing<00:05:02.199> now<00:05:02.560> fly<00:05:02.740> line<00:05:02.919> is<00:05:03.010> out<00:05:03.100> with

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
that we can get a fly lane in the water

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.730 
that we can get a fly lane in the water
once<00:05:19.270> you've<00:05:19.389> got<00:05:19.510> flying<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:19.990> water<00:05:20.169> then

basics of it the textbook style then

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.360 
basics of it the textbook style then
you'll<00:05:37.780> find<00:05:38.050> you'll<00:05:38.289> development<00:05:39.099> your<00:05:39.220> own

when<00:06:08.500> we<00:06:08.590> lift<00:06:08.740> that<00:06:08.979> rod<00:06:09.250> from<00:06:09.550> the<00:06:09.639> water

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
when we lift that rod from the water

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.149 
when we lift that rod from the water
we're<00:06:10.330> starting<00:06:10.750> with<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.289> rod<00:06:11.500> close<00:06:11.889> to<00:06:12.070> the

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
we're starting with the rod close to the

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.010 
we're starting with the rod close to the
water<00:06:12.340> so<00:06:12.639> we've<00:06:12.760> got<00:06:12.909> tension<00:06:13.240> Amelia<00:06:13.750> soon

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
water so we've got tension Amelia soon

as<00:06:14.110> soon<00:06:14.289> as<00:06:14.349> I<00:06:14.409> start<00:06:14.680> Luke<00:06:14.830> moving<00:06:15.130> that<00:06:15.250> rod

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
as soon as I start Luke moving that rod

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.830 
as soon as I start Luke moving that rod
I'm<00:06:15.669> gonna<00:06:15.940> feel<00:06:16.210> the<00:06:16.300> weight<00:06:16.419> of<00:06:16.449> the<00:06:16.630> fly

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
I'm gonna feel the weight of the fly

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.500 
I'm gonna feel the weight of the fly
line<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.260> as<00:06:17.620> I<00:06:17.770> lift<00:06:18.010> I'm<00:06:18.310> gonna<00:06:19.030> lift<00:06:19.389> to

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
line and as I lift I'm gonna lift to

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.149 
line and as I lift I'm gonna lift to
that<00:06:19.630> telephone<00:06:19.930> position<00:06:20.409> but<00:06:20.889> I<00:06:20.919> want<00:06:21.099> to

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
that telephone position but I want to

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.550 
that telephone position but I want to
lift<00:06:21.310> slowly<00:06:21.909> and<00:06:22.360> accelerate<00:06:23.110> into<00:06:23.320> that

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
lift slowly and accelerate into that

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.140 
lift slowly and accelerate into that
stop<00:06:23.889> stop<00:06:25.440> before<00:06:26.440> I<00:06:26.620> bring<00:06:27.159> it<00:06:27.310> forward<00:06:27.520> now

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
stop stop before I bring it forward now

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.240 
stop stop before I bring it forward now
this<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.449> the<00:06:28.570> basic<00:06:28.990> just<00:06:29.320> picking<00:06:29.919> it<00:06:29.979> up<00:06:30.070> and

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
this is the basic just picking it up and

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.279 
this is the basic just picking it up and
putting<00:06:30.400> it<00:06:30.520> back<00:06:30.669> down<00:06:30.909> it's<00:06:31.780> something<00:06:32.139> that

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
putting it back down it's something that

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.440 
putting it back down it's something that
not<00:06:32.440> many<00:06:32.620> fly<00:06:32.889> fishermen<00:06:33.310> practice<00:06:33.700> but<00:06:33.880> this

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
not many fly fishermen practice but this

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.490 
is 90 percent of it once you've cracked
miss<00:06:36.760> then<00:06:37.270> everything<00:06:37.599> else<00:06:37.719> is

miss then everything else is

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.770 
miss then everything else is
just<00:06:38.680> a<00:06:38.830> little<00:06:39.070> tweak<00:06:39.310> to<00:06:40.060> get<00:06:40.210> us<00:06:40.300> our<00:06:40.450> extra

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
just a little tweak to get us our extra

just a little tweak to get us our extra
distance<00:06:43.320> now<00:06:44.320> everybody<00:06:45.040> asks<00:06:45.250> how<00:06:45.340> long<00:06:45.370> we

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640 
distance now everybody asks how long we

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.030 
distance now everybody asks how long we
count<00:06:45.880> well<00:06:46.450> it's<00:06:46.870> hard<00:06:47.110> to<00:06:47.230> see<00:06:47.410> it's<00:06:47.650> it<00:06:47.860> is<00:06:48.010> a

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
count well it's hard to see it's it is a

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.610 
count well it's hard to see it's it is a
judgement<00:06:48.550> but<00:06:49.000> in<00:06:49.540> general<00:06:49.990> if<00:06:50.080> I<00:06:50.200> if<00:06:50.470> I<00:06:50.560> think

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
judgement but in general if I if I think

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.870 
judgement but in general if I if I think
about<00:06:50.830> how<00:06:51.010> long<00:06:51.220> it<00:06:51.340> takes<00:06:51.490> me<00:06:51.550> to<00:06:51.730> get<00:06:51.820> from

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
about how long it takes me to get from

and<00:07:31.330> I<00:07:31.600> like<00:07:31.780> to<00:07:31.900> try<00:07:32.140> and<00:07:32.230> get<00:07:32.380> everybody<00:07:32.680> I'm

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
and I like to try and get everybody I'm

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.920 
and I like to try and get everybody I'm
teaching<00:07:33.280> to<00:07:33.790> finish<00:07:34.060> those<00:07:34.270> positions<00:07:34.600> with

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
teaching to finish those positions with

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.720 
teaching to finish those positions with
the<00:07:35.050> thumb<00:07:35.290> pointing<00:07:35.650> upwards<00:07:35.980> that's<00:07:36.490> quite

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:36.730 
the thumb pointing upwards that's quite

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.610 
the thumb pointing upwards that's quite
important<00:07:37.210> if<00:07:37.419> we<00:07:37.930> finish<00:07:38.110> with<00:07:38.320> the<00:07:38.410> thumb

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.620 
important if we finish with the thumb

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.159 
important if we finish with the thumb
downwards<00:07:38.890> and<00:07:39.340> downwards<00:07:40.030> then<00:07:40.750> it<00:07:40.870> really

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
downwards and downwards then it really

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:45.860 
downwards and downwards then it really
doesn't<00:07:41.470> work<00:07:41.680> as<00:07:41.890> well<00:07:43.710> not<00:07:44.710> as<00:07:44.860> well

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870 
doesn't work as well not as well

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.219 
doesn't work as well not as well
tap<00:07:47.040> tap<00:07:48.040> stop<00:07:48.610> stop<00:07:49.000> and<00:07:49.419> that<00:07:49.840> works<00:07:50.020> right

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:50.229 
tap tap stop stop and that works right

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.760 
tap tap stop stop and that works right
