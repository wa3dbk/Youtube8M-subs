00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.930
 like this where we will discuss 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.670
 five most relevant news of the day in 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.920
 the number five place we will see your 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.379
 music studies that arrives today for the web 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.140
 and for them we are also going to talk 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.890
 about pantech and pega iron that has already been 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.710
 officially announced also about what 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.629
 symantec says that Android is more secure 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.640
 that to them also the first 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.850
 filtered images in what to each 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.830
 the aluminum nokia and also on the 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.870
 galaxy s 4,000 and that in new tests 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.620
 confirm that if it arrived so 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.620
 let's start now 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.989
 twitterviews and today for web and yesterday it 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.089
 a few days ago I was talking about your 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.610
 new music service in streaming 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.409
 that I was going to humbly throw you 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.960
 moment has arrived and the application for 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.909
 get to the appstore today as well as 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.070
 the web application as advertised 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.380
 official twitter form on your blog is 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.759
 say against the first is figuration 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.619
 studies I feel is about a 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.259
 streaming music service per se 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.970
 same but that is a kind of 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.330
 container of other services like 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.549
 spotify or radio as well as the library 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.560
 musical internal device 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.690
 obviously the application has a strong 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.610
 social component because it is focused on 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.110
 discover new music as well as 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.390
 share through the restriction 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.069
 four tabs make up the base of the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.200
 super popular app emerging 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.149
 that is a production product the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.950
 Interaction also reaches iTunes 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.440
 for studies and you can buy 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.440
 contents of the itunes store 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.189
 pantech plays iron coveted green official 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.840
 we already know cables and other terminals that 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.520
 we will hardly see for our 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.729
 borders is to put long teeth 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.069
 although for interesting sometimes we have 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.310
 that we stop at the designs of these 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.220
 most minority Asian manufacturers 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.819
 like the south Korean panthers the pantech 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.379
 iron in his in his last creation a 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.540
 device that has little to envy 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.910
 to the best of the android market with a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.519
 Careful design of the almost do not exist 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.440
 side frames and only a handicap that 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.349
 will surely reach our 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.970
 markets the game vega iron will arrive all 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.060
 with a score of 5 inches and 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.579
 HD resolution we talk about 1280 x 720 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.989
 pixels that will give life to a 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.980
 state-of-the-art processor 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.799
 qualcomm snapdragon 600 with 4 cores to 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.450
 1.7 lakers and accompanied by a gpu 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.450
 Adreno 320 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.670
 in point number 4 we will solve 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.550
 some will seem strange to you and others 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.040
 something good about the symantec that android 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.660
 it's safer than them the external 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.550
 burden of being the system with more 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.560
 users take it android in these 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.160
 moments like it would happen to teachers or 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.810
 with windows xp that nobody -has attacked this 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.250
 does not necessarily imply that you have the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.569
 worst system only that the 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.430
 virus developers come to 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.530
 Make the most of your time tried 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.450
 get to love the greatest number of 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.180
 possible people although in this case 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.280
 has always been distrustful of him and more 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.350
 symantec same as last year 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.680
 just the contrary statements 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.900
 this one jumps to the fore 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.970
 defend it android is safer than 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.890
 we few expect a report from 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.989
 these taking into account that almost with 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.519
 android cultural character has never been 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.200
 considered as a serious alternative 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.390
 in companies with high levels of 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.489
 secrecy or levels of security 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.660
 advanced not only because of the lack of 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.099
 tools to control 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.500
 business security policies 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.239
 but because he never said before that 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.239
 Android is safer than goodbye 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.590
 first filtered images of the doc jack 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.780
 cat quad in what to aluminum 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.000
 again the Chinese social network egg has 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.310
 been feeding some images of 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.750
 one that with an aluminum body the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.150
 positive known as the name of 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.209
 Nokia catwalk features that 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.299
 seems to offer would offer the terminal are 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.600
 a qualcomm snapdragon s4 processor 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.540
 double core to 1.5 in hills a panther 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.230
 It is 4.5 inch eighth led te 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:33.610
 we talk about 1980 x 768 pixels a giga 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.640
 of internal giant ram cameras 8.7 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.330
 megapixel 2000-amp battery 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.360
 now measures 119 by 71 by 88 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.790
 millimeters and a weight of 132 grams 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.030
 we talk about it being thinner and lighter 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.970
 that the Nokia Lumia 920 and especially a 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.670
 aluminum body in certain would be 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.340
 the substitute of the number 920 50 grams 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.990
 lighter and about 2.3 millimeters more 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.090
 thin that this one for the images 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.010
 we have to slot the card 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.520
 microsim that is located in the part 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.740
 superior of tele 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.830
 along with what appears to be the usb jack 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.229
 also like they do not want the 1,720 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.419
 of terminal comes with the three dots 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.650
 on the back that allow the 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.650
 wireless charging 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.550
 in position number 1 we will talk about 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.240
 galaxy 4 mini that new tests 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.710
 confirm that if it came from samsung 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.380
 galaxy s 4.000 some time ago we come 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.240
 hearing about it almost since it's 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.030
 know it was known the existence of a 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.370
 galaxy 4 started to rumble too 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.350
 about its smaller version not in 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.540
 We all know the taste of Samsung 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.600
 for the variety and the refritos so 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.970
 it will not surprise us the least 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.190
 whatever the approach they give you, although 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.590
 hc 4 min and the new tests of the 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.210
 existence of a galaxy 4 mini comes from 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.130
 source code of the official page of 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.290
 samsung where you have found a 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.770
 reference to a terminal with code as 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.020
 of object 9.190 that follows 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.150
 classic samsung coding and just 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.780
 after 3000 Welsh that model 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.910
 gt to 8,190 again as its predecessor 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.130
 this is and 4000 and it would not be a version 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.500
 Smaller with spirit specifications 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.230
 high-end and lower price but that 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.360
 it would be placed more like a range 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.030
 average that shares denomination with the 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.470
 believe of holy catalog in this case the 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.200
 specifications that according 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:33.900
 with those that follow would be a screen of 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:36.990
 44 inches with resolution qhd 960 x 540 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.570
 pixels a samsung processor hits 5 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.360
 thousand 210 with a leading architecture 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.700
 internal memory of 8 16 or 32 gb 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.980
 expandable with microsd camera cards 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.090
 8 megapixel main front 2 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.820
 megapixels 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.980
 Android 4.2 points of libya and with all 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.980
 with your boots' 2.0
