Mike<00:00:13.889> why<00:00:14.429> why<00:00:15.030> would<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.299> want<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.660> solve<00:00:15.870> from

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
Mike why why would I want to solve from

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.900 
Mike why why would I want to solve from
a<00:00:16.139> flash<00:00:16.379> drive<00:00:16.590> when<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.340> pop<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
a flash drive when I can just pop in the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.150 
a flash drive when I can just pop in the
DVD<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.390> bought<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.619> install<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:19.920> that

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
DVD I bought and just install it that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.240 
DVD I bought and just install it that
way<00:00:20.330> well<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.869> difference<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
way well the difference is that with a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.000 
way well the difference is that with a
flash<00:00:23.760> drive<00:00:24.029> since<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:25.380> based<00:00:25.740> on

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
flash drive since they are based on

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.670 
flash drive since they are based on
flash<00:00:26.400> memory<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> read<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.109> write<00:00:28.289> speeds

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
flash memory the read and write speeds

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
flash memory the read and write speeds
will<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:28.890> significantly<00:00:29.730> faster<00:00:30.119> than<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
will be significantly faster than a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.680 
will be significantly faster than a
conventional<00:00:30.929> DVD<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.850> you'll<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.630> able

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
conventional DVD so you'll just be able

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.240 
conventional DVD so you'll just be able
to<00:00:33.870> breeze<00:00:34.200> through<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.649> windows<00:00:34.980> 7

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
to breeze through the windows 7

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.100 
to breeze through the windows 7
installation<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:36.030> about<00:00:36.239> 5<00:00:36.660> or<00:00:36.690> 10<00:00:36.930> minutes

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
installation in about 5 or 10 minutes

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.819 
installation in about 5 or 10 minutes
instead<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.980> usual<00:00:38.430> 20<00:00:38.879> minutes<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.680> me

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
instead of usual 20 minutes so for me

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.580 
instead of usual 20 minutes so for me
it's<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.309> lot<00:00:41.700> easier<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.780> use<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.260> flash

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it's a lot easier just to use a flash

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.410 
it's a lot easier just to use a flash
drive

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
drive

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.630 
drive
so<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.840> start<00:00:46.110> insert<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.950> flash<00:00:47.190> drive<00:00:47.460> into

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
so to start insert your flash drive into

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.700 
so to start insert your flash drive into
the<00:00:47.760> computer<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:50.129> I'll<00:00:50.399> show<00:00:50.640> you

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
the computer and then here I'll show you

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.069 
the computer and then here I'll show you
this<00:00:52.710> removable<00:00:53.370> disk<00:00:53.789> Kay<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.809> one<00:00:54.960> I'm

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
this removable disk Kay is the one I'm

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.900 
this removable disk Kay is the one I'm
going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.590> using<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> install<00:00:56.070> windows<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
going to be using to install windows and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
going to be using to install windows and
I<00:00:57.690> should<00:00:57.899> probably<00:00:58.020> tell<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> guys<00:00:58.559> right

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
I should probably tell you guys right

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.900 
I should probably tell you guys right

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
now that you'll want a four gigabyte or

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.359 
now that you'll want a four gigabyte or
more<00:01:02.910> flash<00:01:03.539> drive<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.470> else<00:01:04.830> Windows<00:01:05.220> will

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
more flash drive or else Windows will

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.640 
more flash drive or else Windows will
not<00:01:05.519> fit<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.320> I've

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
not fit on it so you can see I've

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.420 
not fit on it so you can see I've
already<00:01:07.799> emptied<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.640> flash<00:01:08.909> drive<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> right

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
already emptied my flash drive so right

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.670 
already emptied my flash drive so right

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
now we're going to open up a command

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.370 
now we're going to open up a command
line<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.479> make<00:01:15.479> sure<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.840> run<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.259> as

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

here
otherwise<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.920> could<00:01:26.100> end<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.490> wiping<00:01:27.000> your

otherwise you could end up wiping your
computer<00:01:27.780> which<00:01:28.049> would<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:28.619> very<00:01:29.070> nice

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
computer which would not be very nice

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.050 
computer which would not be very nice
and<00:01:29.790> you'll<00:01:30.509> probably<00:01:30.750> hate<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.200> me<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> what

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you're going to do is type in a disk

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.640 
you're going to do is type in a disk
part<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.970> press<00:01:36.240> ENTER<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.600> you'll<00:01:40.500> have

let's<00:01:50.670> see<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.689> flash<00:01:52.020> drive<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.470> 14<00:01:52.979> gigs<00:01:53.369> so

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
let's see my flash drive is 14 gigs so

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.859 
let's see my flash drive is 14 gigs so
it<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.509> disc<00:01:54.990> 3<00:01:56.149> make<00:01:57.149> sure<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> don't<00:01:57.570> select
