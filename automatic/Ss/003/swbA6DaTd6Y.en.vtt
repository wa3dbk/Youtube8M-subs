look at this neat picture of Great Salt

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.380 
look at this neat picture of Great Salt
Lake<00:04:04.520> in<00:04:04.730> utah<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.790> variation<00:04:08.300> in

Lake in utah and the the variation in
color<00:04:08.660> is<00:04:09.110> that's<00:04:09.860> that's<00:04:10.190> due<00:04:10.460> to<00:04:10.610> an<00:04:10.760> almost

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
color is that's that's due to an almost

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.330 
color is that's that's due to an almost

stops the circulation and things get

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.390 
stops the circulation and things get
saltier<00:04:20.090> in<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.390> little<00:04:20.660> bit<00:04:20.980> yes<00:04:21.980> certainly

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
saltier in a little bit yes certainly

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:42.270 
saltier in a little bit yes certainly

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.310 

here<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.580> see<00:04:43.790> two<00:04:44.060> circles<00:04:44.510> coming<00:04:44.900> into<00:04:45.170> the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
here you see two circles coming into the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.980 
here you see two circles coming into the
top<00:04:45.890> of<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.220> view<00:04:46.460> now<00:04:46.700> these<00:04:47.480> are<00:04:47.750> either

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
top of the view now these are either

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.670 
top of the view now these are either
volcanoes<00:04:48.710> or<00:04:49.690> effects<00:04:50.690> from<00:04:50.810> inside<00:04:51.650> the

volcanoes or effects from inside the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
earth producing circular features we

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.230 
earth producing circular features we
think<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:54.770> is<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.040> Big<00:04:55.250> Bend<00:04:55.520> area<00:04:55.940> of<00:04:57.940> Texas

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.540 

this<00:05:02.240> is<00:05:02.420> an<00:05:02.600> interesting<00:05:03.200> sideways<00:05:04.160> view<00:05:04.430> of

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
this is an interesting sideways view of

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.750 
this is an interesting sideways view of
the<00:05:04.880> peninsula<00:05:05.419> of<00:05:05.840> Florida<00:05:06.400> with<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.430> keys

the peninsula of Florida with the keys
stretching<00:05:08.300> out<00:05:08.419> into<00:05:08.690> the<00:05:08.810> lowest<00:05:09.530> part<00:05:09.830> of

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
stretching out into the lowest part of

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.150 
stretching out into the lowest part of
the<00:05:09.980> picture<00:05:10.370> there<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.990> shallow<00:05:12.800> seas

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
the picture there and the shallow seas

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.730 
the picture there and the shallow seas
around<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:14.090> Bahama<00:05:14.480> Islands<00:05:14.870> top<00:05:15.410> right<00:05:15.680> and

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
around the Bahama Islands top right and

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.819 
around the Bahama Islands top right and
Cuba<00:05:18.740> coming<00:05:19.550> into<00:05:19.669> the<00:05:19.790> picture<00:05:20.000> lower<00:05:20.630> right

Cuba coming into the picture lower right

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:27.350 
Cuba coming into the picture lower right
and<00:05:23.829> this<00:05:24.249> I<00:05:24.489> believe<00:05:24.669> is<00:05:24.849> the<00:05:25.329> coast<00:05:25.749> of

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
and this I believe is the coast of

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.869 
and this I believe is the coast of
northern<00:05:28.360> Chile<00:05:28.929> in<00:05:29.379> South<00:05:29.679> America<00:05:30.159> it's<00:05:30.819> a

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:30.879 
northern Chile in South America it's a

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.909 
northern Chile in South America it's a
very<00:05:31.029> straight<00:05:31.449> coast<00:05:31.809> except<00:05:32.709> for<00:05:32.739> that

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
very straight coast except for that

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.399 
very straight coast except for that
strange<00:05:33.599> headland<00:05:34.599> out<00:05:34.779> to<00:05:34.929> the<00:05:35.049> top<00:05:35.229> right

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
strange headland out to the top right

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.159 
strange headland out to the top right
just<00:05:35.679> disappearing<00:05:36.129> and<00:05:36.909> so<00:05:37.299> the<00:05:37.479> desert<00:05:37.989> is

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
just disappearing and so the desert is

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.369 
just disappearing and so the desert is
this<00:05:38.409> the<00:05:38.949> first<00:05:39.189> part<00:05:39.669> of<00:05:39.939> the<00:05:40.419> inland<00:05:41.139> zone

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:41.379 
this the first part of the inland zone

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.009 
this the first part of the inland zone
and<00:05:41.649> then<00:05:42.339> you<00:05:42.639> see<00:05:42.849> much<00:05:43.059> blacker<00:05:43.479> at<00:05:43.719> the<00:05:43.809> top

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:44.019 
and then you see much blacker at the top

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:46.019 
and then you see much blacker at the top
of<00:05:44.049> the<00:05:44.229> picture<00:05:44.589> of<00:05:44.919> the<00:05:45.099> Andes<00:05:45.519> Mountains

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
with some many dozens of volcanoes and

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.350 
with some many dozens of volcanoes and
here<00:05:51.969> is<00:05:52.239> a<00:05:52.269> Thunderhead<00:05:53.759> the<00:05:54.759> typical<00:05:55.149> look

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
here is a Thunderhead the typical look

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.779 
here is a Thunderhead the typical look
of<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:55.659> thunderheads<00:05:56.169> big<00:05:56.949> rain<00:05:57.189> storms<00:05:57.669> that

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
of the thunderheads big rain storms that

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.039 
of the thunderheads big rain storms that

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:13.019 

here's<00:06:10.069> an<00:06:10.999> obviously<00:06:11.539> a<00:06:11.689> major<00:06:12.199> river

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:13.029 
here's an obviously a major river

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:15.309 
here's an obviously a major river
there's<00:06:14.029> an<00:06:14.209> even<00:06:14.389> bigger<00:06:14.719> one<00:06:14.899> coming<00:06:15.169> into

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
there's an even bigger one coming into
