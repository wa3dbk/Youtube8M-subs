00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.009
 the tv on France 2 I handed a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.020
 table on their head people were saying the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.869
 lives to change that's not for us 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.630
 call Muslims and I grew up 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.269
 like that he makes bronze release 12 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.699
 years I wished to do Ramadan but 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.859
 I was really determined and my father 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.480
 let's see the determination he tells me but 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.510
 she told me she was too young 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.100
 lady in need of doing ramadan who 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.820
 start to me I hurt the young woman 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.559
 ramadan a dinan a debt us and had to 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.190
 it is he who chooses who goes to 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.070
 paradise 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.500
 he tells me that like that and that's okay 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.350
 really upset because good I 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.079
 do not go express I want to tell him I 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 I'm here I told myself that I actually 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.090
 uncomfortable I am passionate about 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.520
 paradise so I continued like this 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.440
 I grew up like that I thought 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.510
 after all the parents they are 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.159
 dangerous Muslims must remain so but 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 do not go but questions that were 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.619
 that had aroused in me a number of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.619
 questions and then I wanted 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.420
 start to say the current and I'm 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.930
 came across a passage that said that at 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.759
 paradise we would talk that ram 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.890
 so that also makes sense when aroused 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.590
 questions I thought to myself but why 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.360
 would we speak that Arabic 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.430
 why is it that there would be as 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.770
 months but therach'i Factiva beautiful 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.960
 remains would have been American 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.850
 Spanish and Italian and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.680
 French 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.970
 so it still attracts customers - 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.299
 and then I thought, well, I go 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.310
 continue since I was raised like that 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:49.009
 and then it's when I arrived 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:54.340
 so in high school I met sébastien 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:56.619
 and we are just friends and justin 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.020
 it was past that is to the father of m 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.920
 of the undertaking in which 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.329
 he had been working for years and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.859
 I did not want my heart 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.739
 find themselves unemployed and I told myself 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.640
 after all why hesitate prayer 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.519
 five times a day 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.500
 after all if I'm going to talk to the soul I 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.209
 ask him to make sure 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.519
 that my father is not associated 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.340
 and there when I talked to there I 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.390
 really felt like a wall that was 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.150
 really an emptiness was nothing there I 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.910
 I'm saying, well that's how I 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.980
 took as a fatality is there so 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.579
 there finally the agent meets sébastien at 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.870
 high school that was not Christian he 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.790
 only flavors was Christian 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.670
 Crétier was the sister of the woman 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.299
 where she had given her son rick and 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.269
 eva's heroes and teen the veyron 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.890
 read the gospel according to jean and we were 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.680
 in the yard where we have simple games 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.480
 to friends and it must have been searched 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.459
 in his binder and the tensions 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.220
 of energy according to people know had there 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:05.019
 given he tells me hey I give you that 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.150
 will do no harm then vixiège what is it 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.930
 that it is but she tells me ah bah listen 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.090
 you will see well then the evening says that I 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.090
 came back because it's good 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.069
 bone was a fridge na li I made him 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.290
 trust I said to myself oh well I wish I 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.180
 will do what he gave me 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.150
 and as at home I understood by reading 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.510
 the first verses that it was the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.819
 city 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.769
 there I locked myself in my room at 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.280
 point that of course we do not find with 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.650
 that in the hands and so froze it on Thursday 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.650
 july the chips on jean third 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.989
 because god has tried that was how 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.790
 see you were wrong it was like a 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.340
 sword that there was really fine 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.500
 raymond one because you tried but the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.380
 sheep who love it rachid fathi mangino 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.400
 brenckle he loved everything the world he has 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.810
 given his son 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.620
 Jesus entrusts you he had given 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.680
 purpose on for me malika took that 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.150
 cut a little bit more that includes him 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.720
 remains but have life 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.629
 eternal 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.519
 it's really like a revelation in 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.200
 done it's very simple it 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.140
 was enough that I believe in Jesus 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.180
 I inherited eternal life and 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.250
 adour to magic as convinced that 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.650
 jesus is the son of god convinced that 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.169
 the city is the word of God convinced 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.820
 that god even convinced also that god 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.360
 does not differentiate between each 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.070
 To be human 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.180
 it was really like a big 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.860
 fiction is then well I had 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.710
 really it is this gospel and 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.500
 then I talked about it to sébastien and by 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.590
 following I propose a pressing mention 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.070
 of memories is going very well oiled tobacco and 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.070
 there he redo the leaves help the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.410
 little calendars rarely under the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.729
 to frighten him and of course that's 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.479
 always I'm hidden deep in my 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.039
 clothes for not that the wall is booming and 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.380
 I came across a leaflet 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.169
 said we could talk to god 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.000
 like a worm that Jesus is alive he 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.740
 was enough to just talk to him as 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.060
 a friend like a lighthouse even though he has 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.979
 also found that we see everything we 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.449
 did we can talk to him any 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.810
 simply and trust him 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.340
 and in the evening as a good student in the 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.620
 family there were many of you on your walls 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.580
 in the room and no I had so much the 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.930
 light is to bring I talked to jesus 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.909
 and I really felt like a 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.639
 presence like those who had me 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.380
 really someone claiming them had been 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.389
 not even imagination because everything 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.550
 it reminded me when I had 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.820
 talked to laives who had a cadmium vacuum 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.919
 the goat at mons in 18 presences and 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.930
 I had lived this experience I got 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.060
 said but really see the midst 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.039
 itches yves dauge years old when he said 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.930
 that it is when it is written that it is 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.870
 resurrected the third day well yes 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.090
 and alive 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.700
 and he is well the steps when I 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.680
 felt damask now then it's 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.270
 I was at my parents' place, it's true 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.500
 that it was not difficult because I 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.410
 had to church life 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:06.020
 I did not engage all inclusive 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.090
 although I was assured that I was 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.160
 saved if I were if I was going to die 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.580
 to die in the months or in the days 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.790
 who followed but I knew at 6am to 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.920
 grow up made sure that comes this 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.630
 past we had for her for my 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:27.350
 parents it was not difficult for 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:32.300
 we had to go through in this was 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:34.910
 not easy and then my bag the area 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.530
 lost but we can marry 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.200
 afterwards there is re as a 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.910
 drogba because that's where it is 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.620
 there I had the freedom to go to 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.770
 the church since I was no longer or 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:49.220
 others of my 20 years lived a fight 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.860
 a fight it was very difficult 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.020
 alas the Lord has allowed many confused 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.490
 to go to church 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.560
 and here it is the same and towards the fight 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.540
 for gonna I really felt like that 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.230
 still dominates give me 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:06.080
 he held me and there I said to myself nan there 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.880
 these images and I have this opportunity to 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.380
 to be able to engage with the Lord I 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.590
 know he's alive and what's alive 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.540
 less on the own self for my sins 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.340
 momentum next I got engaged and since 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.920
 it's true I do not fit on a 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.320
 Christ of whom I could live 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.360
 situations port is less easy but 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.120
 we put us and on whom to count I know 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.540
 on kino invited I have seven sins it's 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.180
 the choice 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.700
 he is also the source of my strength when 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.380
 I need it really since I 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.700
 can say that I'm necessarily it's 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.040
 not always easy it's not 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.680
 always pink moment I read and on who 

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.040
 I can ride marzy players or even 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.420
 just now I know where I'm going here 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.420
 bush against her at the movies
