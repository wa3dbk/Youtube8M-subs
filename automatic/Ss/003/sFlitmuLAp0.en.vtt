can to disrupt the game of kyrics at

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.060 
can to disrupt the game of kyrics at
this<00:01:38.369> point<00:01:38.670> zerg<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.570> firm<00:01:39.930> control<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.799> on

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
this point zerg and firm control is on

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.350 
this point zerg and firm control is on
three<00:01:41.340> bases<00:01:41.729> does<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> income

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
three bases does have the income

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.560 
three bases does have the income
advantage<00:01:42.899> 32<00:01:43.140> workers<00:01:43.740> 217<00:01:44.369> cut<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> lot<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
advantage 32 workers 217 cut a lot of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.030 
advantage 32 workers 217 cut a lot of

workers and a lot of drones to produce

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.440 
workers and a lot of drones to produce
circlings<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.820> units<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.240> try<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
circlings and units to try to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.359 
circlings and units to try to
counter-attack<00:01:48.810> there<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:51.210> foxer<00:01:51.659> could

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
counter-attack there so foxer could

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.679 
counter-attack there so foxer could
could<00:01:53.369> sneak<00:01:53.670> back<00:01:53.880> into<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.240> game<00:01:54.450> with

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
could sneak back into this game with

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.289 
could sneak back into this game with
uses<00:01:55.140> use<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.740> mules<00:01:56.250> he<00:01:56.759> doesn't<00:01:57.030> need<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> get

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
uses use of mules he doesn't need to get

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
uses use of mules he doesn't need to get
an<00:01:57.390> expansion<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.110> he<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.680> has<00:01:58.799> no<00:01:58.920> second

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
an expansion up he really has no second

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.090 
an expansion up he really has no second
step<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> point<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:01.530> trying<00:02:01.829> another

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
step at this point is trying another

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.260 
step at this point is trying another
drop<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> store

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
drop with the store

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.469 
drop with the store
so<00:02:05.259> see<00:02:05.469> how<00:02:05.500> successfully<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.340> able<00:02:06.609> to<00:02:06.729> be

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
so see how successfully is able to be

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.359 
so see how successfully is able to be
with<00:02:07.840> these<00:02:08.319> stores<00:02:08.619> just<00:02:08.860> constantly

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
with these stores just constantly

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.100 
with these stores just constantly
dropping<00:02:09.610> could<00:02:10.090> pick<00:02:10.239> off<00:02:10.390> just<00:02:10.720> this<00:02:10.869> Queen

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
dropping could pick off just this Queen

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.259 
dropping could pick off just this Queen
