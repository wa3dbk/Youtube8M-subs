00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
my hands and dropped in new little motor

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.560 
my hands and dropped in new little motor
and<00:00:15.780> ESC<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.760> and<00:00:17.760> as<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.970> can<00:00:18.090> see<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> little

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and ESC so and as you can see the little

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.279 
and ESC so and as you can see the little
Mamba<00:00:19.850> micro<00:00:20.850> Pro<00:00:21.150> right<00:00:21.779> through<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> window

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
Mamba micro Pro right through the window

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.279 
Mamba micro Pro right through the window
right<00:00:22.470> there<00:00:23.269> ended<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.359> dropping<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.519 

micro<00:00:28.289> Pro<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.939> extreme<00:00:30.689> 18th<00:00:31.109> scale

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
micro Pro this is the extreme 18th scale

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.030 
micro Pro this is the extreme 18th scale
brushless<00:00:32.460> power<00:00:32.669> system<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.649> think<00:00:34.890> it's

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
brushless power system and I think it's

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.470 
brushless power system and I think it's
the<00:00:35.780> CM<00:00:37.460> 2012<00:00:38.460> 50<00:00:38.850> 400<00:00:39.329> kV<00:00:39.660> motor<00:00:41.149> as<00:00:42.149> far<00:00:42.360> as

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the CM 2012 50 400 kV motor as far as

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.330 
the CM 2012 50 400 kV motor as far as
the<00:00:42.629> layout<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.200> thing<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.910> motor<00:00:46.340> went

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the layout of this thing the motor went

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.580 
the layout of this thing the motor went
in<00:00:47.430> pretty<00:00:47.640> easily<00:00:48.350> unfortunately<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> did

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
in pretty easily unfortunately I did

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.790 
in pretty easily unfortunately I did
have<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> remove<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:51.239> receiver<00:00:52.079> from<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
have to remove the receiver from the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500 
have to remove the receiver from the
little<00:00:53.039> position<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.329> there

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
little position that was on there

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.869 
little position that was on there
because<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.500> bolt<00:00:55.739> pattern<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> motor<00:00:56.520> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
because the bolt pattern on the motor is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.060 
because the bolt pattern on the motor is
a<00:00:56.940> certain<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.570> where<00:00:57.840> either<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.739> gonna<00:00:58.890> go

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
a certain way where either it's gonna go

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.939 
a certain way where either it's gonna go
on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> inside<00:00:59.969> by<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> drive<00:01:01.350> shaft<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
on the inside by the drive shaft on the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.969 
on the inside by the drive shaft on the
outside<00:01:02.370> where<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> currently<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.290> ended

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
outside where it currently is so I ended

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
outside where it currently is so I ended
up<00:01:05.040> having<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> put<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> receiver<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.180> top<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
up having to put the receiver on top and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.370 
up having to put the receiver on top and
then<00:01:06.930> move<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.549> ESC<00:01:08.549> forward<00:01:09.229> just<00:01:10.229> got

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
then move the ESC forward just got

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.750 
then move the ESC forward just got
everything<00:01:10.680> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.920> temporarily<00:01:11.430> sent

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
everything kind of temporarily sent

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.410 
everything kind of temporarily sent
right<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.270> gonna<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.600> some<00:01:12.780> runs

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
right now I'm just gonna do some runs

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
right now I'm just gonna do some runs
initially<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> had<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:15.930> issues<00:01:16.259> getting<00:01:17.130> this

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
initially I had some issues getting this

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.070 
initially I had some issues getting this
thing<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.030> running<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.540> had<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> call

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
thing up and running and had to call

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.590 
thing up and running and had to call
castle<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:22.610> somehow<00:01:23.610> worked<00:01:24.060> its<00:01:24.240> way<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
castle and somehow worked its way out to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.980 
castle and somehow worked its way out to
where<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.830> running<00:01:26.040> fine<00:01:26.400> now<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.000> they

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
where it's running fine now so they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.390 
where it's running fine now so they
initially<00:01:28.350> wanted<00:01:28.560> me<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.710> send<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.130> back<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
initially wanted me to send it back and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.810 
initially wanted me to send it back and
wait<00:01:29.939> several<00:01:30.780> weeks<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.380> my<00:01:31.439> ESC<00:01:32.280> back<00:01:32.490> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
wait several weeks to get my ESC back so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.429 
wait several weeks to get my ESC back so
and<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.020> running<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.910 
and it was got it up and running and
just<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> do<00:01:34.860> some<00:01:35.070> runs<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.790> how

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
just want to do some runs on it see how

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
just want to do some runs on it see how
stable<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.460> everything<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.360> thing

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
stable it is and everything one thing

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
stable it is and everything one thing
castle<00:01:40.320> did<00:01:40.470> tell<00:01:40.650> me<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.369> motor

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
castle did tell me was that this motor

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.289 
castle did tell me was that this motor
is<00:01:42.920> not<00:01:43.920> strong<00:01:44.399> enough<00:01:44.430> for<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.970> car

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
is not strong enough for this car

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.910 
is not strong enough for this car
because<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.720> car<00:01:45.750> weighs<00:01:46.110> too<00:01:46.350> much<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.829> if

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
because the car weighs too much but if

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.800 
because the car weighs too much but if
you<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> their<00:01:47.430> website<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.240> does<00:01:48.479> say<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you go to their website it does say that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.780 
you go to their website it does say that
it<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.380> handle<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.159> weight<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.549> car

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it can handle the weight of this car

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.870 
it can handle the weight of this car
anyways<00:01:52.340> looks<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.460> they're<00:01:53.610> trying<00:01:53.759> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
anyways looks like they're trying to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.850 
anyways looks like they're trying to
prevent<00:01:54.119> some<00:01:54.329> warranty<00:01:54.689> issues<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.439> anyways

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
prevent some warranty issues but anyways

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.410 
prevent some warranty issues but anyways
gonna<00:01:56.100> go<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.640> run<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.850> thing<00:01:57.030> out<00:01:57.210> there

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
gonna go and run this thing out there

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.359 
gonna go and run this thing out there
this<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.140> my<00:01:58.170> first<00:01:58.560> test<00:01:59.009> run<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.340> my<00:01:59.490> new

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
this is my first test run with my new

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.410 
this is my first test run with my new
high<00:02:02.369> tech<00:02:02.840> 5245<00:02:03.840> servo<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.469> then<00:02:05.189> also

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
high tech 5245 servo and then also

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.730 
high tech 5245 servo and then also
obviously<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> Mamba<00:02:07.200> micro<00:02:07.619> Pro<00:02:07.890> so

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
obviously the Mamba micro Pro so

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.910 
obviously the Mamba micro Pro so
wish<00:02:09.040> me<00:02:09.190> luck<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.580> hopefully<00:02:10.090> Menten<00:02:10.480> breaks

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
wish me luck and hopefully Menten breaks

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.160 
wish me luck and hopefully Menten breaks
over<00:02:11.920> now
