00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.729
 they have good friends because in deer hunting both 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.030
 for the opening 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.030
 can you tell us a little bit about the specificities of this 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.179
 every day and that rival crew Quebec well 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.189
 the crew who hunt beaucourt in good rate in grove 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.449
 its patience peculiarity 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.249
 this contribution aaa very little wooded department she was pretty few big 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:26.589
 territories 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.249
 and therefore a hunt without outline which had to adapt to each other 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.249
 which makes us very much have pyres 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.640
 % and those who apply several things first that is to say 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.230
 very special relationship with our neighbors 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.790
 since we raised to sullom voe relatively small territories so 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.050
 only for them 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.079
 November 28 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.339
 maintain relations with the neighbor and his rights 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:53.250
 kind how 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.900
 it's of course relations with the owners 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.380
 it's relationships with the holders to hunt it whether it's hunts 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.000
 private or of course communal hunts and then yohan eudeline the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.140
 farmers 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.430
 because 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.330
 we are still in an act in a breeding department I think it 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.479
 need to shirin assets little particular because 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.170
 among the local missions of the subconscious by definition we can not 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.770
 too expensive what to do already without 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.100
 they do not need then constantly 'dezoning' to chase them 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.070
 and then already acquired 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.770
 good carriers of the pages a little closer fence the tactical criteria 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.110
 how did you react to these Swiss roads it just takes the roads 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.060
 bowlers love hunting% and push them to always go forward 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.720
 despite difficulties 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 we will take a little bit of density on a new goal the density of play 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.160
 Roannais dead in the Vendée is pretty amazing because in fact we speak 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.590
 of a very small population 25 or 30 years ago 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.430
 and for skins that deer in the mind was a wood terminal 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.290
 gold size turns out to be very very well suited 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.599
 she gives for all 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.079
 in the fields that is to say that 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.349
 it is robust 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:19.149
 he is he is very robust because he has the offices galore even universe 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.679
 since they have gained age in the fields and who does not feed only for 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:27.199
 the country and for those like a kind of voice could do it on the contrary the 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:32.119
 down the greenery and grax and terraces that makes that we have I think we pay us 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:36.669
 deer both hindsight what is is very solid total has by culture 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.649
 and hunting both in the territory 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:39.739
 two radios 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.989
 and also the private sector ben ali actually has this time of mervans 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.999
 in which obviously a meeting marc had among other courses that 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:47.719
 hunt 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.549
 the rally his crew town had nothing on the Vendée coastline 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.730
 the sense architect is of course the rectorate in this team lasted 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:56.759
 until midnight 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.999
 who to be bored in mervans for a very long time 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.029
 and percent 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:06.429
 of course with the green woods for those who hunt wild boar at we are 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:11.459
 organized to take the three animals and we come through that% 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.079
 to be able to hunt the three crews in this beautiful forest 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:15.979
 of rent 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.670
 if vat - to say 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.749
 it means more di rupo 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:21.780
 cement 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.689
 put the agreement between us 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.480
 which was indispensable for our future
