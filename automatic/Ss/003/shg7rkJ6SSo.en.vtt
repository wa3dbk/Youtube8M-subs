00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that section track and go right here

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.280 
that section track and go right here
split<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.570> basically<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.930> making<00:01:46.260> a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
split it and basically like making a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:55.550 
split it and basically like making a
huge<00:01:46.770> huge<00:01:47.640> he'll<00:01:50.930> go<00:01:51.930> over<00:01:52.140> here<00:01:53.479> incline<00:01:54.560> go

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
huge huge he'll go over here incline go

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:08.260 
huge huge he'll go over here incline go
there<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.479> raise<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.510> up<00:02:00.350> raise<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.380> up<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:16.220 

really<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.509> high<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:14.959> now<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.020> may

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
really really high like that now you may

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.850 
really really high like that now you may
think<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.620> looks<00:02:16.950> unrealistic<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:19.500> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
think that looks unrealistic but you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.940 
think that looks unrealistic but you
know<00:02:19.980> if<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.310> alter<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:21.150> terrain<00:02:21.540> stuff

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
know if you alter the terrain stuff

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.760 
know if you alter the terrain stuff
it'll<00:02:22.950> look<00:02:23.070> realistic<00:02:24.350> going<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.410> come<00:02:25.620> down

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
it'll look realistic going to come down

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:36.350 
it'll look realistic going to come down
here<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.870> know<00:02:34.019> make<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.130> more<00:02:35.340> make<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
here and you know make it more make the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:03:01.500 
here and you know make it more make the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
that and then you know gradual eyes it

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.420 
that and then you know gradual eyes it
likes<00:04:26.550> so<00:04:30.230> overall<00:04:31.230> what<00:04:31.860> you're<00:04:32.070> going<00:04:32.370> to

likes so overall what you're going to

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.960 
likes so overall what you're going to
need<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.730> a<00:04:32.760> long<00:04:33.060> steep<00:04:33.450> section<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.139> track

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
need is a long steep section of track

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.020 
need is a long steep section of track
for<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.180> get<00:04:36.330> its<00:04:36.600> momentum<00:04:37.850> because<00:04:38.850> a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
for it to get its momentum because a

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.010 
for it to get its momentum because a
trail<00:04:39.360> simulator<00:04:39.870> doesn't<00:04:40.200> like<00:04:40.350> is<00:04:40.530> that

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
trail simulator doesn't like is that

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.870 
trail simulator doesn't like is that
you're<00:04:43.020> going<00:04:43.200> to<00:04:43.260> kick<00:04:43.980> your<00:04:44.130> kick<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.639> cars

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
you're going to kick your kick the cars

00:04:44.880 --> 00:05:03.950 
you're going to kick your kick the cars
down<00:04:45.919> down<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:46.950> hump

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.969 

and<00:05:04.530> there<00:05:04.710> you<00:05:04.830> go<00:05:04.860> now<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.340> have<00:05:05.580> your<00:05:05.610> help

and there you go now you have your help

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.520 
and there you go now you have your help
and<00:05:07.979> there<00:05:08.160> you<00:05:08.400> go<00:05:08.460> do<00:05:09.090> is<00:05:09.419> you<00:05:09.600> go<00:05:09.840> to<00:05:09.870> the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
and there you go do is you go to the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.680 
and there you go do is you go to the
paintbrush<00:05:10.979> right<00:05:11.220> here<00:05:13.880> click<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.270> the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
paintbrush right here click the the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.170 
paintbrush right here click the the
magnet<00:05:16.139> and<00:05:16.289> that's<00:05:17.009> just<00:05:17.310> like<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.729> magnet

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
magnet and that's just like the magnet

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:28.029 
magnet and that's just like the magnet
in<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.690> magnet<00:05:19.020> land<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:26.330> brings<00:05:27.330> the

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
in the magnet land and it brings the

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.550 
in the magnet land and it brings the
terrain<00:05:29.039> out<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.639> track<00:05:29.990> so<00:05:30.990> it's<00:05:31.169> not<00:05:31.349> all

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
terrain out to the track so it's not all

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:41.409 
terrain out to the track so it's not all
floaty<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:38.210> when<00:05:39.320> once<00:05:40.320> you<00:05:40.500> finish<00:05:40.860> you<00:05:41.009> know

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
floaty and when once you finish you know

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.180 
floaty and when once you finish you know
doing<00:05:42.419> this<00:05:42.599> and<00:05:42.780> test<00:05:42.960> it<00:05:43.110> out<00:05:43.259> you<00:05:43.860> can<00:05:44.039> make

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
doing this and test it out you can make

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.240 
doing this and test it out you can make
it<00:05:44.340> look<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:45.030> know<00:05:45.150> a<00:05:45.889> little<00:05:46.889> bit<00:05:47.009> more

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
it look you know a little bit more

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.330 
it look you know a little bit more
realistic<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:51.259> there<00:05:52.259> you<00:05:52.349> go<00:05:52.410> you<00:05:52.770> have<00:05:52.979> made

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
realistic and there you go you have made

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.860 
realistic and there you go you have made
a<00:05:53.370> hump<00:05:54.590> very<00:05:55.590> big<00:05:55.830> hump<00:05:56.099> now<00:05:56.460> most<00:05:57.419> humps<00:05:57.750> on

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
like that big but real simulator doesn't

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.779 
like that big but real simulator doesn't
