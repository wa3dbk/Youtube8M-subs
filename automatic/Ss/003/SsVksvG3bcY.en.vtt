00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.750
 reggie 18 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.730
 [Music] 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.730
 my dear claudia 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.080
 They have to acres for a week now in 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.760
 good health but prepared for the worst 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 the men and women who have me 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.230
 fed and hosted here also have me 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.939
 warned that the road to masia was 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.460
 infested with mercenaries the bandits 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.020
 originating from other lands 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.690
 I dare not imagine what he may want 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.360
 say when I left Rome ten months ago 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.210
 I had only one purpose to find out what 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 had escaped our father in one 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.150
 written letter the year before me 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.949
 was born 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.350
 he mentioned a hidden library 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:56.270
 under the masi castle at a sanctuary 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.270
 with a priceless wisdom 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:05.019
 what will I find you when I come and 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.130
 he will welcome me a handful of zealous 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.130
 templar as I fear 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.530
 nothing but the site of a wind 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:17.820
 cold and lonely for about 300 years but 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.820
 we know it does not host two killers 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.850
 we can still claim ownership 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:28.119
 welcome within its walls ho 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.520
 enough of this time claudia not 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.200
 why he is tired because ours 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.149
 battle seems to go into one 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.229
 direction towards chaos today to more 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.210
 I have questions for this 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.880
 pushed so far 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.600
 to clarify to find the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.190
 wisdom left by the great to the suit 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.850
 in order to better understand the purpose 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.850
 of our struggle 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.569
 my role in it 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.569
 [Applause] 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.090
 if something should happen to me claudia se 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.270
 my skills must betray mine 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.140
 ambitions beams weapons do not try 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.450
 justice revenge 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.319
 but insists on the search for truth 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.460
 because everyone 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.590
 can benefit from it 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.400
 my story is no different from that of 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.600
 many others and the world will not suffer if 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.600
 should end up so much
