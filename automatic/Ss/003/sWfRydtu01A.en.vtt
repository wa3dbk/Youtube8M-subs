the lakers are gonna resign him i would
actually<00:01:08.100> think<00:01:08.610> about<00:01:08.700> whether<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:09.270> not<00:01:09.390> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
actually think about whether or not this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840 
actually think about whether or not this
dude<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.229> gonna<00:01:10.409> walk<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> end<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
dude is gonna walk at the end of the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.670 
dude is gonna walk at the end of the
season<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.930> would<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.320> put<00:01:13.619> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
season and that would really put a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.830 
season and that would really put a
damper<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.220> his<00:01:14.760> whole<00:01:14.970> reputation<00:01:15.330> i

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
damper on his whole reputation i

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.179 
damper on his whole reputation i
eventually<00:01:16.140> think<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> he'll<00:01:16.950> stick<00:01:17.159> around

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
eventually think that he'll stick around

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.340 
eventually think that he'll stick around
and<00:01:17.759> i<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.299> think<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> lakers<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:19.110> no

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and i really think the lakers have no

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.200 
and i really think the lakers have no
choice<00:01:19.650> unless<00:01:20.130> they<00:01:20.580> want<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> look<00:01:20.970> real

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
choice unless they want to look real

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.660 
choice unless they want to look real
