00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.480
 hi in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.480
 Luxurious furniture is manufactured 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.139
 you are only going to use tools 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.070
 hammer and saw materials 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:21.200
 you need three pine trunks three 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:24.400
 diumenges six gums two irrigations and five 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.400
 trunks of any kind 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.840
 the first step is to put the thunder ries 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.500
 in the distiller machine so that we 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.500
 solvents 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.309
 the pine trunks are put in the 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.309
 extractor and gives us pine resin 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.140
 now with the saw you have to draw wood 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.140
 light-colored 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.799
 combining the resin with the solvent 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.799
 we have varnish 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.940
 with glue we make glue 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.439
 we use only one old man to make nails 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.030
 Now that we have everything that 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.050
 we need just put things in the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.440
 table the varnish the glue the nails and 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.440
 timber 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.850
 we can make a table and a chair 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.850
 and if we put the iron instead of 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.630
 glue not be a cabinet for 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.630
 save things 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.690
 these are the luxury furniture that we 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:06.630
 we can do for our house we 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.630
 we see in another video have fun and goodbye
