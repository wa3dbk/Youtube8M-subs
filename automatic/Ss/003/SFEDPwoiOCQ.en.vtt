00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.110
 magician offers a look at his 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.460
 the pool is already filled with water and 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.460
 intrigued by the viewers 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:23.100
 now look carefully max 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.390
 gathers all his will into a fist 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.390
 rises on the edge of the pool 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.340
 and water enters but does not sink into it 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.220
 on the contrary, he walks freely along the wave 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.630
 surface I told you that 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.630
 have to remember the biblical motives 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.180
 in front of shocked eyewitnesses 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.800
 illusionist confounded the laws of physics 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.839
 I assure you we do not use any 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.320
 assembly tricks and water absolutely 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.320
 real 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.230
 from this angle you can see how 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.000
 the wizard's feet touch the surface in 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.310
 while directly beneath it swims 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.790
 one of the spectators is a genuine miracle 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.790
 of our days 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.460
 not paying attention to the girls under 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.590
 with his feet the maestro is deadpan 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.760
 continues to walk 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.170
 eyewitnesses simply can not believe their 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.430
 eyes half way 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.060
 my mind refuses to understand 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.100
 happening only unknown to science 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.360
 energy can help a person hold 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.230
 on water without any technical 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.230
 funds 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.439
 he is almost there 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.200
 and here the mission of the magician is over 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.210
 the masked man proved to us that besides 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.210
 of everything else, he is able to walk on water 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.060
 learn the incredible secret of walking on 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.060
 water in the program of the secrets of the great magicians 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.060
 expose 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.200
 we just saw a man in 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.569
 mask made a miracle described more than two 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.849
 thousand years ago it passed on water without 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.530
 any kind of support and all this in front of 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.150
 at the witnesses and his lovely assistants 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.530
 but how did the magician succeed 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.140
 make the impossible secret secret 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.870
 maga is a plexiglass platform 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.370
 durable transparent material 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.659
 plastic base support also 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.430
 invisible from a certain angle 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:17.709
 props if plexiglass immerse in 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.450
 water from a certain point of his impossible 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.489
 notice 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.560
 but if the operator changes the shooting angle 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.909
 we can properly consider this 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.829
 design of course all witnesses 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.599
 of this miracle bought by a magician and only 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.599
 pretend not to notice the platform 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.180
 from an engineering point of view it is long and 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.410
 narrow design clearly thought out easier 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.410
 just notice her below 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.300
 the operator selects a special perspective to 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.660
 do not give out the presence of a foreign body in 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.660
 the pool 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.450
 one of the sections of the platform is extended for 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.180
 so that the camera can show us 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.070
 what's going on inside this pool 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.690
 plot is wide enough to 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.380
 the edges of the platform did not hit the lens 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.380
 cameras 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.250
 a bit pulling away the images of pirates 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.319
 shows us a plastic podium we 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:37.639
 can see how the magician steps over 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:39.469
 the gaps between the sections of the podium 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.879
 through these gaps sailed well 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:42.879
 informed and the audience 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.470
 the presence of eyewitnesses convinced viewers to 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.910
 the fact that the mage has no insurance 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.680
 raising waves and splashes they distract 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.780
 from the ingenious invention 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.780
 which helps can implement it 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.370
 ambitious venture when the water wavers 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.820
 see the platform becomes even 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.060
 harder Well now you know all 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.060
 will be
