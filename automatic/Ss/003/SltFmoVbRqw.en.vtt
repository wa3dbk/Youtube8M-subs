00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
need to do this is exactly what will

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.709 
need to do this is exactly what will
work<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.500> anyone<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.850> plan

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
work for anyone this is the plan

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.360 
work for anyone this is the plan
I'm<00:00:54.780> almost<00:00:55.379> guarantee<00:00:56.010> they're<00:00:56.219> probably

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I'm almost guarantee they're probably

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.740 
I'm almost guarantee they're probably
gonna<00:00:56.610> try<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.969> tell<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.239> something<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
gonna try and tell you something and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
gonna try and tell you something and
they're<00:00:58.050> probably<00:00:58.230> lying<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> because

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
they're probably lying to you because

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.310 
they're probably lying to you because
it's<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.670> not<00:01:00.000> true<00:01:00.270> everyone<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> different

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
it's just not true everyone is different

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.260 
it's just not true everyone is different
I<00:01:01.680> feel<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:01.949> everyone<00:01:02.370> should<00:01:02.399> lift<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
I feel like everyone should lift and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.090 
I feel like everyone should lift and
everyone<00:01:03.750> should<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.140> cardio<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.920> when

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
everyone should do cardio when that when

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.109 
everyone should do cardio when that when
they're<00:01:05.220> trying<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.460> lose<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.670> lot<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.970> weight<00:01:06.090> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
they're trying to lose a lot of weight I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
they're trying to lose a lot of weight I
feel<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.689> always<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.170> good<00:01:07.470> idea<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
feel like that's always a good idea the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.969 
feel like that's always a good idea the
ratio<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.060> say<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.530> really<00:01:10.770> up

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
ratio that I say is it's it's really up

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
ratio that I say is it's it's really up
to<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.340> when<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> first<00:01:11.939> started<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.479> did

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to you when I first started I did

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.109 
to you when I first started I did
legitimately<00:01:13.409> only<00:01:14.040> cardio<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.939> would

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
legitimately only cardio and I would

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.760 
legitimately only cardio and I would
never<00:01:15.299> recommend<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.930> when<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> started

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
never recommend that when I started

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
never recommend that when I started
actually<00:01:17.310> lifting<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.150> doing<00:01:18.570> cardio<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.930> was

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
actually lifting and doing cardio I was

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.499 
actually lifting and doing cardio I was
doing<00:01:19.259> about<00:01:19.409> 80%<00:01:20.040> cardio<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> 20%<00:01:20.880> lifting

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
doing about 80% cardio and 20% lifting

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.260 
doing about 80% cardio and 20% lifting
now<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.350> ratio<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.700> recommend<00:01:23.820> is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
now that ratio what I would recommend is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.999 
now that ratio what I would recommend is
kind<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.630> messing<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.320> ratio<00:01:25.530> how<00:01:25.830> much

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
kind of messing with that ratio how much

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
kind of messing with that ratio how much
how<00:01:26.400> much<00:01:26.580> percentage<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.180> lifting<00:01:27.509> are<00:01:27.570> you

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
how much percentage of lifting are you

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.969 
how much percentage of lifting are you
going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.930> doing<00:01:28.049> versus<00:01:28.470> how<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:28.710> cardio

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
going to be doing versus how much cardio

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.560 
going to be doing versus how much cardio
are<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.520> doing<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.909> started<00:01:30.479> with

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
are you going to be doing I started with

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.929 
are you going to be doing I started with
doing<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:30.900> 80%<00:01:31.500> cardio<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.950> 20%<00:01:32.280> lifting

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
doing about 80% cardio and 20% lifting

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
doing about 80% cardio and 20% lifting

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
everybody is different I would recommend

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.289 
everybody is different I would recommend
starting<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:04.020> 80<00:02:04.740> percent<00:02:05.040> cardio<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.180> the

of weight 80 percent cardio 20 percent
lifting<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.750> feel<00:02:12.930> like

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
lifting I feel like

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.140 
lifting I feel like
a good<00:02:13.380> ratio<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.100> then<00:02:14.490> as<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.970> maybe

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
a good ratio and then as you maybe

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.910 
a good ratio and then as you maybe
progress<00:02:15.660> or<00:02:15.870> see<00:02:16.080> where<00:02:16.290> your<00:02:16.410> body's<00:02:16.770> at

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
progress or see where your body's at

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.180 
progress or see where your body's at
then<00:02:17.820> make<00:02:18.240> me<00:02:18.360> change<00:02:18.780> up<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.680> scale<00:02:20.160> that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
then make me change up that scale that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.460 
then make me change up that scale that
you're<00:02:20.520> using<00:02:20.730> change<00:02:21.270> up<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:22.200> ratio

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
you're using change up that that ratio

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.880 
you're using change up that that ratio
maybe<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:23.100> 60%<00:02:23.850> cardio<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.750> then<00:02:24.840> 40%<00:02:25.560> lifting

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
maybe do 60% cardio and then 40% lifting

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.650 
maybe do 60% cardio and then 40% lifting
so<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:27.030> how<00:02:27.240> much<00:02:27.420> you're<00:02:27.600> in
