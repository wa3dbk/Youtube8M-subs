00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hen rearing is important in 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.319
 strengthening the nutrition of families of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.660
 small producers but the activity can 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.400
 also become a source of income with 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.950
 sale of chickens 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.710
 The technical school of poxoréu studies the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.960
 creation of simple and cheap technologies 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.710
 which can help increase the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.710
 family production 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.420
 every day is a run on the site of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.090
 farinha has spent the 60 years of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.090
 life in the country which explains the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.250
 to everything you have here in Guayaquil 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:43.890
 bug's routine 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:49.739
 to ihm 10 11 on a farm he is not 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.870
 the cassava there myself had in the 25 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.510
 hectares of land in Poxoréu in the south of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.969
 state she creates pigs' milk 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.649
 production serves as food and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.989
 still provides some money for the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.149
 creation costs from the sale of 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.760
 eggs for example that leads to the city 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.159
 or sells to her neighbors 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.280
 purchase more feed for the animals and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 production is good on tv that I take care of 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.670
 others see the birds get loose in the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.939
 backyard and at least twice a day 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 are treated with corn I like to see 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.659
 all together and there are always people from 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.159
 eye on the chicken or a chicken 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.430
 children who have already moved to the city 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.100
 are the ones who enjoy the most confines nené 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.430
 and the league in a hickory chicken in the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.659
 lunch is ready 30 expense is not 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.520
 to consume tv that has enough was for come 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.500
 I want to meet not only because it 's anime 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.299
 still thought that besides pleasing the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.790
 family could earn a buck 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.649
 extra with the raising of chickens to 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.570
 show that this can be a good 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.329
 income alternative for small 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.610
 teachers producers and course students 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.280
 zootechnics of the technical school of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.310
 poxoréu study the viability of the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.700
 of semi-caipirinha chickens in the initial phase 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.780
 are closed and larger nests can 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 circulate outdoors 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.560
 in this project and with the intention of 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.760
 show the small producer who does not 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.240
 needs a lot of investment to 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.610
 maintain a structure that on its website 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.430
 aggregating is a more source of income for 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.020
 thus having the products available there 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.850
 until its feeding to do the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.370
 chicken coop can be reused 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.040
 material that you have in the same places here 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.870
 leftover pvc liner and 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.090
 wire mesh and bamboo 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.540
 the biggest expense is with the purchase of animals 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.390
 and with reason the initial course is not 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.510
 to get the registration I only have on average 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.550
 of 2 reais and 20 in the initial phase is 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.850
 consuming an average of one kilo of feed and 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.690
 cycle of this action will cost on average 70 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.350
 cents 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.590
 then with that initial to aa 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.940
 of the animal to obtain the average ration of 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.580
 r $ 3 during the whole cycle in the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.790
 the first 30 days the chicks 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.910
 closed and they receive only water and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.670
 the also improvised heating 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.110
 This campaign, we improvised to 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.660
 make chicks warm up 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.700
 during the night and during the cold because 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.489
 There when you let go camping. 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.280
 Look he will do the heating and back. 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.530
 at night and they will all group here I 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.140
 approached the feeder trough because the 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.579
 Night will feed and go to drink water. 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.200
 here together would not buy a 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.540
 heater or buy another type of 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.269
 championship he sector has everything a case 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.700
 even after a month confined in this 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.060
 environment the birds will be released in a 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.640
 Masai picket with grass and only return 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.010
 for the night coop feeding 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.870
 alternative may represent a reduction 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.959
 up to 20% on costs when it is up to 30 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.049
 days it is totally confined to 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.560
 from 30 up to 70 days 31 days up to 70 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.200
 days 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.060
 we use the confinement more 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.640
 partnerships 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.160
 then this step backwards which at a cost 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.700
 lower in food because if a pasture 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.200
 This is quality but I was going to give it but it leaves. 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:26.090
 or the kind a big star that is is good 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.550
 protein is soft to make the line 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.370
 the owner of the francs in addition to having a cost 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.500
 smaller than the so-called farm chicken 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.389
 the semi countryman that can be sold with 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.419
 about 70 days 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.419
 has good market acceptance and the best 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.729
 price is very attractive for the creator today 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.080
 confined to sell costs around 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.660
 from $ 15 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.440
 This is semi country chicken that we 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.960
 we create is the action in pasture he sells today 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.610
 around $ 20 a piece clean in the medium 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.610
 of 2 to 3 kilos of weight
