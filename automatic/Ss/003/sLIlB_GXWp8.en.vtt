tools<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.690> need<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> lot<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> people

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.440 
tools you need but to a lot of people
the<00:01:05.970> ability<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.869> make<00:01:07.140> quick<00:01:07.740> presentation

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
the ability to make quick presentation

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.910 
the ability to make quick presentation
accurately<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.570> fishing<00:01:09.900> distances<00:01:10.470> it's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
accurately of fishing distances it's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.500 
accurately of fishing distances it's
hard<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.369> those<00:01:11.520> rods<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.299> hard

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
hard with those rods because it's hard

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.810 
hard with those rods because it's hard
to<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.810> them<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.830> those<00:01:14.130> short<00:01:14.490> time

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
to get them going in those short time

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
to get them going in those short time
windows<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.659> make<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> soft<00:01:16.080> water

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
windows you have to make a soft water

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.190 
windows you have to make a soft water
and<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:16.680> racial<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.610> crucial<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.049> these

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and that's racial it's crucial so these

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.340 
and that's racial it's crucial so these
rods<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:20.360> designed<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.990> help<00:01:22.110> facilitate

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
rods are designed to help facilitate

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.560 
rods are designed to help facilitate
there<00:01:23.950> I<00:01:25.439> guess<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:27.130> term<00:01:27.310> quick<00:01:27.759> loading<00:01:28.090> is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
there I guess the term quick loading is

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.870 
there I guess the term quick loading is
something<00:01:29.409> that<00:01:29.619> it's<00:01:29.979> used<00:01:30.310> but<00:01:30.549> it<00:01:30.700> actually

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
something that it's used but it actually

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.030 
something that it's used but it actually
kind<00:01:31.299> of<00:01:31.360> has<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:31.540> negative<00:01:32.140> connotation<00:01:32.409> in

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
kind of has a negative connotation in

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.700 
kind of has a negative connotation in
itself<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:34.479> because<00:01:35.049> if<00:01:35.290> it's<00:01:35.500> quick

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
itself right because if it's quick

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.219 
itself right because if it's quick
loading<00:01:36.070> then<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:36.880> think<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.270> it<00:01:37.360> as<00:01:37.509> as<00:01:37.810> soft

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
loading then you think of it as as soft

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.859 
loading then you think of it as as soft
and<00:01:38.590> maybe<00:01:38.830> not<00:01:39.130> powerful<00:01:39.549> enough<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.149> then

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
and maybe not powerful enough and then

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.510 
and maybe not powerful enough and then
at<00:01:41.020> long<00:01:41.200> distances<00:01:41.920> may<00:01:42.100> be<00:01:42.159> able<00:01:42.369> to

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
at long distances may be able to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.550 
at long distances may be able to
collapse<00:01:42.789> this<00:01:43.180> rod<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.450> not<00:01:43.720> solved<00:01:44.140> no

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
collapse this rod is not solved no

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.320 
collapse this rod is not solved no
that's<00:01:44.890> not<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.250> case<00:01:45.369> with<00:01:45.580> these<00:01:45.729> at<00:01:45.940> all<00:01:46.060> in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
that's not the case with these at all in

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.660 
that's not the case with these at all in
fact<00:01:46.509> they're<00:01:46.720> very<00:01:46.960> powerful<00:01:47.229> rods<00:01:47.799> but<00:01:48.520> they

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
fact they're very powerful rods but they

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.719 
fact they're very powerful rods but they
accommodate<00:01:49.420> quick<00:01:49.780> loading<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.729> quick

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
accommodate quick loading and quick

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.940 
accommodate quick loading and quick
presentations<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:52.690> it's<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.930> it's<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.380> neat

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
presentations so it's a it's a neat

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.889 
presentations so it's a it's a neat
combination<00:01:54.729> of<00:01:54.820> attributes<00:01:55.330> that<00:01:55.600> have<00:01:55.720> been

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
combination of attributes that have been

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.630 
combination of attributes that have been
brought<00:01:56.080> together<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:57.159> I<00:01:57.250> don't<00:01:57.429> think

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
brought together and I don't think

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.700 
brought together and I don't think
that's<00:01:57.789> been<00:01:58.000> available<00:01:58.600> widely<00:01:58.810> before<00:01:59.470> this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
that's been available widely before this

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.980 
that's been available widely before this
is<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.920> beautiful<00:02:00.369> rod<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:00.850> certainly<00:02:01.690> nothing

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
is a beautiful rod it certainly nothing

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.480 
is a beautiful rod it certainly nothing

rods and the thing that I know is so

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.650 
rods and the thing that I know is so
remarkable<00:03:10.770> about<00:03:10.890> them<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.730> well<00:03:12.030> feel<00:03:12.450> it

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
it's yeah a 3-piece rod the balance the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.430 
it's yeah a 3-piece rod the balance the
swing<00:03:17.610> weight<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.150> lightness

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
swing weight the lightness

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.260 
swing weight the lightness
this<00:03:19.980> might<00:03:20.190> be<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.400> lightest<00:03:20.760> man<00:03:20.940> we're<00:03:21.150> on

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
this might be the lightest man we're on

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.600 
this might be the lightest man we're on
I've<00:03:21.480> ever<00:03:21.630> built<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:23.160> think<00:03:23.490> the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
I've ever built and and I think the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.890 
I've ever built and and I think the
thing<00:03:23.820> that's<00:03:23.850> crazy<00:03:24.270> is<00:03:24.510> that

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
thing that's crazy is that

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.100 
thing that's crazy is that
you<00:03:25.290> know<00:03:25.380> forcing<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:26.010> two-piece<00:03:26.400> rod

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
you know forcing a two-piece rod

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.960 
you know forcing a two-piece rod
lightness<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.410> good<00:03:29.040> balance<00:03:29.490> is<00:03:29.670> something

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
lightness and good balance is something

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.290 
lightness and good balance is something
that<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.830> is<00:03:31.830> appreciated<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:32.820> not<00:03:33.090> unheard

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
that that is appreciated but not unheard

that that is appreciated but not unheard
of<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.440> previous<00:03:34.860> configuration<00:03:35.340> that's

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
of in a previous configuration that's

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.240 
of in a previous configuration that's
pretty<00:03:36.990> special<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.620> lot<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:37.920> guys<00:03:38.040> don't

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.890 
not a slow willowy rod this thing is
very<00:03:52.590> crisp<00:03:53.400> yeah<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.060> not<00:03:54.450> only<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.870> it

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
very crisp yeah and not only is it

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.810 
very crisp yeah and not only is it
hollow<00:03:55.290> built<00:03:55.620> it's<00:03:55.860> it's<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.310> triple<00:03:56.640> heat

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
hollow built it's it's a triple heat

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.810 
hollow built it's it's a triple heat
treated<00:03:57.240> okay<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:57.980> they're<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.310> clones<00:03:59.610> are

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
treated okay so they're the clones are

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.030 
treated okay so they're the clones are
flamed<00:04:00.150> before<00:04:00.660> their<00:04:00.810> split<00:04:01.140> then<00:04:01.770> they<00:04:01.890> get

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
flamed before their split then they get

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.430 
flamed before their split then they get
hand<00:04:02.370> split<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:02.970> rough<00:04:03.180> flames<00:04:03.540> they<00:04:04.170> get

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
hand split and rough flames they get

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.770 
hand split and rough flames they get
heat<00:04:04.830> treated<00:04:05.220> again<00:04:05.520> and<00:04:05.820> then<00:04:06.210> after<00:04:06.630> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
heat treated again and then after the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.540 
heat treated again and then after the
scripts<00:04:07.080> are<00:04:07.200> glued<00:04:07.530> they<00:04:07.800> get<00:04:08.010> heat<00:04:08.190> treated

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
scripts are glued they get heat treated

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.220 
scripts are glued they get heat treated
for<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.760> third<00:04:08.970> time<00:04:09.240> which<00:04:09.810> really<00:04:09.840> elevates

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
for a third time which really elevates

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.880 
for a third time which really elevates
the<00:04:10.890> modulus<00:04:11.460> of<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.880> of<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.420> cane<00:04:12.990> fiber<00:04:13.290> and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
the modulus of the of the cane fiber and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.800 
the modulus of the of the cane fiber and
that's<00:04:14.070> another<00:04:14.250> thing<00:04:14.490> that<00:04:14.550> Chris<00:04:15.030> recovery

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810
