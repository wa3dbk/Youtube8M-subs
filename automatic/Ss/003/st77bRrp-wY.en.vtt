00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
surprise that in the eighth minute he

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.429 
surprise that in the eighth minute he
did<00:00:27.090> actually<00:00:27.269> managed<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.779> score<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> first

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
goal and we were one kneel down and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.310 
goal and we were one kneel down and
unfortunately<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.030> went<00:00:33.420> worse

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
unfortunately it just it just went worse

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.130 
unfortunately it just it just went worse
from<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.600> was<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.960> about

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
from here really it was it was all about

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.229 
from here really it was it was all about
him<00:00:37.530> he<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> only<00:00:38.250> person<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.910> scored

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
him he was the only person that scored

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.569 
him he was the only person that scored
in<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.540> game<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.739> obviously<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.309> can

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
in this game and so obviously as you can

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
in this game and so obviously as you can
guess<00:00:41.790> by<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.300> did<00:00:42.480> actually<00:00:42.690> lose<00:00:42.899> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
guess by that we did actually lose this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.650 
guess by that we did actually lose this
but<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.309> go<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> 29th<00:00:45.210> minute<00:00:45.420> he

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
but here we go in the 29th minute he

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.119 
but here we go in the 29th minute he
does<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.050> managed<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> second

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
does actually managed to get a second

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.150 
does actually managed to get a second
goal<00:00:47.390> once<00:00:48.390> again<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.930> rubini<00:00:49.350> oh<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.800> he

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
goal once again with rubini oh and he

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
goal once again with rubini oh and he
does<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> strong<00:00:51.059> strong<00:00:51.270> team<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.230> was

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
does have a strong strong team and I was

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.080 
does have a strong strong team and I was
really<00:00:52.739> intimidated<00:00:53.219> by<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
really intimidated by it is that the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.090 
really intimidated by it is that the
centre-back<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.809> felipe<00:00:55.289> santana<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.980> i

hard<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.199> me<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> actually<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.920> through<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
hard for me to actually get through and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.920 
hard for me to actually get through and
score<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.730> those<00:00:59.910> defenders<00:01:00.390> compared<00:01:00.809> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
score with those defenders compared to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.900

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
90th minute again with Hulk and we do

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.340 
90th minute again with Hulk and we do
unfortunately<00:01:05.760> let<00:01:06.360> him<00:01:06.510> through<00:01:06.750> again<00:01:07.170> in

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
unfortunately let him through again in

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
unfortunately let him through again in
the<00:01:07.439> 90th<00:01:07.770> minute<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.880> girl<00:01:09.210> was

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the 90th minute and this this girl was

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.789 
the 90th minute and this this girl was
actually<00:01:09.630> quite<00:01:09.720> nice<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.290> way<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.590> pile

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
actually quite nice the way that pile

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
actually quite nice the way that pile
just<00:01:10.830> takes<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.490> volley<00:01:11.840> kind<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
just takes that volley kind of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
just takes that volley kind of
off-balance<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.950> suppose<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.610> then<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.299> thought

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
off-balance I suppose and then I thought

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.789 
off-balance I suppose and then I thought
that<00:01:15.630> was<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:16.020> quite<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> nice<00:01:16.320> goal<00:01:16.619> but

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that was actually quite a nice goal but

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.980 
that was actually quite a nice goal but
the<00:01:16.860> game<00:01:17.100> did<00:01:17.369> end<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.479> was<00:01:18.689> fall

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the game did end like that it was fall

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.120 
the game did end like that it was fall
nail<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> him<00:01:19.470> which<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:20.040> bit

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
nail to him which is a little bit

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310 
nail to him which is a little bit
embarrassing<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> did<00:01:21.540> decide<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:21.990> back

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320

is thomas's debut goal and that came in
the<00:03:12.430> 80th<00:03:12.849> minute<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.480> then<00:03:13.900> as<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.170> can<00:03:14.349> see

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
the 80th minute and then as you can see

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.460 
the 80th minute and then as you can see
in<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> 83rd<00:03:15.280> we<00:03:15.549> go<00:03:15.760> through<00:03:16.060> again<00:03:16.389> but<00:03:17.290> this

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
in the 83rd we go through again but this

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.960 
in the 83rd we go through again but this
guy<00:03:17.680> actually<00:03:17.889> squares<00:03:18.609> it<00:03:18.819> and

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
guy actually squares it and

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
unfortunately that is a goal for him and

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.420 
unfortunately that is a goal for him and
it<00:03:21.940> did<00:03:22.150> end<00:03:22.389> like<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:22.600> which<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.019> 62<00:03:23.859> so
