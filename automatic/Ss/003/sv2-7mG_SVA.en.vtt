00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.120
 That's how I like to play this while I actually have 3,000 pensions 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.990
 I'm using it like this I'm here to fight 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.349
 I fought to the bottom 11 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.259
 Oh, I feel that there is no water mass that can be gathered so much 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.409
 It is possible that the world of sns will be expanded 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:28.159
 Valentino thinks that it may be the first after land merger 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.230
 It was said that 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.280
 I feel a new attraction 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.280
 That up to here as that real problem 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 Possible with a pitcher 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.990
 At the time of the prime minister Fukuda prospects itself itself and is concerned within the year 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.260
 There is 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.010
 Beyond the next woman's take on the obsessive trend inherent in obesity 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.730
 I wonder if I came 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.410
 As strategy is raised so much that it is disliked, as a strategy 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.550
 Even if it is limited to establishment 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.550
 You have to match the start of monetization, right? 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.140
 So you should see a lot of first party in that grant type 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.980
 It must not have been 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.490
 For the purpose of the player 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.070
 A farmer who is cultivating chickens to suit their needs 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.700
 I feel that it will go, but will it arrive first 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.360
 Pre-space efficiency 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.730
 Please read in the bath of Nagareyama city like pulling a thread recently 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.550
 I think that it was the mainstream of everyone who repeated at 4 o'clock 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.790
 But the same four-man life four-wheel aluminum comes down 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.050
 Internationally speaking, in terms of recent talks 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.280
 That's in this narrow part of Japan 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.080
 To use in the morning conveniently 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.310
 ml22 needed 67 from this 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.750
 Now that's a good video clip, it's a good strategy 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.920
 I feel like I'm going to be more fragmented 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 14 people useful for the title 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.340

 Enter that reality 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.179
 Mr. Tanigaki is a vegetable TSE closing 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.979
 now 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.979
 Sales number is 47th 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.749
 eh 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.239
