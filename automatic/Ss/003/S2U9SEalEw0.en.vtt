00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello my name is Pasha you look 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.009
 geek satellite tv and today we are watching 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.859
 five minutes all you need 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.599
 know about the new iphone 5s and of course 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.599
 little we his opinion went 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.200
 as with previous iphone 5s models this 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.300
 just a change of models that already 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.700
 I was with us that year iphone 5 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 especially in the iphone 5 m differs little from 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.300
 the previous model, we will affect only those 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.850
 things that are really him new and 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.680
 interesting as you all know the letter s 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.210
 indicates that it is slightly modified 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.400
 iphone and as in previous cases 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.059
 here is faster processor better 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.190
 camera 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.870
 battery lasts longer more 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.150
 changes that if not radically 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.580
 make this phone to others they are you for sure 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.410
 make us more perfect and more 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.510
 functional also let's break up 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.420
 on the shelves then iphone finds dvan 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.789
 processor 1 is from 7 processor 110 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.219
 four bit architecture 1.3 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.840
 gigahertz which is for real 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.759
 allows new ios 7 work as 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.960
 It should work on the device but also 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.090
 additional processor to this 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 called m7 which besides 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.830
 among any of your movement he also 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.479
 supports necessary functions when 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.160
 you do not use the phone without 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.720
 waste that energy which would 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.179
 necessary in order to work 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.860
 axis processor and besides that processor 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.460
 m7 will save you a little 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.770
 batteries 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.689
 he will also be able to track you where you are 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.280
 you are and for the floor is very important 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.320
 because then this information is not 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.909
 will be able to sell stadium stores 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.799
 so that they know where you are most 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.479
 spend your time and when you are there 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.799
 find that they can send you 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.170
 this ad that interests you 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.549
 now for example like a discount on coffee when 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.409
 you pass by some cafe 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.759
 or for example new sneakers which 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.500
 just now appeared in the store 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.280
 who would have just passed in 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 mall 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.729
 but on the sly also probably help 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.710
 apple slowly improve their new 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.600
 cards collect all this information from 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 your phone is also one gigabyte 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.780
 But the size of the flash drives remained 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.670
 same 16 32 and 64 gigabytes except two 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.350
 to all of us already familiar colorings and it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.299
 black and white which is a little gray 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.399
 and silver also added now 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.530
 golden color and he immediately became the most 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.209
 popular as usual about and of course 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.250
 improved the frame as the front and 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.800
 the rear camera they also made myself 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.720
 sense he is a little more than that 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.980
 increased and rose by 2.2 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.360
 which means that now in the dark you 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.069
 you can receive photos which 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.069
 will be better than on iphone 5 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.689
 not even the camera also added two 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.909
 new functionalities that you do not 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.280
 find on previous iPhones this slow 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.909
 motion that is slow shooting 120 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.230
 frames per second with 720p quality and 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.359
 Bishma functionality that will allow 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.909
 you just hold the camera button 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.310
 take photos of 10 pieces per second and 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.349
 after that iphone must choose a chair 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.150
 a photo that he thinks is better 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.670
 all happened and you know that he 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.959
 will be able to choose where the person is smiling 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.569
 a photo that is better focused 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.230
 and try to predict more successful 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.329
 composition 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.280
 besides the camera the flash has also been changed 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.470
 now the flash is two different 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.329
 bulb 1 more cold colors that 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.129
 blue is another warmer color i.e. 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.650
 more orange analyze the situation 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.599
 iphone chooses how much to use 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.980
 each of the lamps and thus in 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.349
 try to give you as much as possible 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.060
 natural tone for your photo from 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.220
 my tests people are in the photos 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.290
 more natural they are such 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.269
 synovate and green as previous 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.859
 Most sensational models are probably the most 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.939
 a noticeable change that is on the new 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.159
 iphone 5s 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.900
 this tachadi functionality which 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.909
 It allows you to unlock your phone and 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.440
 also buy the app in the appstore 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.090
 just touches this button 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.409
 you can register multiple fingers 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.909
 which means and also you can 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.979
 register several people and 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.389
 give access even to whose family to 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.459
 your phone without you 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.500
 they all had to give out your password 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.440
 iPhone design has not changed 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.530
 from iphone 5 varying shades of colors 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.659
 and in this case i think iphone 5s 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.430
 suffered since apple did 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.870
 phones don't seem so to me 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.489
 elegant as they were before 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.650
 especially due to the fact that black 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.319
 phones they had to make a bezel 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.170
 light they are dark like he was 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.030
 and horses 5 to probably paint 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.069
 not as noticeable as it was with 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.389
 previous model and also i would have to 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.829
 circle button home 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.420
 metal rim and also 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.639
 say goodbye to the white box which 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.169
 so long was on all the buttons to 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.449
 the sensor could read your normal 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.940
 fingerprints something i think too 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.789
 made the phone mini elegant prices 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.340
 iphone 5s have not changed starts 600 49 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.050
 dollars to 800 49 dollars depends on 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.580
 of the model you choose from and from 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.949
 I can advise my experience with phones 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.750
 all who have no previous model to go 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.550
 and at least play the phone in order 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.169
 to decide whether you should change 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.419
 phone to new model and pay 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.190
 A lot of money if you are holding iphone 5 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.919
 I advise you to wait probably next 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.720
 models because not enough here 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.610
 things that I could 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.500
 advise you and probably even 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.120
 persuade yourself to go buy a new one 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.160
 phone and spend no take 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.020
 water in 9 million vehicles first 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.849
 the weekend I think it showed what not 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.410
 surely everything is thoroughly me for 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.190
 order to sell an unreal amount 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.470
 phones 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.060
 it was a review of iphone 5 with you was pasha 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.830
