00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:17.569
 measurements seen like this 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.679
 practices 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.400
 vietnam is difficult nothing 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 so far five people

 has explained that he has to carry the dead 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.710
 later it seems to me that it is urgent then for the most liquid assets after criticizing that 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.150
 so that everything returns to be as before 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.199
 but I know that there is no turning back 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.040
 the packs of tobacco 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040

 if the 1 2 hurricane 2 2% is not like them minor 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.660
 as a partner 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.670
 now that they need 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.030
 they resort to being like that 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.650
 but overall 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.100

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.730
 if they ask me to the first of current change 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.960
 maybe they are not as good as the world allows them to be 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.710
