00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
let's see if I can't get a pattern out

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.150 
let's see if I can't get a pattern out
of<00:00:44.809> these<00:00:50.379> as<00:00:51.379> long<00:00:51.530> as<00:00:51.679> you're<00:00:51.859> really

intruders<00:03:15.740> we're<00:03:16.740> already<00:03:16.920> quite<00:03:17.190> deep<00:03:17.580> in

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
intruders we're already quite deep in

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.960 
intruders we're already quite deep in
the<00:03:17.970> factory<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.920> think<00:03:19.920> if<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.220> jump<00:03:20.550> right<00:03:20.670> here

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
the factory I think if I jump right here

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.570 
the factory I think if I jump right here
I<00:03:21.000> made<00:03:21.300> Chartres<00:03:24.920> yeah<00:03:25.920> I'm<00:03:26.070> willing<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.400> bet

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
I made Chartres yeah I'm willing to bet

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.020 
I made Chartres yeah I'm willing to bet
if<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.760> jump<00:03:27.030> right<00:03:27.209> here<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.390> die<00:03:28.670> why<00:03:29.670> don't<00:03:29.940> you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
if I jump right here I die why don't you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.580 
if I jump right here I die why don't you
jump<00:03:30.269> straight<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:30.630> see<00:03:30.989> what<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.410> up

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
jump straight up see what that is up

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.310 
jump straight up see what that is up
there<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:32.040> think<00:03:33.030> that's<00:03:33.269> just<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.690> ceiling<00:03:34.170> I

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
there I think that's just the ceiling I

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.560 
there I think that's just the ceiling I
think<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.610> tentacle

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
think it's just this tentacle

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.150 
think it's just this tentacle
just<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.290> make<00:03:37.440> sure<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.920> don't<00:03:39.830> know<00:03:40.830> I

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
just to make sure that you don't know I

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.460 
just to make sure that you don't know I
was<00:03:41.940> clear<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.180> make<00:03:42.360> sure<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.720> Eric<00:03:43.230> doesn't

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
was clear to make sure that Eric doesn't

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.720 
was clear to make sure that Eric doesn't
try<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.800> jump<00:03:44.130> over<00:03:44.459> them

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
try to jump over them

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.170 
try to jump over them
maybe<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.470> gray<00:03:46.470> squares<00:03:46.980> have<00:03:47.370> problems

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
maybe the gray squares have problems

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:58.280 
maybe the gray squares have problems
with<00:03:55.160> no<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.459> made<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.910> truth<00:03:57.180> out<00:03:57.390> camera<00:03:57.780> it's

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
with no I made the truth out camera it's

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.380 
with no I made the truth out camera it's
much<00:03:58.590> easier<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.130> about<00:03:59.400> camera<00:03:59.820> oh<00:03:59.970> no<00:04:00.209> it's

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
much easier in about camera oh no it's

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.870 
much easier in about camera oh no it's
not<00:04:00.480> for<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.870> was<00:04:01.140> just

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
he's trying to find a simpler way just

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.990 
he's trying to find a simpler way just
in<00:04:09.700> case<00:04:10.530> if<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.680> found<00:04:11.920> one<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.280> do

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
last one oh that's a long delay on that

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.710 
last one oh that's a long delay on that
last<00:05:12.910> one<00:05:13.320> yeah<00:05:14.610> that's<00:05:15.610> why<00:05:15.790> I<00:05:15.820> just<00:05:16.090> ran<00:05:16.420> for

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
last one yeah that's why I just ran for

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.650 
last one yeah that's why I just ran for
it<00:05:16.920> well<00:05:17.920> so<00:05:18.460> what<00:05:18.640> I<00:05:18.670> can<00:05:18.910> do<00:05:19.060> is<00:05:19.360> wait<00:05:19.600> for

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
it well so what I can do is wait for

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.350 
it well so what I can do is wait for
when<00:05:19.990> these<00:05:20.110> first<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.740> go<00:05:21.010> and<00:05:21.490> that<00:05:22.000> third

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
when these first to go and that third

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.300 
when these first to go and that third
one<00:05:22.660> goes<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.410> I<00:05:23.500> should<00:05:23.710> be<00:05:23.830> able<00:05:23.890> to<00:05:24.040> get<00:05:24.160> to

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
one goes and I should be able to get to

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.120 
one goes and I should be able to get to
just<00:05:24.490> run<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:25.180> whole<00:05:25.240> way<00:05:25.330> through

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
just run the whole way through

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.370 
just run the whole way through
it's<00:05:27.130> at<00:05:27.280> least<00:05:27.370> four<00:05:28.000> seconds<00:05:28.750> with<00:05:29.020> all<00:05:29.230> that

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
it's at least four seconds with all that

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.960 
it's at least four seconds with all that
last<00:05:29.920> one<00:05:30.220> comes<00:05:30.490> now<00:05:32.400> so<00:05:33.400> it's<00:05:33.520> just<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.820> nice

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
last one comes now so it's just a nice

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.970 
last one comes now so it's just a nice
time<00:05:34.390> I've<00:05:34.630> managed<00:05:35.020> to<00:05:35.170> discover<00:05:35.410> string

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
time I've managed to discover string

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.710 
time I've managed to discover string
theory<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.580> I've<00:05:36.700> already<00:05:36.910> made<00:05:37.300> it<00:05:37.420> over<00:05:37.510> to

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
theory and I've already made it over to

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.870 
theory and I've already made it over to
Bobby<00:05:37.930> hock<00:05:38.170> I<00:05:40.920> folded<00:05:41.920> the<00:05:42.070> dimensions<00:05:42.610> and

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
Bobby hock I folded the dimensions and

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.560 
Bobby hock I folded the dimensions and
just<00:05:43.120> went<00:05:43.330> Boop<00:05:44.610> hey<00:05:45.610> volley<00:05:45.880> augment<00:05:46.330> what
