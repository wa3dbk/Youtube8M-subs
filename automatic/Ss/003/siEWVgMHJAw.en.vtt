00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.549 

now<00:00:13.429> we<00:00:13.490> have<00:00:13.879> what<00:00:14.450> we<00:00:14.570> call<00:00:14.750> the<00:00:14.929> altered

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
now we have what we call the altered

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.429 
now we have what we call the altered
chords<00:00:16.480> which<00:00:17.480> are<00:00:17.630> basically<00:00:18.050> all<00:00:18.289> the

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
chords which are basically all the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:19.630 
chords which are basically all the
chords<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:18.800> we<00:00:18.949> played<00:00:19.220> about<00:00:19.400> they're

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
chords that we played about they're

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.609 
chords that we played about they're
slightly<00:00:19.939> older<00:00:20.480> and<00:00:20.750> I'll<00:00:21.140> show<00:00:21.349> you<00:00:21.410> what<00:00:21.590> I

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
slightly older and I'll show you what I

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.089 
slightly older and I'll show you what I
mean<00:00:21.830> if<00:00:22.009> we<00:00:22.160> play<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:22.490> G<00:00:22.700> major<00:00:23.029> chord<00:00:24.009> if<00:00:25.009> we

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
mean if we play the G major chord if we

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.130 
mean if we play the G major chord if we
raise<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:25.460> fifth<00:00:25.939> chord<00:00:26.329> to<00:00:26.570> there<00:00:26.810> that

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
raise the fifth chord to there that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.470 
raise the fifth chord to there that
becomes<00:00:28.510> G<00:00:29.510> Augmented<00:00:30.380> fifth<00:00:30.619> or<00:00:31.400> g<00:00:31.699> plus<00:00:32.150> 5

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
becomes G Augmented fifth or g plus 5

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.579 
becomes G Augmented fifth or g plus 5
that<00:00:32.870> sometimes<00:00:33.620> called<00:00:33.949> or<00:00:34.100> just<00:00:34.430> simply<00:00:34.699> g<00:00:35.000> +

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
that sometimes called or just simply g +

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.660 
that sometimes called or just simply g +
and<00:00:36.589> that<00:00:36.769> there's<00:00:37.100> an<00:00:37.730> altered<00:00:38.089> chord<00:00:39.430> if<00:00:40.430> we

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
and that there's an altered chord if we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.549 
and that there's an altered chord if we
play<00:00:41.600> g7<00:00:42.500> which<00:00:42.650> was<00:00:43.629> g7<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:45.070> we<00:00:47.140> raise<00:00:48.140> the

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
play g7 which was g7 and we raise the

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.150 
play g7 which was g7 and we raise the
fifth<00:00:48.860> again<00:00:49.160> it's<00:00:49.340> called<00:00:50.350> g7<00:00:52.480> +<00:00:53.480> 5<00:00:53.930> or<00:00:54.320> g7<00:00:55.039> or

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
fifth again it's called g7 + 5 or g7 or

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.130 
fifth again it's called g7 + 5 or g7 or
bended<00:00:55.550> 15<00:00:57.129> let's<00:00:58.129> keep<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.579> chord<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.390> I'm

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
bended 15 let's keep that chord and I'm

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.529 
bended 15 let's keep that chord and I'm
going<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.350> move<00:01:00.500> my<00:01:00.710> fingers<00:01:01.070> at<00:01:01.219> it<00:01:01.539> thumb

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
going to move my fingers at it thumb

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.070 
going to move my fingers at it thumb
goes<00:01:02.750> on<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.440> can<00:01:03.590> finger<00:01:03.980> third<00:01:04.489> finger

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
goes on this you can finger third finger

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.660 
goes on this you can finger third finger
now<00:01:06.080> I'm<00:01:06.259> going<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:06.530> play<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:07.190> nicely<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.750> that's

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
now I'm going to play a nicely so that's

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.200 
now I'm going to play a nicely so that's
G<00:01:10.670> 9<00:01:11.440> or<00:01:12.440> wind<00:01:12.770> at<00:01:12.920> fifth<00:01:13.600> or<00:01:14.600> G<00:01:14.990> 9<00:01:15.259> +<00:01:15.619> 5<00:01:16.210> and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
G 9 or wind at fifth or G 9 + 5 and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:26.950 
G 9 or wind at fifth or G 9 + 5 and
another<00:01:18.110> altered<00:01:19.100> chord<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.490> G<00:01:21.310> 7<00:01:22.310> +<00:01:23.240> 5<00:01:23.600> +<00:01:24.080> 9<00:01:25.960> so

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
another altered chord is G 7 + 5 + 9 so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.800 
another altered chord is G 7 + 5 + 9 so
that's<00:01:27.400> third<00:01:28.400> base<00:01:28.430> -<00:01:29.390> v<00:01:29.689> +<00:01:30.380> 5<00:01:30.939> 7<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.509> then<00:01:32.659> the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
that's third base - v + 5 7 and then the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.910 
that's third base - v + 5 7 and then the
9th<00:01:33.020> has<00:01:33.200> moved<00:01:33.500> up<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.799> there<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:35.060> it's<00:01:35.240> G<00:01:35.689> 7<00:01:36.650> +

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
9th has moved up to there and it's G 7 +

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.510 
9th has moved up to there and it's G 7 +
5<00:01:36.950> +<00:01:37.400> 9<00:01:38.079> now<00:01:39.079> we<00:01:39.140> can<00:01:39.439> keep<00:01:39.650> wigan<00:01:40.009> altar<00:01:40.280> calls

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
5 + 9 now we can keep wigan altar calls

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.649 
5 + 9 now we can keep wigan altar calls
all<00:01:40.700> day<00:01:40.729> we<00:01:41.329> can<00:01:41.509> play<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:42.049> call<00:01:42.799> here<00:01:43.659> so
