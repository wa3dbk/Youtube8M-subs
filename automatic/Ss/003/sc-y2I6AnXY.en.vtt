to<00:01:33.369> be<00:01:33.549> a<00:01:33.579> different<00:01:33.939> variation<00:01:34.240> basically<00:01:34.960> to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
to be a different variation basically to

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.620 
to be a different variation basically to
the<00:01:35.259> AEF<00:01:35.950> our<00:01:36.130> baseline<00:01:36.520> weapon<00:01:36.999> but<00:01:37.390> I<00:01:37.450> did

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
the AEF our baseline weapon but I did

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.120 
the AEF our baseline weapon but I did
manage<00:01:37.719> to<00:01:37.960> find<00:01:38.170> some<00:01:38.350> high<00:01:38.530> resolution

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
manage to find some high resolution

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.099 
manage to find some high resolution
images<00:01:39.549> of<00:01:39.759> birth<00:01:39.999> for<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.179> weapons<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.049> if

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
images of birth for the weapons so if

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:42.870 
images of birth for the weapons so if
we're<00:01:41.229> going<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.409> go<00:01:41.469> into<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.859> AE<00:01:42.100> for<00:01:42.609> just

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
we're going to go into the AE for just

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.520 
we're going to go into the AE for just
the<00:01:42.969> baseline<00:01:43.299> weapon<00:01:43.659> first<00:01:43.899> now<00:01:44.320> one<00:01:44.499> thing

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
the baseline weapon first now one thing

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.929 
the baseline weapon first now one thing
that's<00:01:44.799> noticeable<00:01:45.159> straight<00:01:45.399> away<00:01:45.579> is<00:01:45.789> that

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
that's noticeable straight away is that

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.149 
that's noticeable straight away is that
the<00:01:46.030> laser<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.390> actually<00:01:46.749> visible<00:01:47.049> on<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:47.740> am1

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
the laser is actually visible on the am1

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.770 
the laser is actually visible on the am1
it's<00:01:48.460> not<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:48.819> just<00:01:48.850> looks<00:01:49.090> like<00:01:49.149> a<00:01:49.270> kind<00:01:49.600> of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
it's not it just looks like a kind of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.109 
it's not it just looks like a kind of
bulky<00:01:50.109> heavy<00:01:50.469> machine<00:01:51.039> gun<00:01:51.249> you<00:01:51.729> can't<00:01:51.939> really

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
bulky heavy machine gun you can't really

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.489 
bulky heavy machine gun you can't really
tell<00:01:52.299> what<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:52.569> is<00:01:52.600> but<00:01:52.719> it's<00:01:53.020> nice<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.200> on

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
tell what it is but it's nice that on

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:54.840 
tell what it is but it's nice that on
this<00:01:53.649> one<00:01:53.859> you<00:01:53.920> can<00:01:53.979> actually<00:01:54.189> see<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.640> orange

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
this one you can actually see the orange

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.239 
this one you can actually see the orange
laser<00:01:55.119> on<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.420> end<00:01:55.569> is<00:01:55.749> pretty<00:01:55.990> cool<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.409> also

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
laser on the end is pretty cool and also

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.889 
laser on the end is pretty cool and also
there's<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.609> yellow<00:01:57.789> volt<00:01:58.090> battery<00:01:58.420> as<00:01:58.539> well<00:01:58.689> as

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
there's a yellow volt battery as well as

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.749 
there's a yellow volt battery as well as
eighty-four<00:01:59.350> percent<00:01:59.530> now<00:02:00.219> I<00:02:00.249> imagine<00:02:00.640> that

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
eighty-four percent now I imagine that

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.459 
eighty-four percent now I imagine that
this<00:02:00.880> is<00:02:01.060> gonna<00:02:01.210> be<00:02:01.420> like<00:02:01.569> his<00:02:01.810> charge<00:02:02.109> time

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
this is gonna be like his charge time

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.050 
this is gonna be like his charge time
where<00:02:02.859> well<00:02:03.280> I<00:02:03.310> think<00:02:03.549> it's<00:02:03.700> going<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.880> go<00:02:03.939> to

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
where well I think it's going to go to

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.669 
where well I think it's going to go to
one<00:02:04.270> hundred<00:02:04.329> percent<00:02:04.539> but<00:02:05.049> if<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.289> just<00:02:05.499> look

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
one hundred percent but if you just look

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.430 
one hundred percent but if you just look
it's<00:02:05.920> very<00:02:05.979> small<00:02:06.490> he<00:02:06.700> says<00:02:06.909> 110<00:02:07.659> on<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.990> so

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
it's very small he says 110 on it so

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.389 
it's very small he says 110 on it so
don't<00:02:08.560> know<00:02:08.619> if<00:02:08.679> it's<00:02:08.770> going<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.950> go<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.130> one

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
don't know if it's going to go to one

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.800 
don't know if it's going to go to one
hundred<00:02:09.460> and<00:02:09.729> ten<00:02:09.880> percent<00:02:10.300> maybe<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.630> don't

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
hundred and ten percent maybe I don't

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.180 
hundred and ten percent maybe I don't
know<00:02:10.869> because<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.200> seems<00:02:11.410> on<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.620> graph<00:02:11.920> that

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
know because it seems on the graph that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.589 
know because it seems on the graph that
I<00:02:12.250> that's<00:02:12.550> what<00:02:12.730> it's<00:02:12.850> going<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.030> go<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.209> I

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
I that's what it's going to go to I

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.630 
I that's what it's going to go to I
don't<00:02:13.930> know<00:02:14.200> about<00:02:14.290> things<00:02:14.560> gonna<00:02:14.769> go<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.920> 110

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
don't know about things gonna go to 110

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.399 
don't know about things gonna go to 110
then<00:02:16.030> as<00:02:16.239> much<00:02:16.420> as<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.629> use<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.989> it's<00:02:17.170> going<00:02:17.349> to

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
then as much as you use it it's going to

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:17.690 
then as much as you use it it's going to
go

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
go

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.460 
go
down<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.970> zero<00:02:18.209> then<00:02:18.780> when<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.989> get<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> zero

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
down to zero then when you get to zero

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.530 
down to zero then when you get to zero
it<00:02:19.739> charges<00:02:20.129> all<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.310> way<00:02:20.430> back<00:02:20.580> up<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.970> 100<00:02:21.420> or

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
it charges all the way back up to 100 or

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.110 
it charges all the way back up to 100 or
110<00:02:22.110> again<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.590> bit<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.220> em1<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.819> it's<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
110 again a bit like the em1 and it's a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.610 
110 again a bit like the em1 and it's a
overheat<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.870> where<00:02:25.019> you<00:02:25.110> have<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.319> wait<00:02:25.470> till

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
overheat in where you have to wait till

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470 
overheat in where you have to wait till
it<00:02:25.709> cools<00:02:25.860> down<00:02:26.099> between<00:02:26.340> firing<00:02:26.910> now<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
it cools down between firing now the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.910 
it cools down between firing now the
other<00:02:27.569> thing<00:02:27.690> that's<00:02:27.810> interesting<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
other thing that's interesting is the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.530 
other thing that's interesting is the
actual<00:02:29.220> description<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:30.030> came<00:02:30.239> with<00:02:30.420> this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
actual description that came with this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.869 
actual description that came with this
weapon<00:02:30.780> now<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.560> i<00:02:31.650> read<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.980> says<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.310> 84

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
weapon now if i read it says the 84

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.089 
weapon now if i read it says the 84
combines<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.599> versatile<00:02:34.110> firing<00:02:34.560> mechanism

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
combines a versatile firing mechanism

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.710 
combines a versatile firing mechanism
with<00:02:35.310> an<00:02:35.400> all-around<00:02:35.760> movement<00:02:36.239> speed<00:02:36.510> and

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
with an all-around movement speed and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.600 
with an all-around movement speed and
handling<00:02:37.110> now<00:02:37.620> our<00:02:37.739> versatile<00:02:38.160> firing

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
handling now our versatile firing

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.309 
handling now our versatile firing
mechanism<00:02:39.120> something<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:39.630> versatile<00:02:40.110> to

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
mechanism something that's versatile to

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.900 
mechanism something that's versatile to
me<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.530> something<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:41.040> can<00:02:41.250> adapt<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
me is something that can adapt and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.570 
me is something that can adapt and
change<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:43.050> i'm<00:02:43.140> thinking<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.739> movies<00:02:44.370> it's

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
change so i'm thinking that movies it's

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.220 
change so i'm thinking that movies it's
going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.819> like<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.540> can<00:02:45.690> change<00:02:45.930> bursts

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
going to be like you can change bursts

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.589 
going to be like you can change bursts
from<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.549> more<00:02:47.849> like<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> three

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
from it like a one be more like a three

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.630 
from it like a one be more like a three
bursts<00:02:48.900> beam<00:02:49.230> or<00:02:49.500> something<00:02:49.950> don't<00:02:50.549> know

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
bursts beam or something don't know

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.130 
bursts beam or something don't know
something<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:51.390> about<00:02:51.540> because<00:02:51.780> that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
something to think about because that

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140 
something to think about because that
versatile<00:02:52.950> throwing<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.580> there<00:02:53.790> change

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
versatile throwing that in there change

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.729 
versatile throwing that in there change
it<00:02:54.299> up<00:02:54.420> from<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:54.780> being<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.230> normal

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
it up from just being like a normal

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.220 
it up from just being like a normal
automatic<00:02:56.489> or<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> normal<00:02:56.910> laser<00:02:57.269> it<00:02:58.019> just

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
automatic or a normal laser it just

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.780 
automatic or a normal laser it just
throws<00:02:58.470> something<00:02:58.680> else<00:02:58.950> into<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> mix<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.670> be

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
throws something else into the mix it be

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.979 
throws something else into the mix it be
interesting<00:03:00.239> if<00:03:00.299> there's<00:03:00.569> going<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.750> be<00:03:00.780> like

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
interesting if there's going to be like

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.410 
interesting if there's going to be like
different<00:03:01.470> famous<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.310> or<00:03:02.730> maybe<00:03:03.209> you

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
different famous for it or maybe you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.970 
different famous for it or maybe you
could<00:03:03.569> change<00:03:03.750> like<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.140> laser<00:03:04.349> whiff<00:03:04.650> it's

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
could change like the laser whiff it's

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.710 
could change like the laser whiff it's
offical<00:03:05.310> lasered<00:03:05.819> are<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.299> really

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
offical lasered are going to be really

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.690 
offical lasered are going to be really
good<00:03:06.750> at<00:03:06.959> close<00:03:07.230> if<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:07.920> thin<00:03:08.160> laser<00:03:08.400> than

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
good at close if it's thin laser than

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.729 
good at close if it's thin laser than
you<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:09.030> maybe<00:03:09.840> hit<00:03:10.049> people<00:03:10.349> from<00:03:10.530> further

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
you can maybe hit people from further

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.740 
you can maybe hit people from further
away<00:03:10.950> better<00:03:11.280> it's<00:03:11.489> better<00:03:11.549> range<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.329> don't

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
away better it's better range I don't

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.910 
away better it's better range I don't
know<00:03:12.810> let<00:03:12.959> me<00:03:13.019> know<00:03:13.110> in<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.230> comments<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:13.769> you

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
know let me know in the comments if you

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.770 
know let me know in the comments if you
have<00:03:13.950> any<00:03:14.250> ideas<00:03:14.579> what<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.910> could<00:03:15.060> be<00:03:15.120> so

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
have any ideas what that could be so

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.240 
have any ideas what that could be so
also<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.290> weapon<00:03:16.620> looks<00:03:16.799> like<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.130> has<00:03:17.220> some

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
also this weapon looks like it has some

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.130 
also this weapon looks like it has some
kind<00:03:17.579> of<00:03:17.790> attachment<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.480> top<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:18.989> I'm

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
kind of attachment on top so I'm

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.960 
kind of attachment on top so I'm
guessing<00:03:19.380> like<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.890> em1<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.549> has<00:03:20.700> its<00:03:20.849> own

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
guessing like the em1 this has its own

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.789 
guessing like the em1 this has its own
like<00:03:21.209> red<00:03:21.420> dot<00:03:21.599> sight<00:03:21.870> which<00:03:22.139> if<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:22.530> true

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
like red dot sight which if it's true

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.259 
like red dot sight which if it's true
then<00:03:22.829> that's<00:03:23.160> sort<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.700> nice<00:03:23.790> addition<00:03:24.090> to

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
then that's sort of a nice addition to

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.750 
then that's sort of a nice addition to
this<00:03:24.450> weapon<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.230> that's<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.500> 84<00:03:26.069> base<00:03:26.310> design

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
this weapon so that's the 84 base design

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.190 
this weapon so that's the 84 base design
and<00:03:27.030> now<00:03:27.150> let's<00:03:27.359> look<00:03:27.480> at<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.720> Widowmaker

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
and now let's look at the Widowmaker

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.050 
and now let's look at the Widowmaker
variation<00:03:28.889> so<00:03:29.430> they<00:03:29.549> didn't<00:03:29.790> give<00:03:29.910> much

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
variation so they didn't give much

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.670 
variation so they didn't give much
information<00:03:30.600> for<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.810> Widowmaker<00:03:31.290> basically

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
information for the Widowmaker basically

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.020 
information for the Widowmaker basically
they<00:03:31.769> just<00:03:31.799> says<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.370> addition<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.910> base

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
they just says in addition to the base

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.509 
they just says in addition to the base
weapon<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.720> e4<00:03:34.200> Widowmaker<00:03:34.799> custom<00:03:35.160> variant

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
weapon the e4 Widowmaker custom variant

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.220 
weapon the e4 Widowmaker custom variant
will<00:03:35.639> also<00:03:35.880> be<00:03:35.970> included<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.959> that's<00:03:37.079> not

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
will also be included so that's not

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.020 
will also be included so that's not
really<00:03:37.470> much<00:03:37.590> information<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.340> how<00:03:38.549> different

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
really much information on how different

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.729 
really much information on how different
the<00:03:39.090> Widowmaker<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.720> from<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.200> base<00:03:40.350> weapon

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
the Widowmaker is from the base weapon

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.530 
the Widowmaker is from the base weapon
but<00:03:41.190> if<00:03:41.340> we<00:03:41.459> look<00:03:41.489> at<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.850> design<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.239> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
but if we look at the design of the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.289 
but if we look at the design of the
Widowmaker<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.380> combine<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.100> with<00:03:44.340> how<00:03:44.910> past

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
Widowmaker and combine it with how past

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.050 
Widowmaker and combine it with how past
college<00:03:45.690> ue<00:03:45.870> DLC<00:03:46.440> weapons<00:03:46.829> have<00:03:47.040> acted<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.609> we

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
college ue DLC weapons have acted and we

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.729 
college ue DLC weapons have acted and we
can<00:03:48.209> kind<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.690> get<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> gist<00:03:49.230> on<00:03:49.470> how<00:03:49.590> this

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
can kind of get a gist on how this

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.949 
can kind of get a gist on how this
Widowmaker<00:03:50.069> is<00:03:50.430> going<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.700> act<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.660> looking<00:03:51.870> at

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
Widowmaker is going to act so looking at

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.720 
Widowmaker is going to act so looking at
past<00:03:52.109> college<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.799> in<00:03:52.980> black<00:03:53.160> ops<00:03:53.340> 2<00:03:53.459> the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
past college you is in black ops 2 the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.699 
past college you is in black ops 2 the
Peacekeeper<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.600> kind<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.109> an<00:03:55.350> SMG

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
Peacekeeper is kind of like an SMG

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.740 
Peacekeeper is kind of like an SMG
assault<00:03:56.310> rifle<00:03:56.670> hybrid<00:03:56.850> where<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:57.389> did<00:03:57.540> birth

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
assault rifle hybrid where it did birth

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.440 
assault rifle hybrid where it did birth
into<00:03:58.200> one<00:03:58.650> weapon<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.280> then<00:03:59.850> girls<00:04:00.090> we<00:04:00.359> add

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
into one weapon and then girls we add

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.599 
into one weapon and then girls we add
the<00:04:00.569> Ripper<00:04:00.870> which<00:04:01.200> was<00:04:01.470> an<00:04:01.680> SMG<00:04:02.010> but<00:04:02.400> then<00:04:02.519> you

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
the Ripper which was an SMG but then you

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.039 
the Ripper which was an SMG but then you
could<00:04:02.819> switch<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.209> a<00:04:03.269> mode<00:04:03.510> which<00:04:03.690> bro<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
could switch to a mode which bro the

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.720 
could switch to a mode which bro the
reticle<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:04.709> got<00:04:04.950> for<00:04:05.099> those<00:04:05.220> long<00:04:05.459> range

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
reticle so you got for those long range

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.640 
reticle so you got for those long range
kills<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:06.630> if<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.780> notice<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.319> always<00:04:07.530> like

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
kills so if you notice they always like

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.780 
kills so if you notice they always like
to<00:04:07.739> bring<00:04:07.889> something<00:04:08.280> up<00:04:08.400> that's<00:04:08.489> going<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.730> be

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
to bring something up that's going to be

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.819 
to bring something up that's going to be
SMG<00:04:09.269> something<00:04:09.780> assault<00:04:10.079> rifle<00:04:10.470> wherever<00:04:10.709> to

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
SMG something assault rifle wherever to

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.770 
SMG something assault rifle wherever to
put<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.040> into<00:04:11.280> one<00:04:11.489> gun<00:04:11.730> or<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.060> mick<00:04:12.420> like<00:04:12.660> an

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
put it into one gun or the mick like an

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.150 
put it into one gun or the mick like an
option<00:04:13.049> where<00:04:13.170> you<00:04:13.200> can<00:04:13.290> switch<00:04:13.530> between<00:04:13.709> them

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
option where you can switch between them

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.409 
option where you can switch between them
but<00:04:14.430> in<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.700> case<00:04:14.970> they've<00:04:15.299> actually

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
but in this case they've actually

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.629 
but in this case they've actually
brought<00:04:15.780> two<00:04:16.019> weapons<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:16.829> if<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.070> AE<00:04:17.280> base

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
brought two weapons so if the AE base

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.729 
brought two weapons so if the AE base
design<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.359> assault<00:04:18.630> rifle<00:04:19.049> then<00:04:19.530> this

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
design is the assault rifle then this

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.009 
design is the assault rifle then this
Widowmaker<00:04:20.130> has<00:04:20.549> got<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.849> be<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.090> SMG<00:04:21.539> variant

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
Widowmaker has got to be the SMG variant

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.020 
Widowmaker has got to be the SMG variant
now<00:04:22.410> this<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:23.010> complete<00:04:23.400> guess<00:04:23.669> but

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
now this is just a complete guess but

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.610 
now this is just a complete guess but
one<00:04:24.300> thing<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.510> kind<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.110> gives<00:04:25.289> it<00:04:25.410> ways

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
one thing that kind of gives it ways

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.890 
one thing that kind of gives it ways
that<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.010> AE<00:04:26.190> fall<00:04:26.580> based<00:04:26.880> design<00:04:27.270> has<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.659> red

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
that the AE fall based design has a red

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.570 
that the AE fall based design has a red
dot<00:04:28.080> attachment<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.800> Widowmaker<00:04:29.340> does

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
dot attachment and the Widowmaker does

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.890 
dot attachment and the Widowmaker does
not<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.120> kind<00:04:30.390> of<00:04:30.450> assoc

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
not so you kind of assoc

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.600 
not so you kind of assoc
red<00:04:31.110> dot<00:04:31.290> sight<00:04:31.560> always<00:04:31.919> helping<00:04:32.250> your<00:04:32.370> long

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
red dot sight always helping your long

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.010 
red dot sight always helping your long
range<00:04:32.850> gunfights<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.600> that's<00:04:33.810> why<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:33.990> think

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
range gunfights so that's why I think

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.140 
range gunfights so that's why I think
that<00:04:34.259> they<00:04:34.470> a<00:04:34.500> far<00:04:35.100> based<00:04:35.280> design<00:04:35.669> is<00:04:35.880> more<00:04:36.090> of

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
that they a far based design is more of

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.879 
that they a far based design is more of
an<00:04:36.240> assault<00:04:36.449> rifle<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:37.199> also<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.740> other

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
an assault rifle and also the other

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.740 
an assault rifle and also the other
difference<00:04:38.040> is<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.910> Widowmaker<00:04:39.479> has<00:04:39.720> a

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
difference is that the Widowmaker has a

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.240 
difference is that the Widowmaker has a
blue<00:04:40.169> laser<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.650> don't<00:04:40.830> know<00:04:40.889> if<00:04:40.949> that's<00:04:41.100> any

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
blue laser I don't know if that's any

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.010 
blue laser I don't know if that's any
difference<00:04:41.669> on<00:04:41.850> fire<00:04:42.090> ray<00:04:42.389> or<00:04:42.630> if<00:04:42.870> your

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
difference on fire ray or if your

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.840 
difference on fire ray or if your
fighters<00:04:43.320> like<00:04:43.470> plasma<00:04:43.710> balls<00:04:44.100> or<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.490> finds<00:04:44.759> a

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
fighters like plasma balls or it finds a

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.700 
fighters like plasma balls or it finds a
laser<00:04:45.060> beam<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.570> think<00:04:45.780> if<00:04:45.870> all<00:04:46.020> three<00:04:46.199> guns<00:04:46.530> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
laser beam I think if all three guns the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.080 
laser beam I think if all three guns the
five<00:04:46.889> like<00:04:47.130> different<00:04:47.400> kind<00:04:47.580> of<00:04:47.699> lasers

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
five like different kind of lasers

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.430 
five like different kind of lasers
that'll<00:04:48.330> be<00:04:48.419> good<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.780> otherwise<00:04:49.080> is<00:04:49.289> just

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
that'll be good and otherwise is just

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.200 
that'll be good and otherwise is just
gonna<00:04:49.560> be<00:04:49.650> like<00:04:49.919> Liz<00:04:50.310> everywhere<00:04:50.940> it's<00:04:51.090> gonna

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
gonna be like Liz everywhere it's gonna

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.939 
gonna be like Liz everywhere it's gonna
like<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.360> dumb<00:04:51.539> disco<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.560> also<00:04:52.830> the

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
like a dumb disco and also the

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.439 
like a dumb disco and also the
Widowmaker<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.490> like<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.669> little<00:04:53.940> skull<00:04:54.300> and

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
Widowmaker is like a little skull and

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:55.999 
Widowmaker is like a little skull and
crossbones<00:04:55.020> thing<00:04:55.199> on<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:55.380> back<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.770> and

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
crossbones thing on the back of it and

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.740 
crossbones thing on the back of it and
the<00:04:56.160> design<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.759> as<00:04:56.850> well<00:04:57.000> looks<00:04:57.240> kind<00:04:57.570> of

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
the design of it as well looks kind of

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.810 
the design of it as well looks kind of
grungy<00:04:58.020> as<00:04:58.500> like<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.860> lot<00:04:59.070> of<00:04:59.130> wisps<00:04:59.430> on<00:04:59.580> it<00:04:59.699> and

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
grungy as like a lot of wisps on it and

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.310 
grungy as like a lot of wisps on it and
stuff<00:04:59.910> which<00:05:00.180> makes<00:05:00.389> me<00:05:00.509> think<00:05:00.539> that<00:05:00.780> is<00:05:01.020> more

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
stuff which makes me think that is more

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.020 
stuff which makes me think that is more
of<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.530> gun<00:05:01.710> built<00:05:01.949> for<00:05:02.100> speed<00:05:02.190> but<00:05:02.370> yeah<00:05:02.759> and<00:05:02.940> be

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
of a gun built for speed but yeah and be

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.400 
of a gun built for speed but yeah and be
interesting<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.750> see<00:05:03.870> what<00:05:03.960> these<00:05:04.080> guns<00:05:04.320> are

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
interesting to see what these guns are

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.140 
interesting to see what these guns are
going<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.650> be<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:04.830> but<00:05:05.490> anyway<00:05:05.789> guys<00:05:05.910> are

users about a month after so i imagine

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.860 
users about a month after so i imagine
around<00:05:17.639> january<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.180> 11th<00:05:18.510> it's<00:05:18.780> not

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
around january the 11th it's not

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.480 
around january the 11th it's not
confirmed<00:05:19.289> yet<00:05:19.500> but<00:05:19.650> that's<00:05:19.889> when<00:05:20.100> I<00:05:20.130> imagine

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
confirmed yet but that's when I imagine

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.800 
confirmed yet but that's when I imagine
they'll<00:05:20.639> be<00:05:20.729> released<00:05:21.030> but<00:05:21.539> in<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.690> last

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
they'll be released but in the last

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.450 
they'll be released but in the last
video<00:05:21.990> guys<00:05:22.380> they<00:05:22.620> really<00:05:22.860> hurt<00:05:22.979> you<00:05:23.130> enjoyed

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
video guys they really hurt you enjoyed

video guys they really hurt you enjoyed
it<00:05:23.580> let<00:05:23.699> me<00:05:23.789> know<00:05:23.880> what<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.120> thought<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.449> the

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
it let me know what you thought to the

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.210 
it let me know what you thought to the
video<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.050> these<00:05:25.260> guns<00:05:25.530> am<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:25.979> think<00:05:26.130> they're

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
video and these guns am I think they're

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.770 
video and these guns am I think they're
gonna<00:05:26.280> be<00:05:26.430> pretty<00:05:26.580> good<00:05:26.849> I<00:05:27.060> believe<00:05:27.510> that<00:05:27.690> the

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
gonna be pretty good I believe that the

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.300 
gonna be pretty good I believe that the
E<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:27.990> one<00:05:28.229> is<00:05:28.349> actually<00:05:28.620> getting<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.919> buh<00:05:29.099> I

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
E and one is actually getting a buh I

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.350 
E and one is actually getting a buh I
think<00:05:29.520> today<00:05:29.639> as<00:05:29.880> I'm<00:05:30.030> making<00:05:30.300> this

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
think today as I'm making this
