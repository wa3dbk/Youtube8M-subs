00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
before I personally think they should

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.129 
before I personally think they should
make<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.549> charge<00:03:20.819> for<00:03:20.909> PS<00:03:21.269> free<00:03:21.540> life<00:03:21.810> maybe

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
make you charge for PS free life maybe

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.719 
make you charge for PS free life maybe
