00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.230
 new issue of let's talk about films in 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.850
 where you two visionaries Alex and I 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.490
 we talk about the movies that are 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.930
 in billboards new and not so new in 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.930
 this time we will talk about 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.710
 godzilla 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.550
 it's going to sell ugt 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.550
 and do not repeat 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
 happening 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.690
 well I am I garcia de cinema tv and in 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.180
 this time I will be replacing 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.129
 alex herrera then we had a problem of 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.360
 copyright with your image since it looks like 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.870
 A lot of trek were being charged 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.330
 good royalties then let's start with this 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.890
 review and criticism as it was a while ago 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.110
 I found out they were going to get another 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.300
 godzilla movie as if you do not 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.890
 will suffice with the previous 28 for 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.990
 when I found out about this I did not know very 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.400
 well that was a reboot and a reboot of 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.400
 fact I was very happy with the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.860
 1998 film adaptation 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.899
 American movie that many do not 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.850
 they liked it so I took on the task of 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.800
 watch the predecessor movies of 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.410
 godzilla as godzilla 2000 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.200
 godzilla versus gomora mozilla against 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.270
 mecca godzilla and godzilla versus de 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.759
 story that I think was the most epic 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.920
 good to me really liked me the most 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.840
 important I saw the best ideas and it was 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.810
 there when I opened my eyes and said 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.429
 1998 movie is disgusting and I want to 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.039
 see this so famous reboot that 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.990
 everyone speaks or yes and that's how it was 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.250
 well let's talk about the actors as 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.220
 most lucila's movies 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.560
 always add secondary stories 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.690
 in which we see the point of view of 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.970
 the people how to try to deal 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.550
 with this giant change for those who do not 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.170
 they come for schiffrin can you mean 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.300
 giant monster in fact that also 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.310
 they make a bit of reference to that to that 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.530
 name was not invented already existed 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.030
 returning to the above those stories 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.090
 We always try to secondary 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.520
 show how they try to defeat this 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.960
 giant monster and in this movie there 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.480
 it was the exception in this movie 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.580
 we have the brody family the father is 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.380
 played by Bryan Cranston who is 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.180
 a scientist who discovers that something very 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.130
 big is about to pass through 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.930
 from the study of tsunamis the mother of 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.840
 well done giles played by Sandra 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.550
 brought and the son is for brody who is a 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.220
 Marin specialized in deactivation 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.290
 of bombs and that coincidentally during the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.670
 where godzilla movie is going 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.030
 to pass 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.130
 this also have to Ken Watanabe that 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.770
 he plays ichiro seri sawa ohno who 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.450
 is a researcher who knows the 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.040
 origins of godzilla and the enemies of 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.950
 this new cast we also have the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.110
 beautiful elisabeth osl et that is not not 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.180
 one of the twins is sister of the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.280
 twins some performances are more 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.930
 believable that others but let's not forget that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.730
 our protagonist is our great 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.370
 friend godzilla although I would have liked 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.180
 more I see on the screen of him and Bryan 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.709
 cranston 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.600
 well then let's talk about the effects 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.489
 special special effects are 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.890
 very good indeed I really like your 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.569
 photography and the physics that they handle me 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.970
 I mean the effect of water on 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.370
 lighting and the destructive amount 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.980
 that these trucks generate when fighting 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.049
 in the city the glasses the buildings 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.209
 collapsed everything is very well integrated 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.890
 and the 3d has a very good depth 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.810
 achieved and no effects were told 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.400
 sound are incredible 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.250
 well let's talk now about music 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.959
 the music was composed by alexander of 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.850
 exploded that he was a composer of the band 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.310
 sound of harry potter and the relics 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.510
 of death 'and of the arch film to 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.080
 this music makes you 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.439
 style or a fellow patriot 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.239
 style of 1945 and it's very good because of 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.920
 done at the beginning of the movie I already 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.269
 I was stuck I feel with only 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.129
 listen to this music and well then 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.870
 let's conclude with this the movie is something 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.390
 slow and we almost do not see our friend 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.730
 godzilla if it comes out we see it from behind in 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.349
 the cover-style background the 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.690
 story of the characters I think it 's 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.849
 it is very focused because it leaves aside 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.060
 our star change but despite 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.220
 that exceeds its predecessor adaptation 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.019
 American and we did not know if it was 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.880
 'jurassic park' or the day of the 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.620
 independence in this reboot we 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.630
 we go deeper into the possible origin of 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.850
 godzilla because we did not know about the others 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.590
 well where did it come from I loved it so much that 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.690
 put so many references to 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.240
 previous films as movements 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.280
 skills and even enemies and about 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.380
 I liked that Godzilla did it 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.240
 love like the burial that is to save 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.970
 the citizens of a danger without 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.250
 matter what collapses half city a 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.740
 nuclear plant and kill thousands and thousands 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.169
 of people and that is not spoiler in the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.960
 other movies to godzilla he was seen from 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.270
 this way something that I did not like much 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.190
 that the protagonists are right in the 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.940
 moment when something is going to happen and that 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.110
 it's something very patriotic you know the 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.940
 army that wants to destroy all 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.099
 coast to the enemy without caring 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.870
 people who are there and the hero 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.690
 courageous that has faith and that is going to 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.270
 rescue from this great danger typical of 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.340
 hollywood cinema but me and well 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.500
 this time I want to give you two 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.449
 qualifications now as a fan of gotz and 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.880
 and another as a film critic like 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.280
 critic and film viewer I would give 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.930
 a 75 for everything I already told you 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.820
 previously as they were and lover of 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.580
 the godzilla movies I would give him a 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.740
 9 because they respected the main essence 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.370
 of our character was like seeing a 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.500
 godzilla of 1954 but with effects of 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.630
 2014 although I would have liked that 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.610
 godzilla to destroy Japan I do not have 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.199
 nothing against the Japanese or against this 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.030
 city but they did respect the origins 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.270
 of oxy I think it would have destroyed 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.440
 Japan they believe in the end this movie 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.449
 loved it was great 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.979
 I was amazed with her maybe 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.250
 because I lived it in the maximum experience 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.020
 to see it in 3d time access that by 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.800
 true if you have the opportunity to see it 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.440
 in this format 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.250
 Believe me you will not regret the sound 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.289
 the 3 of the whole room good if I would give 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.680
 a 9 as a fan I think I still have a soul 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.210
