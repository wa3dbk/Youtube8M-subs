00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
until it is just perfectly flat this

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.640 
until it is just perfectly flat this
takes<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.130> long<00:01:17.340> time<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:18.020> honestly<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.229> lot<00:01:19.500> of

perfectly against the table close is not
good<00:01:30.420> enough<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:31.259> want<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.460> be

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
good enough we want this to be

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.960 
good enough we want this to be
absolutely<00:01:33.990> perfect<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.280> each<00:01:35.579> one

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
absolutely perfect and we do each one

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.480 
absolutely perfect and we do each one
like<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.290> once<00:01:37.290> we've<00:01:37.500> got<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> table<00:01:38.310> nice

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
like that once we've got the table nice

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.289 
like that once we've got the table nice
and<00:01:38.759> flat<00:01:38.970> then<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:41.070> want<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> measure<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and flat then we want to measure the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.450 
and flat then we want to measure the
facing<00:01:42.840> curve<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
facing curve now this is kind of a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.139 
facing curve now this is kind of a
complicated<00:01:44.880> proceeding<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:46.409> use<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:47.149> glass

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
complicated proceeding we use a glass

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.380 
complicated proceeding we use a glass
mouthpiece<00:01:48.960> gage<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.490> set<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> feelers

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
mouthpiece gage and a set of feelers

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.770 
mouthpiece gage and a set of feelers
these<00:01:52.380> are<00:01:52.590> feelers<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.549> used<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.540> use

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
these are feelers like you used to use

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.800 
these are feelers like you used to use
to<00:01:54.810> set<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> points<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.250> our<00:01:56.280> automobile<00:01:56.939> we

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to set the points on our automobile we

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.480 
to set the points on our automobile we
drop<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> feeler<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.540> see<00:02:00.740> our<00:02:01.740> things<00:02:02.219> as

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
drop the feeler in and see our things as

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.310 
drop the feeler in and see our things as
they<00:02:02.700> should<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.119> well<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.990> needs<00:02:04.200> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
they should be well this one needs a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.350 
they should be well this one needs a
little<00:02:04.469> adjustment<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.700> little<00:02:05.939> bit<00:02:06.090> high

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
little adjustment it's a little bit high

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.870 
little adjustment it's a little bit high
on<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.899> side<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.619> we'll<00:02:08.550> get

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
on that side so we'll get

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.300 
on that side so we'll get
here<00:02:09.530> with<00:02:10.530> our<00:02:11.370> file<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.710> not<00:02:13.710> those<00:02:14.040> high

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
here with our file and not those high

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.230 
here with our file and not those high
spots<00:02:14.760> down<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.410> little<00:02:16.440> bit<00:02:16.890> it's<00:02:17.640> really

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
spots down just a little bit it's really

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.390 
spots down just a little bit it's really
hard<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.840> learn<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.290> make<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.650> cuts<00:02:20.010> just

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
hard to learn to make the cuts just

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.880 
hard to learn to make the cuts just
right<00:02:22.190> then<00:02:23.480> we'll<00:02:24.480> measure<00:02:24.750> again<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:27.890> by

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
right then we'll measure again and by

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.040 
right then we'll measure again and by
the<00:02:28.950> way<00:02:29.160> we<00:02:29.430> measure<00:02:29.670> eight<00:02:30.450> different

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
the way we measure eight different

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.270 
the way we measure eight different
points<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.680> every<00:02:32.310> mouthpiece<00:02:33.740> that<00:02:34.740> boy<00:02:34.980> in

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
points on every mouthpiece that boy in

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.840 
points on every mouthpiece that boy in
there<00:02:35.690> there<00:02:36.690> we<00:02:36.870> go<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.890> look<00:02:38.100> at<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.370> it's

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
there there we go and look at that it's

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.080 
there there we go and look at that it's
all<00:02:39.000> squared<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.630> but<00:02:40.730> surfaces<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> little

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
all squared up but surfaces a little

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.010 
all squared up but surfaces a little
look<00:02:42.360> rough

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
look rough

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.660 
look rough
so<00:02:43.500> we'll<00:02:44.070> lap<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:46.200> paper<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:47.490> get<00:02:47.610> a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
so we'll lap it on the paper to get a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.200 
so we'll lap it on the paper to get a
nice<00:02:48.000> perfectly<00:02:48.870> smooth<00:02:49.230> finish<00:02:49.770> now<00:02:50.520> that's

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
nice perfectly smooth finish now that's

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.780 
nice perfectly smooth finish now that's
not<00:02:51.480> quite<00:02:51.780> enough<00:02:52.110> we<00:02:52.830> got<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.160> make<00:02:53.280> sure<00:02:53.550> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
not quite enough we got to make sure the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.350 
not quite enough we got to make sure the
tip<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.660> way<00:02:54.810> we<00:02:55.050> want<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:56.070> be<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:57.060> it's

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
tip is the way we want it to be so it's

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.520 
tip is the way we want it to be so it's
nice<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.780> even

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
nice and even

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.590 
nice and even
so<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.340> first<00:02:59.580> thing<00:02:59.790> I'm<00:02:59.910> going<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.180> do<00:03:00.360> is

so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.990> take<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.350> tip<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.430> going

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
I'm going to take the tip and I'm going

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.820 
I'm going to take the tip and I'm going
to<00:03:02.640> press<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.510> little<00:03:03.750> bit<00:03:03.960> on<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
to press it just a little bit on the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.460 
to press it just a little bit on the
paper<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.520> can<00:03:05.700> see<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.510> left<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.020> mark<00:03:07.050> at

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
paper and you can see it left a mark at

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.540 
paper and you can see it left a mark at
one<00:03:07.650> spot<00:03:08.010> well<00:03:08.430> that's<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.390> high<00:03:09.630> spot<00:03:10.430> do<00:03:11.430> it

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
one spot well that's a high spot do it

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
too bad you can lap it like this but

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.690 
too bad you can lap it like this but
usually<00:03:21.390> we<00:03:21.900> have<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.290> get<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:22.650> here<00:03:23.040> with<00:03:23.670> our

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
file and actually form the entire tip by

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.220 
file and actually form the entire tip by
making<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.890> series<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.450> diagonal<00:03:30.450> cuts<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
making a series of diagonal cuts and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.010 
making a series of diagonal cuts and
then<00:03:31.920> once<00:03:32.520> again<00:03:32.670> lapping<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.750> into

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
then once again lapping it into
