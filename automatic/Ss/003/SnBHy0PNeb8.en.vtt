00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.799 
was just fun because you know it was a
lot<00:00:53.949> of<00:00:54.010> it<00:00:54.850> was<00:00:55.000> truly<00:00:55.299> a<00:00:55.420> lot<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.629> laughing

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
lot of it was truly a lot of laughing

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.109 
lot of it was truly a lot of laughing
and<00:00:56.289> that's<00:00:56.559> always<00:00:56.769> it's<00:00:57.190> very<00:00:57.549> helpful<00:00:57.940> in

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.119 
and that's always it's very helpful in

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:00.329 
and that's always it's very helpful in
those<00:00:58.510> situations<00:00:59.019> because<00:00:59.219> physically<00:01:00.219> it's

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
those situations because physically it's

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.160 
those situations because physically it's
a<00:01:00.399> really<00:01:00.579> uncomfortable<00:01:00.869> obviously<00:01:01.869> you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
a really uncomfortable obviously you

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.410 
a really uncomfortable obviously you
know<00:01:02.289> it's<00:01:02.619> not<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.100> most<00:01:03.250> comfortable<00:01:03.430> just

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
know it's not the most comfortable just

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.620 
know it's not the most comfortable just
wearing<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.780> suits<00:01:05.019> uncomfortable<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.299> it

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
wearing the suits uncomfortable but it

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.779 
wearing the suits uncomfortable but it
isn't<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.020> most<00:01:08.140> comfortable<00:01:08.560> thing<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.399> do

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
isn't the most comfortable thing to do

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.730 
isn't the most comfortable thing to do
and<00:01:10.090> so<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.810> really<00:01:10.899> helps<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.319> be<00:01:11.470> able<00:01:11.649> to

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
and so it really helps to be able to

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.249 
and so it really helps to be able to
laugh<00:01:11.950> in<00:01:12.190> between<00:01:12.520> those<00:01:12.840> 45<00:01:13.840> minutes<00:01:14.140> while

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
laugh in between those 45 minutes while

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:26.050 
laugh in between those 45 minutes while
they're<00:01:14.440> setting<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.860> next<00:01:15.100> shot
