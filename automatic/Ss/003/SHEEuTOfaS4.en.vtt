00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.020
 sports park the future was tuesday evening he scene of a trial a competition 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.440
 between ajax her 81 years old there is one due to the difference in age and age 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.590
 experience between the players of both teams may be at first 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.710
 face no logical training partners nevertheless there was an air duel 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.119
 we still want that tax wherever possible where possible 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.679
 matches 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.070
 hold a high before they keep that incentive 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.620
 just like the first half of the season we have a lot 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.020
 playing twice a week, so the two have big reasons, and preferably with preference 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.200
 against the pilot 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 for that one has 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.260
 the course in the area does have an irritated discussion of the 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.160
 for the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.840
 the sprint but also the physical world that goes with it 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.620
 or in some cases the absence of a horse 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.620
 ahead the physical duels 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.070
 ajax is currently competing fully for the title in the big league a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.360
 training for logical about the composition of his team 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.780
 Tamara by experienced boys put Wahlberg that paid football experience 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.610
 today it is away from holland by share that already this week 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.820
 play get arranged 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.010
 also has a past at ajax our team has a lot of guys with an ajax 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.940
 past 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.270
 so that seems nice because we see against the ropes youth who still have to 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.760
 come 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.970
 the youth who have yet to come and play in red and white 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.660
 ajax Saturday amateurs in the away kit 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.790
 in this it is already too late nourdin to the ball 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.220
 gets the ball back 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 van elton has had said noël le graët a good 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.469
 as aniston nothing with the cross would be the first chance of the match m 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.120
 it's a hit right away 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.120
 the goal is of dropping reael she sees 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.720
 this duel in the rush hour posted orlando trustfull and it would be his match 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.220
 to become 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.290
 but also the Saturday amateurs with these countries release but also former Prof. Danny 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.390
 shank and paul quawn in the base 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.440
 creates opportunities 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.270
 here for example for the murder there is a big chance but he shoots the ball over 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.270
 the target lands windows 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.959
 orlando trustfull 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.959
 he could relax and watch the kick-off maoz 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.759
 what a wonderful duel in between 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.679
 canceled players of the Saturday amateurs with a sign at the entrance 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.299
 involved but it is allowed to continue 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.369
 also because they 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.180
 give too accommodating by that of the brook and by that of the brook cares through the legs 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:37.469
 from the keeper for the 2 0 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.639
 of the brook that came out at the start of the season for the buy in from 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.019
 ajax just is abdel achmed 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.699
 I wish it is definitely one 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.569
 physical gap against these authors of the ajax Saturday 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:51.339
 Amsterdam a lot stronger 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.759
 but playing football so far so well that is a new attack from the 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.419
 Ajax Saturday 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.719
 beautiful lob 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.109
 about mao zedong 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.479
 but I just drive this hits the bar 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.479
 may be a goal with that certainty 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.289
 who agrees that she will again 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.809
 faster than his opponent and that is often but now also opposite 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.929
 Danny Schenkel 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.049
 nice parzival of the brook again 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.799
 farmer with the bet and the end to see three bam for ellen zoom 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.620
 but then everyone has the goalkeeper 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.620
 from ajax saturday the ball clamp 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.519
 continue this well from the cup 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.749
 l sick at the seaside 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.069
 he goes for his second goal merle real bespoke suits last hits the post 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.619
 the woodwork church has to endure this duel 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.619
 Bart has something to train so from Ajax Saturday 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.129
 and this has already been done by becker 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.870
 recently ajax a2 excel also an assist with young ajax and now an assist 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.919
 almost one 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.699
 his cross is headed in by hellas quarrel 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.809
 it is his second of the match well to the first pole the coming of the 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.809
 number 9 of ajax 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.379
 in the next attack of the day one with a cross of nut 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.029
 and the Netherlands 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.829
 the head through quincy along ravon goes even further this is knew ssssst 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.099
 for but then scheduled leg the ball 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.940
 this government has been opportunities for the hens to expand the score 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.280
 He gets the ball through who tries to cross the opponent 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.970
 schooner to skip that failed schooner then walk backwards and play 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.000
 the ball so in the feet of felgueiras quarrel 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.080
 the opposition 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.130
 has something beautiful in store The most beautiful goal of the evening comes to his name one 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.129
 beautiful lob over the legs 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.569
 in it is 4 0 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.949
 a gift of course but if you unwrap the gift like that 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.779
 beautifully well done to see from Ella 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:49.669
 and so he with a hat trick 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.759
 then a corner for the arena 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.949
 to the ball by which pulls next shot 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.520
 the boxed-by-leg attack goes even further back to see el ganzouri 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.520
 and the fourth of the striker after one of ajax 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.990
 and so it becomes 5 0 for the herring 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.830
 by the first of Ajax Saturday 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.900
 strangers score 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.900
 in this exhibition game on the future Tuesday evening 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.360
 a beautiful evening 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.360
 singles and I enjoyed it too 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.240
 this was the nicest middle east 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.469
 I think I regret that by the keeper 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.749
 I saw the keeper come out better, so I thought hey 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.580
 6 if you are right 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.620
 the trainer also indicated to 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.740
 both duels to stay and that 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.289
 that does not happen if you play the constructor 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.159
 keep the ball running keep doing simple things 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:48.319
 because under the circumstances it was slippery that you would not run much with the ball 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.530
 and have done that 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.759
 after that divided 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.569
 I don't really know physically 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.979
 at the same time there is still good 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.819
 and that I cannot make out of it 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.629
 make themselves down 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.490
 but so beautiful 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.320
 hell yes 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.750
 nice bonus
