00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.350
 to make a wooden box for 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.030
 the atria 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.040
 give yourself some wood a cutter a 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.590
 vinyl glue pencil and nails 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.980
 hammer drill glass screwdriver card 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.779
 avoid different measures first 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 cut a piece of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.030
 wood to make the bottom of the box 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.030
 we have chosen a size of 43 cm x 18 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.100
 then also cut the pieces of wood for 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.130
 make the sides on the longer sides 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 they will measure 43 cm x 6 on the shorter sides 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.900
 instead 20 this measure takes into account both 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.610
 of the length of the bottom both of the 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.610
 thickness of the other two banks 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.549
 then take the vinyl glue e 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.979
 first glue the longer sides to the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.469
 bottom stopping them also with nails and 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.800
 hammer to make the glue stick better 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.780
 vinyl afterwards repeat 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.879
 the operation on the short sides 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.860
 reminding you to paste not only the 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.260
 bottom but also the thickness of the sides 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.739
 long on which they will lean 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.739
 the strong ones
