00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
build it alright so let's get right down

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.010 
build it alright so let's get right down
to<00:00:30.460> it<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:31.119> first<00:00:31.360> thing<00:00:31.480> you're<00:00:31.630> going<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.840> do

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
to it the first thing you're going to do

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:46.000 
to it the first thing you're going to do
is<00:00:32.140> make<00:00:32.320> a<00:00:32.349> nine<00:00:32.590> by<00:00:32.770> nine<00:00:32.980> box<00:00:33.580> so<00:00:36.390> 19

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.139 

there<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.100> go<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.700> use<00:00:47.820> any<00:00:47.940> material

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
there we go you can use any material

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.750 
there we go you can use any material
you'll<00:00:48.570> want<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> won't<00:00:49.200> explode<00:00:49.610> unless<00:00:50.610> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you'll want it won't explode unless you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.960 
you'll want it won't explode unless you
screw<00:00:50.940> something<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:52.399> I'm<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.760> doing

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
screw something up I'm just doing

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.600 
screw something up I'm just doing
obsidian<00:00:54.420> fair<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.350> say<00:00:55.500> doing<00:00:56.010> obsidian<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
obsidian fair to say doing obsidian I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.899 
obsidian fair to say doing obsidian I
guess<00:00:57.949> then<00:00:58.949> you're<00:00:59.100> going<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.339> want<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.699> cut

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
guess then you're going to want to cut

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.319 
guess then you're going to want to cut
it<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.150> half<00:01:00.180> twice<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.220> should<00:01:02.400> have<00:01:02.550> two

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
it in half twice so you should have two

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.149 
it in half twice so you should have two
three<00:01:03.600> by<00:01:03.720> three<00:01:03.989> areas<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.559> are<00:01:04.710> four<00:01:04.979> three

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
three by three areas that are four three

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.570 
three by three areas that are four three
by<00:01:05.280> three<00:01:05.460> areas<00:01:05.759> then<00:01:06.979> next<00:01:07.979> step<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.460> we're

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
by three areas then next step is we're

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.600 
by three areas then next step is we're
going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> put<00:01:09.000> water<00:01:09.300> flow<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.640> corners

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.190 

of<00:01:15.610> all<00:01:15.940> of<00:01:15.970> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
of all of the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.410 
of all of the
of<00:01:18.259> all<00:01:19.159> of<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.369> boxes<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.149> water<00:01:20.270> is

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
of all of the boxes so that the water is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.499 
of all of the boxes so that the water is
flowing<00:01:20.719> in<00:01:20.930> words<00:01:21.170> like<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.270> all<00:01:23.270> right<00:01:23.360> next

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
flowing in words like so all right next

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:24.940 
flowing in words like so all right next
thing<00:01:23.719> we're<00:01:23.840> going<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.079> do<00:01:24.289> is<00:01:24.469> actually<00:01:24.649> hook

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
thing we're going to do is actually hook

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.240 
thing we're going to do is actually hook
the<00:01:25.070> wiring<00:01:25.430> up<00:01:25.579> for<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.119> first<00:01:26.299> floor<00:01:26.740> so<00:01:27.740> I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
the wiring up for the first floor so I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.859 
the wiring up for the first floor so I
like<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.360> start<00:01:29.539> a<00:01:29.659> little<00:01:29.810> offset<00:01:30.700> because

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
like to start a little offset because

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.529 
like to start a little offset because
show<00:01:32.869> you<00:01:32.929> why<00:01:33.140> when<00:01:33.350> we<00:01:33.469> get<00:01:33.590> around<00:01:33.679> and<00:01:34.539> I'm

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
show you why when we get around and I'm

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.899 
show you why when we get around and I'm
probably<00:01:35.899> using<00:01:36.500> more<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.039> these<00:01:37.520> repeaters

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
probably using more of these repeaters

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.850 
probably using more of these repeaters
whoops<00:01:38.479> more<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.110> these<00:01:39.259> repeaters<00:01:39.560> than<00:01:39.799> I

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
whoops more of these repeaters than I

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.200 
whoops more of these repeaters than I
need<00:01:40.009> to<00:01:40.039> but<00:01:40.429> I<00:01:41.149> like<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.479> be<00:01:41.600> safe<00:01:43.000> so<00:01:44.000> what<00:01:44.179> I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
need to but I like to be safe so what I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.539 
need to but I like to be safe so what I
do<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:44.630> line<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.110> whole<00:01:45.289> end<00:01:45.590> with<00:01:46.159> redstone

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
do is I line the whole end with redstone

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.760 
do is I line the whole end with redstone
and<00:01:46.819> once<00:01:47.030> I<00:01:47.149> turn<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.450> corner<00:01:47.719> I<00:01:48.049> use<00:01:48.740> a

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
and once I turn a corner I use a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.050 
and once I turn a corner I use a
repeater<00:01:49.299> with<00:01:50.299> no<00:01:50.509> delay<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:52.520> let's<00:01:52.700> do<00:01:53.030> that

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
repeater with no delay so let's do that

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:01.610 
repeater with no delay so let's do that
real<00:01:53.479> quick

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.230 

again<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.520> why<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.940> keep<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
again that's why I like to keep the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.030 
again that's why I like to keep the
offset<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.230> doesn't<00:02:04.440> connect<00:02:04.830> with

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
offset so that it doesn't connect with

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.290 
offset so that it doesn't connect with
otherwise<00:02:05.340> you'll<00:02:05.550> end<00:02:05.610> up<00:02:05.760> with<00:02:05.820> an<00:02:06.030> infinite

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
otherwise you'll end up with an infinite

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.480 
otherwise you'll end up with an infinite
loop<00:02:06.860> all<00:02:07.860> right<00:02:07.980> so<00:02:08.100> we<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> first

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
loop all right so we have the first

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.920 
loop all right so we have the first
floor<00:02:08.760> done<00:02:10.190> next<00:02:11.190> we're<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.390> up<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.720> level

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
floor done next we're going up a level

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.100 
floor done next we're going up a level
and<00:02:13.460> you're<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.090> repeat<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.750> same

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and you're just going to repeat the same

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.360 
and you're just going to repeat the same
exact<00:02:16.650> thing<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.570> did<00:02:18.570> for<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.740> bottom<00:02:20.220> level

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
exact thing you did for the bottom level

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.840 
exact thing you did for the bottom level
so<00:02:21.330> we're<00:02:21.570> just<00:02:21.720> making<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:22.020> nine<00:02:22.170> by<00:02:22.350> nine<00:02:22.500> box

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
so we're just making a nine by nine box

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.980 
so we're just making a nine by nine box
with<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.880> cross<00:02:24.210> hatches

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.470 

all<00:02:28.380> right<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:28.860> go<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.150> one<00:02:30.300> thing

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
all right there we go now the one thing

repeaters set to maximum delay if you do

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.250 
repeaters set to maximum delay if you do
any<00:03:42.070> less<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:43.390> run<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.720> risk<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:44.050> blowing
