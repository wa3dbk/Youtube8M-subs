00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.819 
for myself whether I expand or shrink
you<00:02:16.900> know<00:02:17.019> I<00:02:17.049> could<00:02:18.180> adjust<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.659> my<00:02:19.840> size<00:02:20.379> so

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
you know I could adjust it to my size so

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.289 
you know I could adjust it to my size so
now<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.269> do<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.659> you<00:02:23.079> attach<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:25.000> to

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
now what you do is you attach this to

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.399 
now what you do is you attach this to
the<00:02:25.780> outside<00:02:26.349> part<00:02:26.379> of<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:27.579> watch<00:02:28.209> itself<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.039 
the outside part of the watch itself the
strap<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.400> when<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:31.389> put<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.659> in<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.900> like

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
strap and when you put it in this like

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.970 
strap and when you put it in this like
if<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.319> were<00:02:32.469> snapping<00:02:32.829> it<00:02:33.129> into<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:34.269> hat<00:02:35.170> right

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
if you were snapping it into a hat right

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.729
