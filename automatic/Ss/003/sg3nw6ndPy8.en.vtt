00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
that a minor chord that we learned

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.100 
that a minor chord that we learned
earlier<00:02:39.070> it's<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:40.090> everything<00:02:40.840> every

finger is actually up one string okay so

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.660 
finger is actually up one string okay so
it's<00:02:43.840> it's<00:02:44.620> almost<00:02:44.860> identical<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.459> the

it's it's almost identical to the
formation<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.630> minor<00:02:46.900> chord<00:02:47.140> earlier

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
formation of that a minor chord earlier

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.600 
formation of that a minor chord earlier
but<00:02:48.220> everything<00:02:48.550> is<00:02:48.670> up<00:02:48.790> one<00:02:49.000> string<00:02:49.709> okay<00:02:50.709> so

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
but everything is up one string okay so

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.979 
but everything is up one string okay so
that<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.790> e<00:02:53.550> now<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> next<00:02:55.150> chord<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.959> key

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
okay you can play it like this but I

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.830 
okay you can play it like this but I
tend<00:03:59.680> to<00:03:59.890> to<00:04:00.310> make<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.580> easier<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.209> tend<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.750> just

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
tend to to make it easier I tend to just

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.800 
tend to to make it easier I tend to just
move<00:04:02.140> up<00:04:02.640> by<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:04.060> fingers<00:04:04.360> that<00:04:04.510> are<00:04:04.540> already

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
move up by the fingers that are already

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.830 
move up by the fingers that are already
so<00:04:04.990> close<00:04:05.319> and<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:06.069> put<00:04:06.280> my<00:04:06.400> middle<00:04:06.670> finger<00:04:07.000> on

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
so close and I put my middle finger on

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.390 
so close and I put my middle finger on
the<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:08.740> string<00:04:08.770> 2nd<00:04:09.490> fret<00:04:10.290> ring<00:04:11.290> finger<00:04:11.709> on<00:04:11.860> the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
the a string 2nd fret ring finger on the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.150 
the a string 2nd fret ring finger on the
E<00:04:12.430> string<00:04:12.730> 3rd<00:04:13.660> fret<00:04:13.690> like<00:04:14.200> so<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:14.709> then<00:04:15.100> I

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
E string 3rd fret like so and then I

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.840 
E string 3rd fret like so and then I
just<00:04:15.280> used<00:04:15.490> my<00:04:15.550> pinky<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.840> put<00:04:17.079> that<00:04:17.579> on<00:04:18.579> the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
just used my pinky and I put that on the

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.630

E<00:04:18.880> string<00:04:19.320> on<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.530> 3rd<00:04:20.739> fret<00:04:20.890> now<00:04:21.190> essentially

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
E string on the 3rd fret now essentially

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.150 
E string on the 3rd fret now essentially
it's<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.880> same<00:04:21.940> I'm<00:04:22.300> pressing<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.720> same<00:04:23.160> the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
it's the same I'm pressing the same the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.240 
it's the same I'm pressing the same the
same<00:04:24.370> notes<00:04:24.730> as<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.330> am<00:04:25.480> in<00:04:25.660> this<00:04:25.810> G<00:04:26.140> but<00:04:27.130> it's

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
same notes as I am in this G but it's

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.800 
same notes as I am in this G but it's
just<00:04:27.310> easier<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.790> go<00:04:27.910> from<00:04:30.240> from<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.270> F<00:04:31.630> to

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
just easier to go from from that F to

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.440 
just easier to go from from that F to
that<00:04:31.930> GD<00:04:32.200> see<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.820> ok<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:33.880> if<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.240> play

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
that GD see that ok so if you play

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.420 
that GD see that ok so if you play
however<00:04:34.660> you'd<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.260> so<00:04:35.980> that's<00:04:36.160> Jesus

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
however you'd like to so that's Jesus

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.920 
however you'd like to so that's Jesus
that's<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:36.790> fifth<00:04:37.000> chord<00:04:37.300> in<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.480> key<00:04:37.510> of<00:04:37.690> C

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
that's a fifth chord in the key of C

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.630 
that's a fifth chord in the key of C
then<00:04:38.350> we're<00:04:38.440> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.590> go<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.980> minor<00:04:39.310> is

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
then we're going to go a minor is

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.360 
then we're going to go a minor is
actually<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.270> sixth<00:04:40.630> chord<00:04:41.050> in<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.919> key<00:04:41.950> of<00:04:42.130> C

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
actually the sixth chord in the key of C

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.040 
actually the sixth chord in the key of C
so<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.610> should<00:04:43.090> already<00:04:43.210> know<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.570> minor<00:04:43.840> from

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
so you should already know a minor from

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.320 
so you should already know a minor from
previous<00:04:44.410> lessons<00:04:44.620> but<00:04:44.950> if<00:04:45.070> not<00:04:45.250> again<00:04:46.150> its

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
previous lessons but if not again its

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.830 
previous lessons but if not again its

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
and then then ring finger is going to go

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.320 
and then then ring finger is going to go
on<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:55.660> g<00:04:55.960> string<00:04:55.990> 2nd<00:04:56.830> fret<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:58.000> that's<00:04:58.150> a
