00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.509
 Give in 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.839
 the governments would 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:25.409
 yes, that's the motto today, and it's certainly true, of course 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:30.949
 Although today the game has a haircut 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.240
 PlayStation Move features 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.270
 and I wanted to finally try it out what you are there at all 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.300
 came came 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.220
 What you can do every year is just the bankruptcy of lace making 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.560
 use the courage photo Lorenz steering wheel so to speak 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.430
 yes of course I wanted to test the same time 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.510
 I'll show you this here now as a very nice gameplay video 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.370
 that's what happened to me "Look at the drive here and there 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.200
 and percent at the end of the video I'll show you again with mine 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.530
 wonderful hands 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.430
 yes, they are also the most unsuccessful 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.689
 soon is halftime 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.640
 and the street 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.930
 Mr. is just from 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.070
 Stegner was shot 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.370
 yes there was also percent opponents on 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.370
 I've been testing Life Ball in other industries 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.300
 he is injured 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.520
 will see later how it works with the display 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.840
 to make it funny 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.220
 but you have to be able to do that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.010
 So I have some 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.490
 Rome with the steering taxation is Magna to come because 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.270
 Huawei based on exactly the other way there was something 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.350
 I steered to Varel on the left but he drove to the right 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.540
 suddenly it went right 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.060
 Hann yes but such situations just now by Gerd Stöwer Rieck 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.950
 the best food Schäuble had on 2 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.160
 more comfortable than you 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.630
 full as Dr 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.119
 Limit Skywalk is there can 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.549
 open throughout the year 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.549
 so braking to the Neckar could be very difficult 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.879
 Mother died that is meaningless 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.259
 or you have to stop 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.259
 Principle does not always speak slightly accelerated 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.229
 Here I want to recover again 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.149
 that they are OK 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.149
 but otherwise got skin here 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.169
 Classic already full 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 I'm happy now too 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.949
 Months of January 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:51.969
 and yes I never did 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.969
 November than that 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:57.989
 I have my heart 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.539
 ordered 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.439
 And yes, I must say that is also how much I have given up early 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.399
 Rürup 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:06.779
 Novartis and such 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:10.159
 here now that of the much awaited continuing Mio 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:13.749
 Aral you just do that 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.059
 his last prank 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.129
 Diaz is also really fun to drive there 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.819
 in multiplayer mode you can always use that too 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.939
 but neither these buses of seasoning 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.569
 And then you can also Novartis Petz or just then on the bike 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.909
 yes and then obstruct the way each other 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:38.879
 just like in the movie 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.239
 it is really cool 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.399
 here is optically 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:43.089
 meanwhile very much 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.739
 are not so many people so far online is too bad but 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.259
 Period of travel 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:59.659
 Page has something like that 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.319
 but Anja Straub 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.559
 It's the license game I'll say 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.669
 so it is anyway 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.669
 advertise that 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.980
 now I am fortunate that it's pretty straight with me 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.029
 Drive Darabos as often as possible 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.169
 or steer so extreme 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.659
 and then it works quite well discussing 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:28.179
 yes and that is already over Diaz for control experience is thus 

00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:31.179
 finished and I have to rise again stressed on the normal job 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.860
 pity actually interested in the place as that would have gone on now 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.539
 is with throw and so but that is unfortunately not that does not work 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.139
 the move controller 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.479
 yes comes well so part two of the video and here 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.400
 You see how I gambled with the move-controller 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.620
 first calibrate the thing here 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.030
 and yes then shows you on the screen what would have to do anyway how 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.909
 does the controller work? 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.499
 and then of course you are allowed to hit four times like they already did 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.499
 have seen and it starts 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.590
 now you can not say much about it anymore i have it all 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.669
 you said 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.219
 That's exactly what I wanted to say 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.719
 to throw the tests if one beside you will take them with the staff 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.499
 alone reader test throw there and a deal next to you open sorrow at crosses 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:20.449
 etched 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.729
 you have% he must have the controller before either you can circle 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.219
 of course press on the move controller or you can in 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.719
 Send all of Scholle once so forward 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.150
 Well, then the testers 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.760
 I've just invented that in the case and the experiments 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.309
 I think so now also exactly once again 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.309
 but unfortunately with the taz the guy caught me because he was too far away 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.020
 around the 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.849
 this idea again now 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.219
 how the whole of them rules 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.719
 so you pattern 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.520
 really develop a sense for percent 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.969
 I say that the whole thing worked 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.430
 but it's just great fun so it's 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.059
 so cool thing it is also possible 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:03.499
 like a ruin or Marie Orka joke and indeed so that process Sonneck 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:05.080
 what is for 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.430
 Percent only at Gartner 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.650
 In short, it's a cool go 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.889
 it's fun section Schillig some room for improvement should be money 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.210
 but that's just super license to play but I am 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.580
 personally can recommend that is also good 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.639
 and year 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.869
 we are just waiting too 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:28.769
 See you next time Arndt thanks for watching. Keep your fingers crossed 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:32.669
 Jena recommend you know as always and then again 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:33.969
 Charleroi's until next time
