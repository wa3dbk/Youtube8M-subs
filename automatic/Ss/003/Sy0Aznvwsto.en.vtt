00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.789 
cutting tool and complex sugar paste
we've<00:00:53.570> gone<00:00:53.719> for<00:00:53.960> glue<00:00:54.250> has<00:00:55.250> amazing<00:00:55.789> sugar

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
we've gone for glue has amazing sugar

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.079 
we've gone for glue has amazing sugar
okay<00:00:57.799> so<00:00:57.859> firstly<00:00:58.430> we're<00:00:58.609> going<00:00:58.729> to<00:00:58.789> need<00:00:58.939> the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
okay so firstly we're going to need the

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.840 
okay so firstly we're going to need the
sugar<00:00:59.239> paste<00:00:59.479> until<00:00:59.960> it's<00:01:00.049> nice<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:00.229> pliable

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
sugar paste until it's nice and pliable

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.359 
sugar paste until it's nice and pliable
sprinkle<00:01:01.850> add<00:01:01.909> some<00:01:02.089> icing<00:01:02.239> sugar<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.369> then

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
sprinkle add some icing sugar and then

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:16.240 
sprinkle add some icing sugar and then
knead<00:01:04.850> away<00:01:14.440> okay<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:15.500> once<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.830> got<00:01:15.950> sugar

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
knead away okay so once I got sugar

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.919 
knead away okay so once I got sugar
paste<00:01:16.429> nice<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:16.850> soft<00:01:17.030> when<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.299> rolled<00:01:17.509> out<00:01:17.690> to

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
paste nice and soft when I rolled out to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:33.300 
paste nice and soft when I rolled out to
approximately<00:01:18.049> 1/2<00:01:18.679> centimeter<00:01:19.220> thickness

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.350

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
so now I've got the sugar paste rolled

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.039 
so now I've got the sugar paste rolled
out<00:01:35.450> nicely

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
out nicely

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.289 
out nicely

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
we're just going to dust the inside of

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.230 
we're just going to dust the inside of
the<00:01:38.360> texture<00:01:38.720> map<00:01:38.869> with<00:01:38.990> some<00:01:39.140> icing<00:01:39.439> sugar

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
it on top of the sugar paste then take

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.699 
it on top of the sugar paste then take
the<00:01:49.519> rolling<00:01:49.819> pin<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.750> roll<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:51.229> over<00:01:51.319> the<00:01:51.500> top

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
the rolling pin and roll it over the top

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.449 
the rolling pin and roll it over the top
of<00:01:51.739> the<00:01:51.920> mat<00:01:52.099> until<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:54.319> paste<00:01:54.560> fills<00:01:55.190> the

of the mat until the paste fills the

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.759 
of the mat until the paste fills the
inside<00:01:55.819> of<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.030> texture<00:01:56.330> map<00:01:59.470> we<00:02:00.470> can<00:02:00.530> just

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:00.769 
inside of the texture map we can just

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:04.869 
inside of the texture map we can just
peel<00:02:01.129> it<00:02:01.160> off<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.920> then<00:02:03.979> you'd<00:02:04.399> be<00:02:04.489> left<00:02:04.670> with

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
just where the cutting to cut around the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.280 
just where the cutting to cut around the
desired<00:02:16.280> letters

straight<00:02:25.860> away<00:02:26.099> we've<00:02:26.670> done<00:02:26.819> here<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.239> if<00:02:27.840> you

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
straight away we've done here or if you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.050 
straight away we've done here or if you
might<00:02:28.079> put<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.290> top<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> cupcake<00:02:29.060> best

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
might put on top of a cupcake best

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.670 
might put on top of a cupcake best
advice<00:02:30.390> would<00:02:30.599> leave<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.049> dry<00:02:31.230> overnight

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
advice would leave it to dry overnight

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.259 
advice would leave it to dry overnight
so<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.129> slightly<00:02:32.310> hard<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.819> I'll<00:02:32.909> stand<00:02:33.120> up

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
so it's slightly hard and I'll stand up

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.130

and you can just pop them out the
texture<00:04:08.100> map<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.870> can<00:04:09.900> see

texture map like so and you can see
there's<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.040> beautiful<00:04:11.340> pattern<00:04:11.490> of<00:04:11.670> the

can also use white chocolate and then
you<00:04:22.140> can<00:04:22.290> use<00:04:22.470> food<00:04:22.830> color<00:04:23.100> which<00:04:23.490> creates<00:04:23.730> a

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
you can use food color which creates a

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.750 
you can use food color which creates a
really<00:04:24.000> pretty<00:04:24.150> effect<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.780> father
