00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.380
 hello to all guys welcome to this one 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.970
 new video review by 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.359
 iphoneitalia.com today we talk to you 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.160
 of the latest google search version 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.850
 the official google app for 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.030
 ios who finally introduced also 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.300
 on iphone and ipad google navona un 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.370
 service we have already known about 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.379
 android platform obviously not there 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.110
 we talked but you will 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.890
 surely read something about it 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.629
 which now also arrives on the iphone 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.720
 this service can be understood as 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.659
 a sort of siri made in google also 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.960
 if there are any differences it has been 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.909
 highly appreciated by users 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.860
 this is the look of google now on ios 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.439
 we repeat to get it, we need to 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.970
 download the google search application 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.030
 no app exists from the app store 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.640
 google now and then specific 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.030
 practically enough to do it this way 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.159
 to reveal the google now screen 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.939
 we therefore have the localized method 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.890
 where am i temperature type of 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.810
 forecast and forecast for others 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.319
 days of course we can also 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.030
 change these settings from between 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:39.649
 the other dissolves the other preferences of 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.780
 google that we have already seen then the 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.060
 place of the photos so these are 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.490
 of images of the place where I am 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.780
 basically images retrieved from 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.759
 google that eventually can 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.429
 save or get directions a 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.229
 walk up to that point or show up 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.539
 a web page 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.789
 maybe the non- functional zoom is n't there 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.999
 interested as I told you that I am there 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.300
 other tab second of what you have 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.340
 saved on yours 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.070
 google these are sample cards 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.080
 indications for transport traffic 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.740
 public state of flight we see this 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.690
 here if you can add no anyway 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.580
 all these cards are added to 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.580
 this kind of timeline then we can 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.260
 remove the me we say exactly how 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.820
 It happens with emails on gmail or even 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.880
 chrome with chrome pages is enough 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.470
 do so and the card disappears more 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.630
 obviously we can update these 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.000
 information via the small button here 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.440
 as for research instead 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.540
 we have search through images that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.530
 obviously it's a little more difficult to 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.540
 show you and then we also have the search 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.090
 vocal always in google now that works 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.920
 exactly as it was said though it is more 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.870
 limited are because unlike 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.210
 android on ios 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.920
 logically apple does not allow google 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.960
 to do a little what he wants exactly 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.020
 like google does not allow apple to 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.360
 bring silicon north if michael ex con 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.360
 anyway, let's try this one 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.360
 voice search as the weather will be tomorrow 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.780
 here is the weather forecast as you have 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.310
 seen while speaking essentially 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.230
 were translated into letters on 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.300
 screen my words what you advise 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.510
 it does not happen because it is necessary to wait 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.750
 a few seconds and then you recognize it all 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.720
 the sentence we make another test more 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.209
 here are saved see the searches 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.800
 that we can do the research 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.250
 voice is translated into search 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:49.080
 textual and remains in the chronology then 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.120
 this is a simple functional bit 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.170
 limited to them and quite limited 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.150
 compared to android 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.040
 but let's remember that anyway 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.459
 a siri alternative that is definitely 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.860
 easier to use more integrated 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.770
 over it 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.900
 more complete on ios e platform 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.270
 probably more complete in general 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.590
 compared to google 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.080
 if you are interested as I already have 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.820
 said if you have the search app 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.370
 google the day from the app store for 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.859
 have google now or download this 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.380
 same application for free from 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.080
 apple store and internet automatically 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.210
 a little went on your iphone 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.430
 even for today it's all a greeting from 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.430
