00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
so I shouldn't be contaminating it helps

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.300 
so I shouldn't be contaminating it helps
to<00:02:17.340> remove<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.760> lens<00:02:17.940> cap<00:02:18.980> picked<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
to remove the lens cap picked up the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.640 
to remove the lens cap picked up the
trail<00:02:20.990> it's<00:02:21.990> going<00:02:22.230> right<00:02:22.380> down<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.890> there<00:02:23.130> so

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
trail it's going right down to there so

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.120 
trail it's going right down to there so
get<00:02:25.650> down<00:02:25.770> there<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.130> find<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:27.170> where<00:02:28.170> it's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130
