00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
move at a snail's pace and you can only

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.660 
move at a snail's pace and you can only
slide<00:03:55.290> when<00:03:55.530> you're<00:03:55.650> moving<00:03:55.799> aiming

diagonally<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.389> almost<00:03:57.750> impossible<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.980> it

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
diagonally is almost impossible and it

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.069 
diagonally is almost impossible and it
feels<00:03:59.459> like<00:03:59.790> you're<00:03:59.970> limited<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.389> only<00:04:00.480> aiming

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
feels like you're limited to only aiming

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.680 
feels like you're limited to only aiming
in<00:04:01.170> four<00:04:01.440> directions<00:04:01.590> instead<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.400> eight<00:04:02.690> well

in four directions instead of eight well
it<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:03.989> gets<00:04:04.230> me<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:05.040> your<00:04:05.310> bullets

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
it really gets me is that your bullets

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.879 
it really gets me is that your bullets
go<00:04:05.910> in<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.150> straight<00:04:06.359> line<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:07.319> enemy<00:04:07.739> bullets

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
go in a straight line the enemy bullets

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.830 
go in a straight line the enemy bullets

you

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
you

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.809 
you
was<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.289> first<00:04:28.560> level<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.400> first<00:04:29.610> five

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
was the first level and the first five

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.300 
was the first level and the first five
seconds<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:30.509> second<00:04:30.930> level<00:04:31.199> if<00:04:32.100> you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
seconds of the second level if you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.559 
seconds of the second level if you
bought<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:32.669> game<00:04:32.850> back<00:04:33.120> then<00:04:33.150> you

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
bought this game back then you

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.960 
bought this game back then you
essentially<00:04:33.990> got<00:04:34.229> ripped<00:04:34.590> off<00:04:34.740> not<00:04:35.580> just

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
essentially got ripped off not just

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.059 
essentially got ripped off not just
because<00:04:36.210> it's<00:04:36.539> absurd<00:04:36.960> difficulty<00:04:37.680> but

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
because it's absurd difficulty but

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.040 
because it's absurd difficulty but
because<00:04:38.340> there's<00:04:38.490> only<00:04:38.669> eight<00:04:38.970> bosses<00:04:39.630> mean

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
because there's only eight bosses mean

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.420 
because there's only eight bosses mean
there's<00:04:40.319> eight<00:04:40.530> levels<00:04:41.009> and<00:04:41.160> they're

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
there's eight levels and they're

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.460 
there's eight levels and they're
relatively<00:04:41.910> short<00:04:42.300> levels<00:04:42.660> too<00:04:42.840> so<00:04:43.319> you<00:04:43.410> can

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
relatively short levels too so you can

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.839 
relatively short levels too so you can
beat<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.800> game<00:04:43.979> in<00:04:44.130> under<00:04:44.400> 20<00:04:44.819> minutes

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
beat the game in under 20 minutes

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.460

depending<00:04:45.449> on<00:04:45.479> how<00:04:45.599> good<00:04:45.930> your<00:04:46.080> bullet

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
depending on how good your bullet

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.890 
depending on how good your bullet
dodging<00:04:46.860> skills<00:04:46.889> are<00:04:47.460> this<00:04:48.449> is<00:04:48.599> not<00:04:48.870> a

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
dodging skills are this is not a

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.170 
dodging skills are this is not a
one-player<00:04:49.530> game<00:04:49.560> nor<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.699> two-player

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
one-player game nor is it a two-player

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.200 
one-player game nor is it a two-player
game<00:04:51.449> so<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.110> need<00:04:52.440> all<00:04:52.650> four<00:04:53.069> people<00:04:53.639> just<00:04:54.120> to

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
game so you need all four people just to

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.210 
game so you need all four people just to
