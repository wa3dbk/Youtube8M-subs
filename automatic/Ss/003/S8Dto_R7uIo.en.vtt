00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 welcome to all I am very happy 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.620
 because I just purchased my equipment 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.210
 directive and prepaid and then the first 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.809
 What I'm going to do is make a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:18.780
 review of all components should 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.990
 have an arm here I should have a plate 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.690
 there must also be a compass 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:30.140
 speak hardware mast 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.280
 here it says that giving a base also removes 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.530
 the piece lnb 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.790
 and there must also be what is the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.250
 decoder and card 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.050
 let's review now the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.410
 tool so I'm going to need to 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.690
 do the prepaid mickey installation 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.540
 first we're going to need a hammer 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.670
 a wick or drill according to the 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.920
 specifications of the kit manual 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.440
 prepaid and we will use a key 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.430
 according to the specifications of x 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.910
 prepaid used a drill I'll have 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.250
 with me 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.180
 to mark at some time 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.340
 need a pen well I have 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.590
 decided that I want to do the installation 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.350
 of my whole here precisely but 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.630
 before you know if you can enter it here 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.520
 I have to check 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.250
 with the compass that is provided to me in the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.710
 prepaid kit if it is possible to install the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.560
 And for that I'm going to take the compass 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.750
 I will place it in the palm of my hand and 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 I'm going to select me from the part that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.240
 is red is pointing towards the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.490
 north right there then I verify 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.220
 Candle according to the manual where it should go 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.259
 the antenna thus pointing towards the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.750
 satellite and tells me that it's just 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.039
 here I have decided that I want to install 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.479
 antenna here and according to what the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.039
 manual 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.240
 I do not have any kind of obstruction like that 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.420
 that therefore I can do my 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.039
 installation here since I have a signal 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.240
 towards the satellite and I do not have any type 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:05.789
 of obstruction we have here the basis that 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.429
 it has assembled the mast and the mast 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.709
 which has a spirit level which 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.640
 we will use to precisely give you 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:18.440
 one level to the base and the mast 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.440
 let's stick here to the wall 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.200
 using the spirit level 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.230
 and once decentralized we can 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.870
 proceed to mark where we are going to perform 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.250
 the holes is important that this 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.250
 stay as straight as possible 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.769
 it is very important that before squeezing 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.319
 let's verify that this is at the level of 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.230
 spirit level in the mast and then 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.390
 we proceed to firmly tighten meliÃ¡ 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.390
 completely the hardware 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.150
 how 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.819
 well after having assembled 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.740
 completely already the plate 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.470
 let's first check out everything 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.810
 the level we have our master level 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.030
 let's loosen these two screws that 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.860
 they are here so that the plate can 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.860
 enter and grab what is the mast 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.240
 then I put it 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.800
 17 fixed here there is a red stripe and according to 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.130
 the city where you are installing 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.720
 where you should place them so that 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.850
 can give you the degrees they need 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.590
 well we have arrived with our cable 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.380
 that is not provided our remove from 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.040
 prepaid directv until here and now we go 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:04.760
 to proceed to place the lnb 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.530
 on the plate we are going to grab this part 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.790
 of the connector cable 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.700
 and we're going 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.210
 to screw in here and let's proceed to 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.450
 put him 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.450
 the lnb screw 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.500
 we make sure we truly 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:31.550
 the baby is firm and well 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.770
 subject to the antenna well I have placed 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.560
 TV up here near the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.090
 antenna decoder 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.390
 decoder and I connected the 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.490
 cables that go towards the television I 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.249
 missing by placing the cable that is 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.230
 placed front on the white wire 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.450
 in which 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.170
 I'm going to place in the and in the 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.170
 decoder 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.249
 after this we will follow the steps 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.089
 that are on screen 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.089
 one by one 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.570
 until we get to this screen that we are 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.980
 watching here we proceed to rotate the antenna 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.220
 moving from left to right 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.780
 slowly 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.780
 until we find a signal 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.820
 with 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.820
 slowly 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.620
 as it was in signal and once you have it 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.420
 and listen to the most acute and the most 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.560
 consistent that I can hear that 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.570
 sound that are on the television can 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.970
 then proceed to tighten the antenna 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.210
 we proceed here to finish and continue 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.210
 the steps 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.639
 and once these steps are finished we are 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.930
 ready to call directv for 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.320
 activate our directv team 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.320
