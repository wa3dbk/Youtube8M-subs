00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
chasers which kind of stir were but I

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.819 
chasers which kind of stir were but I
guess<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.090> okay<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.489> Fab<00:00:59.730> five

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
guess it's okay so we have the Fab five

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.920 
guess it's okay so we have the Fab five
to<00:01:01.829> source<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.339> mickeys<00:01:03.980> anything<00:01:04.980> and<00:01:05.930> Chip

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
to source or mickeys anything and Chip

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.840 
to source or mickeys anything and Chip
and<00:01:07.050> Dale<00:01:07.730> and<00:01:09.830> it's<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:10.950> 8-pin<00:01:11.400> cliff<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and Dale and it's an 8-pin cliff and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.670 
and Dale and it's an 8-pin cliff and
like<00:01:11.940> I<00:01:12.030> said<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.480> each<00:01:12.600> box<00:01:12.960> contains<00:01:13.110> two

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680

like I said and each box contains two
randomly<00:01:14.070> selected<00:01:14.520> pin<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:17.670> believe<00:01:17.940> this

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
randomly selected pin and I believe this

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.880 
randomly selected pin and I believe this
