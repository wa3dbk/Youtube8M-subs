reasons
so<00:00:10.530> if<00:00:10.620> Francis<00:00:10.950> volunteered<00:00:11.490> once<00:00:11.759> again<00:00:12.030> and

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
so if Francis volunteered once again and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.620 
so if Francis volunteered once again and
we're<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.080> use<00:00:13.200> an<00:00:13.769> ear<00:00:13.920> cleaner<00:00:14.280> I

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
we're going to use an ear cleaner I

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.580 
we're going to use an ear cleaner I
prefer<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.809> that's<00:00:16.020> prescribed<00:00:16.410> by<00:00:16.560> a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
prefer one that's prescribed by a

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.890 
prefer one that's prescribed by a
veterinary<00:00:16.949> hospital<00:00:17.430> because<00:00:17.720> we're<00:00:18.720> aware

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
veterinary hospital because we're aware

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.210 
veterinary hospital because we're aware
what's<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> ingredients<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.980> think

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
what's in the ingredients and I think

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.109 
what's in the ingredients and I think
there<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> lot<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.789> options

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
there are a lot of options

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.269 
there are a lot of options
over-the-counter<00:00:22.020> some<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:22.830> good<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.220> some

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
over-the-counter some are good and some

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.830 
over-the-counter some are good and some
are<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.269> good<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:26.910> ear<00:00:27.300> canal<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
are not so good so the ear canal of a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.560 
are not so good so the ear canal of a
dog<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.289> much<00:00:28.769> larger<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.640> longer<00:00:30.119> than<00:00:30.449> you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
dog is much larger and longer than you

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.160 
dog is much larger and longer than you
would<00:00:30.660> think

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
would think

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.560 
would think
they<00:00:31.830> actually<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.369> let's<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.360> way

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
they actually have let's do it this way

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.139 
they actually have let's do it this way
I<00:00:33.930> should<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:34.739> an<00:00:34.890> l-shaped<00:00:35.460> canal<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
I should have an l-shaped canal that

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.479 
I should have an l-shaped canal that
goes<00:00:36.329> down<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.989> then<00:00:37.110> forward<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.219> when

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
goes down and then forward and so when

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.860 
goes down and then forward and so when
you're<00:00:38.610> cleaning<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.120> ear<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> clean

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that entire canal as well as the pinna

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.610 
that entire canal as well as the pinna
or<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> outside<00:00:44.129> flap<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> ear<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:46.500> he

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
or the outside flap of the ear and he

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.529 
or the outside flap of the ear and he
has<00:00:46.710> big<00:00:47.039> flaps<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.629> look<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> today<00:00:51.090> we're

see<00:01:54.950> how<00:01:55.009> much<00:01:55.159> is<00:01:55.340> left<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.740> I'll<00:01:57.890> repeat

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
see how much is left and I'll repeat

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.469 
see how much is left and I'll repeat
that<00:01:58.490> until<00:02:00.069> what's<00:02:01.069> coming<00:02:01.429> out<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:01.729> clean<00:02:02.030> so

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
that until what's coming out is clean so

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.960 
that until what's coming out is clean so
right<00:02:02.780> now<00:02:02.960> we've<00:02:03.590> gotten<00:02:03.920> some<00:02:04.100> plenty<00:02:04.880> of

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
right now we've gotten some plenty of

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.830 
right now we've gotten some plenty of
extra<00:02:05.420> material<00:02:06.140> out<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.390> I<00:02:08.390> will<00:02:08.539> also<00:02:08.810> use

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
extra material out and I will also use

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.000 
extra material out and I will also use
cotton<00:02:09.200> balls<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:10.789> swag<00:02:11.660> up<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.170> extra<00:02:12.799> fluid

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
cotton balls to swag up the extra fluid

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.880 
cotton balls to swag up the extra fluid
and<00:02:13.750> when<00:02:14.750> those<00:02:14.900> come<00:02:15.140> out<00:02:15.230> dirty<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:15.799> I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
and when those come out dirty then I

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:25.309 
and when those come out dirty then I
know<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.100> need<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.370> keep<00:02:16.549> clean

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.289 

so<00:02:25.890> again<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.129> do<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> same<00:02:26.549> thing<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.909> fill<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
so again I do the same thing I fill the

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.890 
so again I do the same thing I fill the
canal<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:27.870> then<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.049> massage<00:02:28.439> it<00:02:29.659> and<00:02:30.659> if<00:02:30.780> they

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
canal and then I massage it and if they

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.899 
canal and then I massage it and if they
have<00:02:31.109> an<00:02:31.230> ear<00:02:31.439> infection<00:02:31.469> this<00:02:32.159> part<00:02:32.459> can<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
have an ear infection this part can be a

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.369 
have an ear infection this part can be a
little<00:02:33.000> bit<00:02:33.299> uncomfortable<00:02:33.480> until<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
little bit uncomfortable until the

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.380 
little bit uncomfortable until the
infection<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.920> under<00:02:35.129> control<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.209> he's

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
infection is under control and so he's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.089 
infection is under control and so he's
being<00:02:36.629> very<00:02:36.840> good<00:02:37.079> for<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.379> $7.00<00:02:37.859> would<00:02:37.980> be

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
being very good for it $7.00 would be

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.520 
being very good for it $7.00 would be
very<00:02:38.310> Wiggly<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.879> so<00:02:39.689> a<00:02:39.719> helper<00:02:40.200> isn't

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
very Wiggly and so a helper isn't

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.410 
very Wiggly and so a helper isn't
necessary<00:02:41.069> but<00:02:41.989> can<00:02:42.989> be<00:02:43.200> helpful<00:02:44.120> once<00:02:45.120> again

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
necessary but can be helpful once again

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.319 
necessary but can be helpful once again
I<00:02:45.720> will<00:02:46.379> just<00:02:46.409> absorb<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:47.220> extra<00:02:47.489> before<00:02:48.239> he

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
I will just absorb the extra before he

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.649 
I will just absorb the extra before he
shakes<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.980> just<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.430> you're<00:02:50.519> inside<00:02:50.939> little

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
shakes is just if you're inside little

00:02:51.659 --> 00:03:00.610 
shakes is just if you're inside little
cleaner<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:54.439> we'll<00:02:55.439> let<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.620> shake

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.010 

eventually<00:03:01.239> so<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.360> doesn't<00:03:02.660> want<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.810> shake

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
eventually so it doesn't want to shake

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.850 
eventually so it doesn't want to shake
that's<00:03:03.290> fine

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
that's fine

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.140 
that's fine
and<00:03:04.220> that'll<00:03:04.520> is<00:03:04.580> going<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.819> go<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.030> the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
and that'll is going to go to the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.570 
and that'll is going to go to the
business<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.569> kind<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.840> cleaning<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.980> outer

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
business of kind of cleaning the outer

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.229 
business of kind of cleaning the outer
portion<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.300> year<00:03:08.599> and<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:10.160> prefer<00:03:10.940> not<00:03:11.180> to

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
portion of the year and I prefer not to

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.699 
portion of the year and I prefer not to
have<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.599> stick<00:03:11.810> things<00:03:12.050> down<00:03:12.260> in<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.530> ear

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
have you stick things down in the ear

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.530 
have you stick things down in the ear
canal<00:03:12.830> because<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.760> don't<00:03:13.940> know<00:03:14.120> how<00:03:14.330> far

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
canal because you don't know how far

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.940 
canal because you don't know how far
down<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:14.780> already<00:03:15.080> might<00:03:15.380> actually<00:03:15.590> cause

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
down you already might actually cause

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.589 
down you already might actually cause
some<00:03:16.130> damage<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.030> goal<00:03:17.239> here<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.510> to

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
some damage and the goal here is to

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.710 
some damage and the goal here is to
clean<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.989> ears<00:03:18.200> not<00:03:19.360> create<00:03:20.360> more

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
clean the ears not create more

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.750 
clean the ears not create more
inflammation<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.560> irritation<00:03:21.709> than<00:03:22.280> this<00:03:22.430> is

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
inflammation and irritation than this is

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.150 
inflammation and irritation than this is
necessary<00:03:23.390> so<00:03:23.930> see<00:03:24.110> we're<00:03:24.290> still<00:03:25.069> getting

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
necessary so see we're still getting

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.400 
necessary so see we're still getting
enough<00:03:25.540> debris<00:03:26.540> now<00:03:26.780> when<00:03:26.930> you're<00:03:27.019> just

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
enough debris now when you're just

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.380 
enough debris now when you're just
working<00:03:28.099> on<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.340> outside<00:03:28.760> part<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.209> ear

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
working on the outside part of the ear

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.740 
working on the outside part of the ear
the<00:03:29.420> ear<00:03:29.660> flap<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.459> all<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.610> those<00:03:31.730> folds<00:03:32.569> that

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
the ear flap and all of those folds that

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.559 
the ear flap and all of those folds that
are<00:03:33.410> in<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.739> ear<00:03:33.920> see<00:03:34.670> how<00:03:34.700> many<00:03:34.940> creases<00:03:35.180> and

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
are in the ear see how many creases and

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.210 
are in the ear see how many creases and
crevices<00:03:36.170> there<00:03:36.319> are<00:03:36.530> in<00:03:36.680> there<00:03:36.830> that<00:03:37.010> trap

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
crevices there are in there that trap

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.720 
crevices there are in there that trap
dirt<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.730> debris<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:40.370> use<00:03:40.700> your

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
dirt and debris so you use your

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.840 
dirt and debris so you use your
moistened<00:03:41.360> cotton<00:03:41.540> ball<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.170> just<00:03:42.980> go<00:03:43.670> down

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
moistened cotton ball and just go down

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.990 
moistened cotton ball and just go down
in<00:03:44.030> those<00:03:44.180> grooves<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.769> clean<00:03:46.459> them<00:03:46.670> this<00:03:46.880> is

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
in those grooves and clean them this is

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.050 
in those grooves and clean them this is
much<00:03:47.209> harder<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.569> do<00:03:47.780> on<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.959> little<00:03:48.260> dog<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:49.060> so

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
much harder to do on a little dog and so

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.780 
much harder to do on a little dog and so
in<00:03:50.180> that<00:03:50.330> case<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:50.810> can<00:03:51.049> use<00:03:51.080> a<00:03:51.620> q-tip<00:03:53.739> and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
in that case you can use a q-tip and

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.039 
in that case you can use a q-tip and
getting<00:03:55.790> those<00:03:55.880> crevices<00:03:56.360> again<00:03:56.630> not<00:03:56.870> going

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
getting those crevices again not going

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.720 
getting those crevices again not going
down<00:03:57.290> into<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.709> ear<00:03:57.950> canal<00:03:58.099> itself<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:01.489> that's

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
down into the ear canal itself so that's

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.580 
down into the ear canal itself so that's
how<00:04:01.970> we<00:04:02.030> clean<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.540> ears<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.049> we<00:04:03.260> continue

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
how we clean the ears and we continue

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.530 
how we clean the ears and we continue
doing<00:04:03.709> that<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.700> material<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.299> fluid

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
doing that and so the material the fluid

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.990 
doing that and so the material the fluid
coming<00:04:05.720> out<00:04:05.959> is<00:04:06.260> clean<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.519> ear<00:04:07.700> itself

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
coming out is clean and the ear itself
