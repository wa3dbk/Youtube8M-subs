00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.149
 It has posted a Gundam production video but is a plan 

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:10.360
 I would like to continue the production of the arms of the Perfection Unicorn Gundam. 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.360
 I will 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.740
 Like the last time, here's a perfect Reid Unicorn Gundam's arm 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.910
 Parts of strawberry 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.800
 We cut out 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:32.629
 Notebook This time it is not a part of the frame like the last time, but the exterior part is fine 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:36.510
 Whether this storage of part of it is this side saber saber 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:42.510
 It There are some last communication also is after 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:46.810
 So this winter park with white exterior, I'm always putting in ink here, so this time 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:53.010
 Is already in the corner with vinegar 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:54.320
 So this Psycho frame as the next process is for parts other than this Psycho frame 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.250
 this 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.120
 We think that we want to put on top coat frosting this 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.420
 I wrote clean play so I would like to continue coloring with this weathering master 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.420
 I think you 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.049
 I think that I want to assembly because coloring in weathering massage has been completed 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.850
 bea 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.430
 Te have Tei 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.340
 Hmm 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.020
 They sell 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.890

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.820
 Wait 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.820

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 Hmm 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.380
 stood 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.009
 Hmm 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.009
 Minutes 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.009
 Hmm 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.680
 Hmm 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.990
 Hmm 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.990
 Hmm 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.350
 Hmm 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.970
 me 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.510
 Hm 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.510
 me 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.890
 Hmm 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.890
 Hmm 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.890
 Hmm 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.320
 The parts I heard this time have also been assembled 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:05.890
 The parts I made this time are the same as last time 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:10.930
 Love is the feeling that say to have been able to hand because it is such a partial parts 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:15.550
 So the parts here will be up and running, and if the number is up, it's good. 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.030
 It bends and the beam saber which specs are stored in abeam serve comes out 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.840
 Like 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:26.300
 I think it will be a part connected to the side of the bamboo shoot 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:32.720
 Also here is a psycho frame attached to the back of this one too 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.770
 Up to the production of little by little to be you so true to this kind of parts It is the exterior part of the Te 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.020
 Though 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.380
 I think that I would like to continue making arm parts next time 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.380
 I will 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.550
 Yeah yeah
