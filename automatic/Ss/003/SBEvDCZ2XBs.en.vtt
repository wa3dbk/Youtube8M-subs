00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hi all my good very many of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.840
 you were asked to show me books 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.590
 I recently bought on self-development 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.870
 of motivation 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.299
 express an opinion why and in general decided 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.350
 get them one way or another yes of course 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.449
 none of you expect me to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.460
 full review because big 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 plots did not start reading but 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.359
 something might interest you and plus 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.970
 maybe you can tell me 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.560
 something in the same planida something similar 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.699
 or maybe just just say what 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.250
 made a bad choice 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.680
 let's start and the first two books are 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 austin cleon and his famous steal like 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.879
 artist and show your work on the very 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.860
 It seems to me that these books are first 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.690
 queue for those people whose work 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.040
 occupies the main q is the activity of 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.420
 them creative work 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.340
 as well as for those people who 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.230
 creativity is a hobby that is essentially 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.950
 for almost every person on this 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.960
 the planet 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.699
 the bottom line is that basically you 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.649
 you can safely take other people's ideas 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.789
 somehow mix them up and out 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.530
 getting something new 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.329
 that is, most people just did 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.129
 it's afraid to do it because we want 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.080
 all create something bright something new 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.799
 something else unknown 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.900
 but for the most part it is very rare to whom 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.540
 succeeds i mean more often you don't care 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.729
 get something new even by perry 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.159
 processing the old material therefore 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.259
 it does not need to be afraid and in this way 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.220
 you will develop yourself this is basic 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.979
 the essence of this book 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.920
 well, and besides this here is very very 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.140
 a lot of useful information in 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.299
 principle for even motivating yourself ie 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.530
 it's like a kick in the ass now by golly 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.710
 is she really this book 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.189
 makes you do something and not spend 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.479
 time on this here regretting yourself 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.610
 pondering how useless you are 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.100
 how much you are mediocre and just 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.930
 do-do-do do well and of course 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.869
 the design of this book is amazing to me 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.790
 madly like that here they are pictures and 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.040
 some kind of clippings that is all in the spirit 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.770
 this artist about sting whether it is 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.750
 artist and writer and 2 of his work 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 show your work that is just the same 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.850
 says that most often people 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.770
 who have done something yes they stay 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.590
 unknown and in this book 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.240
 tells how to do so from 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.460
 your work have learned how to overcome their 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.320
 rene fear of criticism well in general 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.390
 yes show your work in nero 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.340
 the next two books also show 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.370
 bundles because this is the one author this 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.710
 barbara cher and and the famous book dream 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.540
 not harmful and what to dream for a lot 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.640
 the account originally came out to dream not 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.010
 although harmful to dream about what it is like 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.050
 prehistory that is what you dream so 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.450
 won't teach us the same 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.810
 what to dream this book teaches us to understand 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.390
 to have to understand ours really 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.360
 our dreams are what they impose on us 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.190
 society and not afraid to dream them not 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.580
 teaches harmful just come to 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.800
 these dreams and these two books are 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.290
 a little apart from my book 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.930
 collections because they are different from 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.670
 of everything I've read before like 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.380
 rule books with positive psychology 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.630
 they are still a bit like each other 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.340
 that is, most often you open this 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.080
 the book and you know what's already somewhere 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.880
 have seen somewhere read something ie 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.900
 just the same subject she discusses 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.300
 in other words 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.280
 this is completely new this is completely 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.620
 another approach is so here 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.990
 blew my mind that I definitely 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.240
 I recommend barber cher to everyone 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.160
 what to dream and and dream is not harmful here 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.560
 This book in my opinion since the 70s and 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.950
 gives up and reprinted and so on then 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.140
 there is the next purchase is a book of change 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.600
 from all done all 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.860
 account this book should teach me how 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.410
 not afraid of change 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.960
 I am inherently rather conservative 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.150
 man, I take it very hard to change 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.020
 I prefer everything to go as I have 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.030
 scheduled 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.850
 but usually live always brings its 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.530
 adjustments and i'm learning just the same 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.210
 to be more flexible not to 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.190
 perceive everything that happened as 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.230
 some kind of tragedy and really hope that 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.240
 this book will help me in this next 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.520
 the house is the rule that Jack wrote 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.830
 canfield and janet switch athos authors 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.020
 project mystery was still somehow famous 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.150
 movie secret book secrets leg u 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.790
 called the secret that is, when someone to 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.700
 to publish this was a translation to be honest 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.500
 the film itself the book itself is a mystery to me not at all 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.450
 liked it because it is the same 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.060
 the thought that is just being mined 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.799
 you feel like they want you 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.260
 hypnotize and you have long understood 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.459
 general that what is done until all than to 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.620
 dodge 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.140
 and I continue to grind again 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.060
 I don't like this so somehow I am a little bit 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.700
 I was suspicious of this book, but 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.100
 when I looked through I saw that all the same 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.410
 no, there seems to be different ideas 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.170
 these are really separate rules 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.120
 some examples from life and increasingly 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.090
 specific just the same as all i love 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.350
 so still certain hopes for 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.780
 I lay this book 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.420
 and pluses and praised Oksana twin very much 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.580
 your time therefore I will give the rule from jack 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.560
 canfield and janet sweater a next 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.620
 the book talked very very much and tony 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.110
 jay and and important years is acting 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.510
 a practicing psychologist and she thought 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.280
 she is considering what in 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.530
 the period between twenty and thirty 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.540
 years just did lay the foundation 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.580
 for the future, that's all you do 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.650
 then just the same leads us 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.050
 certain result and in this book 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.390
 tells how important it is not to sit 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.330
 don't wipe your pants but do something for 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.880
 to invest in your future 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.950
 your future here the whole book is broken by 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.470
 categories by chapters 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.850
 main issues that are addressed 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.830
 this work is love the mind and body are very 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.750
 I hope that this book will give me a powerful 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.880
 kick like so many others who like 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.670
 since they advised me this book 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.710
 so hit mag jay and and important years 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.050
 the next book is already from the field more 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.420
 applied psychology is this year I 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.070
 about how to change your habits like 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.440
 start doing something in general about when 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.270
 imagine this powerful kick in the ass which 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.910
 just the same advice to give the previous one 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.890
 the book hasn't read anything concrete yet 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.970
 I can not say but again lay 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.700
 she has high hopes 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.950
 very similar in nature this is 12 weeks 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.890
 ready authors brian moran or 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.240
 or moran and michael levin k'tan like 12 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.890
 weeks to do more than others 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.590
 have time for 12 months 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.300
 the main approach of the authors is that when 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.980
 we set ourselves goals for the year we 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.870
 simply believe that we still have 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.210
 a lot of time or vice versa goal 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.980
 seems to us a very big impracticable 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.110
 he is simply doing nothing 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.590
 the most correct moment is to break your 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.420
 year into pieces for 12 weeks that is 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.280
 it turns out for three months and just 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.169
 just focus on these 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.020
 trainings are you for these three months and in 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.210
 planning 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.080
 and in fulfilling their goals in general 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.240
 about this approach 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.849
 if that book is very thin 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.069
 I do not know the author's concept 12 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.710
 week year right so everything is powerful on 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:47.210
 in fact, everything is very simple but I want 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.550
 more yes how to get acquainted that they 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.500
 want to convey specifically in general yes yes 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.940
 let's see well the last of this 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.340
 piles are also pretty similar 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.550
 authors gentle and field mark victor 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.590
 Hansen and the forest and Yuit whole life or 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.870
 aimless to live in general about how 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.330
 it's important to set goals for your life about how 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.190
 reach them you know i'm looking at 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.780
 here is this pile especially for the last 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.819
 books it seems that I am so 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.650
 limp person who is nothing 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:14.419
 who can do what he does not know 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.270
 wants which is completely lost and 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.800
 who needs some kicks at 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.930
 measure map selection of books be logged 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.599
 that's about it even a little bit strange and 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.849
 scary in general it was all mine 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.560
 shopping I really hope that you are 

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:29.300
 read these books share with me 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.870
 your opinion maybe you will advise
