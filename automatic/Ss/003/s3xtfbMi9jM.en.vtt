00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.150
 hello how about friends how are you in years 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.520
 knight mary welcome to this new 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.080
 video jong's job is to help his 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.360
 colleagues to maintain control of 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.920
 game by means of cannes and when one 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.720
 it goes well and it manages to kill the enemy 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.550
 many wonder what can be done 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.039
 then go to help other lines 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.570
 return to their jungle or they can keep 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.820
 pressure to the line which they have just 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.980
 help with a gang return to the jungle 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.900
 or helping your classmates is something very 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.760
 simple to think you just have to see 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.309
 the situation around you and it will be 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.989
 easy to make a decision but when 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.239
 try to decide if you should help 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.610
 keep pressure on a line here there are 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.769
 several things that you have to evaluate 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.409
 first you have to think about why you should 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.390
 put pressure on a line then 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.640
 you do a gang everything goes well and you achieve 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.650
 killing the enemy here is where so much you 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.869
 as your partner can take advantage of 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.220
 keep the line under pressure since you 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:59.949
 you want to create a golden gap and 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.290
 experience in a line between more gold and 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.030
 experience get your older partner 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.760
 will be the advantage you will get before your 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.560
 enemy now another way to get 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.600
 that gap is to deny the subjects to 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.190
 enemy this you're going to get at 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.390
 press the line and make your 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.790
 subjects be hit 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.440
 by the enemy tower in this way the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.570
 tower will be taking the gold of the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.550
 subjects and your enemy will be late 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.409
 another reason why you want 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.930
 pressing a line is because you need 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.270
 gold and experience for you and that's what 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.310
 you will get killing subjects but of 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.350
 this way the press a line and 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.360
 killing subjects can be a small 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.850
 fee for the gun that in which just 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.470
 help since that gang takes a bit of 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.950
 your time that could have served you to be 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.150
 in the jungle get gold and experience 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.300
 so that you do not fall behind is you must 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.070
 to charge a small fee, let's go to the 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.869
 next question is when is the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.149
 best time to press a line 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.280
 every time they get to kill the enemy with 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.869
 a gang helps to press the line already 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.759
 that this will be very important for 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.890
 get the goals that is to go 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.210
 throwing towers killing the dragon or 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.490
 get jong's attention the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.080
 enemy if they manage to get your attention 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.390
 your partners in the other lines 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.030
 will have a greater freedom to kill 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.769
 your enemies or press the lines already 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.950
 that the enemy tremor will be busy 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.630
 as to be able to help his companions 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.519
 our next question is when not 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.740
 is the best time to press a 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.480
 line suppose you did a 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.700
 but the enemy managed to kill your 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.470
 partner then if your partner does not 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.450
 is I recommend that you do not pressure the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.790
 line since he will not be there for 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.310
 take gold and experience and instead of 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.560
 help him you would be falling behind if this 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.850
 it happens to just freeze the line and 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.400
 this you will get by giving him the 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.350
 Last blow to enemy minions like this 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.970
 the line does not advance and your partner may 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.820
 calmly return to continue to 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.220
 peeing subjects also do not you think 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.680
 press the line when the enemy has 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.150
 pressed your partner a lot 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.480
 been under tower and you have been denied 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.850
 many subjects as you can see in that 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.160
 situation your partner was late and 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.780
 will have lost a lot of gold and experience and 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.490
 if you try to help him by pressing the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.650
 line and make it reach the tower of 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.560
 enemy so you would be exposing it to a 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.050
 attack since in that delay he lost gold and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.360
 lost experience that means that the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.750
 enemy can exceed the level or that 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.550
 have more objects purchased 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.530
 Then the best thing you can do is 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.060
 help your partner by freezing the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.070
 line at a point that does not represent a 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.740
 risk to your partner and where 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.300
 can permeate freely sudden good 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.860
