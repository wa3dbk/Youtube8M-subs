under<00:02:44.250> there<00:02:57.080> okay<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:58.320> may<00:02:58.440> lose<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.740> little

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
under there okay so we may lose a little

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.880 
under there okay so we may lose a little
bit<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.310> antifreeze<00:02:59.670> here<00:03:00.210> you<00:03:00.930> could<00:03:01.230> you

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
bit of antifreeze here you could you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.340 
bit of antifreeze here you could you
could<00:03:02.100> drain<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> little<00:03:02.640> bit<00:03:02.730> out<00:03:02.880> from<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
could drain a little bit out from the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.860 
could drain a little bit out from the
bottom<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.800> radiator<00:03:05.450> I'm<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.630> garage

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
bottom of the radiator I'm in a garage

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.900 
bottom of the radiator I'm in a garage
so<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.740> going<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.980> leak<00:03:08.190> onto<00:03:08.340> my<00:03:08.520> floor<00:03:08.700> and

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
so it's going to leak onto my floor and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.100 
so it's going to leak onto my floor and
I'll<00:03:08.970> clean<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.270> up<00:03:09.360> afterwards<00:03:09.690> if<00:03:09.990> you're

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
I'll clean it up afterwards if you're

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.850 
I'll clean it up afterwards if you're
outside<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:11.610> might<00:03:11.790> want<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.740> drain<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:13.770> little

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
outside you might want to drain a little

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.810 
outside you might want to drain a little
bit<00:03:14.130> out<00:03:14.280> obviously<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.330> don't<00:03:15.510> want<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:16.820> let

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
bit out obviously you don't want to let

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.670 
bit out obviously you don't want to let
your<00:03:17.970> animals<00:03:18.720> around<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.140> stuff<00:03:19.380> because

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
your animals around this stuff because

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.960 
your animals around this stuff because
they<00:03:19.770> actually<00:03:19.920> like<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.370> taste<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.820> and

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
they actually like the taste of it and

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.810 
they actually like the taste of it and
it's<00:03:21.060> it's<00:03:21.240> it's<00:03:21.720> not<00:03:21.810> good<00:03:22.140> for<00:03:22.170> them<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.820> make

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
it's it's it's not good for them so make

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.400 
it's it's it's not good for them so make
sure<00:03:23.850> you're<00:03:24.120> cautious<00:03:24.630> when<00:03:24.990> you're<00:03:25.080> working

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
sure you're cautious when you're working

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.480 
sure you're cautious when you're working
with<00:03:25.440> any<00:03:25.650> freeze<00:03:25.950> let's<00:03:26.250> see<00:03:26.340> if<00:03:26.400> we<00:03:26.490> lose<00:03:26.670> any

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.360 

hardly<00:03:32.490> any<00:03:32.640> at<00:03:32.850> all<00:03:33.890> I'm<00:03:34.890> just<00:03:35.040> gonna<00:03:35.130> reach

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
hardly any at all I'm just gonna reach

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.330 
hardly any at all I'm just gonna reach
under<00:03:35.610> here<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.820> grab<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.209> thermostat<00:03:38.660> okay

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
under here and grab the thermostat okay

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.820 
under here and grab the thermostat okay
so<00:03:41.340> there's<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.670> old<00:03:41.700> one<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.300> notice<00:03:43.230> how<00:03:43.560> it

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
so there's the old one and notice how it

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.980 
so there's the old one and notice how it
came<00:03:44.040> out<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.610> can<00:03:44.820> put<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.209> new<00:03:45.630> one<00:03:45.810> in

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
came out so you can put the new one in

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.520 
came out so you can put the new one in
the<00:03:46.290> same<00:03:46.320> way<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.930> obviously<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.050> protrudes

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
the same way so obviously it protrudes

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.500 
the same way so obviously it protrudes
down<00:03:50.090> into<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:52.320> block<00:03:53.209> okay<00:03:54.209> I'm<00:03:54.270> just<00:03:54.390> going

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
down into the block okay I'm just going

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.870 
down into the block okay I'm just going
to<00:03:54.600> take<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.720> clean<00:03:55.020> rag<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.680> clean<00:03:56.459> up<00:03:56.730> around

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
to take a clean rag and clean up around

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.229 
to take a clean rag and clean up around
each<00:03:59.450> side<00:04:01.130> we<00:04:02.130> put<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.459> back<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.850> has<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.000> good

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
each side we put it back it has a good

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.150 
each side we put it back it has a good
seal<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.989> not<00:04:04.140> like<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.410> old<00:04:04.560> ones<00:04:04.830> we<00:04:05.010> have

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
seal it's not like the old ones we have

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.790 
seal it's not like the old ones we have
to<00:04:05.250> actually<00:04:05.520> scrape<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.940> gasket<00:04:06.390> off<00:04:06.800> because

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
to actually scrape a gasket off because

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.030 
to actually scrape a gasket off because
it<00:04:08.100> actually<00:04:08.280> has<00:04:09.590> like<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.739> rubber<00:04:10.980> o-ring

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
it actually has like a rubber o-ring

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.390 
it actually has like a rubber o-ring
instead<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:13.110> if<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.350> get<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> thermostat

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
instead so if you get a thermostat

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.740 
instead so if you get a thermostat
you're<00:04:14.610> looking<00:04:14.820> for<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.090> old-style

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
you're looking for the old-style

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.349 
you're looking for the old-style
gasket<00:04:16.580> it's<00:04:17.580> not<00:04:17.730> going<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.940> be<00:04:18.030> there<00:04:18.209> this

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
gasket it's not going to be there this

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:34.580 
gasket it's not going to be there this
is<00:04:18.510> what<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.720> get<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:22.680> drops<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.130> like<00:04:23.340> this

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.360 

yeah<00:04:35.590> we're<00:04:35.770> gonna<00:04:35.860> put<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.130> all<00:04:36.190> back

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
yeah we're gonna put it all back

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.880 
together okay and like with most of my
videos<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.800> always<00:04:42.010> say<00:04:42.190> finger<00:04:42.610> tighten<00:04:42.970> first

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
videos I always say finger tighten first

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.450 
videos I always say finger tighten first
you<00:04:44.890> want<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.100> make<00:04:45.160> sure<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:47.710> bolt<00:04:47.980> or

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
the nut or the stud is all properly

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.670 
the nut or the stud is all properly
threaded<00:04:52.510> before<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:53.020> start<00:04:53.290> hitting<00:04:53.440> it

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
threaded before you start hitting it

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.980 
threaded before you start hitting it
with<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.830> ratchet<00:04:54.450> because<00:04:55.450> if<00:04:55.570> it's<00:04:55.750> cross

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
with a ratchet because if it's cross

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.210 
with a ratchet because if it's cross
threaded<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.560> start<00:04:56.770> hitting<00:04:56.980> it<00:04:57.040> with<00:04:57.190> a

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
threaded you start hitting it with a

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.520 
threaded you start hitting it with a
ratchet<00:04:57.750> you're<00:04:58.750> gonna<00:04:58.960> make<00:04:59.170> it<00:04:59.320> worse

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
ratchet you're gonna make it worse

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.890 
ratchet you're gonna make it worse
when<00:05:00.310> your<00:05:00.460> finger<00:05:00.760> tighten<00:05:01.120> if<00:05:01.450> it's<00:05:01.660> crossed

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
when your finger tighten if it's crossed

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.240 
when your finger tighten if it's crossed
right<00:05:02.140> it's<00:05:02.440> probably<00:05:02.560> not<00:05:02.770> going<00:05:03.010> to<00:05:03.070> do<00:05:03.220> too

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
right it's probably not going to do too

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.360 
right it's probably not going to do too
much<00:05:03.490> damage<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:04.710> let<00:05:05.710> me<00:05:05.770> get<00:05:05.920> the<00:05:06.010> ratchet

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
much damage so let me get the ratchet

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.510 
much damage so let me get the ratchet
here<00:05:09.630> okay<00:05:10.830> next<00:05:11.830> we<00:05:12.040> have<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:12.280> put<00:05:12.430> the
