and<00:04:20.820> it's<00:04:20.970> really<00:04:21.239> hard<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.720> tell<00:04:21.930> which<00:04:22.290> team

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
and it's really hard to tell which team

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.950 
and it's really hard to tell which team
is<00:04:22.830> gonna<00:04:22.980> come<00:04:23.310> out<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.360> split<00:04:24.720> as<00:04:24.900> the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
is gonna come out of this split as the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.290 
is gonna come out of this split as the
strongest<00:04:25.740> European<00:04:26.430> team<00:04:26.640> in<00:04:26.790> two<00:04:26.940> or<00:04:27.060> three

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
strongest European team in two or three

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.300 
strongest European team in two or three
I<00:04:27.330> think<00:04:27.450> most<00:04:28.140> people<00:04:28.320> have<00:04:28.680> these<00:04:28.950> three

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
I think most people have these three

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.740 
I think most people have these three
down<00:04:29.520> at<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.790> beginning<00:04:29.910> of<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.570> summer

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
down at the beginning of the summer

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.390 
down at the beginning of the summer
split<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.200> go<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.440> Worlds<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:31.980> it's<00:04:32.280> not

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
split to go to Worlds and it's not

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.340 
split to go to Worlds and it's not
exactly<00:04:32.850> what<00:04:33.120> they're<00:04:33.300> gonna<00:04:33.419> do<00:04:33.690> now<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
exactly what they're gonna do now the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.020 
exactly what they're gonna do now the
