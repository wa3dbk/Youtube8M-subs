on the hood in particular the

which gives you wider peripheral vision
so<00:04:01.260> normally<00:04:01.470> when<00:04:01.680> you're<00:04:01.800> wearing<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.130> hood

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
so normally when you're wearing a hood

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.470 
so normally when you're wearing a hood
it<00:04:02.430> feels<00:04:02.640> like<00:04:02.820> you're<00:04:02.940> wearing<00:04:03.120> blinkers

which is why most racing sailors would
