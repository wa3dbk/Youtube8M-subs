00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.240
 The Russian writer Dimitri Glukhovsky describes in his novel 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.499
 Metro 2033 a scenario in Moscow in the not too distant future 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.909
 The city has become completely uninhabitable after a nuclear war 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.590
 all the people who meet this wave 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.580
 have fled to the subway and deadlines their existence now under the ground 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 But life in NATO is not completely harmless 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.339
 in the shafts lurking horrible mutants and crazy 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:35.050
 People 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.210
 The 20-year-old Art leadership already gets the job from his hometown 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.180
 to defend a previously unknown threat that one generally became the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.310
 call black 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.860
 Thun is now struggling with Metro 2033 for the Xbox at 60 the game to the book on the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.270
 market 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.950
 In the nearly seven-hour campaign of the game, you fight with actions 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.069
 through the subway network 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.749
 Complete tasks and deal with a variety of opponents 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.630
 Metro 2033 to counter shooter 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.870
 the strong of the dense storey of the enthralling atmosphere and the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.869
 Lives characters who are more likely to meet your way 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.840
 towards the beginning of the game you fight mainly against the standard 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.350
 Mutants do not pose a major threat to your initial complaints 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.510
 should represent 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.939
 but at the beginning the firefights are a rarity 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.189
 rather, the first with the morbid beauty and the eerie 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.189
 Apparitions of the ailing Huber network made familiar 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.939
 the tasks the Artiom has to fulfill in a very linear gameplay 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.939
 shooters are typical Pierre simple failed 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.560
 At this point, for example, a start would have to collapse so that the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.560
 Mutants can no longer penetrate to a station 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.040
 just look for a bomb Â»that randomly and conveniently 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.040
 This place was forgotten and then it is time to run 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.280
 In some places, the game makes you choose whether you prefer to proceed with care 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.900
 follows or just unpacks the CNOOC and shoots everything 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.519
 In these bandits camp here it is necessary to liberate a companion of the 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.819
 Bad guys have been captured 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.719
 either could now slowly sneak around clearing all the lights 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.079
 and turn off the opponents in ambush 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.079
 or she is missing as we here the rabiate tour 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.119
 but pay particular attention to being constantly in cover 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.120
 the TUI of the opponents is not terrific 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.120
 but the guys meet pretty much 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.829
 as if the mutant and bandit threat were not big 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:50.600
 enough 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.100
 In the course of the game, Artyom also has to deal with fanatical supporters 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.829
 beating two camps 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.649
 For one thing, there would be the Communists to the other the airline has seen 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:05.409
 yes, even a hundred years after the Second World War this conflict gets under 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.279
 the Russian Erdem new explosiveness 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:12.439
 Artyom device, of course, just loud between the enemy lines 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:18.069
 every now and then when you wheel the boy here also the gun of a vehicle 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.560
 and promote the Nazis Communists and Bhutan 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.609
 with big caliber into the team Seitz 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.089
 these sections loosen the otherwise very tense mood of the game 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.089
 always excellent 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.849
 Again and again it takes the young hero on his way to other Oberon 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:36.600
 stations 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.769
 where people have settled 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.349
 Here you can increase your arsenal or old Muslims 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.519
 Buy now or new gas masks filters 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.969
 that's worth it because the men of the ball have gotten your butt mostly 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.700
 more punch or nice touches like a flared up riflescope 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.959
 Incidentally, the currency used in Metro 2033 is ammunition 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.789
 they are available in high quality and simple design, the former 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.049
 much more value 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.400
 Therefore, always scour the environment or rattle after a fight 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.919
 defeated opponents 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.659
 40 4 percent 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.709
 but Artiom is not always under the ground 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.000
 every now and then it goes to the surface in the middle of the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.029
 post-apocalyptic Moscow 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:27.729
 and although the outside of the world is also very consistent Kontny 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.460
 Outdoor missions unlike the metro levels strong lack of tension 

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:34.809
 and deal with monotonous labbadia 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:38.759
 By the way, the excursion to the surface does not work without protective measures 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.029
 Not 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.650
 the wearing of a gas mask is the highest duty because of the contaminated air 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.990
 but watch out that the mutants or humans do not protect you 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.639
 destroy because then your trip to ruined Moscow to Villingen 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.639
 such annoying seconds over 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.849
 Metro 2033 clearly lives from its enthralling atmosphere 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.290
 if you sneak around with the submachine gun creating a creak of the Metro 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.870
 only the light shines your hands to the surroundings and you everywhere the 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.270
 Cries of mutants hear 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.270
 Kurt Scheuch more than once his heart in his pants 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:22.419
 the graphics are extremely well done especially the light and 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.330
 Particle effects make for a scary-beautiful atmosphere 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.409
 suitable 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.550
 By the way, for the full enjoyment that should be with a decent sound 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.680
 System and play in the dark 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.400
 The background noise in the upper layers is clearly better 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.300
 border 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.960
 Unfortunately the german voice does not keep this high level close 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.340
 Although the synchronization is quite neat but the Russian accent 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.339
 now often too much 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.939
 So we can recommend Metro 2033 to anyone who likes the atmosphere 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:55.389
 close 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.599
 an unknown culprit with a counter-gate that we think 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.349
 eat
