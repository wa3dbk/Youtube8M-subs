hoe yourself if you're doing this just

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.229 
hoe yourself if you're doing this just
on<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> one-off<00:02:36.500> occasion<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.430> like<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.790> said<00:02:38.000> I

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
on a one-off occasion so like I said I

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.259 
on a one-off occasion so like I said I
got<00:02:38.600> these<00:02:38.810> with<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.260> height<00:02:39.500> as<00:02:39.940> 5.5<00:02:40.940> there's

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
got these with the height as 5.5 there's

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.170 
got these with the height as 5.5 there's
a<00:02:41.330> platform<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:42.019> here<00:02:42.590> always<00:02:43.190> if<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.030> have

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
a platform in here always if you have

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.729 
a platform in here always if you have
somebody<00:02:44.360> that's<00:02:44.600> not<00:02:44.900> capable<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.410> wearing

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
somebody that's not capable of wearing

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.920 
somebody that's not capable of wearing
heels<00:02:45.980> or<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.850> has<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.209> worn<00:02:47.450> heels<00:02:47.630> very

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
heels or that has it worn heels very

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.229 
heels or that has it worn heels very
often<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.950> should<00:02:48.980> get<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> platform<00:02:49.850> because

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
often you should get a platform because

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.360 
often you should get a platform because
it<00:02:50.360> means<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.750> actual<00:02:51.200> distance<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:52.070> this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
it means the actual distance like this

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.390 
it means the actual distance like this
angle<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:53.150> lower<00:02:53.930> which<00:02:54.829> will<00:02:55.070> make<00:02:55.220> them

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
angle is lower which will make them

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.340 
angle is lower which will make them
easier<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.910> walk<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.269> okay<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.900> higher<00:02:57.110> the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
easier to walk in okay the higher the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.199 
easier to walk in okay the higher the
platform<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.160> know<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.700> sounds<00:02:59.060> really

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
platform I know it sounds really

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.240 
platform I know it sounds really
confusing<00:02:59.930> but<00:03:00.140> if<00:03:00.290> it's<00:03:00.440> just<00:03:00.829> a<00:03:00.980> platform

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
confusing but if it's just a platform

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.340 
confusing but if it's just a platform
and<00:03:01.790> not<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.030> platform<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.870> heel<00:03:03.079> it's

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
and not a platform and the heel it's

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.990 
and not a platform and the heel it's
gonna<00:03:03.530> be<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.980> same<00:03:04.250> as<00:03:04.459> walking<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
gonna be the same as walking on the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.729 
gonna be the same as walking on the
ground<00:03:05.209> but<00:03:05.780> anyway<00:03:06.110> I'm<00:03:06.170> getting<00:03:06.320> off<00:03:06.530> track

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
ground but anyway I'm getting off track

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.979 
ground but anyway I'm getting off track
I<00:03:07.070> meant<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.459> say<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.850> these<00:03:08.030> shoes<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.630> think

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
I meant to say that these shoes I think

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.170 
I meant to say that these shoes I think
the<00:03:09.620> law<00:03:09.799> should<00:03:09.829> you<00:03:10.160> get<00:03:10.310> them<00:03:10.489> was<00:03:10.700> three

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
the law should you get them was three

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.420 
the law should you get them was three
inches<00:03:11.390> which<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:11.989> no<00:03:12.500> very<00:03:12.739> big<00:03:12.980> at<00:03:13.100> all<00:03:13.160> guys

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
inches which is no very big at all guys

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.840 
inches which is no very big at all guys
and<00:03:13.850> then<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.959> think<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.070> highest<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.549> I<00:03:16.610> saw

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
and then I think the highest that I saw

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.000 
and then I think the highest that I saw
them<00:03:17.030> at<00:03:17.269> was<00:03:17.540> seven<00:03:18.049> inches<00:03:18.380> which<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.620> very

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
them at was seven inches which is very

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.800 
them at was seven inches which is very
tall<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.880> just<00:03:20.090> wanted<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.390> tell<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.660> guys
