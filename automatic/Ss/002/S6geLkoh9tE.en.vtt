00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.279
 the Brazilian rail network is composed of 28 thousand to 5 thousand kilometers 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.960
 of railways 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.590
 since its concession program completed in December 1998 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.130
 as almost all the mesh is well manage are private initiative 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.570
 by laying off the construction of the railway contours of the capitals and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.330
 of some major cities in the country to eliminate critical points 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.110
 such as congested roads forming long queues 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.680
 and lack of adequate access to high modal betting 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.130
 are considered exits from the 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.130
 various sectors of the port operation 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.290
 the railway modal is of great importance for the Brazilian market and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.690
 can still be better explored 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.390
 the great advantage in day 3 is the possibility of transporting 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390
 large volumes of volumes over long distances 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.680
 according to the national association of railroad transporters to mtf 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.770
 the participation of the railroads in the transport matrix of Brazil has been increasing 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.150
 year by year 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.910
 19% in 1999 increased to 24% in 2003 and 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.810
 to reach 30% in two years 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.270
 still taka techniques that the international reference is 42 percent of the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.560
 participation 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.560
 a challenge for Brazilian railroads 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.040
 according to ANTT the Brazilian railway system has 29 798 thousand 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.220
 kilometers in length 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.579
 the rail freight concessionaires 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.430
 pronaf serves more than 70 thousand wagons are responsible for transporting 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.849
 more than 200 million tons per kilometer useful tku hours 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.169
 this number puts Brazil in seventh place in the world ranking in 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.209
 railway movement 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.900
 In addition, the national rail sector of the 75% 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.900
 rails across Latin America 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.239
 mtf also inform the railway sector to make a decisive contribution 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.930
 for the surplus held by Brazil with the exports of products 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.239
 industrial and agricultural minerals
