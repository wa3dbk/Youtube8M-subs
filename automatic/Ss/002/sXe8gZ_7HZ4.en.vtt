kind of almost walking in place at the

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.190 
kind of almost walking in place at the
end<00:01:37.399> but<00:01:37.970> I'm<00:01:38.090> really<00:01:38.360> working<00:01:38.600> as<00:01:38.810> hard<00:01:38.929> as<00:01:39.110> I

I<00:01:40.610> think<00:01:40.880> that's<00:01:41.090> where<00:01:41.240> comedy<00:01:41.600> comes<00:01:41.780> from

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
I think that's where comedy comes from

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.260 
I think that's where comedy comes from
is<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.170> unique<00:01:42.640> perspective<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.670> some<00:01:44.030> people

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
is a unique perspective that some people

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.460 
is a unique perspective that some people
can<00:01:44.390> relate<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:44.899> even<00:01:45.140> if<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.289> can't

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
can relate to but even if you can't

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.109 
can relate to but even if you can't
relate<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:45.920> kind<00:01:46.220> of<00:01:46.280> opens<00:01:46.580> up<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:46.880> world

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
relate to it kind of opens up this world
