doing<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.200> on

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
doing it on

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.620 
doing it on
a<00:02:15.470> card<00:02:16.470> or<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.400> clothes<00:02:17.880> or<00:02:18.090> something<00:02:18.450> but

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
a card or on clothes or something but

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.360 
a card or on clothes or something but
where<00:02:18.810> I'm<00:02:18.990> working<00:02:19.260> with<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.650> flower<00:02:19.920> that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
where I'm working with a flower that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.100 
where I'm working with a flower that
tends<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.240> move<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.630> petals<00:02:21.930> are<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
tends to move and the petals are a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.630 
tends to move and the petals are a
little<00:02:22.230> bit<00:02:22.410> fragile<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.980> got<00:02:23.220> my<00:02:23.340> needlenose

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
little bit fragile I got my needlenose

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.930 
little bit fragile I got my needlenose
tweezers<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.960> i<00:02:25.740> found<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.040> lot<00:02:26.280> worked<00:02:26.760> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
tweezers and i found that lot worked a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.860 
tweezers and i found that lot worked a
lot<00:02:27.120> better<00:02:27.830> with<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:30.060> actually<00:02:30.240> have

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
lot better with this you actually have

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.390 
lot better with this you actually have
the<00:02:31.200> safety<00:02:31.410> switch<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.160> have<00:02:32.310> to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
the safety switch that you have to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.750 
the safety switch that you have to
switch<00:02:32.610> on<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.350> then<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.980> push<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.580> button

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
switch on and then you push this button

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.460 
switch on and then you push this button
and<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.240> lights<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.630> up<00:02:36.750> for<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.410> that's

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
and it lights it up for you and that's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.320 
and it lights it up for you and that's
how<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.709> know<00:02:37.860> it's<00:02:38.010> working<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.940> tip<00:02:39.120> gets

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
how you know it's working the tip gets

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.480 
how you know it's working the tip gets
really<00:02:39.660> hot<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:40.709> found<00:02:40.860> out<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.220> hard<00:02:41.250> way

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
really hot and we found out the hard way

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.720 
really hot and we found out the hard way
as<00:02:41.970> my<00:02:42.780> daughter<00:02:43.020> was<00:02:43.520> slipped<00:02:44.520> off<00:02:44.700> that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
as my daughter was slipped off that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.070 
as my daughter was slipped off that
actually<00:02:45.450> will<00:02:45.600> melt<00:02:45.870> step<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:47.450> flower<00:02:48.450> petal

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
actually will melt step the flower petal

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.110 
actually will melt step the flower petal
got<00:02:49.350> kind<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.860> singed<00:02:50.250> there<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.820> really

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
got kind of singed there so this really

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.330 
got kind of singed there so this really
does<00:02:51.420> heat<00:02:51.690> up<00:02:51.840> well<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.830> keep<00:02:53.040> your<00:02:53.160> fingers

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
does heat up well so keep your fingers

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.040 
does heat up well so keep your fingers
out<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.850> way<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.360> if<00:02:54.540> you've<00:02:54.690> got<00:02:54.840> little

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
out of the way and if you've got little

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.170 
out of the way and if you've got little
kids<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.500> isn't<00:02:55.800> something<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.220> they

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
kids this isn't something that they

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.800 
kids this isn't something that they
would<00:02:57.390> do<00:02:58.170> anyway<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.280> basically<00:02:59.940> can<00:03:00.420> put

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
would do anyway you basically can put

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.990 
would do anyway you basically can put
them<00:03:00.989> anywhere<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.680> use<00:03:01.950> any<00:03:02.160> design<00:03:02.610> you

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
them anywhere and use any design you

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.510 
them anywhere and use any design you
want<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.840> have<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.320> for<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.830> few<00:03:05.010> seconds<00:03:05.400> I

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
want to have this on for a few seconds I

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.640 
want to have this on for a few seconds I
found<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.150> tip<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.360> heat<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:06.840> before<00:03:07.470> you

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
found for the tip to heat up before you

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.260 
found for the tip to heat up before you
actually<00:03:07.860> place<00:03:08.430> these<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:08.670> here<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.090> have

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
actually place these on here and have

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.500 
actually place these on here and have
them<00:03:09.420> adhere<00:03:09.570> but<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> back<00:03:10.860> has<00:03:11.150> adhesive<00:03:12.150> on

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
them adhere but the back has adhesive on

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.160 
them adhere but the back has adhesive on
it<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:14.040> found<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.430> if<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.670> hold<00:03:14.910> them<00:03:15.030> on

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
it and I found that if you hold them on

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.260 
it and I found that if you hold them on
for<00:03:16.170> about<00:03:16.260> three<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.680> four<00:03:16.920> seconds<00:03:17.400> that

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
for about three to four seconds that

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.330 
for about three to four seconds that
will<00:03:18.480> heat<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.049> adhere<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.100> flower

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
will heat it and adhere it to the flower

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.699 
will heat it and adhere it to the flower
if<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.180> hold<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.450> much<00:03:21.510> longer<00:03:21.570> than<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.080> the

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
if you hold it much longer than that the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.590 
if you hold it much longer than that the
adhesive<00:03:23.190> actually<00:03:23.549> leaks<00:03:24.180> out<00:03:24.390> from

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
adhesive actually leaks out from

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.770 
adhesive actually leaks out from
underneath<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:26.400> bling<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:27.360> see<00:03:27.630> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
underneath the bling and you can see it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.160 
underneath the bling and you can see it
and<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.080> doesn't<00:03:28.440> disappear<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:30.840> flower<00:03:31.019> is

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.800 
pattern like with every other petal make
sure<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:05.430> you've<00:04:05.549> got<00:04:05.579> an<00:04:05.850> even<00:04:06.000> number<00:04:06.450> or

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
sure that you've got an even number or

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.870 
sure that you've got an even number or
do<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> little<00:04:07.769> bit<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:07.920> math<00:04:08.190> there<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:08.790> you

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
do a little bit of math there so you

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.360 
do a little bit of math there so you
don't<00:04:09.090> end<00:04:09.209> up<00:04:09.390> with<00:04:10.079> two<00:04:10.290> smack<00:04:10.590> together<00:04:11.010> if

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
don't end up with two smack together if

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.400 
don't end up with two smack together if
you<00:04:11.700> were<00:04:11.820> wanting<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.329> do<00:04:12.510> every<00:04:12.840> other<00:04:12.959> petal

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
you were wanting to do every other petal

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.039 
you were wanting to do every other petal
so<00:04:13.829> in<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.790> case<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.150> know<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.510> I'm<00:04:15.630> safe<00:04:15.900> to

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
so in this case I know that I'm safe to

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.659 
so in this case I know that I'm safe to
do<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.380> so<00:04:17.160> I'll<00:04:17.519> take<00:04:17.729> my<00:04:18.320> first<00:04:19.669> little

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
do that so I'll take my first little

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.300 
do that so I'll take my first little
rhinestone<00:04:21.299> here<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.979> position<00:04:22.979> it<00:04:23.130> where<00:04:23.280> I

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
rhinestone here and position it where I

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.820 
rhinestone here and position it where I
want<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.760> like<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.570> said<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.810> find<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.410> needle

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
want it like I said I find the needle

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.070 
want it like I said I find the needle
nose<00:04:25.979> tweezers<00:04:26.400> worked<00:04:26.669> a<00:04:26.760> lot<00:04:26.910> better<00:04:27.210> for

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
nose tweezers worked a lot better for

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.820 
nose tweezers worked a lot better for
this

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
this

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.340 
this
you<00:04:29.790> can<00:04:29.940> hold<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.690> couple<00:04:31.110> different

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
you can hold this a couple different

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.560 
you can hold this a couple different
ways<00:04:31.470> but<00:04:31.830> you're<00:04:32.010> going<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.160> want<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.540> push<00:04:33.540> it

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
ways but you're going to want to push it

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.450 
ways but you're going to want to push it
so<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.990> light<00:04:34.170> comes<00:04:34.440> on<00:04:34.620> for<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.920> few<00:04:35.070> seconds

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
so the light comes on for a few seconds

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.490 
so the light comes on for a few seconds
before<00:04:35.640> you<00:04:35.970> put<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.240> on<00:04:36.600> here<00:04:36.990> so<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.290> make

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
before you put it on here so you make

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.400 
before you put it on here so you make
sure<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.860> tip<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.280> hot<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:39.060> then<00:04:39.780> I'd<00:04:39.900> go<00:04:40.110> one

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
sure the tip is hot and then I'd go one

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.400 
sure the tip is hot and then I'd go one
two<00:04:41.690> three<00:04:42.690> or<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:45.690> can<00:04:45.840> kind<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.080> tell<00:04:46.290> if

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
two three or and you can kind of tell if

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.930 
two three or and you can kind of tell if
it's<00:04:46.530> on<00:04:46.710> there<00:04:46.950> or<00:04:46.980> not<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.550> that<00:04:47.670> doesn't

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
it's on there or not and that doesn't

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.340 
it's on there or not and that doesn't
seem<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.360> have<00:04:48.450> done<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:48.750> quite<00:04:48.990> because<00:04:49.320> I

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
seem to have done it quite because I

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.350 
seem to have done it quite because I
don't<00:04:49.500> think<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.770> held<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.160> or<00:04:50.580> had<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.970> tip<00:04:51.150> hot

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
don't think I held it or had the tip hot

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.690 
don't think I held it or had the tip hot
enough<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.690> begin<00:04:51.930> with<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:53.220> I'll<00:04:53.400> hold<00:04:53.610> it

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
enough to begin with and so I'll hold it

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.620 
enough to begin with and so I'll hold it
on<00:04:53.850> there<00:04:53.880> for<00:04:54.180> just<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.450> few<00:04:54.600> more<00:04:54.750> seconds<00:04:55.200> and

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
on there for just a few more seconds and

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.060 
on there for just a few more seconds and
sorry<00:04:57.630> my<00:04:57.840> camera<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.200> not<00:04:58.350> going<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.530> focus<00:04:58.710> go

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
sorry my camera is not going to focus go

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.150 
sorry my camera is not going to focus go
down<00:04:59.340> there<00:04:59.840> but<00:05:00.840> there<00:05:01.320> it's<00:05:01.500> stuck<00:05:01.770> on<00:05:01.920> there

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
down there but there it's stuck on there

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.990 
down there but there it's stuck on there
so<00:05:03.150> then<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:03.420> just<00:05:03.630> continue<00:05:03.930> on<00:05:04.110> around<00:05:05.000> i'll

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
so then you just continue on around i'll

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.050 
so then you just continue on around i'll
do<00:05:06.210> another<00:05:06.240> one<00:05:06.690> here<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.290> then<00:05:07.440> i'll<00:05:08.060> come

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
do another one here and then i'll come

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.520 
do another one here and then i'll come
back<00:05:09.270> after<00:05:09.690> I've<00:05:09.810> made<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.020> bit<00:05:10.200> of<00:05:10.230> progress

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530
