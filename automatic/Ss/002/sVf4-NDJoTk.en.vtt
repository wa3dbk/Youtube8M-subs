positive note and didn't really allow

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.710 
positive note and didn't really allow
Cardiff<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.850> get<00:00:02.970> into<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.270> game<00:00:03.449> but<00:00:03.600> all

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
Cardiff to get into the game but all

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.630 
Cardiff to get into the game but all
played<00:00:03.959> some<00:00:04.170> great<00:00:04.290> football<00:00:04.859> Edoardo<00:00:05.370> great

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
played some great football Edoardo great

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.240 
played some great football Edoardo great
to<00:00:05.790> see<00:00:05.970> him<00:00:06.060> back<00:00:06.210> some<00:00:06.810> nice<00:00:07.140> touches<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.890> I

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
to see him back some nice touches and I

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.339 
to see him back some nice touches and I
think<00:00:08.490> Arsenal<00:00:09.300> have<00:00:09.420> completely<00:00:09.840> dominated

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
think Arsenal have completely dominated

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.020 
think Arsenal have completely dominated
the<00:00:10.440> first<00:00:10.620> half<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:11.400> deserved<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the first half and so deserved the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.360 
the first half and so deserved the
terminal<00:00:12.469> margin<00:00:13.469> at<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.590> moment<00:00:13.889> well<00:00:14.130> let's

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
terminal margin at the moment well let's

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.890 
terminal margin at the moment well let's
get<00:00:14.519> into<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.759> analysis<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.690> because

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
get into the analysis for you because

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.349 
get into the analysis for you because
Scott<00:00:16.770> quite<00:00:16.980> rightly<00:00:17.190> said<00:00:17.609> arsenal<00:00:18.180> have

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
Scott quite rightly said arsenal have

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.660 
Scott quite rightly said arsenal have
dominated<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.410> we're<00:00:20.279> going<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.490> show<00:00:20.609> you

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
dominated and we're going to show you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.160 
dominated and we're going to show you
exactly<00:00:20.939> why<00:00:21.240> they've<00:00:21.480> dominated<00:00:21.689> because

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
exactly why they've dominated because

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.580 
exactly why they've dominated because
all<00:00:22.590> our<00:00:22.740> analysis<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:24.260> one-way<00:00:25.260> ticket

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
all our analysis is a one-way ticket

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.670 
all our analysis is a one-way ticket
towards<00:00:26.550> Tom<00:00:26.789> Houten's<00:00:27.240> goal<00:00:27.539> Nicolas<00:00:28.320> Bednar

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.999 
towards Tom Houten's goal Nicolas Bednar
we<00:00:28.949> talked<00:00:29.160> about<00:00:29.369> them<00:00:29.490> before<00:00:30.920> should<00:00:31.920> he

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
we talked about them before should he

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.350 
we talked about them before should he
have<00:00:32.070> done<00:00:32.130> better<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.940> he<00:00:33.030> doing<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
have done better or is he doing the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.580 
have done better or is he doing the
right<00:00:33.510> thing<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.989> across<00:00:34.170> they're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
right thing going across they're

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.810 
right thing going across they're
definitely<00:00:34.829> done<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.340> thing<00:00:35.610> going

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
definitely done the right thing going

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.370 
definitely done the right thing going
across<00:00:36.030> doll<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.780> obviously<00:00:37.050> didn't<00:00:37.290> hit

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
across doll just obviously didn't hit

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.799 
across doll just obviously didn't hit
the<00:00:37.469> target<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.879> said<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.600> it's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the target and but as I said and it's

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
the target and but as I said and it's
been<00:00:39.989> proven<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.440> think<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.100> first<00:00:41.370> half

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
been proven I think in this first half

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.130 
been proven I think in this first half
he<00:00:41.790> needs<00:00:41.969> too<00:00:42.149> many<00:00:42.329> chances<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.809> score<00:00:42.989> goals

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
he needs too many chances to score goals

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.529 
he needs too many chances to score goals
and<00:00:43.680> that's<00:00:44.280> maybe<00:00:44.520> why<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.180> mean<00:00:45.390> are

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and that's maybe why I mean are

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.000 
and that's maybe why I mean are
something<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.989> could<00:00:46.170> shine<00:00:46.440> highlights<00:00:46.890> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
something you could shine highlights of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.319 
something you could shine highlights of
his<00:00:47.100> first<00:00:47.370> half<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.760> that's<00:00:47.820> why<00:00:48.090> you're<00:00:48.239> not

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
his first half and that's why you're not

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
his first half and that's why you're not
playing<00:00:48.570> regularly<00:00:48.960> topics<00:00:49.920> another<00:00:50.460> word

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
could do about that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.679 
could do about that
Bendtner<00:01:05.729> losing<00:01:06.299> his<00:01:06.420> marker

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689

those reflexes excellent saved by

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.760 
those reflexes excellent saved by
heating<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.450> then<00:01:34.569> we<00:01:34.659> keep<00:01:34.810> going<00:01:34.869> more

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770
