so<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.920> did<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.910> put<00:00:29.939> two<00:00:30.449> big<00:00:30.990> ones<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
so what I did was I put two big ones and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.549 
so what I did was I put two big ones and
two<00:00:31.949> skinny<00:00:32.669> ones<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.260> might<00:00:34.410> be

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
two skinny ones here and you might be

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
two skinny ones here and you might be
able<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:35.040> better<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.360> would<00:00:36.540> do

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
able to see better on how you would do

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.049 
able to see better on how you would do
that<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.800> drew<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.820> little

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
that I kind of drew it out on the little

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.020 
that I kind of drew it out on the little
pattern<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.469> two<00:00:40.800> big<00:00:41.010> ones<00:00:41.219> here<00:00:41.550> with

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
pattern so you do two big ones here with

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.600 
pattern so you do two big ones here with
two<00:00:42.300> blank<00:00:42.600> spaces<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.559> middle<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.010> then

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
two blank spaces in the middle and then

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.880 
two blank spaces in the middle and then
you<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> skinny<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:46.230> between<00:00:46.440> those

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you do a skinny one right between those

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.580 
you do a skinny one right between those
two<00:00:47.219> blank<00:00:47.820> spaces<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> skip<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.530> space

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
two blank spaces then you skip a space

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.029 
two blank spaces then you skip a space
and<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.190> put<00:00:50.370> another<00:00:50.989> skinny<00:00:51.989> peg<00:00:52.260> right

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
and you put another skinny peg right

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.100 
and you put another skinny peg right
there<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> get<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.210> heart<00:00:54.480> kind

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
there and then you get this heart kind

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.319 
there and then you get this heart kind
of<00:00:55.199> heart<00:00:55.379> shape<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.879> we're<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> do

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
of heart shape so what we're going to do

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.810 
of heart shape so what we're going to do
is<00:00:57.480> make<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> loop<00:00:58.010> put<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.430> center

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
is make a loop put it on that center

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.660 
is make a loop put it on that center
piece<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.350> then<00:01:01.350> wind<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.920> around<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
piece and then wind it around and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.149 
piece and then wind it around and
hopefully<00:01:03.539> come<00:01:03.719> out<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> heart<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.949> we'll

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
hopefully come out with a heart so we'll

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.060 
hopefully come out with a heart so we'll
try<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:07.920> I'm

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
on that one piece so then when you pull

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:51.150 
on that one piece so then when you pull
it<00:02:41.270> up<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:42.830> have<00:02:43.070> heart<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:48.200> what<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.800> now

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.560 

is<00:02:52.160> I'm<00:02:52.610> going<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:53.350> do<00:02:54.350> like<00:02:54.530> this<00:02:55.240> and<00:02:56.240> I'm

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
is I'm going to do like this and I'm

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.600 
is I'm going to do like this and I'm
going<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.840> cut<00:02:57.080> off<00:02:57.230> about<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:58.730> much<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:01.489> when

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
going to cut off about this much so when

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.090 
going to cut off about this much so when
you<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:03.310> have<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.820> little<00:03:06.100> loop

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
you have this you have this little loop

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.820 
you have this you have this little loop
still<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.690> what<00:03:08.900> I'm<00:03:09.020> going<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.200> do<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.620> take

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
still so what I'm going to do is take

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.240 
still so what I'm going to do is take
this<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:11.470> put<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.590> through<00:03:12.770> that<00:03:12.860> loop

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
this and just put it through that loop

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.750 
this and just put it through that loop
if<00:03:13.550> I<00:03:13.670> can<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:16.430> kind<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.730> hook<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:19.459> I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
if I can just kind of hook it and I

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.340 
if I can just kind of hook it and I
think<00:03:20.030> I'm<00:03:20.180> going<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.390> try<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.630> pinch<00:03:21.020> it<00:03:21.230> a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
think I'm going to try to pinch it a

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.500 
think I'm going to try to pinch it a
little<00:03:21.590> bit<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:23.810> it<00:03:23.959> stays<00:03:24.200> closed<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.800> then

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
little bit that it stays closed and then

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.420 
little bit that it stays closed and then
with<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.690> top<00:03:29.989> loop<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.500> might<00:03:30.800> just<00:03:30.830> cut<00:03:31.280> off

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
with this top loop I might just cut off

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.309 
with this top loop I might just cut off
a<00:03:31.459> bunch<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.970> make<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.180> loop

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.479 

cut<00:03:36.280> off<00:03:36.430> about<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.209> much<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.659> hopefully<00:03:38.489> be

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
cut off about that much and hopefully be

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:48.620 
cut off about that much and hopefully be
able<00:03:39.579> to<00:03:39.730> turn<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.239> into<00:03:40.480> loop

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.000 

be<00:03:49.230> good<00:03:49.380> okay<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.760> now<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.090> have<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:55.080> little

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
be good okay so now you have a little

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.830 
be good okay so now you have a little
heart

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.460 

and<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:02.830> what<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.069> think<00:04:03.190> up<00:04:03.520> do<00:04:04.110> let's<00:04:05.110> turn<00:04:05.319> it

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
and so what I think up do let's turn it

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:23.140 
and so what I think up do let's turn it
this<00:04:05.650> way<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:06.819> can<00:04:06.940> see<00:04:07.860> that<00:04:08.860> direction

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.080 

and<00:04:24.150> I'd<00:04:24.900> like<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:26.449> just<00:04:27.449> leave<00:04:27.689> it<00:04:27.870> on<00:04:27.990> the

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
and I'd like to just leave it on the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.899 
and I'd like to just leave it on the
spool<00:04:30.379> because<00:04:31.379> I<00:04:31.469> never<00:04:31.529> know<00:04:31.889> how<00:04:32.099> much<00:04:32.400> it's

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
spool because I never know how much it's

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.510 
spool because I never know how much it's
going<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.180> take<00:04:33.889> so<00:04:34.889> you're<00:04:35.099> going<00:04:35.219> to<00:04:35.249> take

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
going to take so you're going to take

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:51.620 
going to take so you're going to take
your<00:04:35.729> wire<00:04:35.939> and<00:04:41.539> make<00:04:42.539> a<00:04:42.569> loop

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.779 

you<00:04:52.380> can<00:04:52.590> see

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:08.589 

the<00:04:56.360> other<00:04:56.569> loops<00:04:57.309> then<00:04:58.309> what<00:04:58.490> you<00:04:58.639> do<00:05:07.389> you<00:05:08.389> can

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
the other loops then what you do you can

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.429 
the other loops then what you do you can
go<00:05:08.779> whichever<00:05:09.110> way<00:05:09.259> this<00:05:09.740> wire<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:11.439> going

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:12.439 
go whichever way this wire is going

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:18.489 
go whichever way this wire is going
naturally<00:05:13.689> so<00:05:14.689> you<00:05:14.779> take<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:15.259> loop<00:05:15.710> you<00:05:17.499> put

00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:18.499 
naturally so you take this loop you put

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:23.019 
naturally so you take this loop you put
it<00:05:18.620> on<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.949> center<00:05:19.610> piece<00:05:21.699> sometimes<00:05:22.699> they

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:23.029 
it on the center piece sometimes they

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.019 
it on the center piece sometimes they
don't<00:05:23.150> want<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.449> stay<00:05:23.659> and<00:05:23.960> you<00:05:24.039> just<00:05:25.039> wind<00:05:25.789> it

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:26.029 
don't want to stay and you just wind it

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:37.659 
don't want to stay and you just wind it
around<00:05:29.289> then<00:05:30.289> up<00:05:31.389> and<00:05:32.389> down<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:35.330> back<00:05:35.659> up<00:05:36.669> on

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
around then up and down and back up on

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:45.280 
around then up and down and back up on
this<00:05:37.879> inner<00:05:38.120> loop

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:58.400 

and<00:05:46.290> when<00:05:46.470> you're<00:05:46.590> ready<00:05:46.710> to<00:05:46.980> take<00:05:47.160> it<00:05:47.220> off

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:06.720 

so<00:05:59.410> I'm<00:05:59.620> going<00:05:59.860> to<00:06:03.300> cut<00:06:04.300> off<00:06:04.420> some<00:06:04.720> back<00:06:05.730> and

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
so I'm going to cut off some back and

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.540 
so I'm going to cut off some back and
again<00:06:08.490> there's<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.670> little<00:06:09.880> loop<00:06:10.240> here<00:06:11.550> I'm

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
again there's a little loop here I'm

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.400 
again there's a little loop here I'm
going<00:06:12.730> to<00:06:12.790> fit<00:06:13.180> up<00:06:13.300> just<00:06:13.600> a<00:06:13.780> little<00:06:13.810> bit<00:06:14.050> and

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
going to fit up just a little bit and

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:26.000 
going to fit up just a little bit and
hook<00:06:14.890> it<00:06:15.100> and<00:06:21.150> try<00:06:22.150> to<00:06:22.180> close<00:06:22.540> it<00:06:22.780> again<00:06:24.930> and

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
hook it and try to close it again and

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.770 
hook it and try to close it again and
still<00:06:27.010> have<00:06:27.220> your<00:06:27.370> heart<00:06:27.700> you<00:06:28.270> can<00:06:28.420> kind<00:06:28.690> of

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
still have your heart you can kind of

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.600 
still have your heart you can kind of
play<00:06:29.200> with<00:06:29.230> it<00:06:29.470> a<00:06:29.620> little<00:06:29.800> bit<00:06:29.950> and<00:06:31.950> then<00:06:32.950> get

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
play with it a little bit and then get

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.850 
play with it a little bit and then get
just<00:06:33.820> take<00:06:34.030> your<00:06:34.210> pliers<00:06:37.530> however<00:06:38.530> big<00:06:38.710> you

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
just take your pliers however big you

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:46.340 
just take your pliers however big you
want<00:06:39.040> it<00:06:39.100> to<00:06:39.280> and<00:06:39.490> just<00:06:40.030> turn<00:06:40.420> it<00:06:40.450> make<00:06:40.990> a<00:06:41.020> loop

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.800 

so<00:06:47.350> now<00:06:47.530> you<00:06:47.590> have<00:06:47.950> a<00:06:48.340> loop<00:06:49.000> that<00:06:49.390> you<00:06:49.480> can<00:06:49.630> hang

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
so now you have a loop that you can hang

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.660 
so now you have a loop that you can hang
something<00:06:50.110> on<00:06:51.420> and<00:06:52.420> I<00:06:52.510> heart<00:06:53.430> to<00:06:54.430> make<00:06:54.610> a

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670 
something on and I heart to make a

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.500 
something on and I heart to make a
pendant<00:06:54.940> or<00:06:55.240> earrings<00:06:55.690> whatever<00:06:56.200> you<00:06:56.350> want

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
pendant or earrings whatever you want

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:05.220 
pendant or earrings whatever you want
very<00:06:58.510> cute<00:06:58.900> and<00:06:59.370> simple<00:07:01.080> okay<00:07:02.130> thank<00:07:03.130> you
