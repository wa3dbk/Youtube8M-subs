 hello friends welcome to tuto blogs and 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:10.110
 today I will teach you the tutorial of how 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.700
 take out the book packs of injustice 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.299
 this video has directed towards the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.789
 platform to josh that is where I have my 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.710
 initiation game started for 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.800
 start we will need to have the money 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.740
 enough to buy any 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.450
 package we go to the store we pull a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.789
 little towards the corner any package 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.149
 I chose dl milk 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.770
 we give it twice to hong we flipped 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.020
 rotate or whatever you want to call him 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.600
 hopefully cut and now started 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.680
 touch play touch too fast 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.110
 too quickly 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.140
 and we will appear confirm confirm 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.670
 confirm confirm something very important 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.489
 is that they have to have the guidance 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.800
 deactivated good activated or that is 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.920
 can go anywhere and follow the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.610
 screen and they also need to have the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.400
 disconnected internet and if they have 3g or 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.100
 data traffic need to disconnect it 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.810
 of the network and they are appearing more 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.540
 packets of the more plus packages the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.940
 truth is that it is a great trick is a 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.860
 trick that gets you out of trouble and you can 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.480
 start you can do it with any 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.610
 package 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.020
 while you have the sufficient amount 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.539
 how to buy it 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.649
 something that I recommend is not to sell 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:37.460
 all his his characters climb those of 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.500
 human elites of level be better in 12 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.900
 because they owe you many cards 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.200
 to be able to improve them any power 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.960
 of all the characters 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.119
 and they are not coming out anymore more more more something 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.520
 What I recommend to you is also like 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.009
 I told them not to sell them and have them 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.469
 reservations and when they want to buy go 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.630
 and gradually as we know right now 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:07.000
 that you already know is one of the most of the most 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.000
 expensive apart from the arkham batman 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.420
 as you can see we have 44 I sell it and 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.330
 will repeat the trick again 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.709
 They pull the package a little bit until that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.490
 height of distance with twice 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.760
 turn around 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.630
 press the little window of the game and there 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.820
