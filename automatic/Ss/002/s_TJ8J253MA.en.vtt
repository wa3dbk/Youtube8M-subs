adequacy<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.559> depth<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.680> focus<00:00:54.289> beyond<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
adequacy a depth of focus beyond the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160 
adequacy a depth of focus beyond the
Infinity<00:00:56.610> points<00:00:56.969> which<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.719> currently<00:00:57.989> set

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
Infinity points which it's currently set

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.359 
Infinity points which it's currently set
at<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:59.280> next<00:00:59.699> marked<00:01:02.690> focus<00:01:03.690> point<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.369> 25

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
at the next marked focus point is 25

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.980 
at the next marked focus point is 25
centimeters<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> goes<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> way<00:01:06.869> down

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
centimeters and it goes all the way down

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.230 
centimeters and it goes all the way down
to<00:01:09.740> name<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.369> actually<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.700> table

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
to name but I think actually a table

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.380 
to name but I think actually a table
it's<00:01:12.930> also<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:13.470> bit<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.780> yeah<00:01:17.659> listen<00:01:19.280> to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
it's also a little bit so yeah listen to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's also a little bit so yeah listen to
personally<00:01:21.390> don't<00:01:21.600> find<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> fish<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
personally don't find the fish a

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.880 
personally don't find the fish a
distortion<00:01:23.700> too<00:01:24.180> over<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.080> top<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.650> lens

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
distortion too over the top of this lens

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.929 
distortion too over the top of this lens
it's<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:27.770> allows<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.369> very<00:01:29.700> weight

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it's just allows it to be very weight

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.190 
it's just allows it to be very weight
and<00:01:31.700> soupy<00:01:34.970> totally<00:01:35.970> their<00:01:36.210> fittings<00:01:36.630> very

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and soupy totally their fittings very

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.999 
and soupy totally their fittings very
good<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.450> all<00:01:39.450> shots<00:01:39.840> are<00:01:40.079> very<00:01:40.350> clear

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
good with this all shots are very clear

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.210 
good with this all shots are very clear
and<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.560> go<00:01:43.560> full<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.920> fish<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
and if you up about to go full of fish a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.609 
and if you up about to go full of fish a
look<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:44.960> it's<00:01:46.280> good<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:48.380> what<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.500> she

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
look then it's good for that what if she

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
look then it's good for that what if she
tough<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> cameras<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.090> need<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> be

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
tough with the cameras you need to be

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.740 
tough with the cameras you need to be
quite<00:01:51.869> careful<00:01:52.079> focusing<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.890> because<00:01:53.750> it's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
quite careful focusing it because it's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.889

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
up to energy to grease in the corners

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
it's easy to get a finger - in Kaunas on

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.390 
it's easy to get a finger - in Kaunas on
the<00:02:16.940> screen<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:21.020> like<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.260> say<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.920> can<00:02:22.130> focus

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
the screen so like you say it can focus

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.370 
the screen so like you say it can focus
down<00:02:22.640> very<00:02:22.910> close<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.510> I'll<00:02:23.600> just<00:02:24.140> show<00:02:24.290> you

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
down very close so I'll just show you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.020 
down very close so I'll just show you
with<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.680> coin<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.770> said<00:02:28.070> minimum<00:02:28.490> focus

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
with this coin so I said minimum focus

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.940 
with this coin so I said minimum focus
and<00:02:32.680> yeah

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
and yeah

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.040 
and yeah
the<00:02:34.220> focus<00:02:34.580> is<00:02:34.670> down<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:35.060> about<00:02:35.090> there<00:02:35.750> which

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
the focus is down to about there which

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.730 
the focus is down to about there which
is<00:02:36.410> about<00:02:36.910> it's<00:02:37.910> 8<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.750> 3<00:02:38.960> centimeters<00:02:39.290> from

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
is about it's 8 to 3 centimeters from

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.120 
is about it's 8 to 3 centimeters from
the<00:02:39.830> edge<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.030> lens<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.680> great<00:02:42.950> good

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
the edge of the lens so it is great good

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.390 
the edge of the lens so it is great good
for<00:02:43.430> macro<00:02:43.820> photography<00:02:48.010> but<00:02:49.010> obviously<00:02:49.280> not

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
for macro photography but obviously not

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.110 
for macro photography but obviously not
except<00:02:49.970> for<00:02:50.300> my<00:02:50.450> clams<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:51.700> bought<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.850> camera

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
except for my clams I bought this camera

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.440 
but this could come here for bout in two
pounds<00:03:03.440> when<00:03:03.800> I<00:03:03.830> bought<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:05.030> now<00:03:05.090> it's

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
want the right angle and see you can fix

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.740 
want the right angle and see you can fix
it<00:03:15.170> some<00:03:15.830> other<00:03:15.950> fish<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.340> pause<00:03:17.210> pause<00:03:17.510> and

of<00:03:27.800> these<00:03:27.920> people<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.340> are<00:03:28.930> taking<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.970> huge

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
of these people that are taking a huge

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.450 
of these people that are taking a huge
number<00:03:32.210> of<00:03:32.540> fish<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:33.050> pictures<00:03:34.570> but<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:36.340> can<00:03:37.340> take

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
number of fish a pictures but I can take

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.570 
number of fish a pictures but I can take
of<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.670> fact<00:03:38.530> also<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.830> can<00:03:40.010> see<00:03:40.220> some

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
of the fact also you can see some

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.540 
of the fact also you can see some
creative<00:03:40.820> things<00:03:41.510> like<00:03:41.720> if<00:03:41.900> used<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.620> flash

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
creative things like if used the flash

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.590 
creative things like if used the flash
to<00:03:44.180> take<00:03:44.390> photographs<00:03:45.190> then<00:03:46.190> it<00:03:47.120> creates

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
to take photographs then it creates

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.360 
to take photographs then it creates
quite<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.810> good<00:03:48.020> effect<00:03:48.380> because<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.100> flash

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
quite a good effect because the flash

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.330 
quite a good effect because the flash
obviously<00:03:49.730> isn't<00:03:50.000> big<00:03:50.420> enough<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:51.340> illuminate

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
obviously isn't big enough to illuminate

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.800 
obviously isn't big enough to illuminate
such<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.120> great<00:03:54.080> angle<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.540> get<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:59.690> all

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
such a great angle so you get it all

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.050 
such a great angle so you get it all
relates<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.470> things<00:04:01.070> that<00:04:01.310> listen<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.850> the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
relates the things that listen to the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.000 
relates the things that listen to the
favorite<00:04:02.510> looks<00:04:03.440> great<00:04:03.650> funky<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:05.630> yeah<00:04:06.200> they

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
favorite looks great funky and yeah they

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.619 
favorite looks great funky and yeah they
say<00:04:07.250> it's<00:04:07.400> very<00:04:08.320> good<00:04:09.320> for

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.729 

cause<00:04:13.109> affordances<00:04:13.890> are<00:04:15.229> reef<00:04:16.229> making

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
cause affordances are reef making

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.120 
cause affordances are reef making
because<00:04:17.009> it's<00:04:17.220> manual<00:04:17.850> ends<00:04:18.090> it's<00:04:19.130> totally

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
because it's manual ends it's totally

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.640 
because it's manual ends it's totally
silent<00:04:20.479> so<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.840> don't<00:04:22.019> need<00:04:22.139> to<00:04:22.289> a<00:04:22.320> powder

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
silent so you don't need to a powder

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.779 
silent so you don't need to a powder
lands<00:04:23.340> noise<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:25.530> also<00:04:26.100> because<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.639> got

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
lands noise and also because it's got

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:34.129 
lands noise and also because it's got
such<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.979> big<00:04:30.229> depth<00:04:31.229> of<00:04:31.380> focus<00:04:31.530> then<00:04:32.099> you<00:04:33.139> don't

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
such a big depth of focus then you don't

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.040 
such a big depth of focus then you don't
really<00:04:34.289> need<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.620> worry<00:04:34.770> about<00:04:35.780> changing<00:04:36.780> the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
really need to worry about changing the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.980 
really need to worry about changing the
focus<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:37.650> refocusing<00:04:40.400> like<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.490> say<00:04:41.669> it's<00:04:41.990> the

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
focus and refocusing like I say it's the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.820 
focus and refocusing like I say it's the
FJ<00:04:43.349> goes<00:04:43.590> all<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:43.979> way<00:04:44.070> up<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.400> ya<00:04:44.639> f-22<00:04:45.389> which

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
FJ goes all the way up to ya f-22 which

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.570 
FJ goes all the way up to ya f-22 which
increases<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.919> touch<00:04:47.099> the<00:04:47.220> phone<00:04:47.400> because

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
increases the touch the phone because

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.300 
increases the touch the phone because
eat<00:04:47.759> more<00:04:48.330> so<00:04:49.139> most<00:04:49.349> of<00:04:49.410> this<00:04:49.530> video<00:04:49.860> start<00:04:50.160> at
