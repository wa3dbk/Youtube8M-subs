 player already great as well was 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 saying I said a while ago that 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.340
 I wanted to see the sony that is golden 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.950
 because it is the one in which I most 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 he liked next to sonic metal that in fact 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.790
 I have even a metal sonic doll 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.229
 to see if I remember and tried it twitter 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.189
 so you can see that I have this little doll 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.140
 that in fact you have not been in the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.460
 plastic or anything is there stuck in a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.680
 box in perfect condition for when 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.630
 spend the years trying to have it 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.400
 it is the best possible state of passage 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 I would like to comment with you if that 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.219
 it's the same as I am a person 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.360
 that when I collect something that I like 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.060
 a lot of fact we are getting to the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 supersonic I like some figures 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.329
 keep them in their original box even 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.460
 save the boxes although the figure 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.220
 I have out of fact in a chile I bought 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.560
 a pair of conan-type figurines 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 but I took it out of its box 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.860
 keeping in your box while I have 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.049
 another health figurine that was a gift 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.759
 of my brother and that is not taken from 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.619
 its box ie it is in the plastic 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.810
 because I have had some success of 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.399
 discussion with people who say I is that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.869
 well my cousin in fact tells me I'm 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.159
 that when I buy a figure I like 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.170
 have it outside because if I do not feel that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.399
 I have the same store has no 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.229
 that the store that has it in a 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.549
 box is how it is to me like that of a 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.140
 Four jump to the ass but I 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.020
 what happened to this is perfectly 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.599
 so I am one of those who thinks that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.659
 It depends on the figure if the figure looks 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.890
 pretty inside your unpacking I do not 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.420
 like to take out the lismi is not in the dock 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.190
 perfectly we of 4 I know how 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.630
 I'm doing you open what do you think 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.970
 I would like it then in the comments 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.069
 If I am one of those who take out the figurines or 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.690
 you do as I do that you have them 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.130
 well inside the box although I eat 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.819
 well I say I have the odd one out 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.069
 done I have another figurine of the sprint 3er 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.900
 totally inside because it looks a lot 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.819
 and keep your status more than anything 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.180
 because later things are valued more 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.010
 if they have their box I am very call me 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.109
 weird but in the things that I collect 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.400
 like to have your box so much of the psp me 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.379
 I know of the playstation one of the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.790
 green house that includes all that I like 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.980
 keep your street I have everything saved 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.750
 because I think it's important to keep 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.819
 the boxes and especially in perfect 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.129
 been because that happened a few years ago and 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.450
 people who like consoles because they 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.489
 The subject of the boxes is very cool because 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.569
 I'm being some entities of the 4th and 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.889
 bad grandchildren and I think it has happened to me 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.409
 more than anything because this is the most 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.849
 serious is totally as I am I do not think that 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.560
 I should not go here but yes yes yes it is 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.900
 there because they are the cars of four of 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.280
 these did not come I think 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.280
 fourth they came from a corner 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:18.560
 and I can not do it let's see let's 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.060
 count 1 2 because it 's a jump of 47 that 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.800
 I do not know why it is not because I have the 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.000
 head up here I think it's because I 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.030
 touches the head up to look at what 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.739
 I'm going to do is know one thing look 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.060
 look is because I was touching the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.370
 head with this part of here when you 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.140
 you jump on the roof that touches your head is 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.910
 a very long jump like this one what 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.700
 the jump itself will happen exactly 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.700
 the same and if not directly that the 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.080
 space owner does not touch here happens to me 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.730
 exactly the same so without more 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.590
 I'll issue this jump but you have 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.340
 seen dissipate all that I can 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.110
 get in quietly 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.150
 I think we've passed since I did not 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.360
 like my the pancakes at night I think 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.459
 we have passed to the supersonic lord 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.200
 time what's come to the end if there's 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.030
 a chest that is my face or that 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.590
 it seems kind of my face end of the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.420
 map to see what it says 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.739
 if I get to read the book hello again 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.599
 bears I hope you liked ma for 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.400
 after that more laughter until the next 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.690
 so good without more guys but that you 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.400
 he liked it if he's going to teach them first 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.900
 the pixel art of the super are and that they 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.400
 he commented that it is this blonde of whom 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.500
 this one was bet of I love this 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.169
 sound is honey indeed I remember a little 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.930
 of the lashing is precisely in the 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.880
 vertical and sonic where this is and that 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.130
 he was doing an epic battle against shadow 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.020
 I think if I'm not wrong to see and improve a 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.340
 I had a lot of it very close as a 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.900
 little boy was enjoying my 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.790
 mission and here inside I think it was called 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.410
 an epic game of Homer that are engines 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.400
 times so without more guys as well 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.410
 said you know complaining about your tastes 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.150
 tell me you give me so much that we see 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.300
 a very big hug and even the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.300
 following
