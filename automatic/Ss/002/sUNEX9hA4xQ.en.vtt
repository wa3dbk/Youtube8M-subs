that plenty of NCLEX takers don't really
focus<00:00:04.950> much<00:00:05.430> on<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.899> have<00:00:07.350> spoken<00:00:07.710> to

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
see this specific disease in their exam

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.220 
see this specific disease in their exam
and<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.859> guillain-barre<00:00:20.730> syndrome<00:00:21.230> now

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and that is guillain-barre syndrome now

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.349 
and that is guillain-barre syndrome now
what<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.650> guillain-barre<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.820> syndrome

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
what is guillain-barre a syndrome

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.330 
what is guillain-barre a syndrome
basically<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.410> disorder<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.920> occurs

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
basically it's a disorder that occurs

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.330 
basically it's a disorder that occurs
when<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.180> body's<00:00:27.539> immune<00:00:27.990> system<00:00:28.130> right<00:00:29.130> our

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
when the body's immune system right our

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.269 
when the body's immune system right our
immune<00:00:29.699> system<00:00:30.179> mistakenly<00:00:30.300> attacks<00:00:31.170> part<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
immune system mistakenly attacks part of

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.750 
immune system mistakenly attacks part of
our<00:00:32.820> nervous<00:00:33.149> system<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.160> basically<00:00:35.160> what

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
our nervous system and basically what

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.030 
our nervous system and basically what
this<00:00:35.969> does<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.750> leads<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.110> nerve

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
this does is it leads to nerve

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.090 
this does is it leads to nerve
inflammation<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.510> turn<00:00:39.719> causes<00:00:40.260> muscle

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
inflammation and in turn causes muscle

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.130 
inflammation and in turn causes muscle
weakness<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> major<00:00:42.300> symptom<00:00:42.780> of

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
weakness which is a major symptom of

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
weakness which is a major symptom of
this<00:00:43.410> disease<00:00:43.610> now<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> most

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
this disease now one of the most

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.970 
this disease now one of the most
important<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.410> NCLEX<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
important thing to know for the NCLEX is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
important thing to know for the NCLEX is
that<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> patient<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:48.030> also<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.840> we

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that the patient can also have what we

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.220 
that the patient can also have what we
call<00:00:49.489> ascending<00:00:50.489> paralysis<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.809> term<00:00:52.050> is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
call ascending paralysis and the term is

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
call ascending paralysis and the term is
pretty<00:00:52.530> much<00:00:52.739> self-explanatory<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.940> which

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
pretty much self-explanatory in which

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.750 
pretty much self-explanatory in which
it's<00:00:54.449> basically<00:00:55.170> weakness<00:00:56.070> beginning<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it's basically weakness beginning in the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.260 
it's basically weakness beginning in the
feet<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.300> hands<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.649> goes<00:00:58.949> up

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
feet and hands and then it goes up

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.720 
feet and hands and then it goes up
towards<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.480> trunk<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.250> this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
towards the trunk and this is one of the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
towards the trunk and this is one of the
most<00:01:02.940> typical<00:01:03.149> symptoms<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.080> these<00:01:04.260> patients

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
most typical symptoms for these patients

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460 
most typical symptoms for these patients
now<00:01:05.309> patients<00:01:06.030> generally<00:01:06.360> would<00:01:06.810> also<00:01:07.049> notice

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
now patients generally would also notice

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.740 
now patients generally would also notice
weakness<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.250> their<00:01:08.369> legs<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.270> it's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and the patient's facial muscles also

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.160 
and the patient's facial muscles also
starts<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> become<00:01:34.920> affected<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
starts to become affected now as the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.730 
starts to become affected now as the
nurse<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.920> big<00:01:38.130> priority<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.820> us<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
nurse it's a big priority for us to to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.670 
nurse it's a big priority for us to to
be<00:01:40.890> aware<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.540> this<00:01:42.540> disease<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.110> become

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
be aware that this disease can become

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.149 
be aware that this disease can become
quite<00:01:44.040> severe<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.020> when<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.439> happens<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
quite severe and when that happens the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.249 
quite severe and when that happens the
patient<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.780> patient<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.229> have

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
patient can the patient can have

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
patient can the patient can have
actually<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> loss<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.340> autonomic<00:01:50.640> function

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
actually a loss of autonomic function

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.410 
actually a loss of autonomic function
which<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.380> very<00:01:52.439> common<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.210> manifest

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
which is very common and it can manifest

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.410 
which is very common and it can manifest
as<00:01:55.020> what<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.409> call<00:01:55.790> fluctuations<00:01:56.790> right<00:01:57.090> very

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
as what we call fluctuations right very

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.999 
as what we call fluctuations right very
wide<00:01:57.719> fluctuations<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.619> blood<00:01:58.829> pressure

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
wide fluctuations in the blood pressure

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.770 
wide fluctuations in the blood pressure
and<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> patient<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.420> also<00:02:00.509> have

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and the patient can also have

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.499 
and the patient can also have
orthostatic<00:02:01.649> hypotension<00:02:01.920> which<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.850> fall

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
orthostatic hypotension which is a fall

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.149 
orthostatic hypotension which is a fall
and<00:02:03.719> blood<00:02:03.840> pressure<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> patient<00:02:05.070> is

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and blood pressure when the patient is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.580 
and blood pressure when the patient is
standing<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.729> remember<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.229> lead<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
standing and remember this can lead to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.339 
standing and remember this can lead to
an<00:02:07.680> increased<00:02:08.280> risk<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:09.060> injury<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:09.929> collapse

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
an increased risk of injury or collapse

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.850 
an increased risk of injury or collapse
right<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.009> also<00:02:11.959> another<00:02:12.959> priority<00:02:13.379> that<00:02:13.770> we

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
right and also another priority that we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.130 
right and also another priority that we
need<00:02:13.980> to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
need to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.550 
need to
now<00:02:14.260> when<00:02:14.770> this<00:02:15.130> disease<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.180> become<00:02:16.560> severe

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
now when this disease can become severe

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.440 
now when this disease can become severe
is<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.950> patient<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.370> also<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.730> even

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
is that the patient can also have even

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.020 
is that the patient can also have even
sinus<00:02:19.930> tachycardia<00:02:20.250> which<00:02:21.250> as<00:02:21.550> we<00:02:21.730> all<00:02:21.850> know

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
sinus tachycardia which as we all know

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.120 
sinus tachycardia which as we all know
is<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> cardiac<00:02:22.569> arrhythmia<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.620> how<00:02:23.890> do<00:02:23.950> we

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
is a cardiac arrhythmia so how do we

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.160 
is a cardiac arrhythmia so how do we
diagnose<00:02:24.640> these<00:02:24.970> patients<00:02:25.270> now<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
diagnose these patients now the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.710 
diagnose these patients now the
diagnosis<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.190> usually<00:02:27.400> made<00:02:27.880> by<00:02:28.180> what<00:02:28.630> we

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
diagnosis is usually made by what we

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.010 
diagnosis is usually made by what we
call<00:02:28.900> nerve<00:02:29.140> conduction<00:02:29.530> studies<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
call nerve conduction studies and the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.870 
call nerve conduction studies and the
term<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.470> would<00:02:32.560> be<00:02:32.620> used<00:02:32.800> in<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.130> NCLEX<00:02:33.490> is

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
term that would be used in the NCLEX is

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.949 
term that would be used in the NCLEX is
electromyography<00:02:34.780> or<00:02:35.500> EMG<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.959> basically

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
electromyography or EMG and basically

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.410 
electromyography or EMG and basically
what<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.770> it's<00:02:39.130> basically<00:02:39.550> just<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:40.090> test

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
what it is is it's basically just a test

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.420 
what it is is it's basically just a test
that<00:02:40.570> checks<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.620> health<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.220> muscles

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
that checks the health of the muscles

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.150 
that checks the health of the muscles
and<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.910> nerves<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:44.260> controls<00:02:44.830> those

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
and the nerves that controls those

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.760 
and the nerves that controls those
specific<00:02:45.760> muscles<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.540> remember<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.739> a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
specific muscles and remember this is a

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.430 
specific muscles and remember this is a
very<00:02:48.010> common<00:02:48.489> diagnostic<00:02:48.820> test<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.170> it's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
very common diagnostic test so it's

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.110 
very common diagnostic test so it's
important<00:02:50.860> it's<00:02:51.250> important<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:51.760> us<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.000> know

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
important it's important for us to know

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.020 
important it's important for us to know
this<00:02:52.300> information<00:02:52.900> for<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.920> NCLEX<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.670> it's

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
this information for the NCLEX and it's

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.970 
this information for the NCLEX and it's
basically<00:02:55.390> used<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.989> tell<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.500> difference

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
basically used to tell the difference

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.400 
basically used to tell the difference
between<00:02:57.190> muscle<00:02:57.850> weakness<00:02:58.060> caused<00:02:58.480> by<00:02:58.720> maybe

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
between muscle weakness caused by maybe

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.560 
between muscle weakness caused by maybe
an<00:02:59.590> injury<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.519> nerve<00:03:00.670> attached<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.540> a

guillain-barre syndrome however there

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.310 
guillain-barre syndrome however there
are<00:03:14.080> therapies<00:03:14.860> what<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.160> call<00:03:15.340> therapeutic

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
are therapies what we call therapeutic

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.050 
are therapies what we call therapeutic
procedures<00:03:17.320> that<00:03:17.980> can<00:03:18.190> help<00:03:18.310> lessen<00:03:18.670> the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
procedures that can help lessen the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.270 
procedures that can help lessen the
severity<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.500> illness<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.950> hopefully

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
severity of the illness and hopefully

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.640 
severity of the illness and hopefully
accelerates<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.970> recovery<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:23.019> our<00:03:23.170> patients

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
accelerates the recovery of our patients

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.920 
accelerates the recovery of our patients
now<00:03:24.130> there<00:03:24.430> can<00:03:24.549> be<00:03:24.610> several<00:03:25.060> number<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.720> ways

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
now there can be several number of ways

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.020 
now there can be several number of ways
to<00:03:26.200> treat<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.950> complications<00:03:27.670> of<00:03:27.880> this

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
to treat the complications of this

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.509 
to treat the complications of this
disease<00:03:28.390> but<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.660> two<00:03:28.870> most<00:03:29.140> common<00:03:29.680> two<00:03:30.310> most

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
disease but the two most common two most

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.819 
disease but the two most common two most
common<00:03:30.910> therapeutic<00:03:31.360> procedures<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.230> you

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
common therapeutic procedures that you

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.470 
common therapeutic procedures that you
really<00:03:33.220> need<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.430> know<00:03:33.579> for<00:03:33.970> your<00:03:34.030> NCLEX<00:03:34.390> exam

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
really need to know for your NCLEX exam

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.289 
really need to know for your NCLEX exam
would<00:03:34.959> include<00:03:35.230> plasma<00:03:35.890> exchange<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.549> the

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
would include plasma exchange and the

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.449 
would include plasma exchange and the
term<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:38.049> will<00:03:38.230> be<00:03:38.380> used<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.890> NCLEX<00:03:39.190> is

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
term that will be used in the NCLEX is

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.850 
term that will be used in the NCLEX is
plasmapheresis<00:03:40.360> right<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:41.709> it's

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
plasmapheresis right so it's

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.800 
plasmapheresis right so it's
plasmapheresis<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.030> other<00:03:43.180> therapeutic

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
plasmapheresis and the other therapeutic

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.710 
plasmapheresis and the other therapeutic
treatment<00:03:44.230> is<00:03:44.440> high-dose<00:03:45.510> immunoglobin

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
treatment is high-dose immunoglobin

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.280 
treatment is high-dose immunoglobin
therapy<00:03:47.459> okay<00:03:48.670> now<00:03:49.120> basically<00:03:49.420> plasma

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
therapy okay now basically plasma

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.840 
therapy okay now basically plasma
exchange<00:03:50.680> or<00:03:50.920> what<00:03:51.010> we<00:03:51.100> call<00:03:51.250> plasmapheresis

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
exchange or what we call plasmapheresis

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.560 
exchange or what we call plasmapheresis
is<00:03:52.390> is<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.350> method<00:03:53.890> in<00:03:53.980> which<00:03:54.130> whole<00:03:54.850> blood<00:03:55.269> is

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
is is a method in which whole blood is

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.090 
is is a method in which whole blood is
removed<00:03:56.049> from<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.769> body

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
removed from the body

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.400 
removed from the body
and<00:03:57.280> then<00:03:57.880> it<00:03:58.090> would<00:03:58.180> be<00:03:58.209> processed<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.110> that

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
and then it would be processed so that

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.050 
and then it would be processed so that
the<00:03:59.560> red<00:03:59.799> and<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.070> white<00:04:00.100> blood<00:04:00.519> cells<00:04:00.579> are

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
the red and the white blood cells are

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.750 
the red and the white blood cells are
being<00:04:01.810> separated<00:04:02.200> from<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:02.950> plasma<00:04:03.130> or<00:04:03.519> what

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
being separated from the plasma or what

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.789 
being separated from the plasma or what
we<00:04:03.850> call<00:04:04.060> liquid<00:04:04.299> portion<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.930> blood<00:04:05.019> now

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
we call liquid portion of the blood now

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.430 
we call liquid portion of the blood now
the<00:04:06.519> blood<00:04:06.790> cells<00:04:07.180> would<00:04:07.630> then<00:04:07.840> be<00:04:07.989> returned

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
the blood cells would then be returned

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.280 
the blood cells would then be returned
to<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.680> patient<00:04:08.860> without<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:10.150> plasma<00:04:10.750> which

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
to the patient without the plasma which

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.349 
to the patient without the plasma which
the<00:04:11.620> body<00:04:11.829> will<00:04:12.220> eventually<00:04:12.340> quickly<00:04:13.030> replace

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
the body will eventually quickly replace

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.300 
the body will eventually quickly replace
now<00:04:13.870> how<00:04:14.109> this<00:04:14.290> works<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.829> that<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.130> helps

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
now how this works is that it helps

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.699 
now how this works is that it helps
reduce<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.790> severity<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.780> duration<00:04:17.500> of

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
reduce the severity and the duration of

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.909 
reduce the severity and the duration of
the<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.609> guillain-barre<00:04:19.120> episodes<00:04:19.660> because

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
the the guillain-barre episodes because

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.860 
the the guillain-barre episodes because
what<00:04:20.919> plasmapheresis<00:04:21.549> eventually<00:04:22.300> does<00:04:22.539> is

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
what plasmapheresis eventually does is

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
what plasmapheresis eventually does is
it<00:04:23.200> removes<00:04:23.940> antibodies<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.210> other<00:04:25.890> immune

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
it removes antibodies and other immune

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.810 
it removes antibodies and other immune
