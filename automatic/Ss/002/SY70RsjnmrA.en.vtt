at a time we use gulping Gary as an
example<00:00:12.620> we<00:00:13.620> now<00:00:13.799> move<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.250> exploring<00:00:14.940> that

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
example we now move on to exploring that

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.300 
example we now move on to exploring that
sound<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.719> words<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.830> more<00:00:18.260> go<00:00:19.260> gulping<00:00:20.160> we're

going to start with hear the words this

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
going to start with hear the words this
is<00:00:23.130> based<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> theory<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.210> auditory

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
is based on a theory of auditory

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.780 
contrasting sounds so let's just stop
the<00:05:30.510> recording<00:05:30.660> there<00:05:31.230> and<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:32.130> next<00:05:32.310> part

the recording there and the next part
will<00:05:33.180> be<00:05:33.390> about<00:05:33.690> combined<00:05:34.620> sounds<00:05:35.250> let's<00:05:35.550> go

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
will be about combined sounds let's go

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.840 
will be about combined sounds let's go
on<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.660> here<00:05:37.650> we<00:05:37.740> are<00:05:37.860> at<00:05:37.950> gulping<00:05:38.340> Gary<00:05:38.550> word

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
on and here we are at gulping Gary word

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.910 
on and here we are at gulping Gary word
activities<00:05:39.390> we<00:05:39.990> can<00:05:40.170> either<00:05:40.260> go<00:05:40.500> back<00:05:40.740> this

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
activities we can either go back this

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.000 
activities we can either go back this
way<00:05:41.160> and<00:05:41.430> back<00:05:42.000> again<00:05:42.200> to<00:05:43.200> find<00:05:43.410> our<00:05:43.680> sound

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
way and back again to find our sound

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.870 
way and back again to find our sound
train<00:05:44.540> at<00:05:45.540> which<00:05:45.750> point<00:05:46.080> we<00:05:46.260> could<00:05:46.440> study

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
train at which point we could study

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.540 
train at which point we could study
another<00:05:47.880> sound<00:05:48.590> in<00:05:49.590> just<00:05:49.890> the<00:05:49.980> way<00:05:50.130> we've<00:05:50.340> done

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
another sound in just the way we've done

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.150 
another sound in just the way we've done
or<00:05:50.790> if<00:05:51.660> we<00:05:51.810> have<00:05:51.840> studied<00:05:52.380> all<00:05:52.560> of<00:05:53.010> those

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
or if we have studied all of those

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.750 
or if we have studied all of those
sounds<00:05:53.700> in<00:05:53.850> our<00:05:54.030> sound<00:05:54.330> train<00:05:54.690> we<00:05:55.260> can<00:05:55.440> go<00:05:55.590> to

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
sounds in our sound train we can go to

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.470 
sounds in our sound train we can go to
combined<00:05:56.760> sounds<00:05:57.600> activity<00:05:59.210> well<00:06:00.210> done

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
combined sounds activity well done

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.870 
combined sounds activity well done
you've<00:06:00.690> got<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.110> end<00:06:01.230> of<00:06:01.380> clip<00:06:01.560> 2<00:06:01.860> and<00:06:02.250> now

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
you've got to the end of clip 2 and now

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.090 
you've got to the end of clip 2 and now
it's<00:06:03.030> time<00:06:03.210> to<00:06:03.360> go<00:06:03.510> to<00:06:03.570> clip<00:06:03.870> 3<00:06:04.260> where<00:06:04.920> we'll

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
it's time to go to clip 3 where we'll

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.450 
it's time to go to clip 3 where we'll
look<00:06:05.310> at<00:06:05.460> combining<00:06:06.060> sounds<00:06:06.870> at<00:06:07.100> sound<00:06:08.100> level

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
look at combining sounds at sound level

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.600 
look at combining sounds at sound level
but<00:06:08.880> also<00:06:09.000> at<00:06:09.270> word<00:06:09.840> level<00:06:10.110> this<00:06:11.100> is<00:06:11.280> really

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
but also at word level this is really

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.090 
but also at word level this is really
where<00:06:11.940> speech<00:06:12.330> production<00:06:12.600> and<00:06:13.170> early

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
where speech production and early

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.600 
where speech production and early
literacy<00:06:14.490> awareness<00:06:15.210> comes<00:06:15.780> into<00:06:16.140> its<00:06:16.260> own<00:06:16.610> go

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
literacy awareness comes into its own go

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.240 
literacy awareness comes into its own go
to<00:06:17.670> clip<00:06:17.940> 3
