 beta test with the start of open 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.110
 beta testing will happen white 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.199
 otherwise it is zeroing 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.180
 the resources that the players had 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.850
 accumulated over the period of their participation in 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.299
 closed beta test however it will be 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.140
 concern not all loans will be reset 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.120
 gold appliances will be updated 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.710
 some exceptions will make up the game 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.869
 experience 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.330
 exception will be made only for brands 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.210
 victories this is such a characteristic 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.180
 asterisks strips bombs which 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.520
 players can see on their cars this 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 combat statistics will be saved it is not 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.310
 will disappear 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.580
 besides this forward about this one 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.550
 the participant will receive a certain amount of tokens this 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.190
 is a temporary name for a currency 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.590
 which for a period of experience will change y 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.530
 us gaming gold number of these 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.600
 tokens will depend on martial 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.690
 achievements 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.300
 player at the time of accrual and can 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.800
 make up a pretty decent amount 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.980
 tokens are not full gaming 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.130
 in gold but we will find it useful and 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.739
 nice for test participants 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.849
 use when you release the game in our release 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.190
 will be white it will be a complete update 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.430
 there are certain reasons for this 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.019
 all that one of the tasks open 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.920
 beta testing is testing 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.690
 gaming economy and balance as well 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.930
 identifying and correcting various 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.939
 deficiencies associated with this and we want 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.879
 so that all players are on an equal footing 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.349
 and not allow anyone 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.379
 take advantage of the shortcomings of the system 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.299
 while we are not from a balanced release 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.219
 the game is an exciting moment which with 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.530
 our fans are looking forward to 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.629
 who are struggling to bring the team 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.790
 development party closed 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.939
 beta testing will be awarded for 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.859
 hard work for the suffering that 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.659
 they had to move with us with 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.239
 by all 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.459
 This variety of buns gifts think 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.980
 what is the main thing that will please 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.389
 This announcement that the course we 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.900
 give airplanes 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.510
 it will be an interesting car to be heard 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.579
 these planes will be according to the rules that 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.769
 we want to make it transparent and understandable 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.349
 all participants in this testing 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.870
 testers will be divided into two groups 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.180
 the first group are those who flew over 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.930
 100 fights for the entire period 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.260
 testing the project the second group is 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.819
 tester and who have flown over 700 fights 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.010
 the difference between these groups will be 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.489
 be that those who flew 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.069
 more than 700 fights until the game is released 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.069
 they will receive release not only all the same 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.900
 buns that will get a group of 100 plus 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.790
 battles but also plus gift planes 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.190
 let the name of these aircraft so far 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.080
 will remain secret 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.840
 we can say it will be two 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.610
 fighter i-16 ur mavic and it will 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.950
 very interesting car which 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.580
 will please their owners 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.460
 but who exactly will get what kind of car 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.920
 or what kind of cars it depends on 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.050
 what stage did a person join 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.200
 testing the project on alpha alpha and 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.440
