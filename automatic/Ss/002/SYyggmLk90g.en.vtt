00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.360
 my people out there and cordial 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.830
 Welcome to a tutorial how to do 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.800
 I like this or your server as well 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.380
 i actually make my server famous 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.510
 It's not all that hard 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.400
 think because you just have to 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.570
 do it right and how to do it right 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.239
 Power I show you now and indeed 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.160
 first in game now on the server 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.160
 Of course you have to do that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.460
 players still want the players 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 did not see flex , for example 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.449
 where else do you see things like that? 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.160
 Survival games always you are 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.000
 nothing more special service then 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.010
 almost like everyone else and that's why 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.640
 I would suggest making your own 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.180
 play modes like here mgv 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.040
 its own game mode or there is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 they still 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:16.110
 lago i also do not know lightning 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.030
 not every server has attacks niki 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.790
 of course, the standards must be 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.650
 so do not have to but we should 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:28.979
 games the animals or what else is there 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.770
 jumpman runs one can also yes that must 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 just be there and the thing still has to be 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:40.250
 be set relatively well for 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.250
 example , for example , must be here 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.210
 Here is an example I have no 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.540
 to make thermal for example 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.540
 This is 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.390
 pretty weird here for example that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.160
 you should not do it for example 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.780
 yes, in any case, there you see us 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.520
 should not do that has to be changed 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.070
 it will apparently work somehow 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.820
 not good mark webber and that's how it works 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.920
 with games that's all 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.120
 seem to be set whoever 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.360
 wonder what but this is the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.100
 But he thinks that is still is 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.510
 just a blue say I'll see 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.950
 her husband does not shy that still has to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.490
 just be made and so on 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.050
 well because he must have potential it 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.480
 has to look nice i think this is here 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.420
 everything looks very out of the invite 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.340
 opportunities must be well already look since 40 Sun 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.959
 have burst out 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.930
 well and yes he has to work 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:45.860
 for example this is now a 14 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:49.160
 gigabyte ram power server with 210 gb ssd 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.980
 and so on, keep it neat 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.930
 The player must be a big one too 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.820
 be number when you make a server 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.910
 so people think of me 50 server there 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.640
 you can not play by him and 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.930
 you have to think about something 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.930
 server makes here is now a 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.980
 minigame server you can also see the here 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:18.400
 rp she brakes as above is 1 1 well 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.400
 In any case that was it for the first time 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.590
 Gamepad forgot something I show 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.890
 you still afterwards but I would 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:35.510
 say now it's time to desktop 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:38.709
 or internet where i show you like you 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.239
 makes the server popular on the internet 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.959
 that I think I'll do that now 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.880
 that would be far 122 minutes of video 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.310
 but well the part 2 will be then 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.940
 probably a few hours later 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.150
 come 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.470
 Well then until then next few next 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.989
 I show you how said the server 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.989
 makes it popular on the internet and until then
