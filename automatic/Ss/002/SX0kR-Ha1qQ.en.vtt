that how cool is that and the likeness
is<00:00:30.570> pretty<00:00:30.810> good<00:00:31.050> um<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.859> an<00:00:31.980> older<00:00:32.340> version

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
is pretty good um it's an older version

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.069 
is pretty good um it's an older version
of<00:00:32.880> Van<00:00:33.090> Damme<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.870> younger

of Van Damme it's not like a younger
version<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.770> would've<00:00:34.920> been<00:00:34.980> cool<00:00:35.160> if

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
version I think it would've been cool if

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.770 
version I think it would've been cool if
we<00:00:35.340> got<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.640> like<00:00:35.760> maybe<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.210> blood<00:00:36.480> sport

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
we got in like maybe like a blood sport

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.959 
we got in like maybe like a blood sport
version<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.200> even<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> guille<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.340> um<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.760> mean

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
version or even a guille but um I mean

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.250 
version or even a guille but um I mean
this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> accessories<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> bass

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
this is the accessories you get the bass

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.200 
this is the accessories you get the bass
interchangeable<00:00:41.160> hands<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.670> glasses<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
interchangeable hands the glasses and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.850 
interchangeable hands the glasses and
and<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.570> believe<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> leather<00:00:43.079> jacket<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.620> well
