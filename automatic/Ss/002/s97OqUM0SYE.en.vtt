00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and then if you're gonna do in survival

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.419 
and then if you're gonna do in survival
mode<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.650> might<00:00:28.800> want<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.189> fire

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
mode then you might want to have a fire

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.950 
mode then you might want to have a fire
resistance<00:00:29.880> potion<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> whole<00:00:30.750> bunch

because it might take you know like
10-15<00:00:32.940> minutes<00:00:33.180> actually<00:00:33.270> make<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
10-15 minutes actually make this and

10-15 minutes actually make this and
personally<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> blocks<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
favorite obviously if you're doing it in

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.799 
favorite obviously if you're doing it in
survival<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.670> need<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> pickaxe<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.390> some<00:00:51.600> kind

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
survival you need a pickaxe of some kind

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
survival you need a pickaxe of some kind
maybe<00:00:52.140> even<00:00:52.289> soar<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> fight<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:52.949> blaze<00:00:53.250> its<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
maybe even soar to fight out blaze its I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.189 
maybe even soar to fight out blaze its I
don't<00:00:53.940> recommend<00:00:54.300> doing<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.570> survival<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
don't recommend doing in survival but it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.869 
don't recommend doing in survival but it
is<00:00:55.289> doable<00:00:55.559> I've<00:00:55.860> done<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> before<00:00:56.219> obviously

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
is doable I've done it before obviously

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.610 
is doable I've done it before obviously
you<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.600> start<00:00:57.809> off<00:00:57.899> by<00:00:58.079> breaking<00:00:58.379> down

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you have to start off by breaking down

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.060 
you have to start off by breaking down
pretty<00:00:59.190> much<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> entire<00:00:59.820> blaze<00:01:00.180> area<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.070> of

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
pretty much the entire blaze area and of

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.410 
pretty much the entire blaze area and of
course<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> make<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.670> bigger<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.180> smaller

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
course you make this bigger or smaller

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.240 
course you make this bigger or smaller
depending<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> speed<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> blaze

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
depending on the speed of the blaze

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.850 
depending on the speed of the blaze
spawning<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.299> place<00:01:06.990> spawner<00:01:07.320> for

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
spawning from your place spawner for

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
spawning from your place spawner for
some<00:01:08.010> reason<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.549> blaze<00:01:08.729> spawners<00:01:09.110> spawn

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
some reason some blaze spawners spawn

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.600 
some reason some blaze spawners spawn
faster<00:01:10.619> than<00:01:10.770> others<00:01:10.950> I'm<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.189> sure<00:01:11.520> if

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
faster than others I'm not sure if

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
faster than others I'm not sure if
there's<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> light<00:01:12.270> dependence<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.110> don't

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
there's like a light dependence I don't

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.810 
there's like a light dependence I don't
think<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.790> be

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
think there is like I think it can be

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
think there is like I think it can be
dark<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.240> light<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.689> spawn<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.650> just

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
dark or light and they spawn really just

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.350 
dark or light and they spawn really just
if<00:01:16.950> you're<00:01:17.100> near<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.670> far<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.090> tell

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
if you're near it as far as I can tell

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.420 
if you're near it as far as I can tell
but<00:01:18.600> I've<00:01:19.530> found<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
but I've found that this is one of the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.210 
but I've found that this is one of the
most<00:01:20.580> effective<00:01:21.030> ways<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.630> two<00:01:21.869> rows

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
most effective ways is to have two rows

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
most effective ways is to have two rows
empty<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:23.939> cut<00:01:24.299> out<00:01:24.450> on

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
empty like I have up there cut out on

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.240 
empty like I have up there cut out on
the<00:01:25.049> top<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.439> each<00:01:25.470> side

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the top on each side

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.039 
the top on each side
I<00:01:26.280> think<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> lengths<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> them<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> have

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
I think the lengths of them that I have

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.679 
I think the lengths of them that I have
is<00:01:28.439> seven<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> spawner<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.270> one

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
is seven so it's like the spawner is one

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:56.399 
is seven so it's like the spawner is one
and<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> got<00:01:31.140> three<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.500> each<00:01:31.590> side

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.830 

and<00:01:57.409> once<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:58.040> all<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.310> four<00:01:58.549> areas<00:01:59.509> cut

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
and once you have all the four areas cut

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.929 
and once you have all the four areas cut
out<00:02:00.020> then<00:02:00.590> you'll<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.040> want<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.340> make<00:02:01.579> a<00:02:01.610> path

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
out then you'll you want to make a path

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.789 
out then you'll you want to make a path
around<00:02:02.180> all<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.930> areas<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.500> can<00:02:03.649> walk

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
around all the areas so you can walk

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.260 
around all the areas so you can walk
around<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.189> collect<00:02:04.369> any<00:02:04.490> XP<00:02:04.820> that<00:02:04.970> happen<00:02:05.180> to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
around and collect any XP that happen to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.639 
around and collect any XP that happen to
drop<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.899> then<00:02:06.049> you'll<00:02:06.200> want<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.409> close

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
drop and then you'll want to close

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.529 
drop and then you'll want to close
yourself<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.670> just<00:02:07.939> in<00:02:08.090> case<00:02:08.119> you

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
yourself in so that just in case you

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.240 
yourself in so that just in case you
know<00:02:08.660> gas<00:02:08.989> or<00:02:09.259> something<00:02:09.560> or<00:02:09.649> outside<00:02:10.009> and

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
know gas or something or outside and

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.699 
know gas or something or outside and
they<00:02:10.340> shoot<00:02:10.550> at<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:10.819> or<00:02:11.060> if<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:12.140> know<00:02:12.290> zombie

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
they shoot at you or if you know zombie

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.530 
they shoot at you or if you know zombie
pigman<00:02:12.980> want<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.220> walk<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.580> or<00:02:13.700> something<00:02:13.910> not

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
pigman want to walk in or something not

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:30.440 
pigman want to walk in or something not
to<00:02:14.660> worry<00:02:14.780> about<00:02:14.870> it

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.320 

as<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:31.980> see<00:02:32.160> right<00:02:32.280> here<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.180> whole

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
as you can see right here that the whole

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.270 
as you can see right here that the whole
method<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.959> once<00:02:34.140> they<00:02:34.620> spawn<00:02:34.920> up<00:02:35.069> top

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
method is that once they spawn up top

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.320 
method is that once they spawn up top
and<00:02:35.550> they<00:02:35.610> fall<00:02:35.849> in<00:02:35.970> those<00:02:36.090> little<00:02:36.209> holes

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
and they fall in those little holes

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.580 
and they fall in those little holes
eventually<00:02:36.900> because<00:02:37.050> they're<00:02:37.170> coming<00:02:37.319> after

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
eventually because they're coming after

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.080 
eventually because they're coming after
you<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.069> what<00:02:38.370> they<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.730> know<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.970> they're

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
you is what they you know that they're

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.729 
you is what they you know that they're
like<00:02:39.239> any<00:02:39.390> other<00:02:39.540> mob<00:02:39.750> they<00:02:39.959> walk<00:02:40.200> toward<00:02:40.500> you

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
like any other mob they walk toward you

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.830 
like any other mob they walk toward you
and<00:02:41.250> they<00:02:41.370> follow<00:02:41.670> those<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:42.000> holes<00:02:42.150> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
and they follow those little holes and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.750 
and they follow those little holes and
they<00:02:42.959> can't<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.319> out<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.310> every<00:02:44.550> now<00:02:44.670> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
they can't get out and but every now and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.130 
they can't get out and but every now and
again<00:02:44.790> they<00:02:44.970> glitch<00:02:45.239> hour<00:02:45.450> or<00:02:45.660> something<00:02:45.900> if

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
again they glitch hour or something if

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.449 
again they glitch hour or something if
there<00:02:46.290> was<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.410> full<00:02:46.739> one<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.160> if<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.250> put<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
there was a full one so if you put a

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.370 
there was a full one so if you put a
half<00:02:47.670> slab<00:02:48.000> stare<00:02:48.390> there<00:02:48.599> there's<00:02:49.140> only<00:02:49.170> half

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
half slab stare there there's only half

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.800 
half slab stare there there's only half
a<00:02:49.590> half<00:02:50.069> of<00:02:50.250> an<00:02:50.400> area<00:02:50.670> where<00:02:50.849> they<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.180> fall

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
a half of an area where they can fall

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.600 
a half of an area where they can fall
out<00:02:52.019> or<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.470> they<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.709> hit<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:52.980> from<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.519> you

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
out or that they can hit you from so you

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.250 
out or that they can hit you from so you
just<00:02:53.760> hit<00:02:53.910> them<00:02:54.000> from<00:02:54.150> underneath<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:55.230> know

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
just hit them from underneath you know

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.750 
just hit them from underneath you know
and<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.709> hit<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.830> little<00:02:55.950> half<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.549> an<00:02:56.700> area

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.039 

then<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.849> want<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.060> close<00:03:03.269> in<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.480> top<00:03:03.750> part

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
then you want to close in the top part

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.930 
then you want to close in the top part
so<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.560> when<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.950> blaze<00:03:05.160> spawn<00:03:05.610> they're

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
so that when the blaze spawn they're

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.210 
so that when the blaze spawn they're
forced<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:07.080> drop<00:03:07.319> in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> holes<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.130> if

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
forced to just drop in the holes and if

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.470 
forced to just drop in the holes and if
they<00:03:08.310> don't<00:03:08.430> drop<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.819> holes<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.150> stay

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
they don't drop in the holes of the stay

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.850 
they don't drop in the holes of the stay
up<00:03:09.540> top<00:03:09.780> until<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.170> eventually<00:03:10.470> they<00:03:10.530> do<00:03:10.590> drop

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
up top until the eventually they do drop

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.890 
up top until the eventually they do drop
in<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.099> holes<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> couple<00:03:12.450> while<00:03:12.720> they're

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
in the holes with a couple while they're

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.640 
in the holes with a couple while they're
coming<00:03:13.019> at<00:03:13.290> you

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
coming at you

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.140 
coming at you
you<00:03:14.280> want<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.489> make<00:03:14.579> sure<00:03:14.670> though<00:03:14.790> it's<00:03:14.940> closed

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
you want to make sure though it's closed

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.970 
you want to make sure though it's closed
off<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:15.540> they<00:03:15.660> can't<00:03:15.870> get<00:03:15.989> away<00:03:16.079> they<00:03:16.769> can't

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
off so they can't get away they can't

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.470 
off so they can't get away they can't
escape<00:03:17.190> because<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.760> mean<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.450> know

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
escape because I mean it's you know

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.539 
escape because I mean it's you know
they'd<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.079> just<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.319> waste<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.620> blaze<00:03:19.799> I'm

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
they'd be just a waste of blaze I'm

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.220 
they'd be just a waste of blaze I'm
pretty<00:03:20.819> sure<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.090> blaze<00:03:21.120> are<00:03:21.480> only<00:03:21.599> about<00:03:21.780> two

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
pretty sure the blaze are only about two

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.440 
pretty sure the blaze are only about two
blocks<00:03:22.560> tall<00:03:23.099> so<00:03:23.790> if<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:23.940> make<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.209> two<00:03:24.420> or

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
blocks tall so if you make it two or

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.780 
blocks tall so if you make it two or
three<00:03:24.630> high<00:03:25.110> then<00:03:25.860> it's<00:03:26.010> about<00:03:26.130> perfect<00:03:26.640> for

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
three high then it's about perfect for

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.949 
three high then it's about perfect for
them<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:26.970> jump<00:03:27.180> around<00:03:27.299> have<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.569> little<00:03:27.780> bit<00:03:27.870> of

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
them to jump around have a little bit of

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.930 
them to jump around have a little bit of
freedom<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.680> they<00:03:28.709> don't<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.099> know<00:03:29.130> sometimes

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
freedom so they don't you know sometimes

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.330 
freedom so they don't you know sometimes
if<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.480> mob<00:03:30.870> spawner<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.349> too<00:03:31.680> enclosed<00:03:32.069> in

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
if the mob spawner is too enclosed in

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.920 
if the mob spawner is too enclosed in
and<00:03:32.549> they<00:03:32.610> have<00:03:32.700> nowhere<00:03:32.849> to<00:03:33.000> spawn<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.660> you

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
and they have nowhere to spawn so you

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.789 
and they have nowhere to spawn so you
know<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.079> want<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.349> make<00:03:34.440> sure<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:34.680> like

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
know you want to make sure it's like

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.680 
know you want to make sure it's like
three<00:03:35.040> or<00:03:35.130> four<00:03:35.160> tall<00:03:35.639> just<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.030> be<00:03:36.120> safe<00:03:36.299> and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
three or four tall just to be safe and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.050 
three or four tall just to be safe and
then<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.769> just<00:03:37.799> for<00:03:38.190> aesthetic<00:03:38.670> value

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
then this is just for aesthetic value

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.270 
then this is just for aesthetic value
obviously<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.870> don't<00:03:39.989> have<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.260> do<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.530> okay

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
obviously you don't have to do that okay

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.920 
obviously you don't have to do that okay
so<00:03:41.459> here's<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.910> finished<00:03:42.209> product<00:03:42.420> obviously

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
so here's the finished product obviously

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.750 
so here's the finished product obviously
I<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.200> wish<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.530> peaceful<00:03:44.069> or<00:03:44.310> nicer<00:03:44.700> is

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
I just wish it to peaceful or nicer is

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.030 
I just wish it to peaceful or nicer is
it<00:03:44.880> from<00:03:45.090> peaceful<00:03:45.299> to<00:03:45.540> easy<00:03:46.319> I<00:03:46.500> think<00:03:46.620> and

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it from peaceful to easy I think and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.710 
it from peaceful to easy I think and
there<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:47.940> can<00:03:48.060> see<00:03:48.180> spawning<00:03:48.510> in

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
there you go you can see spawning in

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.210 
there you go you can see spawning in
there<00:03:48.840> they<00:03:49.200> just<00:03:49.440> drop<00:03:49.650> down<00:03:49.829> in<00:03:50.010> there<00:03:50.130> and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
there they just drop down in there and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.309 
there they just drop down in there and
obviously<00:03:50.760> by<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.910> sword<00:03:51.359> then<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:51.989> just<00:03:52.200> be

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
obviously by the sword then you just be

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.690 
obviously by the sword then you just be
mowing<00:03:52.709> them<00:03:52.799> down<00:03:52.829> I<00:03:53.010> think<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.400> takes<00:03:53.549> like

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
mowing them down I think it takes like

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.940 
mowing them down I think it takes like
two<00:03:53.850> or<00:03:53.940> three<00:03:53.970> hits<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.359> diamond<00:03:54.660> sword

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
two or three hits of the diamond sword

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.620 
two or three hits of the diamond sword
