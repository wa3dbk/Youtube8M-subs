technology<00:00:02.070> has<00:00:02.250> brought<00:00:02.399> us<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> point<00:00:03.030> to

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
technology has brought us to a point to

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.570 
technology has brought us to a point to
where<00:00:03.210> ring<00:00:03.929> design<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.680> not<00:00:04.950> only<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.339> little

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
where ring design is not only a little

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.210 
where ring design is not only a little
bit<00:00:05.759> easier<00:00:06.359> but<00:00:07.049> it<00:00:07.170> can<00:00:07.379> actually<00:00:07.589> be<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.890> lot

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
bit easier but it can actually be a lot

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.040 
bit easier but it can actually be a lot
easier<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.970> customer<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.540> go<00:00:09.719> ahead<00:00:09.929> and

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
easier for the customer to go ahead and

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.320 
easier for the customer to go ahead and
get<00:00:10.139> exactly<00:00:10.740> what<00:00:10.830> they<00:00:10.980> want<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:12.090> what<00:00:12.240> I'm

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
we're going to actually set that and

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.359 
we're going to actually set that and
that's<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.090> have<00:00:24.269> right<00:00:24.570> here<00:00:25.369> after

that what we want to do is we want to
put<00:00:28.170> some<00:00:28.470> rails<00:00:28.859> up<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.730> know<00:00:30.000> what

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
put some rails up so that we know what

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.269 
put some rails up so that we know what
it's<00:00:30.269> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.599> actually<00:00:30.869> follow<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.009> how<00:00:32.219> we

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it's going to actually follow and how we

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.360 
it's going to actually follow and how we
do<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.360> actually<00:00:33.950> put<00:00:34.950> these

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
do this is we just actually put these

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
do this is we just actually put these
little<00:00:35.969> profiles<00:00:36.600> here<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.290> does<00:00:37.410> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
little profiles here and what it does is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.680 
little profiles here and what it does is
it<00:00:37.710> tells<00:00:38.219> us<00:00:38.430> where<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.149> ring<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
it tells us where the ring is going to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.610 
it tells us where the ring is going to
lie<00:00:39.870> within<00:00:41.030> then<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.660> want<00:00:42.870> an<00:00:42.960> outside<00:00:43.379> curve

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
lie within then we want an outside curve

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.170 
lie within then we want an outside curve
I'm<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> give<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> little<00:00:44.879> European

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
I'm going to give it a little European

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
I'm going to give it a little European
shank<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> square<00:00:46.140> bottom<00:00:46.469> shank<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
shank that's the square bottom shank and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.029 
shank that's the square bottom shank and
now<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> follow<00:00:48.530> that<00:00:49.530> area<00:00:50.010> right

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
now it's going to follow that area right

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.350 
now it's going to follow that area right
in<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.539> let's<00:00:51.719> run<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> simple<00:00:52.289> sweep<00:00:53.360> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
in there so let's run a simple sweep and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.750 
in there so let's run a simple sweep and
pick<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.570> rail<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.530> outside<00:00:55.890> rail<00:00:56.100> I'm

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
pick that rail and the outside rail I'm

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.319 
pick that rail and the outside rail I'm
going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> pick<00:00:57.120> these<00:00:57.410> three<00:00:58.410> profiles<00:00:59.329> just

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
going to pick these three profiles just

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.720 
going to pick these three profiles just
so<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> runs<00:01:00.719> smoothly<00:01:01.140> well<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.340> didn't<00:01:02.579> want

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
so it runs smoothly well we didn't want

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
so it runs smoothly well we didn't want
it<00:01:02.820> closed<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.270> let's<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.719> again<00:01:03.899> pick

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
it closed so let's do that again pick

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.410 
it closed so let's do that again pick
those<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:07.520> keep<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.670> open<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:11.420> pick

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
those to keep it open and then pick

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.350 
those to keep it open and then pick
those<00:01:12.630> three<00:01:13.369> there's<00:01:14.369> what<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.330> we

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
those three there's what we have and we

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
those three there's what we have and we
can<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.960> adjust<00:01:16.049> those<00:01:16.470> very<00:01:16.740> simply<00:01:16.979> by

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
can actually adjust those very simply by

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.240 
can actually adjust those very simply by
just<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:18.360> ahead<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.020> pull<00:01:19.530> these<00:01:19.770> handlebars

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
just go ahead and pull these handlebars

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.789 
just go ahead and pull these handlebars
out<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.700> little<00:01:21.030> bit<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.470> wider

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
out a little bit more we can go wider

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.270 
out a little bit more we can go wider
watch<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> carefully<00:01:24.170> or<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.530> go<00:01:25.680> back<00:01:25.890> or

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
watch it carefully or we can go back or

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
watch it carefully or we can go back or
we<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.640> any<00:01:26.880> width<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.390> want<00:01:27.630> height<00:01:27.930> we

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.050 
doesn't matter we can lift and lower the
height<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.590> crown<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> little<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.759> we

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
height of that crown a little bit and we

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.789 
height of that crown a little bit and we
can<00:01:54.090> change<00:01:54.509> there<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> rail<00:01:55.350> size

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
can change there like the rail size

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.160 
can change there like the rail size
which<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.369> kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.729> fun<00:01:57.600> because<00:01:57.630> those<00:01:58.020> are<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
which is kind of fun because those are a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.569 
which is kind of fun because those are a
little<00:01:58.290> bit<00:01:58.469> thick<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:58.890> let's<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.219> pick<00:01:59.369> that

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
little bit thick so let's just pick that

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.530 
little bit thick so let's just pick that
rail<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.719> let's<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.680> move<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
rail and let's just move that

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.950 
rail and let's just move that
a<00:02:02.600> little<00:02:03.560> bit<00:02:03.680> thinner<00:02:04.540> how<00:02:05.540> about<00:02:05.750> right

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
a little bit thinner how about right

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.740 
a little bit thinner how about right
there<00:02:06.460> there<00:02:07.460> we<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:07.880> we<00:02:08.119> have<00:02:08.270> our<00:02:08.420> crown

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
there there we have it we have our crown

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.070 
there there we have it we have our crown
that<00:02:09.050> we<00:02:09.170> want<00:02:09.880> then<00:02:10.880> what<00:02:11.270> we<00:02:11.360> do<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:11.570> we<00:02:11.930> go

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
that we want then what we do is we go

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.380 
that we want then what we do is we go
ahead<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.500> cut<00:02:12.710> this<00:02:12.740> inner<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.240> it's

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
ahead and cut this inner so that it's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.900 
ahead and cut this inner so that it's
all<00:02:14.540> rounded<00:02:14.960> like<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.520> there<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.700> have<00:02:16.880> it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
all rounded like that there you have it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.910 
all rounded like that there you have it
we<00:02:17.150> have<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.330> finished<00:02:17.690> ring<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.440> can<00:02:18.740> be

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
we have a finished ring that can be

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.590 
we have a finished ring that can be
changed<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.550> it's<00:02:19.790> fairly<00:02:20.030> simple<00:02:20.270> and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
changed and it's fairly simple and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.630 
changed and it's fairly simple and
fairly<00:02:20.810> quick<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.680> as<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.160> can<00:02:22.280> see<00:02:22.430> there's

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
fairly quick so as you can see there's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.110 
fairly quick so as you can see there's
absolutely<00:02:23.060> no<00:02:23.390> reason<00:02:23.630> anybody<00:02:24.640> should<00:02:25.640> just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
absolutely no reason anybody should just

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.730 
absolutely no reason anybody should just
settle<00:02:26.600> for<00:02:26.720> what's<00:02:26.990> on<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.140> store<00:02:27.440> shelves

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
settle for what's on the store shelves

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.950 
settle for what's on the store shelves
you<00:02:27.980> can<00:02:28.160> actually<00:02:28.610> have<00:02:28.880> your<00:02:29.150> ring<00:02:29.390> custom

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
you can actually have your ring custom

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.020 
you can actually have your ring custom
made<00:02:30.200> not<00:02:30.980> only<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.250> before<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.880> ever

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
made not only that before you ever

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.900 
made not only that before you ever
really<00:02:32.450> even<00:02:32.480> start<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.220> actually<00:02:34.490> do<00:02:34.880> a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
really even start you can actually do a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.540 
really even start you can actually do a
rendering<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.810> this<00:02:36.080> ring<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.280> neat

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
rendering of this ring and the neat

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.190 
rendering of this ring and the neat
thing<00:02:37.790> about<00:02:37.820> it<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.330> let's<00:02:38.570> just<00:02:38.750> say<00:02:38.870> we<00:02:39.020> want

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
thing about it is let's just say we want

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.680 
thing about it is let's just say we want
to<00:02:39.260> go<00:02:39.350> all<00:02:39.560> platinum<00:02:39.920> on<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.430> ring<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:41.450> take

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
to go all platinum on this ring we take

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.330 
to go all platinum on this ring we take
that<00:02:42.170> ground<00:02:42.560> plane<00:02:42.830> we're<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.160> going<00:02:43.280> to

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
that ground plane we're just going to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.750 
that ground plane we're just going to
give<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.610> white<00:02:43.880> background<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.760> just

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
give it a white background so just

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.520 
give it a white background so just
simple<00:02:47.240> little<00:02:47.540> color<00:02:47.870> for<00:02:48.170> rendering

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
simple little color for rendering

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.220 
simple little color for rendering
purposes<00:02:49.070> now<00:02:49.280> only<00:02:49.630> I'm<00:02:50.630> going<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.870> take<00:02:51.020> that

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
purposes now only I'm going to take that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.820 
purposes now only I'm going to take that
we're<00:02:51.560> going<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.709> grab<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.190> stone<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:53.830> we're

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
we're going to grab the stone and we're

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.380 
we're going to grab the stone and we're
going<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.040> make<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.459> oh<00:02:55.760> let's<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.239> make<00:02:56.330> it

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
going to make that oh let's just make it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.870 
going to make that oh let's just make it
a<00:02:56.540> diamond<00:02:56.959> since<00:02:57.350> we're<00:02:57.500> going<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.880> talk

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
a diamond since we're going to talk

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.260 
a diamond since we're going to talk
diamonds<00:02:59.360> meanings<00:03:00.340> put<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.520> on<00:03:01.760> there<00:03:02.030> and

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
diamonds meanings put that on there and

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.430 
diamonds meanings put that on there and
then<00:03:02.360> we're<00:03:02.480> going<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.630> take<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.900> metals<00:03:03.290> that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
then we're going to take the metals that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.430 
then we're going to take the metals that
we<00:03:03.590> have<00:03:03.709> chosen<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:05.150> head<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.170> body

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
we have chosen the head and the body

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.810 
we have chosen the head and the body
we're<00:03:07.400> going<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.580> make<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:07.970> all<00:03:08.209> platinum

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
we're going to make that all platinum

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.030 
we're going to make that all platinum
pick<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.239> choose<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.660> color<00:03:11.930> give<00:03:12.920> it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
pick that and choose that color give it

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.410 
pick that and choose that color give it
some<00:03:13.220> lighting<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:16.060> then<00:03:17.060> we're<00:03:17.180> going<00:03:17.330> to

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
some lighting and then we're going to

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.840 
some lighting and then we're going to
render<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:18.310> rendering<00:03:19.310> takes<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.670> few

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
render this rendering takes a few

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.090 
render this rendering takes a few
seconds<00:03:20.360> but<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.320> neat<00:03:21.530> thing<00:03:21.769> about<00:03:21.799> this

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
seconds but the neat thing about this

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.289 
seconds but the neat thing about this
whole<00:03:22.340> thing<00:03:22.549> is<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.540> can<00:03:23.750> actually<00:03:24.070> get

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
whole thing is you can actually get

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.520 
whole thing is you can actually get
exactly<00:03:26.299> what<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.660> want<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:27.019> can<00:03:27.200> make<00:03:27.380> those

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
exactly what you want you can make those

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.440 
exactly what you want you can make those
little<00:03:27.799> changes<00:03:27.980> it's<00:03:28.370> very<00:03:28.670> simple<00:03:29.030> now<00:03:29.299> with

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
little changes it's very simple now with

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.289 
little changes it's very simple now with
the<00:03:29.570> technology<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.739> biggest<00:03:31.310> advantage

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
the technology and the biggest advantage

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.630 
the technology and the biggest advantage
of<00:03:32.450> this<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:33.049> lot<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.709> places<00:03:33.890> will<00:03:34.280> sell

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
of this is a lot of places will sell

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.330 
of this is a lot of places will sell
their<00:03:34.670> rings<00:03:35.390> pre-mounted<00:03:36.019> which<00:03:36.500> means<00:03:36.799> hey

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
their rings pre-mounted which means hey

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.699 
their rings pre-mounted which means hey
