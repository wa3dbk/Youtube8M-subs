00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.139
 after I have presented the pages to you now more for soldering 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.139
 need 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.799
 I would like to start now Third Act and show how to do such a 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.289
 Toggle switch so soldered with a cable 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.470
 the later II 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.340
 LG 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.699
 in the top is lit. 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.119
 that he needs Lothar Späth a4 we want to switch on and go out 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.520
 Of course we need such a Dirk Schäfer 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.960
 Iraq now has one ahead of the elite in the top 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.150
 and 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.090
 a power adapter Kappel 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.560
 for example, from 14 to three stages if we now travel a bottle 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.250
 would like 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.320
 Of course, this is also possible and once fourth or twice four tones where was 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.450
 land later 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.520
 for example, delicacy floor or other devices can switch 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.330
 the whole thing works and thus the failure 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.139
 that we are on the bottom 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:04.150
 have three teams 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.600
 We have one on the right 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 the slightly darker Pinter mass 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.230
 in spoken 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.230
 in the middle that comes to appreciate the way goods were 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.070
 and completely on the left 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.260
 then the power will come later 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.680
 so that our lady shined later 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.100
 Knigge said Steegmans took the first step there 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.480
 to cut the cable dapd 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.560
 You can easily use a pair of pliers 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.180
 and Parma 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.690
 Put Schmidt 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.670
 if you are not listening to someone 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.650
 You can also find such in the hardware store 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.920
 third hands and the first step is now in it 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.280
 for the first time 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 to connect the master connector to the switch 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.780
 Let's continue now 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.310
 made a career again of that 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.360
 Power plug and but of the three the plug 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 they are superimposed 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.159
 in tears, he is a little bit in front of him 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.039
 but then that 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.179
 it will 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.259
 ever experienced 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.849
 one side of the 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.569
 third hand trapped 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.329
 and on the other side 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.559
 now comes the 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:21.739
 they failed 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.409
 as I said at the stake at the far right 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.519
 Steyr is responsible for darker plans of mass 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.749
 So you have to go there 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.749
 Finally, the black cable to be soldered on 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.799
 it goes but then also the whole optically a bit 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.579
 also want to be 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.429
 we still have here 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.839
 black stocking hose then I have already in full one 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.119
 cut even pieces 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:50.829
 and this one 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.899
 a passenger was the Karwendel 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.809
 pushed 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.349
 and only then 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.489
 can you get the cable 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.659
 with the 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.659
 Soldering switch here is important now 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.849
 to paint 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.339
 The power cable was now received through such a small opening here 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:16.329
 shoves 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.979
 so that you later the cable too 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.939
 can ban it properly 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.029
 Florian Mair is already rudely preparing a failure in the third 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:27.229
 hand 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.640
 and that would actually be relatively easy 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.430
 For this one needs contracts just to name preparatory Poland 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.879
 a little nonsense 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.639
 and you just keep the nonsense Brawn GP 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.949
 Price of the tip you see this liquefied 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.469
 and that they barely possible this year 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.779
 and the failure to run 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.619
 and now form more solid connection between cable and 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:00.369
 fail 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.369
 when the whole is done then 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:07.309
 you can take the orf-center in Vienna and 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.399
 and as you can see 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.399
 Peters now definitely in front of it 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.519
 so of course still missing now 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.069
 I have 2k 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.769
 the ones connected with her have to have it all working well Martha 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.840
 Now it's our turn 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.870
 and next followed now 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.599
 the middle bond of the 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.599
 to appreciate this because turned 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.139
 the last step is of course now 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.220
 still what places fork done with the last five 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.449
 around the storm hose now 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.080
 and also called 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.930
 Susan to shrink 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.930
 it's just a legal lighter needed 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:55.289
 This one will then just here 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.509
 to the hose 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.509
 and you look like this 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.889
 contracts 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.180
 with it a firm 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.150
 instead of the air and also 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.319
 optical bit better 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.719
 the insulation gives off
