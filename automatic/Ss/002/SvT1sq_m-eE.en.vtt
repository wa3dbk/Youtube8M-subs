to you and the total nut jobs yeah the
problem<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> crackpot<00:01:33.420> ideas<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.579> often

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
problem with the crackpot ideas is often

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
problem with the crackpot ideas is often
it's<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.030> difficult<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.320> very

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it's so difficult it's it's it's very

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.399 
it's so difficult it's it's it's very
close<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.070> Bigfoot<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.820> crop<00:01:39.060> circles<00:01:39.450> it's

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
close to Bigfoot in crop circles it's

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.630 
close to Bigfoot in crop circles it's
very<00:01:40.619> close<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.430> end<00:01:41.549> up

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
very close to you're going to end up

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.550 
very close to you're going to end up
trying<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.180> prove<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.509> negative<00:01:42.540> which<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> just

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
trying to prove a negative which is just

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.609 
trying to prove a negative which is just
bad<00:01:43.860> territory<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.850> scientifically

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
bad territory to be in scientifically

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.319 
bad territory to be in scientifically
the<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.369> learn<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.759> when<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.030> started

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the and we learn this when we started

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.749 
the and we learn this when we started
doing<00:01:48.540> free<00:01:48.810> energy<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.950> put<00:01:50.100> our<00:01:50.250> researchers

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
doing free energy we put our researchers

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.649 
doing free energy we put our researchers
on<00:01:51.170> over<00:01:52.170> unity<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.360> came<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
on over unity and came up with a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.990 
on over unity and came up with a
research<00:01:55.439> file<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.159> two<00:01:56.670> feet

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
research file that was like two feet

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.020 
research file that was like two feet
thick<00:01:57.479> inside<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.380> inside<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.009> about<00:01:59.219> three

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
thick inside of a inside of about three

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.359 
thick inside of a inside of about three
weeks<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:01.500> had<00:02:01.590> no<00:02:01.770> idea<00:02:02.070> where<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> even

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
weeks and we had no idea where to even

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.069 
weeks and we had no idea where to even
begin<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> producer<00:02:03.509> came<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
begin and a producer came up with a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.130 
begin and a producer came up with a
great<00:02:04.170> idea<00:02:04.290> look<00:02:05.159> what<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.969> all<00:02:06.869> we

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
great idea look what we can do is all we

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.900 
great idea look what we can do is all we
can<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.439> start<00:02:07.829> with<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.340> people<00:02:08.459> claim

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
can do is start with what people claim

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.240 
can do is start with what people claim
is<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.599> work<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.440> bought<00:02:10.619> kits<00:02:10.979> we

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
is going to work and we bought kits we

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.680 
is going to work and we bought kits we
bought<00:02:11.400> kits<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.819> people<00:02:12.090> said<00:02:12.300> we're<00:02:12.480> going

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
bought kits that people said we're going

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.430 
bought kits that people said we're going
to<00:02:12.780> work<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.050> then

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
to work and then

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.930 
to work and then
we<00:02:13.530> built<00:02:13.740> those<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.250> while<00:02:14.730> I'm<00:02:14.910> not

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
we built those and while I'm not

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.840 
we built those and while I'm not
extremely<00:02:15.860> satisfied<00:02:16.860> what<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.250> did<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.520> free

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
extremely satisfied what we did on free

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.090 
extremely satisfied what we did on free
energy<00:02:18.180> that's<00:02:18.990> about<00:02:19.290> as<00:02:19.440> close<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.950> can

energy that's about as close as you can
get<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.490> kind<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.940> stuff<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.450> try<00:02:21.780> and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
get to that kind of stuff to try and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.810 
get to that kind of stuff to try and
show<00:02:22.410> somebody's<00:02:23.100> guaranteeing<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.790> a

positive you can show that it doesn't

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.200 
positive you can show that it doesn't
work<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.040> you've<00:02:26.370> done<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.670> best<00:02:26.910> faith

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210

Industrial Light &amp; Magic that moved from
models<00:02:55.830> into<00:02:56.070> building<00:02:56.670> virtual<00:02:56.970> models<00:02:57.540> that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
models into building virtual models that

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.110 
models into building virtual models that
the<00:02:58.470> quality<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.130> model<00:02:59.670> making<00:02:59.880> that's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
the quality of model making that's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.730 
the quality of model making that's
coming<00:03:00.480> out<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.810> virtual<00:03:00.960> world<00:03:01.230> is

coming out in the virtual world is

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.280 
coming out in the virtual world is
increasing<00:03:02.610> rapidly<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:03.480> people<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:03.990> past

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
increasing rapidly as people get past

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.900 
increasing rapidly as people get past

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
the learning curve and I mean of course

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.760 
the learning curve and I mean of course
we<00:03:06.180> all<00:03:06.300> know<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.660> rubber<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.110> where

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
we all know that the rubber the where

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.990 
we all know that the rubber the where
the<00:03:07.920> rubber<00:03:08.070> is<00:03:08.190> going<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.490> meet<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> road<00:03:08.880> in

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
the rubber is going to meet the road in

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.330 
the rubber is going to meet the road in
the<00:03:09.060> next<00:03:09.090> 10<00:03:09.360> years<00:03:09.390> both<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:09.960> CG<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.040> in

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the next 10 years both in CG and in

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.100 
the next 10 years both in CG and in
rapid<00:03:11.700> prototyping<00:03:12.210> is<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.690> interface<00:03:12.900> is

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
rapid prototyping is in the interface is

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.290 
rapid prototyping is in the interface is
in<00:03:13.500> people's<00:03:13.920> ability<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.520> really<00:03:14.760> feel<00:03:15.120> like

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
in people's ability to really feel like

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.060 
in people's ability to really feel like
they're<00:03:15.450> interfacing<00:03:16.080> with<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.500> virtual

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
they're interfacing with the virtual

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.949 
they're interfacing with the virtual
object<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.670> when<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.239> gets<00:03:18.390> solved<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.780> think

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
object and when that gets solved I think

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.130 
object and when that gets solved I think
it's<00:03:19.050> actually<00:03:19.170> going<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.500> get<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> lot<00:03:19.800> better

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
it's actually going to get a lot better

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.770 
it's actually going to get a lot better
hi<00:03:22.140> first<00:03:22.830> about<00:03:23.040> your<00:03:23.640> bronze<00:03:23.970> Falcon<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.690> know

hi first about your bronze Falcon I know
it's<00:03:25.110> pretty<00:03:25.350> horrible<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:26.040> I'd<00:03:26.160> be<00:03:26.310> willing

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
it's pretty horrible but I'd be willing

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.100 
it's pretty horrible but I'd be willing
to<00:03:26.700> take<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.090> away<00:03:27.180> from<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:27.570> soon<00:03:27.780> look<00:03:28.260> at<00:03:28.410> it

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
to take it away from you soon look at it
